1,This is a great series. We just decided to check it out and glad we did. It has a good story line and it entertaining. Working on the second season right now.
1,"Most especially during war time. However, the situation at home is aggravated. This BBC series, written by A. Horowitz, is a compelling fictional account of Detective Chief Inspector Foyle's investigations of domestic (his region) crimes during WWII. Highly recommended for you PBS crime/mystery/war drama fans."
1,"Don't know why this show didn't last longer than it did, although....I am a Jeff Goldblum fan and I've found that most people are not. Liked the subtle humor, witty sarcasm, and character interaction.  The premise was unique and opened the show to a lot more episodes than it enjoyed. Too bad."
1,"David Suchet is the classic Poirot. Amazon instant video for Prime subscribers is the easiest delivery system. Amazon has difficulty streaming at times, but the inconvenience is minimal."
1,"Yes folks, Star Trek is back and back in a big way.  Be warned that spoilers are ahead, but considering the plot of J.J. Abrams' reboot of Gene Roddenberry's legendary franchise has been pretty much out in the open, I'm probably not saying anything that you don't already know anyway.  It all begins with the vengeful Romulan Nero (Eric Bana) coming back in time to wreak havoc on the Federation, so much so that it impacts the history and continuity that die hard Trekkies will no doubt find bones to pick with.  From that point forward, we are introduced to the young and reckless James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) who is convinced by Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to enlist in Starfleet.  It isn't long before Kirk is at odds with Spock (Heroes' Zachary Quinto); who himself is an outcast among his own Vulcan people, and shares a rocky relationship with his Vulcan father Sarek (Ben Cross) and human mother Amanda (Winona Ryder).  The dynamic and groundwork laid of Kirk and Spock's relationship is what helps make Abrams' take on Star Trek so good, as he modernizes nearly everything that Trek fans hold dear (seeing young Kirk driving to the Beastie Boys' ""Sabotage"" may be overdoing it a bit, but hey...), yet he manages to pay enough homage to the original series while putting his own spin on things.  Pine and especially Quinto are surprisingly wonderfully cast and Kirk and Spock, as is Karl Urban as McCoy, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Simon Pegg in an all too brief turn as Scottie, and Bana as Nero; who is undoubtedly the best Trek film villain since Khan.  John Cho as Sulu and Anton Yelchin as Chekov are fine in their relatively small turns as the film moves along with a nicely brisk pace, but the real surprise manages to be the emotional chords that Abrams pulls; whether it be the destruction of the planet Vulcan or the appearance and guidance of old Spock (Leonard Nimoy), who foretells his past self and Kirk alike that their bond and friendship is more than paramount.  With brilliant effects, epic space battles, and overall dynamite action scenes; this is the Star Trek for a new generation that we have all wanted and rightly deserve.  Now here's hoping that Abrams can manage to pull another rabbit out of his hat with the series someday further down the line."
0,"I did watch all six episodes, and I probably will watch more if they make more. That main scientist shown in the picture is very annoying, I must say. As viewers we are somehow expected to believe that he knows more than he's revealing, but he just seems to be too contrived. The show reminds me somewhat of Flash Forward, but it doesn't come close in quality or scope."
1,I am re-watching the last three seasons to refresh myself.  With the new season coming up I can't wait.  Such an awesome show it really is top notch.
1,Blues is a super sweet TV show for kids! The best part is it's not so annoying that you go nuts. It's actually cute and entertaining.
1,I found season 2 just as good as 1 and enjoyed all of the series.  The stories were gruesom and in some places hard to watch but I liked everything about the series.
1,"I just finished watching Dexter : Season 1 and it is phenomenal!I'm an avid movie watcher and TV series watcher! Ive watched all the seasons of CSI Vegas and Law & Order SUV, The Shield!Dexter is far superior to all of them. Season one starts out good, gets alot better half way through as the characters develop and ends with an amazing season finale!Showtime hit a homerun with this one! Im looking forward to Season 2 and have already lent my Season 1 set to a friend!"
1,"My son is 3 and he likes this show.  His attention span is pretty short, so he usually doesn't make it through an entire episode in one sitting, but he sure loves the theme song!  :)"
1,"Its a weird name for a kid and kids show.  I don't particularly care for this show, because the characters voice is whiny and annoying, but my kids like it so I suffer through it for them.  Over all its a good kids show, I just don't care for it because, well...I am an adult."
1,It was delightful!  Held my 3 and 4 year olds attention and they wanted more.  So nicely done too. Highly recommend
1,"One of the best I have seen, watch both seasons you won't be disappointed. In fact you will be wanting more, hopefully they will have a season 3."
0,Wow... I can't believe I am saying this.. I am a big fan of this series... but the 3rd season.. BORING.Feel like I wasted my $20 and I am not sure I even want to finish the unwatched shows.Just my .02Yawn.
1,"I'm truly happy and glad that this hilarious series found a new home and now continues with its comedic hijinx for people to enjoy. This set episodes are just as hilarious as the previous one s and hopefully they'll keep on making this series for a while to come, I mean if the Simpsons can stay on the air for almost 25 years why not the gang from Futurama? Anyway for fans of the series or fans of any comedy series here's a great set to add to your dvd library..."
1,I loved 24 when it was on tv and now after years I still love it.  All the seasons are the bomb.  LOL
1,"I loved the wry humor, and the little historical tidbits here and there made it interesting, too.  It was what I like to think of as &#34;light&#34; science fiction.  Too much science fiction gets so involved with gadgetry and special effects that the plot and characters get lost.  No so with this program.  I really hated to see it go."
1,"Acting is good - the plot varies from episode to episode - a very watchable series - well produced , one of the better shows on tv"
1,"Very much like the original Scared Straight. I'm not sure the younger kids in trouble really fall for all the &#34;Hard Timers&#34; antics that they see on the tour, but it seems like a worthwhile effort to turn kids in trouble around."
0,"This show isn't what it used to be, but having said that, each week tends to be mildly amusing as the A-Team of this new millenium goes about righting wrongs and having some fun.What's annoying is that for a long time now, NONE of the plots even pretend to have any meaningful obstacles... countless systems are bypassed with the flick of the wrist and a punch of the keyboard's Enter key... villains are hoodwinked, authorities remain clueless, foes are outsmarted etc. This used to be a smart, sassy show but any similarity to the UK's ""Hustle"" has long since been bypassed... what we seem to have nowadays is a team of people who effortlessly con everyone, walk away smiling every time... and if the episode can get away with sticking to one location (ie. cheap for the Production) then so be it... at most everyone dons a disguise or change of wardrobe. Ugh.Episode 4.12 ""The Office Job"" however has to go down in the history books as *the* most tedious and boring example of a premise s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d beyond breaking point and well into SNAP territory. I actually believed the producers had lost their minds with this one..."
1,"Just as the sorrow I felt when &#34;The X-Files&#34; ended, I was sad to see Grace leave the stage. Holly Hunter is larger than life and every cast member filled their spaces with emotion, sincerity and clarity."
1,"I bought this along with Season Two for my son who was really really happy with them . He already owns Season 3 and is waiting for Season 4 to come out. Where he lives he only gets two TV channels. If it weren't for DVDs and Netflix, he would have nothing to watch."
1,"I like Covert Affairs, but it is still building dimensions. I tend to compare it to Alias and I see the importance of the difference with Covert Affairs. The truth is that there is still a better view of the CSI with Covert Affairs but the depth of characters is thin and I am waiting for that breakout year. This is true with almost any series. There is a year that puts it apart for the pack."
1,"Season 3 of PARENTHOOD will be airing in the fall and season 2 will be released on dvd later this month.  Here we have the 13 episodes that made up the first season, our beloved introduction into PARENTHOOD.  This truly is an amazing series with superb acting and writing that is much needed on tv right now.  It has been a very long time since there was a realistic drama on tv about a true and realistic middle-class family.  This show is based on real situations that normal people deal with.  It is also based on the unity of family and unconditional love.  The pilot episode tried to jam all the characters in and was a little muddled but episode 2 smoothed everything down and the show got into a groove.  The talent involved in this ensemble cast is immense with the standouts being the superb Lauren Graham and Peter Krause.  They are both known for tv series and here they in no way resemble previous roles.  Lauren in particular.  She again plays a single mother but her character and performance in no way resembles Lorelai Gilmore.  Dax Shepard also rises to the plate here.  Many know him for comedy but he creates a great character here.Invest your time into this amazing show that is PARENTHOOD.  You will get to know characters worth knowing who are facing life situations the same as you.  You will laugh, you will cry and most of all you will identify.  This season wiull definitely impress but then you must move on to season 2 where the series truly shines.  PARENTHOOD is amazing and I highly recommend it."
1,"This overall is an honest, good show.  You get to see real law enforcement at work and real criminals which is eye opening sometimes."
1,"This first season is fantastic.  There are definitely relationship scenes that are skip-worthy, but the story feels original, and interesting. The young guy is dumb, but that's ok, we all know a few dumbies in real life.  The following seasons are OK, but the first season really shines."
1,"Adam is a pain in the neck, and rightfully so. Still, he is more than Mitchell wants or needs and so he tries to find a way to get him out of his hair. Mitchell is also feeling here, and feeling is leading him to wonder about a lot of things. He wonders, for instance, if Lia is right about him, if he is safe, and if he should think about love. Also, George and Nina are having a go at things, and things are becoming more and more interesting for the both of them. Combine that with our recently-arrived girl and we have a cast of grand things.This episode really sheds light on vampires and the way they are seen. It also shows what depravity exists and just how Mitchell is seen. The Nina and George fest is on, too, and humor has crept into this fray. That is a nice one considering where it went in the last season.As far as goods, this season is on pace for a nice outing. I personally have liked it more and more as I have watched it, and I have watched it a lot. The Adam story is one of many, it seems, and I am not sure if he will appear again. I also wonder about what Lia said, what will happen, and who will be impacted. Mitchell is a soft target now, and the words have said so. That makes it all nice and the video here is nicer still."
1,"The Plots of each were consistent and the character matured some, which added to the overall enjoyment.  The change in regulars added a &#34;newest&#34; that was fun."
1,out of curiosity I watched this.  Katy HOlmes does a fantastic job in this story playing Jackie Kennedy...she's so good you forget who she is.  It's a great story line and the roles are all supported well.
1,"I loved Kathy Reichs' books centering on the Temperence Brennen character and read them all.  The show is somewhat different from the books but still very pleasing.  Reichs continues act as an executive producer/consultant and it shows in the forensic goodies.  Emily Deschanell is perfectly cast for her role as the tile character, and David Boreanz as well as her FBI cohort.  Plenty of humor to offset the gruesome details of the murders they investigate.  If you like crime procedurals, you won't be disappointed in this show.  There is also some nice romantic interplay among the various cast members as well.  A very attractive cast.  The shows are consistently enjoyable."
1,"A very well written show.  I was more than a little sorry to see it end. I'm sure there were more good stories to tell.  The actors were 'real' although some of the story lines were a bit fantastic, but we can read the newspapers for the 'real' stuff."
1,This is a very smart adultoon ( adult cartoon).  Love the innuendo both subtle and blatant.  Worth checking it out
1,"I thoroughly enjoy &#34;Parenthood&#34;.  The family deals with so many issues, the least of which is the size of it and the emotional closeness of it's members.  Sounds like a cliche, but &#34;I laughed; I cried!&#34;.  It is wonderful, with a superb ensemble cast and crack writing.  It is upbeat, but not sugar-coated.  It's about survival, and the support system that helps them endure as a family."
1,It is enjoyable to see the U.S marshal get himself into and out of some fun predicaments. I will watch and see where the story goes next.
1,"A somewhat far fetched plot that keeps you interested in where the heck this is going feeling. If you are looking for something to watch, that doesnt need to be a five star movie, this is a decent choice."
1,The series provides the sci-fi ones expects of Dr. Who.  It is somewhat repetitive and I can only take a few doses at a time.
1,"""Eddie doesn't rob banks...He's about this high in the bunch but he gets around more than any man I've ever seen,"" says Dave Foley (Richard Jordan), a baby-faced Boston cop about as amoral as the wiseguys he hunts. Eddie Coyle (Robert Mitchum) is a worn out, two-bit gunrunner. He provides untraceable revolvers when required. He draws the line at machine guns. Eddie is honorable in his way. He loves his family. He's just a low life who isn't all that shrewd. The fix he's in, because he can't take any more jail time, is what this superb Peter Yates' movie is all about.""Look. I'm gettin' old, y'hear?"" Eddie tells a young hood who deals in machine guns. ""I spend most of my life hangin' around crummy joints with the punks drinkin' the beer, eatin' the hash an' hot dogs and watchin' the other people go off to Florida while I'm sweatin' how I'm goin' to pay the plumber. I done time when I stood up but I can't take no more chances. Next time it's goin' to be me goin' to Florida."" Now he's facing more prison time for foolishly agreeing to drive a getaway car when he should have asked his friends some questions. He'll do just about anything to cut a deal for no jail time. He's nearly 50. He doesn't want his wife to go on welfare, doesn't want his three kids made fun of because their old man is doing time. He's squeezed by Dave Foley to inform...and Eddie decides he'll rat a little. He's too believing to understand he might be tagged for ratting big time. It's all betrayal, but Eddie doesn't really understand betrayal. All those friends of Eddie's make us wary every time we meet them: Scalise (Alex Rocco), who robs banks, sometimes violently; Jackie (Steve Keats), the dangerous dealer in stolen machine guns; Dillon (Peter Boyle), owner of a low-life bar who knows more about things than Eddie does.The movie looks as hopeless as the Boston weather. It's the cold end of fall, filled with drab, chill days where parking lot asphalt is always wet. We're into Eddie's life in the low lane, where the anchors in the crummy strip malls are a tired Woolworth's and Barbo's Furniture Store. It's a lousy life and it belongs to Eddie Coyle. ""Have a nice day.""Director Peter Yates sets up scenes -- an exchange of machine guns, a bank robbery, a family held hostage, a stakeout in a commuter train lot, a night on the town -- that are so naturally established that we might miss how skillfully they build the story and show us Eddie's life. We're never sure if things are as hopeless for Eddie as they seem. Yates keeps us on edge, and he adds layers of Eddie Coyle's sad and foolish trust.This is one of Robert Mitchum's best performances. Mitchum still looks like he might be a tough guy, but his Eddie Coyle is a man who has had the force of his life wrung out of him. He's been in the life forever. He does the jobs others ask him to. He doesn't ask very many questions. He's just not smart enough. Mitchum takes all the hard edges off his usual persona and gives us an aging loser whose life is on the skids, and who doesn't understand just how badly off he is.The Criterion release looks just fine. There is a commentary by Peter Yates."
1,"Season one got me hooked. Good acting and an interesting storyline, the characters work well together and their relationships with each other seem to have become even more believable and interesting in season two."
1,"Seasons 1 and 2 are outstanding, each episode was extremely interesting, time passed quickly.  However, I would judge season 3 as good but not as good as seasons 1 and 2."
1,"David Tennant rocks. I love his version of the doctor. He 's able to show more emotion than is usual in this character,"
1,"It's basically a slightly less intelligent version of &#34;Seinfeld.&#34; If I had to define it I'd say it's sophomoric humor which contains lots and lots of yelling amongst the main characters. For lovers of low brow comedy, this will be among your favorites. I haven't seen all of the episodes yet, but so far it appears that no topic is taboo."
1,Timothy Olyphant....what more is there to say!  The plots are fun and the dialog is great with many lines that make you chuckle.I love the verbal sparring between &#34;Boyd Crowder&#34; and &#34;Marshall Raylan Givens&#34; & Timothy Olyphant!
1,"When this series first aired I thought it would be a typical clone series of Friends or Joey or the like but to my surprise and happiness I found it actually has a talented and entertaining cast who keep the series more enjoyable as each season comes out.  I like how it plays on the seemingly stereotypical lifestyles of the vastly intelligent but socially awkward and socially talented but slight less intelligent academically and not always in the same group as you would think.  Many people have wondered if the series has a laugh track like some of the early 80's to mid 90's shows, while you do hear laughter it's actually from an audience rather then a mechanical laugh track.Still if you find it annoying to hear laughter in some of the scenes then this series is one you might want to pass over, while it doesn't distract you from what's going on in the scenes more then half the episodes will have for obvious reasons laughing in them. If you're still unsure of the series I'd say get the first season especially for the price it's going for and see whether or not you will become a fan as I highly suspect or this is a series you'll want to pass over either way I still say the series is worth a try."
1,"I enjoy this show, although I think the romantic (or sexual) tension between the lead actors is not there.  The female lead is leading the male around by the nose.  I do not truly enjoy a weak man, but that's just me.  I like the detecting portion of the show, and the other characters are great.  The female boss, the intern and the morgue doctor are great characters.  The detective is fun, when he is not with the female lead."
0,"It was a disappointment. I gave it a few episodes to get into it, but it didn't get any better."
1,One of all time favorite detectives - Love all episodes - wish there were more. No one can outsmart Poirot.
1,Loved the first season so now I'm loving the second one too.  Mary and Marshall pop off each other so well.
1,"The cast works extremely well together.  The episodes are well written and directed.  There are comical, suspenseful, action, and drama focused episodes that bring out the different aspects of the characters and plot."
1,"COULD NOT WAIT TO START LAST SEASON OF PRISON BREAK.  WAS SO EXCITED TO SEE JUSTICE HAS PREVAILED HOWEVER, THE CONCLUSION OF SUCH AN INCREDIBLE SEASON LEFT ME DEPRESSED FOR WEEKS. :("
1,"A different type of crime show that makes you feel a part of the investigation.  I especially respond to the interviews with relatives and friends of the victim/s.  Best of all, at the end of the broadcast, the episode completes with an actual ending."
1,"Season after Season I am never disappointed.  Even though this is for season 2, trust me it will leave you wanting more.  Love this show."
0,I don't really love Little Bear because it looks ok that was so very angry and I really hate this show
1,My kids love this show. It's one of my 3 year olds favorites. I just wish amazon had more prime seasons.
1,"One of my personal favorites. Not a bad place to start if you want to get into MST3K. It is a classic, the riffs are non-stop, and the direct-to-video nature of it just screams to be riffed."
1,"This show is hilarious. It's one of those shows that'll have you every few weeks saying, ""so and so isn't my favorite character anymore, it's all about..."" but that's just testament to the hilarious writing that goes into the show. (My favorite is Tina right now btw) While not especially high on the smart comedy it does have some pretty funny moments that don't fall to relying on fart humor or being completely offensive and distasteful to get the punch line, though there are a few of those moments, the show doesn't simply rely on that to get a laugh. I've already started watching the second season and I'm very happy my 12 year old niece made me watch this show one night on Netflix. Highly recommended."
1,"The other reviewers are right.  This one gets better as the movie progresses and the ending is one of the best.  The bath scene with the mom is down right creepy, but even more so may be the parents' utter lack of concern in hospital.  Maybe the actors didn't really know what was going on???  I guess that applies to the entire movie, though, so kick back and enjoy the seemingly endless one-liners."
1,"Liked that Loved this, I can hardly wait for the next season, I even bought the first episode of the next season."
0,"This could have been a great show. But its not. What we get is a bunch of bikers presented as the defenders of small-town America. They get to be ""bad"" guys, but bad guys within real strict limits. Its another biker fantasy for rich guys in the suburbs. To undermine the premise even further they create real ""bad guys"" in the form of a white sumpremist gang hanging around the edges of things doing everything the ""good"" Bikers can't do.The show is also heavy on disfunctional family stuff taken right from the Sopranos. We have Jax Teller whose murdereded father apparently formed the gang as a utopian hippie experiment and would never have approved of the club running guns to make money. Jax spends half of every episode pouting about something. He just comes across as a total wuss.Ron Perlman has the presence to play the leader of the gang. But whatever presence he has is constantly undermined by Jax and the fact that every idea he has seems to fail or backfire. The show is at its best when Perlman is taking care of business for the club and showing how a small town like Charming works. Its at its worst whenever Jax gets whiny and they bitch at each other.Shows like this are good when everything is in shades of grey. When they show why someone like Clay makes the decisions he does and why idealism usually leads to trouble. But in Sons of Anarchy, Jax is always right and even if he takes a risk, it always pays off.One of the good things in the show are the law enforcement characters. There is far more realism in the show about them than the bikers.I really wanted to like this. And there were some things that I did really like. But the show is too tame and too much into biker fantasy."
1,I love Survivor Gabon a lot it was really fun that the Fang and Kota are the Gabon Tribes nice
1,"I loved it was exciting, an funny  It was worth Watching. I would see it again If you like Sci fi this is the one."
0,"The time I spent watching this movie that I could have spent doing something else. It actually takes real effort to make a movie this bad. First and foremost this movie is mainly about a backup generator and how long it can stay running. Apparently that's the best plot this movie has to offer. There's also a locked room (that's the sub plot) but maybe they are saving that for the next movie because no one ever bothers to find out what's behind the door.Other than than you have a bunch of people running away from shadows and looking for flashlights that work. You think that with an entire city gone they could have stopped by Radio shack and got a cart full of flashlights and batteries to haul around. Maybe even stopped by Sears and got a new generator? If all else failed the least they could do is stop at the supermarket and get some matches and lawn torches. Sadly hour main characters aren't that bright. Probably the worse survival group in this history of survival horror (I think that's what this was trying to be) *spoiler here* no wonder none of them survive.The monsters in this movie are shadows. They were creepy for about the first 5 minutes than after that just plain boring. No scares, or real sense of danger to be found in this movie. Only if your afraid of your own shadow than maybe just maybe. For some reason I remember another movie about people running around trying to find lights to keep on so they didn't vanish in the dark. I forget what it was called but it wasn't that old. That movie was a yawner as well (probably why I forgot it). I know this movie will soon ""vanish"" from my mind because there isn't anything worth remembering from it other than I need to pick up some batteries just in case the power goes out. Last time the power went out I had to bump around in the dark looking for matches and luckily I found some old birthday candles.This movie was such a waste of time it should have never been made. The characters are pointless, the movie has no plot, it never goes anywhere, it carries on to long, and nothing about what's taking place is explained. I'm all for these weird sci-fi no explanation movies but if you're going to do them at least do it right like War of the Worlds. Throw in some action, and controversy to skip over the fact that no one knows why the creatures are there or where they come from really.This movie is a fantastic waste of time! Can't imagine anyone owning or at least even bothering to watch this more than once unless they are trying to use it as a sleep aid."
1,"This was an immensely popular independent internet series, years ago, for gamers. It is fun even if you don't game, but you may not get it."
1,We love NCIS and all the seasons are great.  Anyone who enjoys the characters will like this season.  Beware of scenes in the autopsy room.
1,"Riding the Band of Brothers wave of Fame Damian Lewis is great.  This was a great show.  Loved the cast.  Fun to watch the actors work together.  This show, like many, was not given a chance when it was on NBC.  From what I heard many did not care for Crews' flakiness but that was part of what made the show unique from all the other cop shows.  Well worth the watch."
1,Diego draws the young ones in a wholesome way. My grandson (aged 3) enjoys and learns prereading skills through watching Diego and his many adventures.
1,"My daughter is very particular about her kids even watching TV, but this is one of the shows that is ok for them to watch and they really enjoy it."
1,Wasn't what I thought it would be. A little slow and took awhile to figure out the story line.Hope second season is better.
0,"I saw the reviews on here and read some internet posts about how great this show was, so I bought it. I'd seen a clip of the show on the internet and thought it was interesting, but the lead just gave me bad vibes. Watching the first three episodes last night, I just couldn't take it anymore! Callie, his love interest, is totally annoying. She is a nurse who also goes to medical school and has a son. Jim is a know-it-all punk who always magically has the upper hand. There is no explanation at all for why or how he outsmarts everyone, he just does. The characters is very smug and unlikeable. Maybe he appeals to narcissistic Generation X and Y types, but not me. Furthermore, Jim doesn't have any depth. He is in jerk mode all of the time. He's not even vulnerable. This is the worst written show on TV!The character is just not believable as a cop. He acts like a rich prep schooler. I believe that he is supposed to be middle-class, but the writers probably can't even comprehend how to create a middle-class character, so they based one off of their own privileged lives. It's almost like they couldn't stand writing Callie as just a nurse, so they made her a nurse who is trying to be a doctor! Now she's classy enough for the show!I got bored during episodes. The shows I watched began with a murder, then just became disjointed as time went on. Jim would investigate, meet up with Callie, make sarcastic comments, then there would be a final magical scene that resolves everything perfectly. The Carlos Gomez character is the only interesting one that comes across as human, but even he has no chemistry with the lead.I just couldn't stand the show anymore and I put it up for sale. I really don't recommend it."
1,"This is the best show on television, tied with NCIS. I love the characters and their humaness. There is plenty of action but these characters also have a soft side and I appreciate seeing that. I truly love this show."
1,"From the bleak, broken world with its tiny personal living spaces and small pleasures, to the twisted plot that our character finds himself drawn into, this little gem is well worth your time. The animation is as strange and intriguing as the picture on the front, with realistic over-sized faces attached to inadequate bodies. The main character's deadpan acting adds a sublime sense of resignation to this futuristic view of life under corporate control. How interesting that this viewing coincides with the corporate destruction taking place off the coast of my state in the Gulf of Mexico. Seeing the power of a huge corporation first hand makes Metropia seem all the more possible."
1,"And I mean that in every way ;). She looks so pure and innocent. As I said about &#34;Strangers With Candy&#34; I am not sure this series could be shown on TV these days because it isn't politically correct enough. Too many people have forgotten how to laugh at themselves any more.I have also heard that Sarah is kind of like she is in this series in real life in the sense that she is outspoken and sometimes people are offended by her honesty and political incorrectness. Lighten up America (and others), humor and laughing at oneself is better medicine than anything a doctor could give you."
1,This show is too cute for its own good and I like to watch it when I'm sick. Sue me.
1,"It is amazing to see the writers and producers of this show maintain such high quality with great stories and endless conflicts.  The group has many more personal problems to deal with now, not so much football, like Tyra and her academic struggles, the Riggins brothers and their attempts at making money along with Jason Street, who now has a baby to care for, Matt and his neverending issues with his grandma, Julie and her frequent clashes with her parents, and more."
0,"Buy the first 4 seasons, rent the 5th season.  Not very good -- terrible scripts."
1,A learning experience that otherwise I would not have known. Too bad you can not give your reason for your rating in a short concise manner!
1,Vic Mackey is one of the most real characters in TV police work.  I'll be sad to see the end of this season and the last one end

1,"Spoilers:During the sixth season the Doctor is murdered and he must find out who killed him. More importantly he has to discover WHO or WHAT the ""Silence"" is and why, well, they've chosen to silence HIM. The doctors lies, dies and Amy Pond cries. Steven Moffat comes up with an intriguing story arc that has a strong beginning, lags a bit in the middle but picks up again by the last third.End of Spoilers:While the sixth season of ""Doctor Who"" isn't flawless, it's ALWAYS entertaining even during the lesser episodes in this set. Writer/producer Moffat has made ""Doctor Who"" his own show (much as his predecessor Russell T. Davies did) in a sense rebooting the series with a new Doctor (Matt Smith)during the fifth season, a pair of new companions (Karen Gillian as Amy Pond and Arthur Darvil as Rory) who plays a role almost as important as the Doctor himself. It's a clever story arc that at times gets lost in its own cleverness but always returns to what makes the series fun. Smith has made the role his own which given the performances of his predecessors is saying something.Moffat ties together the story strands from previous seasons including the origin of Dr. River Song (Alex Kingston). Any season that features one of my favorite actors Mark Sheppard (""Battlestar: Galatica"", ""Supernatural"" and ""Burn Notice"" among other shows--please someone get this man a series!)is given a bit of leeway.I do hope though that Moffat will move away from the all powerful Doctor as it would eventually become something of a narrative dead end for the show. There is a bit of noticeable banding now and again but on the whole the presentation is exceptionally good.The Blu-ray for ""Doctor Who"" receives a marvelous looking transfer for home video in high def. Colors pop (well, when they're supposed to)and the show looks remarkably sharp with strong fine detail.Audio sounds quite strong with a nice immersive 5.1 lossless mix but dialogue is quite strong.Special features include a number of fun, informative commentary tracks for the following episodes: ""The Impossible Astronaut"",""The Doctor's Wife"",""The Rebel Flesh"", ""A Good Man Goes To War"", ""The Wedding of River Song"". We also get ""Doctor Who: Classified"", ""Monster Files"", episode prequels for episodes 1. 3. 7, 8 and 13 which although unnecessary are nice additions to the episodes as well as ""A Christmas Carol"" the annual Christmas episode, comic relief sketch and ""Doctor Who: Confidential-A Night's Tale"" plus deleted scenes for various epiosdes.Although the sixth season has a couple of filler episodes and a few that don't resonante even though the concept is solid enough, the overall story arc for season six is well thought out  and plotted.Recommended."
1,"Rome has clearly inspired Showtime to produce this miniseries in 10 one hour parts, portraying Henry VIII's more youthful and vigorous days.  The timespan is a small one, from his growing discontentment with Catherine of Aragon, to consummating his love for Anne Boleyn... so we only get to wife number 2 - plenty of scope for sequels, but did leave me with a bit of frustration at times wanting to see a little more resolved.As it is, the key players here are Henry VIII, in his low 20's, fighting fit and clearly horny (there are some fairly explicit scenes towards the beginning of the season).. Cardinal Wolsey (played with great presence by Sam Neill) the corrupt but efficient First Minister, and Sir Thomas More, the fervent Catholic and conscientious humanist.The series thrives on a combination of terrific performances, well written screenplay and flawlessly depicted Tudor atmosphere of the Court.It falls short of Rome's success by failing to have a counterpoint to the Royal drama - the scenes of `Real' England, the bars and backstreets, are only rarely seen, but could be considered vital to understanding the England of the times.  Having some lowly characters in situations of poverty, may well have helped accentuate the drama.Having said that, and despite a few forgivable departures from history, this works well as a refresher on Tudor history, and is a first at seeing Henry VIII in his prime as a real human being.Kudos to Showtime, and I await the next series with bated breath..Extras are modest, but rewarding - a couple of 5 minute featurettes on costume and sets, and a lengthier one with a tour guide taking us round the real Tudor historic sights in London, all moderately interesting.  A documentary depicting the real history may have also been a welcome addition, but is lacking.Also included are first episodes on some other Showtime series - a cunning plan, and a welcome one."
1,This andDreamlandfit between what Amazon calls seasons 4 and 5.These are absolutely beautiful to watch (in HD) and David Tennant is wonderful in all these episodes.  Planet of the Dead is a great stand alone story.  Even though the final episode feels a bit forced (as they try to cram as many guest appearances as possible...) the overall story resolution is pretty amazing.  So while this was a very short season it is totally enjoyable.
1,"This is a short but mostly good ending for a great series, with Monk finally finding out what was in the present from Trudy that he had never opened before.  It opens up a Pandora's box of unhappiness for a while, but in the end, things turn out very nicely for our man Adrian.  New horizons also open up for the captain and Randy. I also found Traylor Howard somewhat more likeable this season than in seasons past."
1,"I love the interaction between the characters, especially Joy and Elka. Victoria's vanity and Melanie's &#34;adorable&#34; are spot on! Having all the guest stars from other sitcoms the ladies have played in is truly interesting. Carol Burnett, Mary Tyler Moore, Bonnie Franklin, Georgia Engel, Tim Conway, Valarie Harper....and the list goes on. The comedy is well-timed, funny, and the cast knows how to maximize the effect. Overall a truly funny, enjoyable, heart-warming series with the best cast out there!"
1,"This show is not for everyone. If you don't want to see moms going over the top and children acting like brats then don't watch it.But it's not all like that. In most episodes, the parents are kind and teach the kids sportsmanship. Just like with everything else, there's a good and bad side. And there's some things that might shock as well anger some. But this is a show, like any other.What saddens me, are the reviews that the comments that are so catty and mean. It's a show. Treat it as such. If you don't like it, don't watch it, simple as that."
0,"""The Mutant Chronicles"" plays like a bad SyFy movie original film. In the 28th century the world is ruled by four corporate entities and nations no longer exist. When two warring factions face off and accidently destroy the seal that keeps The Machine a device that ""creates"" mutant soldiers that feel no pain and only live to attack and kill, these mutant soldiers start overrunning the Earth forcing people to flee the planet. Brother Samuel (Ron Perlman)recruits war veterans Major ""Mitch"" Hunter (Thomas Jane)along with a team of other veterans to delivery a explosive device to the heart of The Machine. The only problem is that Hunter and his team must find the key that activates the ancient bomb which is located somewhere within The Machine itself.A low budget for a movie wouldn't matter if it were inspired unfortunately ""The Mutant Chronicles"" written by Philip Eisner and directed by Simon Hunter, the script and direction are amateurish at best. While the cast is fairly solid it's pretty clear to me that John Malkovich took his brief role in the film for the money (as I suspect everyone did along with the idea of shooting almost an entire movie without real sets). It seems like everyone here had good intentions but they were undermined by a poorly written script, direction that focuses on the look and feel of the movie but not the performances or even assembling capable action sequences.Perhaps the element of camp and the stilted dialogue was intentional or this is meant to be a corny backstep to a 1950's style of filmmaking. If that's the case, you might enjoy it. I didn't.The image quality pretty good.I'd suggest renting before buying to see if this appeals to you."
1,Interesting premise still used by psychology and law enforcement. Well done by  this group of actors...and personal stories interwoven. Fun to watch!
1,"This season, from the few episodes already available, has the making for a brilliant season, possibly the best yet. Karen Gillian says that THIS is the season to watch, and never were truer words spoken about Doctor Who! The cast is turning in awesome performances, the writing both takes itself more seriously and remains endearingly light-hearted, and the cgi and visual effects are stunning. By far, the best product with the brand name on it.Well done!"
1,"This story is a bit slow, but the acting is worth the watch, and the costumes are interesting, glad we women don't have to wear those bonnets these days!!"

1,The Norwegian legend of trolls is cleverly uncovered in this modern mock documentary. The special effects that create the trolls are very well done. The monsters are otherworldly and bizarre. A ton of fun to watch.
1,"I am a huge Cary Grant fan, I thought I'd seen all of his movies, and today, this gem came to my attention. I sure miss the values, the love and the care for one's family and neighbors as depicted in this movie. I was born in the 60's, so I remember scouting, and the morals and values that were taught. I remember friendly neighborhood children, riding bikes and going to the beach.I didn't expect to get choked up watching this, but I did, as well as laugh out loud at times. This story is about a family with a heart for children. They bring two children who are living in orphanages, into their homes. The transformation that love, discipline, and a home can cause on even the most devastated child. How I wish things could go back to the way they were. I know it wasn't as idyllic as is shown in movies, but I definitely miss those days. I'd give this 10 stars if I could!"
1,"""Kings"" is a good story about a modern day king in North America, but I can see how it got canceled. Besides it being not such an easy concept to get into, it was also on television the same time Barack Obama became president, so very bad timing there also hurt it. No one wanted to see an ""American"" King, at that time. Also, the show is very religious, being based off the Bible and all.The story is a about an everyday farm boy, David, whose bravery and morality gets him a seat amongst the powerful King of Gilboa, Silas. Gilboa is basically an alternate reality version of America and Shiloh, the capital, is like New York. Now David witnesses how power and politics play out, and through the corruption, uses God as a beacon to serve his ever corrupt king.Many of the characters are multi-layered and easy to get into. Besides David, every major character is morally ambiguous. David is just pure, innocent goodness, however. He is more loyal than your pet dog and basically worships King Silas, thinking he's a vessel of God. He lost much of his family to the enemy country to the north, Gath (which is similar to Russia) in the war, and just seeks peace between Gilboa and Gath, believing King Silas to be the one man that can achieve that.Silas is corrupt, power-hungry, and ultimately, miserable. However, he's also very charismatic and somewhat clever, making him believable as both a politician and king. He's been king for at least 30 years and founded the capital city of Shiloh. But because he now loathes the duties of being a king, his heart gradually grows darker over the course of the show. He has a hidden second family, and they're the only thing that makes him happy, but he'd still rather be king and hold onto power than be with the people who he really wants to be with. The problem is, the writers want you to think Silas is a good guy who does bad things, when he's mostly just a bad guy. A bad guy capable of love, but still mostly evil, selfish, and insecure. [SPOILER: He tries to kill David by the second episode! END SPOILER] This becomes annoying because he rarely ever gets his comeuppance, so we rarely ever get to see Silas get what he deserves. So I guess it kind of mirrors real life power figures, but still leaves you a bit angry at how much he can get away with as essentially an anti-villain who never gets punished in any way.Queen Rose is just your basic ice queen, politician-type who is mostly evil and selfish, but thinks her actions are ""for the good of everyone."" Like Silas, she barely loves her kids and cares more about image than family.Prince Jack is your troubled and neglected son, whose daddy issues causes him to grow into a very dark man. However, he's not really evil. He wants to be king, but his older sister is next in line. Plus, he's gay, and Silas is homophobic and ashamed of him.Princess Michelle is the well-meaning daughter, however, she's not very capable or independent, and relies too much on her power or family to bail her out of situations whenever she screws up, which is often. She strives to be good and optimistic, but is too much of a spoiled brat to really do much on her own, which isn't really her fault, being a rich princess and all. She falls in love with David, but basically promised her father to be celibate, so is also kind of a tease. She's the opposite of Jack in that she comes off a lot more moral than she truly is. Jack comes off more savage than he really is; he just wants to be loved.Thomasina is the royal assistant and besides David and Michelle, is the closest character to be good. However, she is a survivalist and is basically a good person whose job is to do bad things for the royal family, and it weighs heavy on her soul.William Cross is the brother-in-law corporate war monger and is basically a young Dick Cheney. He only cares about money and power, but just like his little sister, Rose, believes he is doing good for the world. He arranged for Rose to marry Silas and Silas gets his power from Cross' money, making them both allies and enemies, as Cross is the real power in the monarchy. The Reverend is the man who talks to and for God, but being so close to power and corruption, slowly starts to become bad himself without even realizing it until it's too late for him to ""save his soul.""There are also two comic relief royal guards and an ex-con son to William Cross played by Macaulay Culkin, but they don't matter much.Kings is written well, and while the later season (post-war with Gath) is better than the beginning, is still compelling to watch. As mentioned, this entire world takes time to get used to, and I'm not sure if a season two would've been worth watching, so personally, I think this would've made a better two-hour movie, or 24-episode season, than what we got. But it's still worth watching. The season finale is kind of annoying because they assume they'd not only have a season two (some characters get exiled for the course of one year), but a season three as well (A new king is crowned). But because this never happened, we get no resolution and we [SPOILER!] never get to see David become King, as the pilot and rest of the series foreshadows. As mentioned, a season two probably wouldn't have had much to do, anyway. [END SPOILER.]It also would've been nice to see the history of how Gilboa (America) got founded and how war with Gath (Russia) began. Ultimately, if you're open-minded though, Kings is worth checking out. I was curious about this show I never got to see following a presidential election year, so I checked it out. It is well written and has great characters, so you might like it, too."
1,I choose this rating cuz this season of heroes was amazing. the episodes never messed up with amazon and everything went just fine I would recommend this show to everyone
1,I never knew how a lot of the states go their shapes. I like how it touches on issues that are relevant tody.
1,Well acted Engish period series.Interesting subjects.Acting & interesting scripts moved the series along nicely.Hope it maintains the quality in the future season.
1,nova presents learning new things in an interesting media presentation. With nice visualas well as great speakers etc.Just is interesting to watch and learn.The topics are so varied and wide that makes everyone happy.
1,"This show is amazing. My just turned 2 year old loooves it. He has learned his shapes from this! He also loves to ""measure"" everything (our dogs just looove that...). He has all the toys and books they have made for it so far. Waiting on more! Hint hint! He sleeps with the dolls, plays all day with the figures and love to color in the coloring book. Keep it coming!"
1,"Sorry, but the other reviewers are leading you astray. As usual, (re)viewers fall in love with a show and think it can do no wrong. Well, plenty goes wrong in Earl's second season---mainly the scripts.The writers are milking the same old laughs, and even a bunch of decent guest stars can't make this nearly as funny as season one. They try to get outside the box at times, but when all of your characters are basically morons, things get a little stale after a while. The trailer park humor worked for a season, but now it's just old.The only really funny thing on this show now is Joy; Pressly does a great job of making her lines come alive, show after show. Everyone else seems caught up by the slowly increasing weakness of the scripts. There's also the feeling that now that the formula is set, let's milk this puppy while we can. Randy and the cleaning lady are especially flat by the middle of this season.This season has its moments, but it also has loooong minutes of pedestrian writing and nothing interesting going on, and cheap attempts at weak laughs.Didn't think this would jump the shark so soon.Earl's list should now include, ""Had a good, really funny show and then made it boring."""
0,"I give two stars here only for the soundtrack and for Ciaran Hinds.As for the rest, it really isn't a ghost story.  It's a narrative mess, muddled and confusing, with the focus taken off of the main character and given to two others whose story is not interesting.Too bad it was so pointless.  It could have been much better."
1,"This is a great, family friendly, show that helps kids with shapes and counting. It's fun entertainment and the kids love it."
1,"I really enjoyed this show, I hope to see more in the future.  A lot of secrets I did not know about."
1,Watched this while cooking and found that several episodes made me want to stop and sit down to watch.  The fact that it's divided into episodes makes it good for short viewings.  Have not finished watching it.  Did read the book and like it.
0,"honestly the costume is really cook looking for the time period this was made in.The flash is one of my favorite super hero's ever since my nickname was Flash when I did track, so learning a little bit about him was cool but I really couldn't sit for so long through these episodes like 40-60mins each?the only way to watch this and stay sane is to skip threw a lot of parts, there is just too much story, if they re-made this into a tv series now a days and made it like the arrow, I would prolly love it if they made it, if they re-make this now a days I would love to watch it even at 2 hours an episode lolafter seeing how awesome arrow was, I never knew arrow before but once I started watching the tv show wow he is actually awesome, the story behind how he got accuracy and everything is awesome and he's not one of my favorite, im even thinking about buying some green arrow comic books just to see more about how cool he is now. Flash I already got a lot of comics of him lol. but really looking forward to seeing a re-make of this in years to come"
1,"This show is fast paced and fun. I love the ""helping the little guy"" angle and the quick humor in every episode."
1,"A love affair between an Israeli man and Palestinian woman is obviously going to run into the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  That fact could have made this a very trite film.  The director and actors, apparently using improvised dialogue, keep this film fresh and original.  The acting is very good.It is also refreshingly short at about an hour and a half.  I have come to suspect that any movie over 2 hours is the result of poor editing.While it has nothing to do with the quality of the film I do get tired of all of the smoking that goes on in these foreign films.  Will they ever break with this 1940's Bogartian cliche?"
1,I really like what Rick and his crew can do. It was good to reacquaint myself with the early episodes.
1,I loved watching this without commercials and episode after episode.  It is fun watching the changes in Sylar and this volume was very good.
1,We sing many of the songs we've learned from here throughout the day. My son loves to see what adventure they will go on enxt.
1,"Very fast paced,  but not too fast.  Easy to understand, and what happens makes sense.  Has a Sci-fi taste to it,  but still very with in reach of reality."
1,"I ordered series one and two after reading the positive reviews on Amazon about this show.  Added to that the ton of awards it has also won I was very interested to see if the programme would live up to all the positive hype.  One and two were amazing and Series three is fantastic.  I have enjoyed them all and have encouraged friends and family to watch the show because it is just that good.  Do yourself a favour and watch all three series, you will not regret it."
1,"Why mess with success?  That seems to be the idea behind this season of Monk.  And while it wasn't as strong as some of the other seasons have been, it was certain still fun.The season opens with Sarah Silverman reprising her role as Monk's biggest fan.  She hires Monk (Tony Shalhoub) to find out who is framing her dog for murder.  The catch?  The dog died before the murder took place.And there is more fun to be had.  Monk suspects Captain Stottlemeyer's (Ted Levine) new girlfriend of murder.  Natalie's (Traylor Howard) daughter Julie (Emmy Clarke) gets her first boyfriend and learns to drive.  Monk takes a job as a security guard at his bank to catch a robber.  And he must deal with the consequences of shooting Santa.  And he falls under the spell of cult leader Howie Mandel.When I reviewed season five, I did mention that they were occasionally crossing the line from character to caricature.  That seemed to be more of a problem here in my eyes.  In fact, there were several in a row near the beginning that seemed to be forced for laughs.  The episodes dealing with the nude beach and the rapper were painful instead of funny.  And some of the others had a been there, done that feel to them.On the other hand, there are still so many good moments.  This is especially true of the two part season finale which advances the Trudy storyline when Monk is accused of murdering the six fingered man.And I can't fault the acting.  All four leads (including Jason Gray-Stanford and Lt. Disher) continue to do great jobs bringing their characters to life.  I was disappointed that we only got to see Julie a couple times.  And it is sad watching this knowing that we won't get to see the late Stanley Kamel any more as the excellent Dr. Kroger.Monk may be showing its age.  But it is still fun and entertaining.  Fans will welcome the newest season into their homes."
1,"I guess it is in fashion to take pot shots at a show just because WE AMERICANS did not originate it. Some folks must believe it makes them seem ""worldly"" to include the comparisons in their reviews. Honestly, I believe this show solidified AMC as a series powerhouse. It already had Breaking Bad, Mad Men, and Walking Dead in their stable. This show rounds out the offerings nicely and makes the channel one to beware if you are a network.The Killing is intelligent and has a cast of characters that leave you constantly guessing. Deep into season two and there is still a mystery to be solved.  This is a show to share with friends, And the ""partner dynamic"" hasn't been this engaging since X-Files."
1,"Telling a non-linear story isn't easy but this writer-director pulls it off with aplomb. The movie's story structure plays like a piece of music.There's the A melody about a successful woman who's personal life is a mess. Then the B melody about troubled teenagers. The C melody explores the relationship between two crop duster pilots and the daughter of one of them. The D melody reveals an illicit affair.The movie weaves these melodies into a regular rhythm for the first two acts: A B C D, A B C D, A B C D...Don't be fooled: the repetition of this rhythm isn't predictable when you watch the movie. In fact, the excellent writing and the mesmerizing performances of the actors will pull you from scene to scene. For a movie with no action scenes, you will be surprised at how often you are on the edge of your seat, waiting for the next revelation.And thus we learn how each of the melodies is connected to the other and how events from one melody influence the previous one.A unity emerges, binding events from future to past and past to future.Disparate geographies are connected: from the gloomy, blue-tinged, rain-sodden Pacific Northwest to the warm yellow and brown primal landscapes of west Texas, and the golden hues of Mexico.The third act breaks the rhythm as events collide and rebound and merge. Once the music of the story ends and the music of the ending credits roll, you'll find yourself pondering and maybe even hoping for an encore."
1,"I'm kind of ashamed that I love this show so much, but I really do. I always do a Storage Wars marathon when I'm sick (for free through Amazon Prime, yay!), so I've seen quite a few episodes. It's nothing fancy, but always entertaining."
1,Season 1 was simply fantastic. This is slightly a let-down. Probably because the novelty has worn off slightly. As we know Earl is a no-good guy who discovers Karma and decides to undo some wrong things he has done in the past. The persona of Earl is still very sweet and maybe one positive thing is that the episodes are somewhat less aggressive in tone than sometimes in the first season but it is nevertheless not as great.
1,family love to sit down and watch this together. Love Hiro! Kids really enjoy the show as well as us adults!
0,Could not figure out what the story line was. Movie hopped around the lives of several different women and different time lines. I could not follow it and turned it and off after about 30 minutes.
1,Very cute show for kids. I have twin 2yr olds and a 5 year old and they all love it.
1,"That said, don't go into this with any preconceptions and I think you will appreciate the show more.Watch and decide for your self."
0,"I SAW this lame movie in  pre-screen in HD-MOVIESBah, where to begin? The film starts off strong with a good scary set up, but the story of mass disappearances of people when they are in darkness goes nowhere. We waited all 90 minutes for some explanation; even some guesses by the remaining few who have found one another, but none came. The characters are completely uninspired and even when they learn that they will die if it goes dark, they dont take even the most basic steps to survive (candles? gas lamps?). Frustrating, as this could have been an interesting movie, even scary, but its as if the writer & director had an idea for a piece of a movie, but never developed the plot. Its ninety minutes of whispers I exist and dark shadow creeping up on people to take them away and pretty much nothing else.  i recommend as just STUPID & WASTED MY TIME!!!!!  D"
1,"THE START IS VERY VAGUE AND CONFUSING, BUT IT'S BUILDING UP SLOWLY, VERY SLOWLY TO THE END OF THE FIRST SEASON WHERE EVERYTHING IS CLEAR, EXCEPT WHAT IS GOING TO BE IN THE NEXT SEASON AND IF THERE WILL BE ONE!"
1,"I was skeptical about this season when I found out Clemmy, Garcia, and Kimball were killed off.  I thought Clemmy was hilarious as well as Garcia with his red hot temper (plus I think he's hot).  I even liked Kimball, especially with her religious fundamentalism and the possible romance with cousin Travis Junior.  Well, I was surprised how well I liked the new characters: Sgt. Jack Declan the tough, angry fat guy (although he has, according to the commentaries, since lost a lot of weight) and the exuberant New Yorker Dep. Frank Rizzo who is also really cute.  They fit into the department right from the first episode.  I also like the quasi romantic connection between Wiegel and Rizzo.  I've just heard from the cyberspace grapevine that this is the last season so, unfortunately, that storyline won't be further developed.  Reoccurring sketches include the Mexican radio station, high school metal detector, the white trash gal Carmen, senior abuse public service announcements, the mental hospital, the lonely ranger, the library, classroom presentations, the sexy car wash, the guy with the boat (I don't care for those skits), Cindy the ex-sex slave turned dispatcher, and Terry the roller skater.  Other sketches are listed below along with what I consider highlights.Disc 1:1. Dangle mentions in passing a couple times that two deputies were blown up last season (what about the third?).  Trudy introduces the ""Suicide Prevention Webpage.""  Frank Rizzo gives some background on his well-traveled law enforcement career.  Rizzo becomes Jones's partner and schools him on how to complete a drug bust.  Williams and Dangle escort an employee from his workplace.  Sgt. Declan visits his informant Terry.  Highlight:  the KKK winery.2. Doll trouble.  Air Overnight delivers ""presents"" from ""Joe Public.""  Williams and Wiegel give makeovers at the high school metal detector.  Dangle and Rizzo conduct surgery.  Highlight:  Patton Oswalt guest stars as a man confessing to a crime for a trip to Tailand which leads to a hilarious airplane scene.  The commentary talks about the special effects and how much that doll costs.3. The department holds their meetings at Capt. Crabby's Crab Shack because of the asbestos at the station (why would they be eating seafood so early in the morning?).  A convicted murderer leads Dangle and Williams to a buried victim.  The dept. keeps a blind man in the restaurant and pretend its a jail by yelling lines like a 1930s African American family.  Highlight:  Wiegel and Rizzo commandeer a tour bus.  Rizzo tells the group he once had a 300 game at a bowling alley they passed.  The commentary has Thomas Lennon and Niecy Nash talking about Raineesha's booty.4. One of my favorite episodes.  Dangle hosts a murder mystery dinner.  Among the guests are Dangle's ex-wife, her other ex-husband and current fiancee (played by ""Kids in the Hall"" comedian Scott Thompson).  She obviously likes guys a little on the peculiar side. Williams plays a mammy and Trudy is supposed to be the victim--things do not work out that way, however.5. Conclusion of the murder mystery where all sorts of gossip comes out about the guests.  Highlight:  Terry is accused of trying on fruit at the produce section of the Piggly Wiggly.6.  A team from the Vatican comes to Reno to determine if the city is worthy of a visit by the pope and the department does whatever it can to discourage the visit.7.  Old videos showing the department back in the day is shown.  Highlight:  Trudy sings a song about blocking bad words on the library search engine (brought tears to my eyes), Jones running out of a meth lab screaming when he is shot at.Disc 2:8. Rizzo harasses a soccer coach to get his kid more playing time.  Junior and Dangle help Mayor Hernandez with a scandal involving a hooker and a drive through. Commentary by Ian Roberts and Joe Lo Truglio.9.  Rizzo and Wiegel are trapped in a moving motor home and love is in the air.  Highlights:  Mario the cute little witness protection dog.  Trudy talking at the end of the episode about what went on in the trailer.  That brought tears to my eyes.  Commentary by Joe Lo Truglio and Kerry Kenny-Silver.10. Dangle's 10-year tribute to the death of Princess Diana is ready for showtime, much to the chagrin of the department.  Wiegel's video will is shown.  Highlight:  Jesus Christ Superstar party.11. The department hires Levon French of the popular Linoleum City commercials to film a recruitment video.  The commentary reveals a real life run-in with the Sparks police.12. Sgt. Declan passes his anger management course, though you wouldn't know it.  Williams and Wiegel try to clean up gang graffiti and get shot at. Junior and Declan are after unlicensed merchandise of Nickelodeon characters.  Rizzo helps a family whose brakes have failed.

1,Each episode of this series is well done and interesting. I am hooked on this series and am dreading it ending. The actors are superb. The casting could not have been better. Foyle is an intelligent and thoughtful person who gets to the truth by being observant of the little things surrounding each case. He also has a soft heart and a determination to do the right thing.
1,edgy characters mixed with a dash of quick witted dialogue makes for a good series. Only wish there was more to come.
1,Happy to have gotten something that my niece likes.  She sings the songs and is always asking to have the disc played on repeat.  I'd recommend this for 2 to 4 year olds.
1,"OVERVIEW:  The premise of ""South Park"" was conceived by creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker in the early 1990s.  Due to its viral-video success, Comedy Central picked up the rights to the franchise and aired the first episode of the adult animated series in 1997.  The cartoon garnered fame as one of the first shows to hinge its comedy on the use of crude language, satirical storylines, and dark humor.  Set in South Park, Colorado, the main characters of the show--Stan Marsh, Eric Cartman, Kyle Broflovski, and Kenny McCormick--often parody the childhoods of their writers.SPECIAL FEATURES of the Season 15 box-set include deleted scenes, ""6 Days to Air:  The Making of `South Park,'"" ""6 Days to Air:  Behind the Scenes of `City Sushi,'"" and ""Commentary-Mini.""  If you have never watched the episodes with ""Commentary Mini,"" I encourage you to do so; the short commentaries from Trey Parker and Matt Stone are optionally run during the first three minutes of each episode.  Parker and Stone have used this method of commentary since the early seasons.  Their short introductions often expose insights behind particular jokes, further multiplying the laugh count.SEASON 15 kicked off in the spring of 2011 with fourteen episodes, each written during the week before broadcast.  In true ""South Park"" style, some of the pop-culture references of this season include:  The Royal Wedding, the History Channel, ""The Matrix,"" U.S./Mexico Border Security, DeVry University, Wiki-Leaks, Steve Jobs/Apple, Asperger's Syndrome, Broadway Theater, ""The Human Centipede,"" Comedy Central's First Annual Comedy Awards, the NCAA, Veganism, and the War on Wall Street.  I have been a fan of ""South Park"" since its beginning and religiously purchase each season; however, I feel that the show's wit and charm has been in a slump since season 14.  While I still find the show highly entertaining, much of the recent comedy has felt `forced.'  I am happy to say that the writing seems to pick back up in Season 16 and is nearly fully-operational by Season 17.EPISODES:  In the middle of the 15th Season, the episode ""You're Getting Old"" gave the implication to many viewers that Stone and Parker may have used the plot as an allegory for expressing their feelings about the direction of the ""South Park"" series.  Because the later seasons failed to impress long-time viewers, the fear of an impending end to ""South Park"" only gained steam.  By the end of Season 15, Comedy Central had announced an extension to Stone and Parker's contract which promises to carry the series into 2016 (Season 20), thus subsiding the worry of dedicated fans.Episode 1:  ""HUMANCENTiPAD""--When Cartman doesn't get the iPad he has been bragging about, he starts a campaign against his mother; Kyle fails to iTunes updates before agreeing to them.Episode 2:  ""Funnybot""--Jimmy names the Germans as the world's least funny people during the school Comedy Awards; Germany retaliates by producing a funny robot.Episode 3:  ""Royal Pudding""--Canadians around the world tune in to watch the royal marriage, as is tradition.  But when the new princess is kidnapped, Canada is left in a state of chaos... as is tradition.Episode 4:  ""T.M.I.""--When the school posts the students' height differentials, Cartman misinterprets the `objects' measured.Episode 5:  ""Crack Baby Athletic Association""--Cartman exploits the entertainment quality of crack-babies, creating a lucrative business venture the Kyle cannot resist.Episode 6:  ""City Sushi""--Big-Rig Butters, Inspector Butters, Marjorine, Professor Chaos, and Leopold Stotch are discovered to have a single unifying quality:  Butters.  To avoid being grounded, Butters must sort out his multiple personality disorder.Episode 7:  ""You're Getting Old""--Stan becomes more cynical with age leading to a breakup with Kyle.  Sharon and Randy separate so Randy can pursue his dreams as `Steamy Ray Vaughn.'Episode 8:  ""Azz Burgers""--Due to an onset of antisocial behavior, Stan is believed to have Asperger's Syndrome.  With Kyle's help, Cartman opens a business called Cartman Burger.Episode 9:  ""The Last of the Meheecans""--In an elaborate came of capture-the-flag, Butters becomes trapped in Mexico and earns the alias `Mantequilla.'  Cartman joins the U.S. Border Patrol to prevent Butters from crossing back over as well as to seal his win.Episode 10:  ""Bass to Mouth""--A gossip website exposes the private e-mails and phone conversations of South Park students; the boys orchestrate a plan to bring the hacker to justice.Episode 11:  ""Broadway Bro Down""--[Episode co-written by Robert Lopez]  Randy becomes a Broadway enthusiast after discovering theater's subconscious effect on Sharon.Episode 12:  ""1%""--Cartman's scores on the Presidential Fitness Test destroy the entire school's average.Episode 13:  ""A History Channel Thanksgiving""--The boys stumble on a conspiracy theory concerning aliens, ghosts, and the first Thanksgiving.Episode 14:  ""The Poor Kid""--When Kenny and his siblings are shuffled into foster care, Cartman becomes the poorest kid in class."
1,"Clearly a great program, just a little odd, and it jumps around from past to present, then present to past. Glenn Close is an absolute evil(you figure out the rest), and scary in this series. There are so many unexpected twist and turns that I spent the weekend watching season 2, don't leave the room put the streaming on hold. Fatal Attraction was just a prelude to this actress' ablilty to play a role."
1,"First met this show in an online preview of Episode One at a nameless competitor. Since I grew up 20 miles from Lunenburg the filming location for this show the hair stood up on the back of my head the moment I started watching it. The views of the harbour are classic and the aerial shots give a whole new perspective on a town I know and love. Camped in Lunenburg this summer up the street from where the Bluenose II is being rebuilt and walked the harbour where Duke's boat lies docked with a for sale sign. Town Hall subs as the police station.Those personal attachments aside the series employs great Canadian actors the two male leads being standouts. Anyone who has gone down to the sea in ships knows that superstition and faith take over when man loses control and despite the most advanced technology man is still powerless to control the sea. Half-million ton ships still plow straight into rogue waves off the Cape of Good Hope and vanish forever. Ships like the Mary Celeste show up sailing themselves with crews that vanished without a trace. Among people who try to make sense of the inexplicable ghosts and hauntings are commonplace. Some of the storylines here begin to strain suspension of disbelief but on the whole are not too far removed from reality. The episode in Season 2 based on the plagues of Egypt taken from Exodus is a case in point. Highly recommended. If it succeeds this show should do wonders for tourism in a World Heritage Community. Weekly it makes me homesick for Lunenburg, Mahone Bay, Chester, and Hubbards."
1,"If I could give you only a single reason to see The Great Buck Howard it would be John Malkovich. As one of the most respected actors working today, Malkovich is probably best known for roles playing a bad guy or, at least, a very angry guy...The role of Buck Howard shows a different side of Malkovich, but it's one that is completely delightful.Colin Hanks plays Troy, who one day decides to quit law school with the intent of becoming a writer. To support himself, Troy must find a job. The opportunity comes along in the form of Buck Howard, a mentalist (""magician is a dirty word"") who in his prime appeared on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson 61 times. Now the Great Buck Howard plays small venues with even smaller crowds. Troy becomes Buck's assistant, quietly observing the man who doesn't seem to realize that his days of being great are behind him.It's a simple, low-budget movie that doesn't have anything profound to say but, none-the-less kept me thoroughly entertained.Emily Blunt, Ricky Jay, Steve Zahn, and Tom Hanks (as Troy's father, go figure) round out the principal cast, but despite solid performances from all; this is Malkovich's show.Yes, he's playing against type but there is a certain amount of joy I got from watching him in this role. Buck is not a multi-faceted character; we only really get a look at the stage persona. Troy knows Buck about as well as we do, but Malkovich allows us to see the passion and frustration of the character, even with it barely there. The man is an absolute marvel, truly one of the finest living actors.Is the film great though? No, it's not. It's not a character study or a laugh-out-loud comedy. It's not even very original and some of it's even predictable. However, it has enough charm and wit to warrant recommending it. Buck Howard is a great character and it is a delightful little movie. Tom Arnold's cameo is almost worth the price of a rental, by itself.The Great Buck Howard is not great, but much like the fictional Buck's show; it's disarmingly funny, charming, and very amusing.GRADE: B"
1,If you have watched the previous 4 seasons you wont be disappointed with season 5. The characters are expanded upon and some new ones are introduced to keep things fresh.
1,The parents were very crazy. They are like stage moms and the kids are very cocky about themselves but I did enjoy the kids performances and the way they performed.
1,"This is one of several programs that explore engineering and construction projects that push the envelope in some way. Taller buildings, deeper tunnels, bridges with longer and wider spans using novel materials or newly- or specially-developed construction techniques are at the core of these programs. Other that run in the same vein are &#34;Extreme Engineering&#34; and &#34;Build It Bigger&#34;."
1,Teen Wolf season 1 is great. I would have liked more episodes. It is a great imaginative show. Teen agers are always getting into trouble. Worth watching.
1,"Season 3 is much easier to use because CBS Video has splurged on the Play All function and subtitles.  I started to like NCIS with the introduction of Cote de Pablo who looks like a cross between Winona Ryder and Salma Hayek.  This is the season with the ""homos on the train"" line."
1,Enjoyed it immensely. And I would highly recommend it to my friends and family. It was well done and very entertaining. The actors were marvelous.
1,"Being geeks and sci-fi/fantasy fans, the wife and I enjoy the humor of the Big Bang Theory and a lot of the &#34;in&#34; jokes, spoofs, cameos, and general chemistry among all the actors and the situations they get themselves into."
0,"This movie was just a live-action cartoon that carried no real sense of peril or logic.  I guess it was sort of fun, in a way, and Hauer is always worth watching.  However, I just found the film to be like many movies that ape the glory days of grindhouse:  these new grindhouse films are more like caricatures of the real thing.  They lack charm, cohesion, and restraint.  I own this movie, it was fun in a shallow, forget-it-ten-seconds-after-it's-over kind of a way, but I really can't recommend it as good cinema."
1,starting with an actor who was noted for military roles and still going on today Dr. Who is part of many of our lives.The original shows were on miniscule budgets and demanded a lot more imagination from the viewers than today's shows.The Aztecs in this show were probably more comfortable on the London Underground than in the Central American jungles but that doesn't matter.The Doctor is a far cry from today's version-  with no real alien identity (two movies had him as definitely an elderly Earthman)- but that didn't matter- kids loved it and more than a couple of their parents too!.A captivating history lesson
1,"Here is a series that is a sleeper. The cast is great - how could you not like Judi Dench, but all English fans will recognize James Carter from Downton Abbey as Capt Brown. Another star is Francesca Annis that plays Lady Ludlow. Watch for the cinematic effect when she appears, especially in her own estate. I would have given it 4 stars until I viewed the last 2 episodes. Not bad for a guy."
1,"The magic behind this show is that it lets you see your life and the people in it and appreciate them for their humor and kindness.  It's not ful frontal comedy with laugh tracks, its about life and seeing the humor in it. All the situations are about Gavin and Stacey (who are great) but the power of the show are their friends and family, people we all know and have in our everyday life.  They are fullly developed characters portrayed without judgement,, from the uncle who loves outdated technology and will go on and on about it to 'Nessa who has lived life to its fullest.  Its also not a chick-flick  and will appeal to men as well as women.  Funny and real."
1,Gave this to a good friend and ordered another for myself.  Very funny!  I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys irony and a good laugh.
1,It may be that aliens are making this show to mis direct us :) but it is a lot of fun :)
1,"If you haven't read the book, you might like this.  Other reviewers have said it all!  I do recommend the book."
1,It is like a variety show for kids that allows them to learn about all kinds of music and diversity.
1,"Although this season of Eureka did not have a particularly strong story arc that carried throughout (the questions of ""the artifact"" are never answered in a satisfactory manner), it really doesn't matter. The show is just so much fun to watch! It's the strength of the characters that makes it shine- Sheriff Carter, Deputy Lupo, Fargo, Zoe, Alison, Stark, and of course, Henry Deacon. It's a delight to see the chemistry that occurs between all these well written characters, as they attempt to save the town of Eureka from a new crisis each episode. Sure, it's pretty formulaic, but that's part of what makes it so good... it's familiar, and comforting, and the formula just plain WORKS.Unfortunately, the resolution on this DVD is not very good (it's old technology, after all), and it's not available on Blu-ray. But if you can stream it from Netflix in HD, it looks fantastic."
1,"A little too quirky sometimes for us experienced TV detective show watchers-- still enjoyable, just outside the realm of realistic. The female partner is, disappointingly, a weak link."
1,"I watched all of these on PBS, bought and watched DVDs of them all, and now have watched them all again.  Of course I read the books years ago also.They never get old.David Suchet is such a perfect Poirot it as if he and Miss Christie were of one mind."
1,Great show only one season though so don't get excited no ending just leaves you hanging but still worth the watch for us conspiracy nuts :)
1,"Freeman was a straight-A student in science, as a kid, and he brings a genuine passion about the importance of science education.  This series does it right, it discusses problems and solutions, and it interviews real scientists and explains what they do and why it's fun.  Far better than the eye candy of ""The Universe"" series.  This is highly recommended as both entertaining and educational."
1,"A prime example of how an excellent idea, exceptional design, award winning props and a promising storyline with a compelling cast can be utterly destroyed by poor directorial & storyline delivery, slow pacing & bad direction (no doubt prompted by misguided producers) while barraging the audience with endless flashbacks in every episode.There is such a thing as too much realism. We all know how slowly things occur in real space but it does not translate to a television audience. The pace should have been quickened quite a bit. The dragging on & on of every scene was painful to watch on DVD. I can only imagine how slowly it dragged in weekly episodes with commercials. They spent 3/4 of an entire episode just reeling in the tether of a stranded astronaut. Also the suit limitations on the last episode were preposterous to make such an ordeal for such a short distance. We have better technology in our homes. How about an all metal tractor vehicle or remote fetch device. Yes, even in that heat & pressure. That was downright aggravating just on stupidity for lack of tech device capabilities. It should be about using innovations to overcome defeat. Not the failings of technology. Just because NASA cant get things right doesn't mean our TV series have to follow suit. NASA & DOD have Compartmentalization & isolation creating stupid mistakes & dampening creativity. Our TV series can do better by sharing ideas & inventing impressive solutions & new hi-tech ideas to thrill the audience. Not make them groan with defeat. The TV Show should lead the way. Not follow failures.There is also a limit to flashbacks. This show exceeded the tolerance after the first two episodes & actually confused the audience when they couldn't tell which timeframe they were watching. But they continued these flashback fillers on every painful episode to the very last scene. A Sci fi show needs a quicker pacing crammed with the best & latest technology perceivable. It does not need a weekly disaster. Any soap opera can keep an audience interested 5 days a week for decades. If they can find material, there is no excuse for lack of innovation for a weekly scifi. Finally, any of the 4 main networks are death to a Scifi series. Take it to syfy or UPI or Ion or Tru TV or TLC. Anyplace but the 4 old fogy networks. Remember? The ones who killed Star Trek? Do you really think they learned their lessons? We still hold a grudge against the big 3 for their rigid mindset nearly 50 years later. Why would you waste any decent show idea on blockheads like that? They don't deserve nor have the intelligence to recognize a good program when they see it. The 4 networks only still exist as a source of local news & for the few people who can't have satellite or cable broadcast channels.Another major fopah is Nadia, the inappropriate female sexual harasser. This may have been ok in the 70's but no one has tolerance for sexual harassment especially in the workplace. It is against the law & is heavily lectured against by all corporations. There is zero tolerance for this behavior by either gender. It isn't cute nor appreciated by the audience. She would have been fired & in jail for her behavior. The audience has zero tolerance of this behavior. I don't know what dinosaur created her, but they have no business involved in creating a TV series.Revamp the show. Quicken the pace, fire the writers & directors. Hire the techno-geeks from Eureka & some of their writers & directors. Combine the two show concepts. Create some science experiments & inventions gone wild. More personal issues & interactions without creating an orgy. More space encounters: meteors, UFO's paralleling & checking them out; dogfights with ET (there should be more than one type of ET besides the singing Beta which the other ETs are interested in without creating some alien battle show. Just a moderate, gentle-mix like our real ISS has to deal with. They Appear with curiosity but don't directly interact.There are also maintenance & other tasks to be written into the story. But no weekly disaster. Just repairs, technology & personal interaction with stress. The Donner Zoe love story should be encouraged. The pace must be a lot faster. No vague mysteries dragging along week after week. These Beta etc. must do something much more meaningful & impressive each week & communicate without this constant Negative guilt Complex. Get rid of these guilt themes. Stop dragging down the audience. Be uplifting. hopeful. Technological. Get away from that theological theme. It must be immensely positive & special powers from it for the crew. Perhaps genetic improvements like spontaneous healing or telepathy. Perhaps a miracle star child for Donner & Zoe by regenerating their reproductive systems & raising their child on the journey. No more guilt sequences for either the space crew or ground crew. That negative element must cease.Revamp the show & take it to the other cable networks. It is still salvageable with a faster pace, much more tech & extremely limited flashbacks.You will also need an award winning theme song which captures the attention of anyone who hears it. It must be a catchy, recognizable tune which you will find on nearly all top TV Series. This current theme sounds like a cat randomly walking over a keyboard. This is not a top series theme song. This is not a theme song at all. It is irritating noise.If you make these changes & improvements you can still sell this show to another cable network & make it work. But you must be prepared to show them you are quickening the pace, dumping the flashbacks & female sex addict, while beefing up the technology & redirecting this into a tech solutions team, with a super science geek, aspiring love story, exciting space occurrences & discoveries with a dynamic, memorable theme song.That is how you can make a second go at selling this idea."
1,"The feel of the show is terrific.  The sets look authentic.  Just when you think that show MIGHT be going off track and too deep into a subplot, it resolves the issue and is right back on track.  Too many of today's shows start out really well then begin to wonder around aimlessly for a few seasons then die off, i.e., Under The Dome."
1,"I think the show is adorable.  My 18-month-old daughter watched it for a bit, but quickly lost interest.  Maybe I'll try again when she's a bit older."
0,"Not even worth while renting.  All the reviews seem to be written by those who have some vested interest in the film.  A lot of cheap movie shots of Mexico somewhere and homes still not repaired from Hurricane Katrina event.  Standard boy meets girl who is already engaged but ends up not wanting to getting married to her husband to be, but falls in love with the guy she has the adventure with.  Like the last Titanic movie disaster.  I waste a lot of time watching movies, and this was very much of a waste of time.  The final seen of the monsters is some kind of land walking Octopus types with a lot of extra arms, which could not exist on land.  The Octopus type body is made only for a water environment and could not move on land.  And these monsters were not all that distinct.  The monsters do a lot of guttural and screeching sounds.  Very stupid.  At the end you have the two main actors staring at these monsters with mouth open wonderment."
1,This episode will have you laughing throughout. The MST3K crew does a great job at riffing this 80s B-movie. This is a great place to start if you want to get into MST3K.
0,"This show is plain dumb and not funny. It is sad how much TV comedy has deteriorated. Gone are the days of fantastic shows like Seinfeld, Cheers, Frasier, Everybody loves Raymond, Tool time etc. And they are replaces with shows like this one, with 2 dimensional stupid characters, bad acting and idiotic writing, where sleazy behavior is supposed to be funny. It is not!!!The 3 guys characters all have exactly the personality; all unlikeable, dumb, juvenile, infantile, sleazy and lack any redeeming qualities, and the girl is the same shallow personality in female version.The stories all have the same theme; juvenile pursuits of cheap thrills like one night stands (referred to as ""banging"") or getting quick cash without effort. And to get these thrills these 4 characters and even the father in season 2 are willing to do anything; ""banging"" the other guy's mom, selling alcohol to minors, threatening people with Jihad terror attacks, cheating the welfare system etc.The 4 characters plus the father are supposed to be business partners and friends, but all they ever do is screw each other over. With friends like these, who need enemies?YUK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Amazed to see that show is based on actual records, etc. Interesting to see how far medical procedures has come and how barbaric it once was."
1,"This first season had a handful of strong episodes.  Intriguing premise, though you get the feeling the momentum can't be maintained long-term.  There's a LOT of cat-and-mouse, which can get old if you binge-watch, but it's very well-made and scripted.The only thing missing is the ""wow"" factor, making it not all that memorable.  But if you love sci-fi and are looking for something to follow, I'd definitely recommend a watch.  It may have only lasted two seasons, but I watched every single episode as it broadcast, and was disappointed when it wasn't renewed."
1,Got these for my son's birthday. He says they are great! They are funny so give them a try! OK!
0,A guy shows up on the first episode in the nude joking about his dongle.  I'll pass.  I don't need this crap entertainment.
0,"Both my 4 year old nephew, and 5 month old son didn't want to watch this show.  Not meant for entertaining small kids, that's for sure."
1,"But, the overall story seemed a bit predictable.  I really like the Kristen Bell, and she handles the role well, but, overall, it was just okay for me."
1,"The old, old stone mansion that once was an orphanage sits isolated within its ill-kempt gardens and grounds. The abandoned lighthouse on the cliff not far away no longer shines a beacon. The cave below and the sandy beach still receive the incoming tide. Be wary. Laura Sanchez grew up in the orphanage. When she was about seven she was adopted and left. Now she is 37, married to Carlos, and they are parents to a little boy, Simon, about seven. They adopted Simon, who doesn't know this, and who is deadly ill with a disease only pills can keep at bay. Now Laura and Carlos have just bought the abandoned orphanage and are moving in. It is a large building of many rooms and hallways, with dark oak paneling, old fire places and frosted, etched glass. They hope to make it a home for children with special needs. There are no children yet, just Simon.Simon makes friends, make-believe friends. They tell him things, he says. ""I won't grow old. I'm not going to grow up,"" he tells his mother. ""Will you be like Peter Pan?"" Laura asks. ""Like my new friends,"" Simon says. ""There's more than one?"" ""Six."" ""They won't grow up either?"" Laura asks. Simon looks at her. ""They can't,"" he saysSimon leads Laura in a game to discover clues, a game he and his friends have invented. Suddenly the game is foreboding. ""You're not my mother!"" Simon screams at Laura. ""Who told you that?"" she asks, stricken that this little boy, her son, is facing something she and her husband were waiting to tell him when he was older. ""My friend told me,"" Simon says. ""What friend?"" ""Tomas,"" Simon yells, crying and defiant. ""Tomas told me the truth, that I'm just like them.... I have no mother or father and I'm going to die.""Days later, Simon disappears, apparently kidnapped. The parents, with Laura increasingly frantic, try everything to find him. In time, there will only be Laura and this moldering stone mansion where she was raised as an orphan with other orphans. We begin to learn what happened there when Laura as a child left.So...whose imagination, whose story are we inhabiting?""Horror"" is a term that has been debased in the movies over the last thirty years or so. Technology and computers have eliminated most of the need for imagination and the kind of dread we make for ourselves out of little things. Market research drives so many creative decisions into the dead end of splatter and special effects. The Orphanage is just slightly a horror movie. It is lonely, deliberative, sad, thoughtful, even quiet, even, surprisingly, with a degree of contentment at the conclusion.All the actors do fine jobs, and there is a notably quiet and intense performance by Geraldine Chaplin as a psychic whose own death is near. It is Belen Rueda as Laura who helps make this movie something special. There are so many opportunities for intense ""acting,"" distraught ""acting,"" tearful ""acting."" Rueda does nothing of this. We believe her as Laura because she doesn't try to over-dramatize Laura. Laura is often intense and sometimes distraught. She also puzzles through this mystery, is determined to find her son and can take action. But Rueda never overacts. Thanks to Rueda's performance and fine directing and screenwriting, I think The Orphanage establishes itself as an unusual and intriguing movie.The audio and video transfers are very good. There are some typical ""How we made the movie"" extras. If you have a taste for unusual and unsettling stories, I recommend you tryThe InnocentsandThe Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)."
1,"It was rough enough for the fans of NCIS to lose Kate Todd by having Ari Haswari snipe her at the end of Season 2.  So, starting Season 3 off by showing Kate's murder from Ari's POV is a little rougher.  But the two episodes that start off Season 3 of NCIS--the two part ""Kill Ari"" episodes--really bring up a subject in this series that hadn't been fully fleshed out.  Obviously, these two episodes allow the regular characters to come to grips with the loss of Kate--the irony of Kate's ghost talking to Ducky and Ducky not talking back to the ghost, the overall story of how the survivors all see Kate.  McGee seeing a superwoman, Abby seeing Elvira, Tony being Tony in seeing Kate (That schoolgirl outfit), and Gibbs seeing Kate as he last saw her--with a hole between her eyes.  Just as obviously, ""Kill Ari"" allows for the introduction of Cote De Pablo's Ziva David, the Mossad/Masada agent liased to NCIS in the wake of Kate's death and Lauren Holly's Jenny Sheppard--Gibbs' former partner/lover who rose beyond working the field to the NCIS director's job.But my observation after a couple of viewings of this box set is that the underlying story of the season is the revelations about the history of Leroy Jethro Gibbs.  For much of the first two seasons, Mark Harmon's ""tough, no-nonsense investigator"" (To quote the liner notes on the set) has always had an understated sense of humor that has allowed him to smile quitely at the office interaction between the members of the team while presenting his harder face.  But that exterior begins to crack in the ""Kill Ari"" episodes; the mystery surrounding Jethro's background begins to unfold as Ari murders Kate, then takes his shot at Abby and captures Dr. Mallard.  This is what starts leading Jethro to being close to Ziva--maybe no one notices, but because of the information that she uncovered about Jethro and fed to her half-brother Ari, Officer David feels partially responsible for Kate's murder.Through Season 3, we start getting clues to who Jethro is and what he keeps from everyone--the flask that we see at the end of ""Under Covers"", his continued attraction towards redheads (It certainly is no coincidence that Holly/Sheppard is a redhead), and the subtleties of his relationship with Ziva--forged in an oddly shared tragedy.  Of course, much of all that goes on in the season comes to a head in the ""Hiatus"" two-parter at the end of the season.  We find out why Gibbs is what he is, how many of his actions have prepared DiNozzo for running the team and prepped Tim for being an agent; and how the discoveries affect his relationship with Dr. Mallard and Director Sheppard.As always since this series started, the performances are stunning.  Mark Harmon continues to embody the toughness and instincts of Jethro, but also had to be very nuanced as Gibbs' painful history comes out.Michael Weatherly's Tony DiNozzo continued being the second coming of David Addison (my usual Moonlighting aside), but Tony had to face growing up and being a decision-maker/leader (""Bait""), and had a difficulty through this season that he hadn't had in the previous two--ZIVA.Cote De Pablo flipped the dynamic of the team.  As Ziva, Cote brought a much more formidable presence to the squad.  In the first two seasons, Tony could get Kate off-balance with his remarks and his stunts, offending her Catholic schoolgirl sensibilities.  In the third season, Ziva--partially because of her background, partially because it was just HER--was able to get Tony off his feed more than he thought possible.  An example of this--aside from her driving, or her mangling of slang--came up in ""Probie"", when she was able to get Tony to reveal why he was receiving calls from a sperm bank.  De Pablo was able to affect a very cool and very canny customer in Ziva.  Many viewers are always going to miss Sasha Alexander, but Cote is a wonderful fit.Sean Murray's Tim McGee is still a wonderful work in progress; the nerd-boy field agent who continues to get tortured by DiNozzo in a big-brother/little-brother fashion.  He still seems over his head at times, eager to please Gibbs (Or at least keep Jethro from popping him one in the back of the head--isn't it funny how The Head Slap has become one of the show's many trademarks?).  Plus, there's whatever seems to be going on in his private life, whether or not it's with Abby.Of course, what can be said about Pauley?  Perrette is a scene-stealing wonder on screen, especially in Abby's lab when she's mainlining the ""Kaff-Pow"" or getting Bert to do what he does (Her stuffed hippo--YEAH, THAT ONE).  Plus, we get surprised by Abby's ability with duct tape (""Frame Up"") and her temper in general (""Bloodbath"").David McCallum's Dr. Mallard continues to be the second coming of Jonathan Quayle Higgins, though not as prissy as Robin Masters' major domo.  Ducky continues to tell his stories while working his was through the cadavers.  Plus, we get another visit from Nina Foch as Ducky's mom late in the season, getting a surreal moment when she's visiting the NCIS HQ.Many people thought the introduction of Jenny Sheppard as fluff.  Given the underlying story of the season, Lauren Holly's character was actually needed.  Jenny became an insight to Gibbs' relationship issues and why he stays operating as an investigator--basically, she knows certain things about Jethro that his squad aren't privvy to--though as it turns out, she doesn't know the whole story (Until ""Hiatus"").The good guest shots in this set have to start with Sasha Alexander, and her completion of the Catlin Todd storyline.  Her ghost appearing in various forms to the team members was striking (Of course, her schoolgirl outfit in Tony's vision was typical Tony).  Rudolf Martin's Ari Haswari was brilliant--slick, dangerous, deceptive and unstable.  I found myself regretting Ari's storyline being completed--he could have been Wo Fat to Gibbs' McGarrett (Hawaii Five-O reference).  It's always fun when Jessica Steen drops in to trade remarks with Weatherly as Paula Cassidy.  Michael Bellisario's turn as Abby's lab assistant is a comical and dangerous turn.  Finally, we can't forget Muse Watson's introduction in the ""Hiatus"" episodes as Gibbs' mentor when he joined NIS, Mike Franks.  Franks' amusement at the changes--the female director in particular--are tempered by his having to fill in many of the blanks for Gibbs when Jethro is recovering from amnesia.Ultimately, the season of change that is NCIS Season 3 is a storytelling wonder--full of the humor and action that has been the staple of the series since it's beginning, but also the undercurrent of melancholy that permeates this season.  The loss of Kate really becomes the latest in a series of painful losses for Gibbs--but we never realize it until the end of the season."
1,"I didn't know what to expect when I first started watching this series, but now I am hooked. I love the characters they have created and the story lines they supply.  Definitely worth watching."
1,You may think you are just watching a reality show but a lot of history walks through the door.  The experts take the time to explain everything you need to know.  The whole family loves the show.  It is fun to guess what stuff is worth before the experts settle it.
1,"This is part of a series that would be so much better if they didn't create narration and characters &#34;for dramatic purposes&#34;...Isn't murder and the case surrounding it dramatic enough without making up stuff? Production quality is good and this case (and others in the series) are interesting, but the fictionalized sections take away rather than add to the video."
1,"Outside of one big change, much is the same on season seven of this hit show.  Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) is still obsessive, compulsive, and phobic.  But he is still able to consult for the SFPD and help old friends Randy Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford) and Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) solve difficult cases thanks to the help of his assistant Natalie Teeger (Traylor Howard).What has changed is his psychiatrist.  After the death of actor Stanley Kamel, Dr. Kroger was also killed off, giving us a great case for the first episode.  Monk is desperate to get away from a song that reminds him of Dr. Kroger, so he buys a house, only to find out about a mysterious death that took place there.  Joining the cast in that episode is Hector Elizondo as Monk's new doctor, Dr. Bell.From there, things settle down to normal.  Or as normal as you can have it for Monk.  Monk and Natalie get trapped on a submarine.  Monk takes on a chess master who might have committed the perfect crime.  Stottlemeyer witnesses a miracle and becomes a religious monk.  Monk makes friends with his neighbor, only to find she's a murder suspect.  In the only development relating to Trudy's murder, Monk attempts to keep the parking garage where she died from being turned into a park.And I have to mention my favorite episode of the season.  The special 100th episode is full of fun.  Yes, Monk solves a new case.  But the episode also features appearances by quite a few people we've met over the course of the show so far.  It was very funny and a very clever way to mark the momentous occasion.Unfortunately, this season is as uneven as the previous season was.  Yes, I still enjoyed it.  But the comedy and tender moments aren't as natural or real as they have been in previous seasons.  Actually, the first half started strong.  It was the second half where things fell into predictable molds once again.  The writers seem to be running out of steam and going for the cheap laugh over the real character moments that make this show for me.  Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the season.  It just wasn't as strong as it could have been.The show is slipping from its peak, which makes me happy that this was the penultimate season.  It's still good, but it has been better."
1,Have enjoyed the unexpected turns that this series takes - very unexpected - which keeps my interest! Have enjoyed watching it all in order!
1,"I gave this TV show 3 stars mainly because of the awful OVER THE TOP sound effects and awful, hip hop music score. I had to mute or lower the ""Drama Music"" and cringe over the rest.The use of the sound effects is way too much and is used to over compensate for the lack of ""scary"". I wish they would give up on the scary part and focus on story/script (since that's what makes shows truly scary not music). This is a typical, unrealistic teenage life show with a little Sci-Fi/ Wolf thingy involved. I like the main characters. OH how I feel sorry for GEN Y. Our music generation in movies/TV was 1000% better. The father of ""Allison"" I have seen in way too many other TV shows ie: The Secret Circle among others.. heeds the need for new talent in U.S. Acting scene is at desperate proportions now-a-days. Otherwise, so far in Season 1 is a fun watch."
1,"I cannot praise this series enough. This is a great example of tight and taunt script writing and acting. A man on the brink and flirting with self-destruction is brilliantly portrayed by Idris Elba and his supporting cast. If you want gripping engrossing and fast paced TV drama .. this one is absolutely for you. I have watched all available seasons (on this and other sites) at least twice, (this one thrice) and enjoy it as much each time I watch. Idris Elba is an acting talent, or rather a force, that can rarely be equaled."
1,"This was just the most exciting season ever, I became truly addicted to it and watched the whole 22 episodes in a matter of three days. I loved the plot, the characters, the individual scenes, everything and just wish there was more."
1,"unfortunatley, I seem to be watching the seasons out of order (i can get several seasons on amazon, other ones from different places) - but the season is great - good twists & change-ups - now just get amazon to make all the seasons available..."
1,"I admit that I found myself caught up in the TV whirlwind that is Bones.  But with good reason a show that focuses on solving crimes via skeletal remains mixed with humor, sorta romance and danger.  It all equals a wildly addictive TV show that has you coming back for more with each episode watched.It stars David Borenaz and Emily Deschanel as partners working together.  Along Dr. Brennan and her crew of coworkers who are just as important to the show as the two stars in it.  All kinds of things take place in the 2nd season with more storylines resolved and new ones opened up.  They are just as addictive and compelling as the first season and they even have an addition to the team as a whole in a new director (Tamara Taylor) for the Jeffersonian.I love the way the season progresses with the different members of the team reaching new personal goals and other things (marriage (sorta), promotion).  It's exciting to see a show this good actually stick around for more than a minute.  I can only hope that Season 3 picks up right where this season ended on a very high note and full of possibilities this time around.  That i'm sure will have even more people flocking to check out this all around well written, directed and acted show in Bones."
1,"I never saw the Morse series when it was on TV, only heard it referenced in the INSPECTOR LEWIS series.  I finally decided that I needed to see the orginal.  It wears well in spite of the number of years since it was made, just like Morse's car !  I am encouraged to find DVD's of other series featuring Mr. Thaw as I hope they will continue to quality.  Also, the location of Oxford is marvelous.  I got the companion DVD MORSE's OXFORD for a closurte look - I will never be able to visit Oxford in person, but felt like I had a nice private guided tour after watching this."
0,I don't want to say that this movie is snobbish but I'm having a difficult time trying to see it any other way.Here's the scoop. It's set in Manhattan and all involved are upper crust professionals. Knightley is married to Worthington. She's a freelance writer for magazines and  he's in commercial real estate development. She finds out he has a real hot co-worker (Eva Mendez) and is upset because he's never mentioned her. Sam heads off on a business trip with Eva and another co-worker and while he's gone Kiera runs into an old flame. Both are tempted and this deals with how they deal with the temptation.I couldn't muster any real sympathy for these people. It's not that I didn't like them but it seemed that there was too little at stake for any of them. All could make a living in their own right. There are no kids involved. None of the relationships have a lot of years attached and none of the relationships are without their blemishes. What if this were set in some blue collar town and the husband and wife were just scraping by and had a lot of concerns in their day to day and some number of young kids in tow? This I think who mean more to the average viewer. And what is the writer/director saying here in that Worthington crosses the line in a big way where Knightley just tip-toes over the line. She was the one with unfounded fears and jealousies where he never doubted her for a moment? Is she less guilty than he?!This is all very professional. All the acting and production values are top shelf. It's just that there seemed to be too little gravity to it. Even when Mendez spills her guts it didn't want to hit home. Sorry. I can't recommend this.
1,"Allow me to preface this review by saying that I'm not a huge fan of Star Trek.  I don't hate it by any stretch, but the sheer volume of information in the Star Treklexiconis both intimidating and exhausting.  I do absolutely adore science fiction and I know full well Star Trek's place and significance within the genre.  It was perhaps even more palpable to viewers like me that the 2009 re-boot of the original iconic crew of the USS Enterprise be placed in the very capable hands of a hugely imaginative filmmaker; J.J. Abrams.  Abrams is admittedly not a hardcore fan of the series either, but he clearly respects the stories greatly, and I think that gave him both the ability to take risks with these characters as well as celebrate them effectively.  He clearly brought a team as well, and is at his most generative.  Abrams will likely please hardcore fans as he surrounded himself with informative writers, but they will also please the mainstream fans, while at the same time making money and leaving the chance to create endless sequels wide open for himself, or the rest of Hollywood to indulge on.  As a film Star Trek is indulgent, but its science fiction is fantastic and its seamless visual effects are some of the best I've ever seen.I'm not going to get bogged down by summarizing the story here in order to avoid both spoilers and going off on too many details.  The film works as an origins tale with new actors playing the original crew.  Little known actor Chris Pine plays Captain James T. Kirk as the film's primary character, and does very well for himself in a role that will probably be under tremendous scrutiny.  The film keeps focus on his meeting other crew members such as Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban), Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin), Hikaro Sulu (John Cho), and of course Scotty (Simon Pegg), but primarily focuses on Kirk's interactions with the film's other protagonist; Spock.  In my humble opinion Spock is portrayed brilliantly by Zachary Quinto (who plays the villain in television'sHeroes).  To top it off the film has an outstanding Romulan villain named Captain Nero, played by the always solid Eric Bana.  There are nearly endless supporting roles filled quite eloquently by other known and talented actors and actresses.  This really is a huge production, but it is by no means wasteful.So I am definitely recommending this, and the only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because of a few gratuitous scenes included as comic relief that rubbed me the wrong way but are more or less forgivable.  As far as how it compares to the otherStar Trek films?I found moderate charm in some of those films and I have great reverence forThe Wrath of Khanspecifically, but it's just not even a contest.  This is a different era of visual filmmaking.  I would imagine hardcore fans are pleased but I can't say for sure as I never read other reviews before writing my own, where I know for certain the mainstream appeal is absolutely undeniable.  I'm just thankful this is a fiercely clever film that just also happens to attract the masses."
1,"Cancelled after one season? Excellent acting, plot development, plot, and casting it must have hit too close to home for the current administration, and was killed off. Watch it and I think you will agree."
1,This is the way to watch TV. Interesting take on a very back holler community and a no frills gun slinging US Marshal that just keeps the good stories rolling.
1,"One of my favorite survivors: likeable and interesting characters, big plays, and plenty of hilarious moments from the Dragon Slayer aka coach aka who knows his birth name."
1,"I loved is early 1900 version of &#34;ER&#34;  As a history geek I liked the peek at the realities of health care at that time, and the acting and drama just kept me wanting more"
1,"The main character here is  a lot like the character HOUSE, AND HE IS JUST AS GOOD AT HIS JOB. INTERESTING STORIES W ITH INTERESTING PEOPLE."
1,My toddler luvs to dance and sing along with the yo gabba gabba gang. Cool tricks! Cool tricks! Go crazy!
1,This is just one of the best true crime shows I have ever watched.  I love every episode.  No wild speculations or weirdo psychic frauds just straight facts about interesting missing persons cases.
1,"Okay, I got &#34;hooked&#34; in amazon.com prime viewing Veronica Mars 10 years after this program first aired, and in the interest of those who were and are like me, late to the program, I won't provide spoilers. That being said, I'm really so into this major plot line that I did jump ahead to the grand finale, and now I am watching all the 2nd and 3rd seasons the way one eats popcorn or salted peanuts--I hate having to stop watching and go on to real life. I find that no matter what episode I watch, there is a great deal of continuity of story line, characters that Veronica's sleuthing bring to life, and there is such genuine warmth between the father-daughter pair that make this series worth the time and trouble to watch. You could label me the &#34;mountain girl who finally had time to see old TV shows worth saving&#34;, oh but perhaps too trite. Anyway, what keeps me into this story is the completeness of every episode, and the way the final episode wraps up the characters very nicely. It keeps you guessing right to the end, no matter how many mysteries you've see on TV or in the movies. Sorry that this is one for the history books. Well written and acted."
1,"My granddaughter loves this show, and wants to watch it every opportunity she gets!  Of course, she, and her stuffed toys/animals/dolls, get to enjoy it with her! :-)"
1,Love this show me and my husband watch this together. He is really picky when it comes to television. I &#60;3 Jax
1,"I own the whole TV series from 10 years ago. I loved her character, a great female role model for the teenage/young adult set. She's smart, resourceful and I love a good detective story because I'm a super sleuth myself so I felt a kinship with her character. I could totally be a detective. While chicks were watching vacuous reality OC shows back in the day, I was more into watching the smart girl kick butt and solve mysteries. The movie was fun to watch for someone who obsessed over the TV series, but probably not for someone who didn't watch it 10 years or or who vaguely remembers the story lines. It was fun to see all the regulars again. The movie was a bit contrived and dorky but I loved it anyway. I would watch the next one if they made one so we can see Veronica and Logan be in love and live their lives together. Also, did Gia die? That wasn't clear."
1,"I'm officially addicted to this show...great character building, great storylines, and love these actors! Can't get enough of this show...."
1,"instead of thinking that Japanese message they intercepted was a trap to lure more naval personnel into the area, they should have tried to make contact with the USS Indianapolis and then if contact failed they should have immediately launched a search and rescue mission.secondly the ship was overdue, and still no contact was made by the navy with the USS Indianapolis, nor any search and rescue enacted.this was a case of many innocent sailors dying because the Navy did not care enough to follow through.too many navy personnel died while other navy personnel ignored their cries for help.what was never discussed was who from the navy who ignored the above,  and were they ever prosecuted and found guilty?too many unanswered questions which deserve answers now, and i hope we finally learn all the answers to the above concerns.too many navy personnel died while other navy personnel ignored their cries for help.lastly the naval officer they said was guilty of negligence, while all survivors said he did everything to keep them all alive and went above and beyond, but nevertheless the navy made him feel so guilty he ended up killing himself.......now that i call grave naval injustice, and a loss of the life of an exemplary naval officer, who went through hell on earth in the sea but still managed to keep many crewman alive to be rescued."
1,I just love the series. It's very interesting and gripping to see these detectives work cases. Great show to watch.
1,"TWO LOVERS is an intimate film that requires that the viewer can identify with or at least care about the characters it depicts.  Otherwise this is a pretty dark film with few moments of light to redeem the rather depressing story.  It is a verismo style contemporary tale of choices made by vulnerable and rather weak people living life in a closed world.Brighton Beach, Brooklyn is the shadowing decaying setting where we first meet Leonard (Joaquin Phoenix) making a delivery for his father's dry cleaning business, deciding instead to jump off a bridge in suicidal dejection: Leonard is a lost soul, bipolar to boot, a wannabe photographer who has just been crushed by the end of a relationship (both partners decide that marriage won't work because they both carry the gene for Tay-Sachs disease, a fact that would prevent their having healthy children).  Salvaged by passersby, Leonard proceeds to his parent's (Isabella Rossellini and Moni Monoshov) apartment, the setting for a careful preparation of Leonard for taking over the family business.  A potential buyer has a daughter Sandra (Vanessa Shaw) and  the plan is to have Leonard marry into the new family for business reasons.  At the same time Leonard meets Michelle (Gwyneth Paltrow), a young woman caught up in the throes of an affair with a married man.  Leonard must decide between the beautiful Michelle and the available Sandra and the film deals with all the problems of this critical moment in the life of Leonard who is ill-equipped to make any semblance of reasonable decisions.Many viewers will want to endure this dreary love story simply to see the 'last film' of Joaquin Phoenix, and while the performances are uniformly good, the story itself is the problem.  Life is bumpy, yes, but there are usually occasional moments of light to relieve the tension.  Grady Harp, July 09"
1,"If I didn't live in Portland, I might not watch this as regularly as I do. It's okay. The quality wavers between a notch above and a notch below most contemporary sketch comedy, though the characters are generally well done -- caricatures that are right on target. Armisen is good in his roles, while Brownstein is less so. The main shortcoming of the program is the shortcoming shared by most current-day comedy: An emphasis on the situation itself rather than on specific quanta of humor. Fifty years ago, the basic unit of comedy was the joke. Optimum execution of the joke put a premium on delivery and timing. Today, however, the joke has largely died out, replaced with the overall situation as that-which-is-to-be-considered-funny. This shift in focus has changed humor from a well-defined verbal/mental exercise to an amorphous display which the audience is to perceive as funny. As a result, delivery and timing are neglected. Moreover, if it's the situation itself which is presumed to be funny, then the corollary is that more of the situation is going to be more funny. All this is a roundabout and perhaps clumsy way of saying that many of the skits just aren't that humorous or witty to begin with, and that they sometimes go on far too long. Too often, the vibe of the show is, ""Watch us because we're funny,"" rather than really being funny. Still, it's diverting enough most of the time. I do still watch it, after all."
1,"The movie is riveting and holds strong all the elements of the original Star Trek series and movies.  It begins with an attack of an amazing outside-the-box Romulan Ship with a tattooed seethingly evil Captain Nero (Eric Bana).After the attack, one of the survivors, the infant James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is shown as a wild risk taker growing up in Iowa.  He rides wild clunker cars and has no fear.  Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) meets Kirk as an adult and recommends that he join the Starfleet.  This gives him the opportunity to meet Spock (Zachary Quinto) and all the familiar faces in the Star Trek fictional universe.The cast is top notch and their acting shows they have studied the history of the series.  Character essence flows well and gives great satisfaction - like comfort food for the soul.The action and story are fabulous - nothing too long or drawn out - just enough.  The movie is top notch."
0,"Very depressing the entire time, yes it's suspenseful and has a great cast, but there wasn't a silver lining or even the smallest joke."
1,"I am recommending all of season 5 of this series, not just one episode.Denis Leary's enflamed New York city firefighter Tommy Gavin is back. I find Tommy Gavin an interesting character but at times it is frustrating that nothing of Denis Leary the stand-up comic with the zingers at the ready and the educated man (MFA from Emerson college) shows through. I suppose this shows Leary's commitment to Gavin as a character.Perhaps more than any other factor, what shows in this season is Gavin as a substance abuser, an alcoholic. He is in AA and he is out of AA. He fights with the priest constantly about their problems with alcohol. The other firemen open a bar and he gets involved with it and drinking there. His girlfriend allows him to drink but his wife does not. An unrecognizable Michael J. Fox does a brilliant job of playing Gavin's wife's new boyfriend who is wheelchair bound. He and Gavin briefly bond as maimed characters on just about every level, including substance abuse. It's hard to upstage Leary but Fox manages it. I was sad that Fox did not become a permanent character on the series but I suppose he was not interested in doing tv long term. Maybe they can bring him back next season for a few episodes as well since he was not killed off.Gavin the firefighter is also on considerable display in this season. Perhaps his inability to conquer his inner demons is what makes him courage personified with rescuing people in burning buildings. He can even cope with burned bodies which other firemen can't face without becoming ill.The least satisfying aspect of this series is Gavin's continuing problems with his girlfriend and his wife and the other few women who briefly alight in his life. I can't stand either the wife or the girlfriend as characters and would be happy if somehow they were eliminated from this series. I wish they would bring back Tatum O'Neal more, Gavin's sister. At least she was a female character with whom we could sustain interest.Of the other firefighters, Sean is the most interesting one in this season because he gets cancer (probably from 9/11 exposure) but must get surgery on the sly because he wants to remain in the fire department as a fighting fireman. We also discover that Sean can SING in some very imaginative dream sequences while he is unconscious. Kenny wants to marry a prostitute and the Chief is married to a promiscuous woman he brought over from Russia. This seems very strange to me and I have no idea if this bears any relationship to what choices real firefighters would make as to women to marry. That they are able to convince themselves that they can reform these women is black comedy."
1,"I reviewed Season 5 in detail but I will tell you that if you like cop shows be prepared for some dirty cops in this one, even though they have a good side also.  Vick and his crew go about catching the bad guys with no holds barred and there is no such thing as PC to them.  They do, however get the job done where others would probably not.  Absolutely the best cop show my wife and I have ever watched."
1,The writers have brought in new characters which keeps the series interesting while slowly revealing background on the main characters to give the viewer a better appreciation of why they behave as they do. Not every episode will wow you but many will and they do manage some interesting surprises and comedy along the way.
1,"This is a series which has a nice twist to the run of the mill hard guy private investigator series. The main character is Vincent, a former detective with Scottland Yard, who is your typical hard guy, chip on his shoulder, private investigator. But there is a twist, he is going through a rough personal crisis, losing the women he loves to another guy, which causes him all kinds of struggles through out each investigation. This twist makes him very human and makes the series different from the rest. If you enjoy both a good private investigator series and a good drama series, you will enjoy this series."
0,"Originally contracted for a cable network, it contained such massive inaccuracies that the network wouldn't show it. Seriously, though, Katie Holmes as Jackie Kennedy Onassis? Greg Kinnear as JFK? I like Kinnear, he does good light comedy, but that's not what's called for here. Don't waste your time unless your ideology needs support."
1,"""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"" is a 1970's crime movie, with great dialogue, acting, and intrigue. The movie reminded me of ""The Sopranos"" more than classic film noir. ""Eddie Coyle"" is more realistic and subdued than a lot of noir. It also has a lot of criminals interacting: pulling capers, making deals, and distrusting each other, like some of the criminals in ""The Sopranos"". It's centered more on the interaction of the characters and the story than on action. There are several great scenes, where the dialogue and the acting are engaging, particularly when Robert Mitchum speaks. I've never been a fan of Robert Mitchum, but here he's excellent, bringing a lot of emotion and weariness to Eddie Coyle. The story is also very good, as we see Eddie struggle to stay out of jail. The DVD is from The Criterion Collection, and looks good. There is a new commentary track from director Peter Yates. I don't think this film will appeal to a wide audience, because it's completely a crime film and nothing else, but fans of crime films might thoroughly enjoy it. Reviewed 8/23/2009 after watching on DVD."
1,"This was one of my favorite shows, but I truly feel that the writers strike during the second season of the show did it in. It never regained its mojo."
1,This is one of the few History channel shows that actually discusses history. It's generally filled with interesting trivia. Highly recommended.
1,"If you're reading this you either are 1) a fan of the show 2) want to know more about it to see if it will appeal to you. Michael C. Hall (""Six Feet Under"") plays Dexter a vigilante serial killer. By day Dexter works as a splatter analyst in the police department using blood patterns to help determine exactly how a crime occurred.We have a true anti-hero as the focus of the series--a serial killer who almost seems to have a conscience because he focuses on dealing out justice (and focusing his urges)to those he feels are evil. His father a police officer instilled a code to help him direct his ""urges"" and distinguish between good and evil.Showtime has attempted to improve the quality of their shows and their DVD releases with some mixed results. I found the image quality to be anything but subpar for a DVD. It's a very good transfer. Is it high definition? No, but this isn't an HD-DVD and the quality for a standard DVD is very good although there are some digital compression issues that crop up occasionally.The one complaint I have is simple--no chapter indexing where you can see specific scenes for each episode. Sure you can skip through it by hitting the next button but it's kind of unusual in this day and age for new shows to NOT have this. The second is minor and others have pointed it out--the menu is a very basic design that looks like it could have been done by an amateur.You also have to reset audio for each disc as you watch it for 5.1 as it automatically defaults to 2.o. To be sure many of these are minor points but they do contribute to the enjoyment of the show if handled well.The special features are an improvement over some previous Showtime series but far from perfect. We get two episodes of the excellent Showtime drama ""Brotherhood"". We also get ""Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation"" a very good featurette that focuses on splatter analysis and what it reveals about a murder. It ties in to ""Dexter"" because that's what Dexter does for a living on the show and it also helps him to break a number of cases. We also get a commentary track that I haven't listened to yet as well as an online link to watch two episodes of the new Showtime series ""The Tudors"" and a pdf file with the first two chapters of the new Dexter novel. I suspect that ""The Academy of Blood: A Killer Course"" is along with the DEXTER novel excerpt buried in the DVD-Rom portion of the disc. You won't be able to watch it or access it on a regular DVD player which is just plain sloppy as this isn't indicated on the package.We also get biographies for the actors. While the extras here (including two commentary tracks on the set are very good, the show could have used more commentary tracks and the involvement of star Michael C. Hall on at least one of them. Also, the special features really need to be more clearly indicated as to whether they are DVD accessible, PC accessible and where you might find them on the disc.Minor Plot Spoilers:Dexter's father a police officer recognized early on his son's proclivities and tried to give him moral guidence and boundaries so that he can function in our world but, more importantly, use his ""skills"" to hunt down those that prey on others.Dexter is conflicted--he knows that he's not normal and he also knows he doesn't fit in (he has difficulty with emotions having to fake his way through it). He also recognizes what he is and how his father tried to shape him into something ""better"".When he goes toe-to-toe with the Ice Truck Murderer and tries to track down this nasty serial killer he gets a glimpse into his own soul but also recognizes that unlike his evil doppleganger he can choose his actions and not just act on his instincts.END OF PLOT SPOILERS:Overall, Dexter is a terrific show. The second season has also gotten off to a bold start. The first season used the novel DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER as a starting point. For the second season the writers/producers have chosen to depart from the novels which should make for an interesting move. This is a solid set that could be improved with future seasons."
1,A very solid Doctor Who story with outstanding characterization in the voice work which almost overcomes the very poor to the point of distraction animation! It was still a solid lead and one has to wonder why they did not go forward with more as all they really need do to make this a top notch production was find people who could animate rather than run schematics. Worth your time if you love the TARDIS.
1,Gritty action and lots of it.I detest crooked cops but these guys made you feel for them.Beware lots of blood....
1,"Season 2 was great, just enough side plot to keep us focused on the main plot.  Heros and  villans stepped up and did their parts.  Margo Martindale was great as a criminal overlord of a hillbilly dope empire.This is the second of what has been four great seasons with two great leads(Timothy Olyphant and Walton Goggins) and a fantastic supporting cast.  I have now watched all four seasons and this show is still growing and staying alive and thriving."
1,"This second season is exploring new ways and avenues where bones are of course multiplying at leisure and for our best pleasure. Yet this second season is quite new in several aspects.First and foremost the season is widely open to personal matters and it explores the private, and at times not so private, relations between the members of the team, after the boss has been changed to a woman, which rebalances the sexual ratios. Bones herself is courting and going out with an FBI agent who has temporarily replaced Booth while he was sort of suspended and deprived of a gun after shooting a clown on top of an ice-cream vendor's van. But in the end she will not go through the process completely as far as leaving the Jeffersonian for a life of full leisure and farniente.Zack manages to get his doctorate and to be hired in the job he was holding as an intern because he goes to Angela and begs for help on his  look and manages to become presentable, which means he can now stand in court and testify seriously in a deportment that can carry the agreement of the jury. So far he is no longer obsessed by sexuality but he encounters a great difficulty: he is summoned by the White House to go to Iraq. But this time this reference does not lead to any political dissertation or even cogitation on the subject. Political questions are systematically and carefully avoided in this second season.Jack and Angela are finally realizing they love each other and even decide to get married and they finally find themselves in front of a priest (in fact a black priestess) in some church for the last step when the State Department steps in and reveals Angela is already married in some kind of broom stick over-jumping ceremony. More later, I guess.Booth is entangled in the hands of a British shrink after his shooting the clown on the ice-cream vendor's van and he is a perfect sucker, building a full barbecue for the shrink under the shrink's blackmailing procedure of retaining the document he must sign. This same shrink will also step into Bones' psyche as some kind of private counselor. Agent Booth and Doctor Brennan will not be able to establish some kind of personal relationship, especially since Temperance's father reappears in her life and even saves the situation a couple of times. But he has to be arrested by Booth and be brought to court for his ancient crimes, including the attack against the deputy chief of the FBI, though this one was crooked to the utmost, his lips kissing the heels of his shoes or something like that.Booth reestablishes for a short while a relationship with the new boss of the institute, Dr Camille Saroyan, with whom he had had a liaison some time ago in another life. But that cannot last more than one or two episodes. This is characteristic of all these people: they are unable psychologically or administratively to build balanced and normal relationships. Is it a side effect of their jobs or professions, we can wonder, or simply  personal immaturity?That level of the season blurs out the various crimes and cases they examine and solve. And these cases do not deal with political issues or even with immigration, except one case about some strange Chinese practice of burying the bones of a man with the bones of a woman so that the man has some company on the other side of the road. Most cases are plain simple crimes in America and among Americans. But they often deals with social problems like the mother of a severely handicapped girl: what can the mother do to help her child the genetic victim of a deadly disease that keeps her retarded, even if it is only for a short time before she dies? Some of these questions are crucial: do we have the right to experiment on human beings new treatments that would enable astronauts to reinforce their bones that get highly decalcified due to prolonged sojourn in space?Some of the cases are plain vicious crimes and it is fun to catch the killers who are most of the time not at all the one or the ones we were expecting. Suspense is always with us even if the personal and more sentimental level of this season makes that suspense not as intense as I would personally prefer it to be.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID"
1,"Wonderful music, educational about animals and the kids (and parents) get to learn Spanish as they are entertained. Consistency, repetition and catchy tunes all help to make this a very interactive show. My toddler especially loves learning the names of new animals that Diego, Alecia and Baby Jaguar help to rescue."
1,"Watching the series is sooooooooooo sad. Watching the family talk about their love ones not knowing where they are and what happen to them. You want there to be a happy ending but unfortunately in most cases it's not, I like the show and it's a good show but very sad to see. Would recommend."
1,"I rediscovered Buddy Holly's &#34;Everyday&#34; on the radio in Jean and Lionel's car in Episode 7.  That alone was worth the price of the DVD!  However, I do wish the lovers would kiss one another, or at least say, &#34;I love you.&#34;  The romance is terribly sterile, especially Judy and Alistair.  It is hard to believe they slept together for 9 years and still didn't manage to warm up to each other even once."
1,"I liked this one, it had a good cast, interesting stories, so of course it was cancelled.  Since their moronic name change, it seems that Siffy prefers to produce more &#34;unreality&#34; dreck now, instead of actual Sci-Fi shows! :P"
1,"I watched this without expectations. I mean, it's not actually a Jane Austen story. It's only a mash-up by the greatest stretch of that term. And -- cue the red flags and warning lights -- it's a mini-series.At this point, I think I've watched it at least 10 times. I absolutely LOVE this story, and the characters are wonderful. The casting is sublime.I will never look at Wickham in the same way, again. This is a wonderful spin on his character. In fact, this mini-series takes liberties with most of the characters, and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Alex Kingston (River Song in Dr. Who) presents a wonderfully dimensional Mrs. Bennet. Hugh Bonneville as Mr. Bennet is charming and more sympathetic, as well.If there's any flaw in this, it's that it ended exactly where it should. While that may sound like &#34;where's the flaw...?&#34;, the fact is, I wanted to spend more time &#34;lost&#34; in Austen.Wonderful, and highly recommended for Jane Austen fans who aren't absolute purists about the sanctity of the original story.  This is an adventure for the young woman who falls into &#34;Pride and Prejudice,&#34; as well as the viewer."

1,"The Disappearance of alice Creed is one of those movies that would intice me to watch it if it were on TV but that I really couldn't see myself owning. The reason I say that is because, after watching it, I felt it already blending into the armada of movies that are just so similiar to it.Two men take a room and soundproof it, followed by making it look like ""just another place."" Afterward, they go out and select a woman they had picked out previously - obviously someone that is worth picking out - and kidnap her. Then they ask for their money, some things happen, and everything seems to go a little awry.When reviewing this, I do have to mention that the movie does have some twists that I did not expect to see. There were some things that were hidden in the dynamic between the kidnappers, some things in the kidnapper/kidnappee, and just some things in general. There were also some exciting places in it that would get me to watch it again, and that make me happy to have checked it out. i simply do not know if I would go further and pick it up, because kidnappings don't seem to go beyond the act and the actions that take place between abduction and money (in my opinion - others may love them).As far as this type of movie, however, everything was set yup in ways that worked out well. The plot was bendable but not believeable, the things that happen sometimes make you think that everything could blow up any time, and you really don't know exactly what could happen. The situation is strange as is, and it gets stranger as the events transpire. That makes for good movie watching and the acting propelled it further.As I mentioned, this is not my genre BUT I liked it. I would watch it again so, in a lot of ways, I think that says something. for people who like movies like this, there is not any nudity to speak of, no gore and little violence, but some perhaps questionable material - depending on who you are (it didn't even dawn on me to think of it that way until writing this, however, so it isn't something really off or anything). I'd give it a 4.3 or so, and would perhaps score it higher if I simply liked the type of movie more."
1,I really liked the series and the cast and the story line and like so many other reviewers I am disappointed that there is no second season.  I wish another network would continue with it.
1,Slow getting started but it picked up.  Waitung for season 2 to become available for Prime members.  You will love it.
1,"My three year old grand daughter absolutely loves these, and she learns about all kinds of exotic animals.  When asked, she says, &#34;Diego, please&#34;."
1,I enjoyed it but it is not even close to &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; or &#34;Lark Rise to Candleford&#34;. It is okay to watch but it didn't wow me.
1,"I have watched 2 seasons, not sure if I'll continue. Sometimes I just get plain bored with this show. Really irritates me that they use the show as a commercial for Kia. And the acting isn't all that great.edited: Got the email that my review is on the site; but it is not listed."
1,I liked the people in the show and the plots were different and exciting. It was a good show right up to the end.
1,The cast is great and perfectly cast. I watched the entire 1st season in a week and the second season the following week.
1,This is among my list of favorite shows.  I really appreciate Amazon providing it on Prime.  I would say if you like a good clean mystery show give this a try.
1,"Jaaman returns in what I consider to be his best yet.  I actually like the story and I thought it was well acted and directed.  This is one beautiful looking film and just as brutal.  Jaa is in top form here as he goes through numerous fighting styles including the use of weapons.  The fight that ends the film is incredible and clocks in at almost ten minutes.  Yes, the ending left you hanging but this is part of a trilogy.  Think of it like the ending to Kill Bill 1 and you'll know what I mean.  It's so good they can call it whatever they want, this is now my favorite Jaa film."
1,"2 seasons, really? It started a little shaky but there was enough there to keep a person interested.  Then, season 2, around the 3rd or 4th episode it really hit it's stride and was a 'can't wait for the next episode' show.  Naturally, as soon as it was addictive the network cut off the flow.  Networks need to learn that when they cut off their addicted viewers they go through some horrible withdrawals.  Such unpleasant experiences results in... &#34;never again&#34;.  I've blocked that network from my tv.  If they have a hit show that lasts for more than 3 seasons and get good reviews even of its conclusion I'll watch it in the secondary market... Amazon, Hulu, Netflix, etc.THE SHOW... possibly the most beautiful actress alive, Sarah Shahi plays a &#34;negotiator&#34; Kate at a law firm.  A lawyer who has sworn off &#34;law&#34; per se.  The show has plenty of tension and drama going on with her partner at Reed and Reed... her stepmother (after her father has died), an ex-husband that is an off and on sexual or love/hate interest, who is also in conflict with her as the prosecutor who routinely is a challenge to her professional life.  Kate also has a love hate relationship with a despicable 3rd partner who Kate also has mixed relationship type feelings. Apparently a true Mr. Darcy but you'll never know because this network sucks. All this while each show has the additional drama of Kate trying to negotiate and 'solve' seemingly impossible conflicts where a trial is trying to be avoided. It would still be pretty fun to watch but keep in mind as soon as you really really love this show... it abruptly ends, cancelled, without anything near a conclusion."
1,I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE WATCHED THIS BRITISH COMEDY BUT IT IS JUST AS ENJOYABLE EVERY TIME. IT IS THE STORY OF A YOUNG BRITISH OFFICER WHO FELL IN LOVE WITH A YOUNG NURSE. THE LETTER HE WROTE HER WAS LOST IN THE MAIL; SO SHE ASSUMED HE WASN'T INTERESTED AND THUS THEY LIVED THEIR OWN LIVES.MANY YEARS LATER SHE IS RUNNING A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS AFTER HER HUSBAND DIED AND HAS A GROWN DAUGHTER. HE IS DIVORCED FROM THE WIFE HE HAD IN KENYA AND HAS RETURNED TO ENGLAND. HE IS WRITING A BOOK AND USES HER SECRETARIAL SERVICE. THE REST OF THE STORY IS PURE BRITISH COMEDY AT ITS' BEST.
1,This is the best cop series I have ever seen. The characters as so original. The stories are are so imaginative and not derivative like so many cop shows.  I hated it when I realized I was watching the last episode.
1,"I loved this movie.  It might have had something to do with the fact that Colin Farrell was in it!  It is a sweet love story about a poor fisherman and his daughter.  It was a nice, sweet slow-down movie to watch after all the summer's blockbusters.  I do recommend it!"
1,"As a fan of period movies, I could not miss the Season 1 of ""The Tudors"".  Henry VIII, King of England is known to most as a man who broke from the Catholic Church to become Head of the Church of England and marry six women. Such infamy secured him a place in history, but so was the fact that it was his daughter with Anne Boleyn - Queen Elizabeth I, who was one of the most benevolvent rules of her time.  In any case, season 1 has four DVDs that will entertain you for almost 12 hours.  Perfect time to watch it would be this holiday season.  I was suprised that series had so much sex in it but also the twists and turns about historical background for Henry's decision-making and his pick of the closest advisors on his court is something I wanted to understand better.  Writers do get sloppy towards the end of the series and the language is not as sophisticated as one would expect it to be on the Court of one of the greatest kings of his time.  I find Jonathan Rhys Meyers to be excellent in his role, but perhaps too young to play a king married for 20 years to Queen Catherine.  Maria Kennedy who play Queen Catherine of Aragon, Queen of England is graceful and dignified.  Unlike the actress Natalie Dormer portraying Anne Boleyn.  Ms. Dormer is too coarse and unsophisticated in her role for a someone (like Anne Boleyn)who was witty enought to keep Henry's interest for so long,speak fluent French after being at the French court for many years.  This portrayal of Anne Boleyn is not befitting of a woman who was a mother of one of the most influential queens of the british royal history.  Court politics, intrigues and the switch of loyalties will keep your attention.  The lessons learned are the ones that apply event o today's modern times and that is perhaps the one more reason for having this series so popular.  I cannot wait to see season 2.  Costumes and jewelry are breathtaking."
1,"An excellent program if you enjoy math and science. If not, the characters are fun to follow through the ups and downs of work and college life. You have to love Finehart(?)."
1,"Survivors (2008-10) is a BBC production based on a book by Terry Nation that ran for two seasons, each with six episodes.  The story follows a group of people in Britain, in the aftermath of a worldwide pandemic that leaves few left alive.  This version is the second BBC adaptation of Nation's work, as a series of the same name was also produced in the mid-1970's.The story opens just as a global pandemic goes critical, and kills most of the world's population.  In Britain, Abby Grant (Julie Graham) contracts the virus, but somehow manages to survive.  With her husband and her neighbors all dead, Abby leaves her suburban home to search for her son Peter, who is away at school.  While on the road, Abby meets Greg Preston (Paterson Joseph), and they decide to travel together.  They find other survivors, that include Anya Raczynski (Zoe Tapper) a doctor, escaped convict Tom Price (Max Beesley), playboy Al Sadiq (Phillip Rhys), and Najid Hanif (Chahak Patel), a young boy.Banding together, the group takes up residence in a large house.  They forage for food and supplies from supermarkets, and homes, but somehow don't seem to gather any weapons or many tools.  On one of their forays, they are challenged by another band of survivors, led by a dislikable fellow named Dexter (Anthony Flanagan), who threatens them with a shotgun.  In a lawless world, Dexter seems to exercise some restraint, by not killing anyone.Joined by Sara (Robyn Addison), the group works together peaceably, while Abby often ventures off alone, looking for her son.  Abby finds a high tech settlement being run by Samantha Willis (Nikki Amuka-Bird), a former Government minister.  Willis seems rational, but has radical plans for the rebirth of a new government.  Abby is revolted by Willis' methods, yet strangely does little to dissuade her friends from going to the settlement, while she follows another lead to her son.The group is back together in Episode 5, which unfortunately is one of the low points of the season, as a religious group comes to stay at the house.  Fortunately, matters get back on track in the season finale, as Samantha Willis arrives at the house, and with Dexter as her aide, she attempts to implement more of her distorted vision.  The season closes violently, as Abby falls into the hands of a mysterious group, who will assume a major role in Season 2.Survivors features some interesting characters and is well acted, however as season progresses, the adventure is characterized by an increasingly pronounced disconnect with reality, that soon makes the program difficult to take seriously.  The limitations of television, no doubt contributes to what is a very ""civilized"" view of the breakdown of society.This is an unrealistic world where the roads are clear of abandoned vehicles, securing petrol is not a problem, there are no signs of the rotting dead, and few violent encounters or deaths.  With supposedly 99% of the population wiped out, people just keep popping up all over the place.  For the end of the world, things actually do not seem that bad.Abby Grant is a likeable and capable leader, but travelling alone without regard for safety is reckless.  The prospect of rape comes up a time or two, but it is quickly brushed away.  Most situations that feature violence are not handled well.  In general, the group has little regard for security, which often contributes to their finding themselves in trouble.While the writing falls short at times, the series is still entertaining, as an adventure that also explores different aspects of morality.  Although it often backs away from controversial issues, and is not suitable for the whole family, Survivors is certainly worth a watch, while available to Prime members in HD.  And for those that give the series a chance, the good news is that the writing actually improves appreciably in the second season."
1,The Event was an on the edge of your seat movie.  I enjoyed the entire cast. At first I was sorry there was only one season but looking back it feels complete.
1,"I can't understand the 7 bad reviews for this show I read but whatever. I'm an average sci-fi fan who thought the 'V' of 25 yrs ago was 'ok' but this updated version is terrific. And the ultimate compliment to it is that in season 1 you get a mere glimpse of what the aliens 'really' look like and yet the show is compelling and creepy and utterly entertaining. The show is totally made by the perfomance of Morena Baccarin who plays 'Anna' the alien Queen. She is so beautiful, creepy, and deadly you almost wind up rooting for her in her quest to wipe out Earth! Her counterpart Elizabeth Mitchell as the FBI Agent on Earth trying to expose the 'V's' is also terrific. It is this battle between two Mothers that actually drives the show. The supporting cast of Joel Gretsch as Father Jack, Scott Wolf as a self serving journalist, and the gorgeous Laura Vandervoort as Anna's daughter are all great additional characters on the show. Post 911 fears; idolatry; wanting someone or something to 'fix' all our problems; these are just a few of the issues dealt with on 'V'. I really, really liked it and didn't think I would. I will definitely purchase season 2 when its available."
1,"Of course this show is going to be wonderful. Tortured, decent man runs into moral dilemmas all day long and rises above them all with honor and humbleness. Love this guy anyway. he could read a phone book and sound delightful"
1,"This season of Psych is great, the duo of Shawn and Gus are even funnier and have to solve even funnier cases. The character development between Shawn and Juliet is also furthered.I would definitely recommend this season to anyone looking for a good laugh."
1,"I LOVE this series. I HATE the way the ""suits"" let this end. 5 stars for the series... ZERO stars for the ""SUITS""! It was such a disappointment to see the episodes again and see the story heat up, only to be kicked in the teeth by corporate greed at the end... This isn't even a cliffhanger... this is just waking up in the middle of a dream and never knowing the whole story..."
1,"An interesting series to immerse oneself in, as it may [also] lead you to ponder its accuracies with reality...Check it out!"
1,"A tale of justice and retribution, Hobo With A Shotgun (2011) doesn't break any new ground.  It takes a situation more common to westerns, and places it in a modern urban setting, where an innocent stranger arrives in town, and tries to do the right thing when he encounters injustice, only to discover that the police are corrupt.  Attempting to move on and make an honest living, the man reacts with violence when threatened, taking the law into his own hands, and embarking on a path of bloody violence and destruction.  Spoilers follow.Arriving in a city on a passing train, the Hobo (Rutger Hauer) witnesses The Drake (Brian Downey), and his sons Ivan (Nick Bateman) and Slick (Gregory Smith), abusing a man wearing a manhole cover around his neck.  The Drake is an underworld leader, and the man, who happens to be his brother, is dropped into a manhole, and then decapitated using a car.Spotting a lawn mower for sale in a pawn shop, the Hobo decides to save up to buy it, and try and make his living cutting lawns.  Outside an arcade, Slick attacks a prostitute named Abby (Molly Dunsworth), but is knocked out by the Hobo, who takes the scumbag to the police station.  Instead of arresting him, the police chief turns Slick loose, and he and his brother attack the Hobo, and then toss him into a dumpster.  Fortunately the Hobo runs into Abby, who gives him a place to stay for the night.The Hobo degrades himself to earn enough cash to buy the lawnmower, and is in the pawn shop when three thugs enter and attempt to rob the place.  Faced with a crisis, the Hobo picks up a shotgun, which just happens to be loaded, and blows away the punks.  He then begins to clean up the town, eliminating anyone he perceives is guilty.  After blowing apart a horny cop, the Hobo is reunited with Abby.  They intend to run away together, but with The Drake and his sons standing in their way, the path out of town proves to be a bloody one.Reality isn't intended to be a major factor in Hobo With A Shotgun.  The point is to establish a reason for all hell to break loose, and then open the floodgates to mayhem, highlighted by some outrageously cool gore.  With that understood, the movie hits most of its goals, and while quite nasty, the movie is perhaps less violent than it could have been, as there was clearly potential for more sexual violence and brutality from the villains.Rutger Hauer (The Hitcher,Blade Runner) is great as the Hobo, bringing a kind of world weary resignation to the role, as he obliterates the dregs of the town.  As an older man however, he doesn't bring the same kind of energy and rage that a younger actor could have.  The Hobo doesn't do much fighting, and relies mostly on his shotgun.  The character Abby takes quite a wild ride, going from a victim about to bleed out and die, to an armored street warrior.  She doesn't quite make the transition to killer gladiator, as she is cruelly maimed by a lawnmower, but she still manages to strike back and defend herself.  This bleak adventure not intended for the faint of heart.  In a place so depraved and evil, there can be no happy endings for anyone.  If you are a fan of revenge films, give this one a watch.  It won't lift your spirits much, but it should give you a nice adrenaline rush."
1,"I tried this show after I had watched all of Downton Abbey. This is a very sweet show, The story's unfold gently and you do begin to care about what happens to the characters. If you like period dramas, you should watch this one."
1,We started watching this when there was really nothing on regular tv to watch and it is really pretty good. I never heard of this series but we have come across several series on Amazon that we never heard of which were Ok to watch.
1,"""24"" is like Red Bull--once you've had it you're addicted. The fifth season of ""24"" revolves around one central mystery: who killed an ex-president and how is Jack Bauer connected to the assassination? It's a thrilling season--probably the best since the first season--and it comes to a stunning conclusion that will be answered in January of 2007. Interestingly after having watched ""Casino Royale"" its clear that the new Bond film was inspired by shows like ""24"" which were, in turn, inspired by early Bond and some of the newer spy thrillers out there. There are a number of twists and turns in this season set my advice is NOT to read any reviews that summarize anymore of the plot if you haven't seen this season as there are some major spoilers in some of the reviews that follow.As usual Fox has put together a terrific DVD. This also features a brief episode ""prequel"" to the sixth season like previous sets had. We get a large amount of worthwhile commentary tracks including some with Emmy winner Kiefer Sutherland. There's also a summary of the season included as well athough if you've watched the show (or are watching it now) it won't really provide anything new. Th ""100 Episode Reel"" is a pretty useless extra -- basically a clips compilation.Different places are offering different exclusives. If you purchase it here you can download a free episode from Unbox (at least during the Holidays) while Target also offers a limited edition bonus disc for this set with additional featurettes on the show. Regardless of whether you buy it here at amazon.com or elsewhere this set features plenty of extras including an examination of the wonderful Presidential retreat featured in the show, a good featurette on the stellar work by the cinematography on the show, a featurette on the supporting actors on the show as well as extended and deleted scenes. I haven't had a chance to dig through all the bonus material yet but it what I have checked out looks really, really good.This set is packaged in the thinpak holders with two discs per holder so the accordian style packaging has been abandoned for this thinner packaging. This is a terrific set for an outstanding season of the series.What I would love to see if Keifer Sutherland and Donald Sutherland featured during a season."
1,"I wish all T.V. shows were this much fun! You learn as you have a good time, and it always gives you a good laugh, no matter what your age!"
1,"Touching, transcendent, witty, snappy, thoughtful fun.  The female cop character is too mean, closed-minded, and coddled by all the males around her but Sarah Shahi performance is serviceable, and she is extremely pretty.  The Adam Arkin character is a total winner.The 2nd season's plot lines go off the rails, then the series was cancelled, but the first season of 'Life' is procedural perfection."
0,"The only ""bang"" in this series for me was the sound of my remote hitting the television screen in disgust. My bad, I bought into all the rave reviews for this abysmal, Erkel-ized comedy.Throw glasses onto Johnny Galecki and it STILL doesn't make him funny. (His casting as the weirdo, brooding idiot on Roseanne I always found strange, too.) Are people finding this ""cute""? ""Smart""? All I can say if I am over 50% similar to you, do yourself a favor and find some quality TV sitcom reruns to scratch your comedy itch. This will having you banging your head against the wall."
1,"""Centurion"" is what is called a ""hack and slash"" film from Neil Marshall, director of ""Dog Soldiers"" and ""The Descent,"" which means there are lots of gores, mutilated limbs and dead bodies. Blending raw violence and beautiful landscapes, ""Centurion"" has a potential for a sweeping saga with action, history and romance, but somehow the film itself, though it is not bad, ends up with dissatisfaction because of the generic storytelling and flat characters.Set in the second century Britain, a band of Roman soldiers is left behind the enemy lines after the surprise attack from the Pictish warriors. Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender), who had survived the Pictish raid on the Roman frontier fort, is entrusted by General Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West) of the Ninth Legion with the task of bringing the six survivors back to safety.Michael Fassbender is as brilliant as ever though his heroic character (and the romantic subplot) is underwritten. Olga Kurylenko appears as a fearsome warrior riding on a horse (and she doesn't speak a single word). She is not bad, but those who expect her to play another sexy ""Bond Girl"" as in ""Quantum of Solace"" might be disappointed.For me, the biggest problem with the film is that though ""Centurion"" delivers a few thrilling action scenes, the story itself is not that thrilling. We see a group of characters chased by another group of characters, but the chase scenes drag on, are at times repetitious, sometimes even look as if borrowed from somewhere else, like ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.""""Centurion"" is a blood-soaked period action that could have been better with fleshed-out characters and a tighter story."
1,"One of the most enduring urban legends in Los Angeles is that of the Dollhouse, an underground establishment which traffics in wish fulfillment. Rumor is that the Dollhouse programs its people (a.k.a. ""Dolls"" or ""Actives"") with imprinted personalities and skills, to be whoever or whatever the Dollhouse's incredibly powerful and wealthy clientele desires them to be. When not on assignment, it's said that these dolls are kept in a placid zombified state, their original personalities having been erased. Some urban legends are true.The Dollhouse exists, and its influence reaches far and reaches deep. While its steely lady Director espouses an altruistic motivation, sinister elements have surfaced to gainsay this. The elephant in the room is Alpha, a doll who inexplicably went berserk during his dormant state and murdered a group of defenseless dolls and other Dollhouse functionaries. The only doll to survive Alpha's killing spree is Echo. And, as we learn, there's something very special about Echo. Alpha supposedly perished at the hands of Dollhouse's security. Supposedly.Another running subplot focuses on federal agent Paul Ballard who from the opening episode is already obsessed with unearthing and exposing the Dollhouse. For a chunk of this season, though, he spends time groping in the dark and being derided by his fellow agents. Meanwhile, shadowy forces seek to bring down the Dollhouse and they show no scruples in using Ballard as a pawn.- Head programmer Topher, to Echo's new handler Boyd: ""So what do you think of your new girl?""- Boyd: ""She's not a girl. She's not even a person. Just an empty hat. Until you stuff a rabbit in it.""Echo is the key, the central character of the story. Piece by piece, little by little, there's a breaking down in the Dollhouse's programming and several of the dolls begin to act outside their established parameters. The most curious of all the dolls, Echo demonstrates a more focused resistance. She begins to fight her programming, as stray memories from her past life and from her past imprints begin to seep back in. Season one's fourteen episodes chronicle Echo's evolution from tabula rasa to someone who regains a measure of independence and self-awareness. Just how much does she regain? What are the repercussions, to her and to the Dollhouse?  Adelle DeWitt, the lady Director, proclaims: ""This House is out of balance."" The second season finds the Dollhouse still teetering on collapse. It makes for awesome, gray-area'd television.A sigh of relief for me, when I found out that DOLLHOUSE is getting picked up for a second season. I wasn't sure or that hopeful, since the ratings weren't at all impressive. I noticed - hell, everyone noticed - that DOLLHOUSE seemed to have trouble finding its groove. The first five aired episodes are pretty much standalone tales and, with the possible exception of ""Gray Hour,"" lacking in that ""Gotcha!"" punch. With the sixth episode ""Man on the Street,"" things finally start rolling, and the overarcing story really begins to build momentum. It's all good from there on, with Joss Whedon, it seems, having finally found clarity and able to move forward with the constructing of the Dollhouse mythology.A smattering of propers for the lead. Sexy. Sensuous. A whiff of something dangerous, rebellious. A very good actress. Is convincing when she talks smack. Can even sing. Is it heresy to admit that I find Eliza Dushku more of a turn-on than Sarah Michelle Geller? ""She has that thing. She never didn't have that thing."" is what Joss Whedon said about Eliza Dushku. Those expecting DOLLHOUSE to be a straight-up action thriller may be disappointed; it isn't that kind of show, strictly. You really don't get a steady diet of Eliza Dushku whuppin' on bad guys, although, don't get me wrong, there are some skull cracking moments. But Echo doesn't always get the ninja/super spy/assassin implant (sometimes it's fellow Actives Sierra or November tapped for the fisticuffs). Dushku, and the other actors playing dolls, get challenged each episode as they put on different hats, assume various avatars. Echo, when not a good-natured vegetable, in turn becomes an asthmatic hostage negotiator, a dominatrix, a cocky thief, a blind cultist, a backup singer, the perfect girlfriend, and even a dead woman who comes back to solve her own murder. That's a whole range of emotions and attitudes and character shifts. Eliza Duskhu pulls it off. However, I find that Echo, as a blank slate, is when she's at her most likeable. She exudes sweetness and a childlike innocence. Come to think of it, the same applies for the other dolls. We wonder what these characters are really like, at their core. And, so, when the dolls begin interacting with each other, that's when the show really gets interesting.The rest of the cast are uniformly very good, but I just have to point out the remarkable Tahmoh Penikett (FBI agent Paul Ballard). Penikett exudes a commanding presence, physical and intense and yet sort of soulful. Plus, his Muay Thai training comes in very handy in his action sequences. In fact, the best fight scene in this season of DOLLHOUSE happens in ""Man on the Street"" as Ballard takes on Echo in a no-holds-barred skirmish. I will admit that, in the first few episodes, I found his story arc plodding as guy wasn't getting anywhere on his case. But then again, as implied, those first few episodes came off as slow and muddled.In the tradition of John Ford and Orson Welles, Joss Whedon likes to hire actors he'd worked with before. Alan Tudyk (FIREFLY) and Felicia Day (DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG) have guest starring parts. In Season 2, Summer Glau is slated to have a recurring role. The show, however, may have to deal with losing Amy Acker (ANGEL and the horribly scarred Dr. Claire Saunders in this one). It looks like her pilot HAPPY TOWN was picked up by ABC.Not unexpectedly, this show reeks of many dark themes. Themes of paranoia and conspiracy, of sexuality and objectification and of just what is it that makes up one's sense of identity, and of technology abused. And, of course, it's a morality play. Joss Whedon intended DOLLHOUSE to be thought-provoking, controversial, and at times uncomfortable, and he succeeds on all counts. Part of the intrigue is that you never quite know what kind of episode you're going to get. Sometimes, it's got this romantic air about it. Sometimes, it's funny. Sometimes, it's pretty creepy and appaling. Your perceptions are effed with. Each further episode peels away layer after layer. At some point you realize that you can't believe a lot of what you see on the surface. Joss Whedon relishes playing his Jedi mind tricks on the television audience.I've got my preferred episodes, although I heartily recommend anything from ""Man on the Street"" and on. But, yes, ""Man on the Street"" is very good. To me, that's when Joss Whedon finally finds his sea legs and begins to amp things up. ""Needs"" gives us a glimpse of some of the dolls' true personalities. ""Omega"" at last unleashes Alpha, who is a seriously deranged em-effer and who can access all his past imprints. ""Epitaph One,"" one of the two unaired episodes, is set in a bleak post-apocalyptic future in which the Dollhouse technology had been set loose onto the world, and where the Imprints hunt down humans with intact personalities. Joss Whedon filmed ""Epitaph One"" because the network required a thirteenth episode and also because Joss intended this one to serve as either a teaser for future story arcs or as the capper to the series, should the worst happen. Meanwhile, the third episode aired, ""Stage Fright,"" is worth checking out for Eliza Dushku's singing in one scene.Bonus features time. This Season One set comes in 4 discs and presents all twelve episodes, plus two unaired episodes (both of which are on disc 4): ""Epitaph One"" and the original pilot ""Echo"" (some of the scenes in ""Echo"" are integrated into the aired episodes, but there's enough never-before-seen material to make it worth watching - but you could see where the episode needed tightening up); audio commentary for three episodes: ""Ghost"" (with Joss Whedon & Eliza Dushku - really fun), ""Man on the Street (with Joss Whedon), and ""Epitaph One"" (with Joss's brother Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen, the happy couple who wrote the teleplay and who in their commentary track sometimes engage in playful lovey-dovey talk - also really fun); a whole gang of brief deleted scenes from nine of the episodes (my favorites of which are those depicting Sierra and November as bounty hunters in ""Omega"").Disc 4 also has these following featurettes: ""Making DOLLHOUSE"" is around 20 minutes long and offers insights into the casting choices and the two pilots made, as well as a look at ""Epitaph One""; ""Coming Home"" - this is almost a reunion featurette, 7 minutes of Joss Whedon's staff warmly expounding on how glad they are to be working with him again; ""Finding Echo"" is about the magic of a hot Gouda pizza and of Joss and Eliza's friendship and how that led into their collaboration in DOLLHOUSE (5 minutes long); ""Designing the Perfect DOLLHOUSE"" is Joss giving a 6-minute tour of the amazing Dollhouse set; and ""A Private Engagement"" - the cast and crew share their thoughts on Dollhouse imprinting and, hey, is Joss Whedon a doll? (almost six minutes long).So, to boil it all down (because I don't really know how to end this thing)... DOLLHOUSE is about: Broken people desperate for an escape. It's about an urban legend. A shadow corporation. Some worrisome place called the Attic. A psychopathic doll. A whiff of romance, probably doomed. A determined, much maligned FBI agent. It's also about espionage and martial arts, and playing God and are emotions real as long as you feel them wholeheartedly even if they're programmed into you? And it's about co-ed showers. DOLLHOUSE is Joss Whedon masterminding a reality-warping thriller and his messing with our minds but making us like it. DOLLHOUSE is Eliza Dushku asking us: ""Who do you want me to be?"" So sit down. Tune in. Make yourself uncomfortable. It's time for your treatment."
1,"I'm going to leave the original review as a reminder to me. Understand the purpose before judging. The intent of this series is to present a way to understand what it means to be in a combat zone. Most of the episodes are well done and include original footage as well as recreations. The information is as detailed as necessary and the narration and interviews offer an easily understandable overview. Recommended for those who want an interesting and informative glimpse into a 'Combat Zone.'[Combat Zone? Not a TV person, so I was not familiar with the series. OoPs!]Viewed this series by chronology instead of episode number. Interesting interviews and original footage. The recreations are well done and the narration is informative. Photographs add that personal dimension. For those who are well grounded in military history, this series may be disappointing. If you like a combat type  series instead of documentaries, this is a good one."
1,The odd little Belgian sleuth continues his quirky ways as he solves the cases others fail. Fun to watch - not 5 star but entertaining and somewhat addictive.
1,I watched a bit of this...and stopped.  I will get back to it..but thus far it really didn't grab my interest.  I will watch it through though.  Eventually.  What I've seen just didn't interest me.  It might be different for someone else.  It's always a gamble when you buy a film if you aren't familiar with it.  I bought it because I usually love films from that period.
1,We have watched the first and second season and we love the series.  We are now watching the third season and just like the first two we love the NCIS Team and the plots are excellent.
1,This is a really fun show.  I like it because it has nothing to do with day to day life.
1,Lark Rise to Candleford  is tame and the pace is definitely not rapid.  It is a leisurely walk through the late 1800's where small problems of two towns and their inhabitants (with an emphasis on class) are reviewed.  The people's lives and issues can be taken as an allegory about how the world at large was changing.
1,"I love the series. It is engaging and a lot of fun. However, the blu-ray edition and my Sony blu-ray player do not get along. I suspect the player is the problem and not this set. Every time I start up the disc, it resets as if I had just placed it into the player and I have to go through all the front matter again. It is irritating because if the blu-ray player is on pause and shuts down for lack of activity, it resets the disc and we have to start over.Aside from that little problem, this is one great series, solving a new case each episode, and yet having an on-going story in the background. All of the performers are top-notch and the stories are all over the map, presenting a new look each story at some form of crime (white color or otherwise). The performances and story excellence carry forward into the following seasons and we are looking forward to the release of the fourth season."
1,"I am currently trying out Amazon Prime's 30 day free trial.  I hadn't heard of this movie but love the work of the two actors staring in the it so I gave it a chance because what the heck-it was free.  It was such a fun movie-I just ordered it on dvd for my own collection.  Bear in mind, most of my dvd collection is scifi, drama, action adventure, swashbuckling, and horror movies, with a few fun movies mixed in from time to time.  This one made it to the list of must haves.  As far as that goes, Amazon Prime became a must have as well but that is for a different review.  A hint though-bye-bye, Netflix."
1,"Season four is quite possibly my favorite season, although season one comes in pretty close behind. Gus seems to find his own place this season, and Shawn has a nice thing going on at the beginning and end of the season (as usual). The first episode, ""Extradition: British Columbia"" is hilareous: Shawn takes Gus on the road to Canada, where he passes himself off as Santa Barbara's head detective and Lassiter & Juliet have to play second fiddle. Then we find out the whole reason he went to Canada: it was originally a trip he had planned for Abigail. I had to watch the episode again, because suddenly a lot of the scenes took on whole new meanings.I also enjoyed ""A Very Juliet"" episode - very touching, even if it does pull Juliet and Shawn apart a bit. Perhaps that's why in Season five he sends a picture of a dog to all of Juliet's boyfriends with a message ""this is you"". Ah, the on again-off again relationship between the two.If you enjoy the series, this is another one to add."
1,"You never know what twist and turns are in store once you get these two guys together. Acting is top notch. You love some characters and of coarse you loathe some of the others. They are lawyers, what did you expect? But there is a lot of chemistry between the actors on the show. Harvey is the arrogant one, but always a winner. The firm only hires Harvard graduates, but Harvey, always one to bend the rules hires an unemployed young man who happens to be in the middle of a drug bust, when he stumbles upon the interviews. If you enjoy watching characters that are forever improvising and can think extremely quick on their feet, you will thoroughly enjoy this show."
1,"Out with the old, in with the new. X-FILES has for sure generated its share of would-be successors. FRINGE, WAREHOUSE 13, EUREKA, and SANCTUARY are only four of the ones still airing on television. Being a sci-fi/ horror/ fantasy junkie, I'm compelled to view them all. I'm not saying SANCTUARY is the best of the lot (that would be EUREKA), but it's got certain things going on in its favor.There are clandestine strongholds, Sanctuaries, scattered across the globe which house all manner of strange, fantastic creatures, some sentient, some not, and some monstrous and catastrophic. Our cast includes the resident werewolf (who provides tech support), Bigfoot, a forensic psychiatrist, and Jack the Ripper, and their leader Dr. Helen Magnus, a beautiful scientist much older than she looks and who heads up one of the Sanctuaries. The show tracks Magnus and her crew's exploits as they seek to study and shelter (and, if required, contain) these grotesques that inhabit the world in secret. They had to label them something, but ""Abnormals"" for some reason just doesn't do it for me. I guess I don't think it's catchy enough. Abnormal makes me think of a skin growth or tofurkey or Nicolas Cage.The two-part ""End of Nights' picks up from last season as we learn the fate of Dr. Magnus's daughter Ashley, who had been abducted and genetically experimented on by the shadowy organization derivatively calling itself the Cabal. Ashley is metamorphosed into a vampiric killing machine and deployed, along with five others who had been genetically manipulated, to conduct surgical strikes against the Sanctuaries network. It's a heck of a send-off, the writing staff having decided to write Ashley out of the show. ""End of Nights"" is one of the series's most action-packed episodes, the best bit probably that of the sinister John Druitt channeling his inner Blade the Vampire Killer as he takes on Ashley and friends. Points taken away, though, for the otherwise perfect Amanda Tapping's over-the-top histrionics in these two episodes. I mean, I get it. She's frantic over her missing daughter. But, sheesh...What hurts the season is its episodic tendency. It lacks the connective tissue of a thru story arc to pull you even more into the cast's various adventures. Instead, what we get is mostly this ""monster of the week"" vibe. Several characters don't make it out okay. But if the writers were trying for a dramatic, impactful beat, it doesn't work out that way for one of the characters to whom I felt was done a disservice. This person's death scene is accomplished in perfunctory fashion. In fact, it happens off camera. And, in ""Eulogy,"" is it just me who wanted to whack that obnoxious pixie with a mighty flyswatter?This time out, the Sanctuary team encounters weirdness in the shape of a pudgy superhero, a pandemic that ravages the human race in the near future, Magnus's degenerative brain disease, a telepathic tribunal, a 5000-year-old cult, an extinction-level Abnormal, and, perhaps most terrifyingly, a Bollywood dance number. My favorite characters continue to be Dr. Helen Magnus, the deadly John Druitt, BigGuy, and the awesome half-nosferatu Nikola Tesla. I'm not yet sold on Agam Darshi who is introduced as freelance operative Kate Freelander in ""End of Nights."" Her character feels lightweight and I'm not down with her incessant jibber-jabber. But I find Darshi more accessible than Emilie Ullerup.For tepid episodes like ""Fragments"" and ""Penance,"" we get highly watchable stuff like the fun ""Hero,"" the bleak post-apocalyptic ""Pavor Nocturnus,"" and the very plot-twisty ""Veritas"" (directed by Amanda Tapping and guest-starring EUREKA's Erica Cerra). I couldn't get that into the two-part season closer ""Kali,"" and not even the nice character moments for Kate can salvage it. It's yet another cliffhanger ending, with lives in the balance and Magnus's directorship at Sanctuary in peril of usurpation. Not as good as EUREKA or FRINGE, mostly because, despite its potential, the show's writers can't seem to stretch their wings enough, and so we're forced to settle for a mediocre product. And yet SANCTUARY is bolstered with decent f/x and solid performances by Amanda Tapping, Christopher Heyerdahl, and recurring guest actor Jonathon Young (as Tesla). Season 2 produces just enough cool or redemptive moments that it's guaranteed itself a measure of loyalty and steady eyeballing from me of future episodes. But I hope they bring back Ralfie... only the cutest ugly dog creature thing ever!SANCTUARY - THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON collects the entire 13 episodes on four discs and has the following hefty bonus material:- Cast & Crew Audio Commentaries on all 13 episodes (and plenty of these featuring actress/executive producer Amanda Tapping who, when you listen to her, sounds less British and a lot more fun to be around with than the workaholic Dr. Magnus)- ""International Sanctuary"" - featurette which details the global network that is the Sanctuaries (00:03:24 minutes long)- Amanda Tapping Directs the ""Veritas"" episode (00:03:42 minutes)- ""'Next Tuesday' - Anatomy of an Episode"" - a breakdown of this season's bottle episode (00:16:45)- ""SANCTUARY's Visual Effects"" (00:08:55)- ""Sanctuary for Kids"" - Amanda Tapping talks about the show's launching of its charitable foundation which seeks to help children in crisis (00:01:12)- SANCTUARY Goes to the San Diego Comic Con (00:08:06)- Robin Dunne's Video Diary - ""Will Vision - Behind the Scenes & On Set"" - worth watching for the genuinely moving final two minutes or so as Robin records the last day of shooting for Season 2 (00:13:18)- Robin Dunne's Video Diary: ""Will Vision - SANCTUARY Goes to Japan"" for a presser and to shoot several establishing shots of the Japan Sanctuary, until the monsoon came along (00:10:48)- ""Dancing in Mumbai"" - about that moment in the season finale ""Kali, Part II"" in which Robin Dunne has to dance, Bollywood style - and we get a behind-the-scenes peek at the dance rehearsals that went into it; I'll be honest, though, Dunne's dancing is pretty stiff and awkward (00:12:35)- Bloopers & Outtakes (00:05:07)- Behind the Scenes Slideshow (00:04:11)"
1,Good start.  I watched the first episode and I'll be back to watch the rest.  Jeremy Renner was very good and his NEW partner was too.  Will watch some more...
1,"Herccule never disappoints withnhis &#34;little grey cells&#34; but I love watching the settings which are put together with such care as to be as close as possible to the real thing.  The clothes,hair, trains, cars, jewelry--all are perfect."
1,I don't like umizoomi but the kids like it. I don't think its creative and the songs are corny and the tasks take forever to complete. I like the idea of being task oriented but they take so long to go through each step that it feels as if they are trying to force learning.
1,"I would almost swear this guy is Steve Carrell's brother.  Very informative and funny at the same time.  The only thing I really disliked is when I got to Season 2, and discovered Prime wants $1.99/episode, on top of my membership fees."
1,"An o.k. season. The writing strike did this and other shows no favours. The actors were all superb, the directing and producer started to lose their way in this season."
1,I like the characters and the plots are wonderful.  It definitely keeps you interested in what is happening and going to happen.
1,Wonderful period piece about London and the medical care available at the turn of the century.  Particularly interesting to those who can compare past and present medical training
1,"I absolutely adore this show. It's my kind of humor. It pokes silly fun at people from Portland, pretentious health concious hipsters, too hip for their own good.Ordering food in a restaurant becomes a five year trip to an organic chicken farm run by a charismatic cult leader who imbues every encounter with God-like love.The handsome goofy mayor is all over the place mentally, deciding to get together a baseball team for Portland which ends up with whatever pot luck players want to join, including an old man who is deaf, a very obese African-American, etc.The long haired proprietors of a bookstore carrying only books about women's issues are snobby space cadets, unable to make change without closing up shop and going to the bank.The title of the show is a combination of the words Portland and Utopia. In one episode, it is explained that Portland has never left the 1800s. Men have long beards and handlebar mustaches. People make their own beer. Bikes are the main transportation and they are uncomfortible ones. People raise their own chickens.Until I can arrange to visit this strange and funny place I can watch this, although there weren't enough episodes.I find this show a breath of fresh air. It's off the wall silly and I love it."
1,Prison wives sheds light on the other half of a prison sentence. My wife and I both enjoyed watching every episode in this series. These women take commitment to a whole other level.
1,"I haven't watched the first season in its entirety, but I have watched enough episodes to have a grasp on the show and material. I was first heard about this through a lifetime teaser, which sucked because I didn't have the lifetime channel. When I found out it was on netflix, I got all excited and hoped it would live up to my expectations. Usually things fall far short from how they first appear, but this series has kept me interested and entertained the entire time.Details: The show starts out with a supermodel (Deb, I believe) who is extremely vain and couldn't picture herself as anything but a size 0, maybe 2, and is one of those ""beautiful people"". The word superficial definitely comes to mind. Due to an accident involving a truck and some grapefruit, which seems like a pretty bad way to die in my opinion, she makes her way up to a purgatory type locale. When trying to decide where her fate lies, she takes matters into her own hands and presses the ""return"" button on her guardian angel's keyboard. This sends her back to Earth but as Jane, a super intelligent lawyer with a heart of gold and a bit of extra weight. Basically, almost the exact opposite of Deb. The show helps Deb (in Jane's body) with several realizations that life is about more than just looks.Drama: To add an extra layer to everything, it turns out that Deb's fiance actually works for the same law firm as Jane. Oh how cruel fate can be... And while he is still grief stricken, he has shown some interest in one of their coworkers, much to Jane/Deb's dismay.Why 4 out of 5 stars then, you ask? It really ticked me off in the first few episodes when Jane was stressed and her assistant would feed her cheeze whiz straight out of a can or give her a doughnut to improve her mood. It almost seemed like the show was saying ""bigger women love to do these types of things, that's why they are bigger"". It was totally unnecessary and inconsiderate."
1,"because, as one of the extra bits shows the storyline was starting to take a very dark turn. Another complaint I have is the introduction of several new characters, never to be heard from in following seasons. Claire Benet.'s flying boyfriend?, watch him here- he's not in 3rd season, no explanation. Wasn't the son of Ali Larter's character named Micah?, his Black relatives are introduced here, not one word about any of them next season.I have a feeling that if this season had gone full length the series might've had an even shorter run."
1,"A great series, this is one I have recommended to several of my close friends, and they agreed it was just great TV.  Mystery, Drama, and irony. I was wary about watching this at first, but after seeing 'Sherlock' with Mr. Cumberbatch, I thought I would give it a go, and I was impressed."
1,"This is the 2nd season/series of the rebooted Doctor Who featuring Matt Smith as the 11th Doctor, and he does not disappoint in the slightest.  Very impressive acting and the character has a feeling of being very genuine and very authentic.  The show continues to thrive and is both fun and entertaining to watch, and some of the stories, while outwardly entertaining, also really make you think about things in ways you otherwise might have overlooked - which I feel is true of several seasons/series of Doctor Who - but it certainly continues in this one.  This year again featured the Ponds, Amy and Rory as The Doctor's companions.  Excellent special effects as usual and great writing, but superb acting, especially by Matt Smith.  Matt Smith may have been the only person who could have adequately followed David Tennant's 10th Doctor in the iconic and legendary role.  I am truly impressed with how good this program is and I highly recommend it to anyone."
1,"However one can tel that the people who put these shows together are not technical people, just journalists, because the picture concentrates to much and to long on the faces of the people working and talking about the project instead of showing and detailing the project.And one more very annoying issue.They are trying to create drama by always inserting the coming of a Hurricane ot Taifun, or rough seas, which just add unnecessary nonsense to the show!Your best bet is Build it Bigger with the Architect as a narrator !"
1,"I tend to watch a lot of off-beat and non-mainstream movies. When you do this, you'll come across as much garbage as there was in the trash compactor scene in the original STAR WARS. However, every once in a while you'll uncover a gem. Sometimes, you'll uncover a really unusual movie that's really not all that great, but is so unusual that the very oddity and absurdity of it makes it stand out and worth watching through. RUBBER is one of those movies.RUBBER is a movie about a killer tire. The film opens with a man (Jack Plotnick) standing out in the middle of the desert covered in binoculars. Then a car comes driving up a dirt road destroying a bunch of wooden chairs that have been set up as though they were orange safety cones. The car stops and a man in a police uniform (Stephen Spinella) gets out and begins talking into the camera. He gives a long monologue about in every great movie there is an element of something happening for ""no reason"" and that's what this movie is all about. He then dumps out the beverage in his hand and jumps back into the car and is driven off. Then the man with the binoculars begins passing out binoculars to a group of spectators standing behind roped off pillars. The people take their binoculars and turn around and begin watching the movie. Throughout the rest of the film RUBBER moves back and forth between the action of Robert the Tire and the audience. Towards the end of the movie, the audience actually becomes a part of the movie.So, with the absurdist theatre element in place, the main ""action"" follows the deeds of Robert the Tire. It's never explained in the movie how or why (and Robert isn't even given a name, except in the special features and in promotional materials) Robert comes to be. He just rises out of the dirt and is. It takes him some time to get adjusted to just standing up and then rolling around of his own accord. But soon he's off and rolling. Then he comes across a plastic bottle in his way and he flattens it. Next a scorpion in his way meets the same fate. However, the next object is a glass bottle and Robert can't flatten that. This seems to upset him so tries to destroy it with his mind and succeeds in making it explode. So, now Robert is a living tire who has a type of pyrokinesis, he can't make things explode with his mind. Robert quickly moves from exploding bottles to exploding living things.In some ways RUBBER is a critique at the way Hollywood and the studios usually make movies. It's an insane process that doesn't make any sense to most people and often even confounds those in the movie business. I know there are countless times I've left a film thinking, ""How did they get to make that?!"" RUBBER pokes fun of that and the way that most people are just there to watch a good show. Yet, that passivity can make us animals. But, don't read too much into that. RUBBER is, after all, a movie about a killer tire."
0,"This was at one time a free download. I downloaded it, but never had the chance to watch it. On the 31st, some weird power failure completely disrupted my computer. The unbox player had to be re-downloaded. None of my films or downloads was marked as downloaded, but they began to come back - over 90% of them. The rest I simply re-purchased on unbox - though I had to buy Borat on DVD. When I tried to either re-buy or re-download this episode, I discovered it listed but not for sale. Why? Can anyone at Amazon answer that question - several other episodes are also unavailable. ???? I cannot even seem to delete the useless episode. Que pasa? I give it 1 star because you can't give something no stars - a rating deserved by lots of stuff."
1,When this show was first aired my children love loved it.  I even had to find the &#34;clue&#34; writing book.  Now my youngest grandson at 2 yrs is just as fascinated by the energy and colors that is shown.  He gets just as involved looking for Blue's clues as his mom did.  I would recommend this high energy positive presentation of the joy of learning and solving puzzles.
0,"The show makes it look like they're going to reveal mysteries but then they choose the most mundane conclusions for every &#34;so called&#34; mystery they examine. For example, the missing cornerstone of the white house is dismissed as a mystery because it's to big and heavy to move. Really?! That's pretty obvious from the beginning isn't it? Yes, it's a big heavy rock. It's missing. Well it has to be there because it's a big and heavy rock. Mystery solved!  That's pretty much how this show goes. Very boring and no fun to watch."
1,"This is what television should be all about. Refreshing series about life, family, responsibility and football! I love it and can't stop watching it."
1,"Season eight is another great season of fun with all of the most endearing characters. I know that all good things must come to an end, so I plan to savor season nine and enjoy it as long as it lasts."
1,"My 21/2 year old grand daughter is always asking to watch this show. I created her own page on the laptop, with Amazon Prime Video as her home page. So now when she has TV time she can choose the show she wants, 'Little Bear' is one of her favorites.  Each episode is a learning experience."
1,Again these are mysteries that are amazing how these cases get solved. I hope these types of shows will continue to be streamed for free through amazon.
1,"Well, I enjoy them for many reasons. i remember Mark Harmon when he played football for UCLA. He made the right career choice instead of getting banged up and damaged from the NFL he is raking it in with all of these hit series year after year."
1,"The Killing is an unusual show that chooses to skip the ""gun drawn"" action-based drama of most cop programs on TV and instead focus on the detail of detection.Amid three simultaneous plot lines, most of the characters in The Killing are either somehow broken or hiding a secret, enabling the story to unfold in a much fresher and original way. Unlike shows such as CSI, the detectives in particular don't always make the best choices, work on imperfect information and struggle with their own personal issues as much as the case at hand.As the audience starts to uncover more about the suspects and different people who may or may not be involved in the killing, we see the messiness of people's lives, the hidden activities just under the surface and the not-so-obvious motivations at work.What's particularly refreshing about the format is that a single case is investigated over the entire season. With weaker writing, this might not have worked but the writers have created a tightly plotted world that makes you want to see the next episode as soon as one has ended.I haven't seen the Danish original but the American remake is a well acted and surprisingly unique approach to crime drama. As others have said, it's Twin Peaks without the absurdity but it also has a dark edge of its own that reminds the audience that there are always secrets all around us."
1,"Nice bonding between the characters, interesting plot.  Well done.  The &#34;extra&#34; skills that the individuals have are well thought through and believable."
1,"Particularly like the increased emphasis on Auggie's role in Season 2.  Still a little hard to believe the sister can't figure out there is something going on, though"
0,"didn't care for the flick at all, in fact my whole family had me stop the show about 15 minutes into it."
1,"Ok, so I have to admit, when I saw the advertisements for this show, all I could think of was that it looked cheesy and very tween centered.  Then I saw an episode on TV, intrigued I took a look at Hulu and caught some of the second season episodes they had there.  Now, its a guilty pleasure and I just had to get the first season to see how it all started.Glee is a great show in that its positive.  Sure there's some mature themes in it, but really, its about life and that just makes it more realistic.  It shows overcoming obstacles and reaching for your dreams.  But most importantly, it has great music.  Glee is about the New Directions, a glee club who isn't very popular at school but enjoys each other's company and can put on quite the show.  They have several struggles and triumphs through the series and in order to stay as a club at the school, have the ultimate goal of placing in regionals to keep their funding.Characters:Artie Abrams (Kevin Mchale) is a paraplegic and a guitar player.  He has dreams of being a dancer and also is a love interest for Tina.Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) is annoying yet determined.  She wants to be a star and will let nothing stand in her way.  She grows through the series and has to learn that it isn't all about her, despite her talent.Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) is a goth wonderful singer with a stutter.  She spends most of her time with Mercedes and Artie and learns to accept herself for who she is and not drive people away.Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) is head cheerleader and cruelly vicious.  After spying for Sue Sylvester on the glee club and then ending up pregnant, she instead finds solace and friendship in the group.Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) is a little unintelligent but has a lot of heart.  Quarterback of the football team he is blackmailed into joining the glee club because of his outstanding voice, but later learns that its where he wants to be.Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) is an out of the closet gay student.  He has a wonderful singing voice, and is a bit diva-ish but really appreciates his friends.  He is often bullied for his unique nature.Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) is a main diva.  She isn't afraid to express who she is and competes with Rachel for solos in the club.  She is a Cheerio at one point, but returns to Glee because its where her heart is.Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) is another of Sue's spies but admits that Glee is the best part of her day.  She gives the other members a hard time and is sometimes vicious.Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) is another of Sue's spies but cannot perform the task adequately as she is a complete airhead.  She's a great dancer and often unintentionally provides comic relief for the group.Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) is the school's guidance counselor.  She has extreme OCD and during most of the season has a crush on Will that in some parts is returned.  She is also engaged to the coach Ken Tanaka during the series.Noah Puckerman (Mark Salling) is the bad boy of the group.  Known for his trademark mohawk and being great with the ladies, he joins the glee club after being in the Acafellas with Will.  He is a love interest for several of the group's girls.Will Schuester (Mark Morrison) is the glee club director and Spanish teacher.  He has a good heart but doesn't always listen to the kid's on what they want.  But he learns quickly and always tries to do his best for them.  A former Glee club member himself, he is a great singer and dancer.  He has a lot of love interests and has trouble with relationships.Terry Schuester (Jessalyn Gilsig) is Will's neurotic wife.  Originally seen as controlling and bossy, she mellows out when trying to hide a secret from Will.  She cannot overcome her jealousy and suspicion however and does not add to the relationship very much.Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) is definitely the nemesis of the Glee Club.  Head of the vastly awarded Cheerio's she is upset that Will's club is cutting into her budget.  She'll stop at nothing to destroy the New Directions.  She does have moments where her inner goodness shines out however, and it keeps the audience guessing.Mike Chang (Harry Shum Jr) is a football player who is also a great dancer.  He plays a minor role in the series but is great at backup.Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) is Kurt's father.  He's a bit confused about how to do right for his gay son, but ultimately loves him and wants the best for him.Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman) is the head of the school paper and has an extreme crush on Rachel.  She is often seen trying to avoid him.Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter) is a member of the Cheerio's that has Down Syndrome.  She becomes Sue's special sidekick.Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton) is a football member that has joined glee club.  He plays a very minor part often doing backup.Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) is a nice guy but easily mislead.  He cowtows to Sue and often doesn't rule favorably for the glee club.  He tries to do what is right however and does save them once in awhile.Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky) is the former glee club director.  He was removed for inappropriate conduct and is later used for comic relief and the selling of illegal drugs.Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) is the coach of the school teams.  He is in love with Emma and jealous of Will.  He causes problems at times but ultimately is just a guy who wants to be loved.Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel) is the coal of the rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline.  She is also Rachel's biological mother.Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff) is the lead singer of Vocal Adrenaline.  For a time he is a love interest of Rachel's before becoming a rival again.April Rhodes (Kristin Chenowenth) is a washed up former glee club member who never finished high school.  After a stroke of good luck and some help from Will she ends up rich and helps out the glee club.There are many other characters, but most play minor roles.As a whole I think they did a great job of casting the characters.  They also included some cameos such as Josh Groban and Olivia Newton John and also Neil Patrick Harris.  There were some characters that I just didn't care for however.  I'm not a big fan of the Emma Pillsbury character.  I realize she's a love interest for Will but I think her arc in the story takes a lot away from the show's true purpose; the glee club.  She also, despite her eccentricities, just isn't that interesting and I can't see why Will would be interested in her.  The same would go for her boyfriend in the series, Ken Tanaka.  He makes things hard for Will and the football players, but aside from that, doesn't add too much.Most of the characters I love though.  Artie is fantastic and you really feel compassion for him especially in the episode on dancing.  Sue Sylvester is great.  She plays the perfect villain and I can never tell what she's going to do next.  All of the Glee club members really know how to put on a show.Episodes:The First Season has 22 episodes and they are all jam-packed with music, dancing, and your soap opera-ish type plot lines that seem to be popular.**Warning, some of these episode descriptions could be considered spoilers for plot lines.Pilot:This introduces us to the gang and also to the formidable Will Scheuster, a Spanish teacher, former glee club member, and the new director of the Glee club.  The group largely consists of outcasts and starts only five members strong.  But they've got talent, it just needs to be explored.  We are also introduced to Will's formidable wife Terry and the guidance counselor who has a crush on him, Emma Pillsbury.Shomance:In order to try to get some new members (and not be slushied in the face) the group puts together a number to sing in front of the whole school.

Glee Club's Arch Nemesis Sue Sylvester (coach of the award winning Cheerio's cheer squad) sends some cheerleaders as spies into the glee club.Acafellas:Will forms an all male vocal group and in doing so gives up some responsibility to the glee club.  They hire a dance instructor, but realize that they just need to accept each other for who they are.  Especially Kurt as he struggles with his sexuality.Preggers:In this episode, Kurt comes out of the closet, but also joins the football team. Quinn tells Finn that he is the father of her baby and they have to decide what they are going to do with their future despite the fact that she knows Puck is actually the father.  The Glee club also helps the football team win a game.The Rhodes Not Taken:With Rachel quitting to perform in the school play, Will enlists former glee member April Rhodes to be in the glee club.  As she never graduated high school, she is still able to do this.  While struggling to overcome April's bad influence on the group and competing at sectionals, the glee clubbers have a lot on their plate.Vitamin D:After their success at Invitationals, the team feels too confident to perform adequately so Will has the girls compete against the boys.  However, Terri, newly appointed as the school nurse gives the kids over the counter drugs to help them pep up and ultimately gets them in even more trouble.Throwdown:With Sue as co-director of the Glee club, things couldn't be more tense.  She tries to pit the group against each other and then the group becomes even more disheveled when its revealed to the rest of the school that Quinn is pregnant.Mash-Up:When asked to come up with a way to mash two very unlikely song together for Emma and Ken's wedding, Will has to struggle with his feelings for Emma.  These aren't the only relationship problems in this episode as Finn, Quinn, Rachel, and Puck all have to deal with their feelings as well.Wheels:When its revealed how hurt Artie is that he can't travel with the rest of the group they try to raise money to rent a wheelchair accessible school bus for him to take to regionals.  Artie learns something unexpected about Tina, and Sue shows her softer side.Ballad:Will assigns the group a task to sing ballads to each other about how they feel.  This results in a lot of secrets being exposed and Finn telling Quinn's parents about her pregnancy.Hairography:When they see their competition for regionals (and Will is subsequently impressed by their use of hair in dance) they all don the wings and have a rockin time using ""Hairography"" in their routines.  Quinn considers putting the baby up for adoption.Mattress:After a big uproar about the team not appearing in the yearbook Rachel finds a way to try to make them popular again by starring in a local Mattress company commercial.  This compromises them however, as they are paid in mattresses and this could disqualify them from competition.  Will discovers Terri has been lying to him about her pregnancy and spends the night at the school.Sectionals:With Will stepping down from coaching the club, Emma postpones her wedding to take the team to sectionals where they learn that their set-list as been leaked to the opposing teams.  With not a lot of hope in sight, and Finn not showing up as he learns the truth about Quinn's baby, they have to find a way to win in spite of the troubles.Hell-O:This ones all about relationships.  Will and Emma struggle to accept each other the way they are.  Finn is undecided about Rachel and Sue has Santana and Brittany try to ruin that relationship.  Rachel also meets the lead singer of a rival glee club and makes a connection.The Power of Madonna:Just like it sounds, this episode pays homage to Madonna.  With the girls feeling inferior, Will assigns them Madonna songs hoping it will make them feel empowered.Home:When Finn finds out that his mother and Kurt's father are dating he's not sure how to take it. April comes back and helps the team with their auditorium problems and Mercedes learns to feel good about herself.Bad Reputation:After a list ranking the glee club members by hotness circulates, they try to figure out ways to make themselves ""badder"" in order to rise on the list.

Kurt struggles with his identity and begins dating Brittany.Dream On:When Will's old rival in glee club Bryan Ryan wants to cut Glee from the school budget, he has to give up some of his dreams in order to keep it going.  Artie also has to come to term with his dreams of being a dancer.Theatricality:This episode pays homage to Lady Gaga and all her craziness.  Rachel meets her mother and Kurt and Finn's families move in together creating tension.Funk:After feeling a bit defeated by Vocal Adrenaline, a competing team, Will teaches the glee club that they have funk and soul.  Rachel is also devastated when Jesse returns to Vocal Adrenaline.Journey:The team's performance at Regionals will determine their future in the school.  However, they've just learned that Sue is one of the judges and are feeling depressed.  Quinn goes into labor.As a whole the episodes are great and I enjoy the music.  I should note however that some of the plot lines tend to get stale and drawn out.  They also focus more on some characters than others and while the tension between Rachel and Finn is interesting, it just gets boring after awhile.  Some of the more minor characters have great back stories and I'd love to see it expanded.Some of the story lines were quite touching though.  Quite a few timse there were moments in the show that I could feel tears coming to my eyes.  Now that's good writing!Music:Since this is Glee I have to talk about the music.  The show uses a mix of modern tunes and old classics and of course show tunes.  They use Madonna, Lady Gaga, Journey, and other popular artists in their works.  The actors do their own singing but it is slightly noticeable that it is prerecorded.I did enjoy most of the music but thought they got a little heavy handed with the show tunes and broadway hits once in awhile.  Its not that they're not good songs, I just thought the performances and singing for the modern hits were much better done and also better coreographed.~~~This is a great family friendly tv series.  While it explores some mature themes (teen pregnancy, virginity, drugs, etc.) it does so in an approachable way and a parent can easily sit and explain right choices to their kids while watching.  But its also entertaining for adults.  There are plot lines that keep it interesting and music to keep you entertained.  While I would love to see more music there's only so much they can fit into an hour long episode.  Fantastic series and I highly recommend watching it.Review by M. Reynard 2010"
1,"Monk's 7th is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous seasons. Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his devoted Assistant, Natalie. Monk is forced to find a new therapist because Dr. Kroger has died. Throughout this season Monk matches wits with a chess player, helps a boxer, gets stuck on a submarine underwater, meets his other brother, fights City Hall, and much more. I highly recommend MONK: SEASON SEVEN!!!"
1,"I'm floored.  Season 1 of Flashpoint is over, and I think it may be the best overall cop show I've seen.  No, it might not have the totalitary coverage of The Wire, the seedy-ness of The Shield, or the multiple angles of the Law and Order series(es).  But, it manages to be action-oriented, believable, never dumbed-down, emotional, and relavent.  I'm not a cop, but I would bet money that police that do watch the show find many of the issues presented to be dealt with in a way that no other show has.Acting and writing are where Flashpoint rise to a very high (Sierra 1?) spot.  The conversations are believable and flow without really much  that is unnecessary.  All the characters have a genuiness about them, and bring multiple facets to the team that enrich the show without falling into cliche' and stereotype. I didnt think I'd gravitate towards the negotiation and psychological aspects of each incident, but I've come to find those some of the most interesting aspects about it.  They do a really good job immersing you and bringing credibility to what they say and how they say it.There are a few petty things I hesistate to even mention, because I think they present themselves to blatantly only because the rest of the show is so damn perfect.  A couple of the negotiations get a little too heartelt (most are perfect though, especially the second to last episode, perhaps the most heartfelt of all) and the ""last-three-minutes-song-of-the-week-montage"" was very, very 2008 (everyone did it then, House, Grey's Anatomy, etc, etc, etc) but hopefully they phase this out in subsequent seasons.I'm continually amazed at the caliber of shows on TV these days; everytime I am sure television will fall into the trap that movies have (rehashing stuff that isnt even worth rehashing), along comes a show like Flashpoint that knocks me down and draws me in in a way few movies do anymore.  I watched the first season on-demand, but its going to be a purchase, because its one that has taken its place in my heart and mind as a ""best-of"" type of show, and I'd be proud to give it a prominent place on the movie shelf.I simply can't recommend this show enough."
1,"If you saw CATCH ME AS YOU CAN starring Leo DiCaprio as the king of the white collar criminals, this series, WHITE COLLAR, is loosely based on that premise.  This time, however, everyone is fictional.  The two partners are an FBI agent and the con man in the white collar section.  This is as much breezy comedy as it is crime drama. This episode has the two of them working on an Iraqi stolen artifacts problem.  It is not earth shattering tv but it is good and entertaining.  With some work and in time, it might become even better."
1,Reminds me of how fortunate we are to have the advancement in the medical practices.  Very humbling that so many died and through their deaths our healthcare is so improved.Acting is superb.
1,"Why wouldn't you buy this in hi def?  Great show and great buy.  I hope this show continues on.  Scyfy has a lot of misses on their shows, but this one is a hit."
1,I really enjoy this series. Especially the way each episode links to the other and is finally resolved somewhere along the way or at the end. Extremely good writing. Love Timothy Olyphant and the rest of the cast. I'm already watching season 3.
1,"i liked the first episode, but by the second, it became clear that this is a GREAT show. the characters are unique and interesting and the twists and turns are actually surprising. if you're in the mood for a wild ride of a show, which looks like it might be a typical crime of the week show but ISNT, download this one. fun fun."
1,"I caught this on HDNet about the same time it was released in a limited number of theaters.  I fear it won't have much of an audience.  ""Vanishing"" is yet another take on Armageddon with more than a strong hint of religious overtones.  It is also fraught with questions, none of which are answered.  This leads to frustration.  I suspect the filmmakers would say something like, ""it's up to the viewer to decide"".  Baloney!  We want facts.  We want answers...at least for the key elements.  Obviously cost was a factor as the evil-doers are essentially shadows that take the human form, but leave their clothes.  Light, real or artificial, can save you.  Still, in the city of Detroit, only 4 or 5 people have survived, but who knows.  In spite of more questions than answers, the movie has its share of tension and spookiness.  It's not really a horror movie though.  I think it would be more at home as a 45 minute episode of ""The Twilight Zone""."
1,One of my favorite British comedies even though a bit dated. A very funny series that we enjoy a lot.
0,Not much to say except this is proof of the dumbing down of our country.  I didn't finish the program.
1,Well written show with good acting and multiple plot lines and character development.  All in all a lot of fun for an evening.
0,"TBBT is one of those shows that people do not stop talking about. After hearing all this great stuff, I thought I should jump in! On a day off, I caught a marathon on TBS. I watched about 4 episodes, didn't find them funny, so I decided it wasn't for me. Recently I won a season in my office's white elephant. I thought I would maybe give it another try, because maybe the episodes I saw where just from when the show was in a dry patch. I popped this disk in, I watched all 7 episodes on that disk, and I didn't laugh once. The problem I have with this show, is that it doesn't really make you think, unlike so many other shows out there such as Arrested Development, Parks and Rec, and Community you don't have to think. The jokes are simple and all the jokes are just 'stand-in jokes' and none of the jokes &#34;come out of the charecters.&#34; I know that was kind of hard to understand haha, but the charecters just don't really feel real., How they portray Asperger's is unbelievably off, they portray people with that disease to be self-centered and really not care for anyone. I have a very close family member that has that disease and he is very kind and not as extreme as that character is. If you wanna see a good portrayal of that disease watch Parenthood or Community. and how &#34;geeky&#34; they are. The overwhelmingly loud laugh track ruins the show, and the acting is just awful. I know some of you probably disagree with me, and that's OK. This is just my opinion."
1,"I really enjoy it, because I got to see , a lot of scences that was not showed on the tv show, so i understand it more. it was a great story and i cannot wait until the new season beings."
1,"This is a very dark detective story with some very fresh writing and fantastic performances--the villains make you yell at the screen and the smartest man in the room (Luther) is often misjudged. All 14 episodes (over 3 seasons) play like a long, well told movie."
1,The actor in the lead role is convincing in his character. All the episodes are fast paced and keep you wondering what will happen.
0,"couldn't watch it for long.  Bad acting does not do it for me.  I like good direction and really good acting.  I do not really like method acting -being oneself just saying the words.  This is not acting.  however, even with method acting this episode failed miserably."
1,"This story is a magnificent crime drama, I especially enjoy the interaction between the two main characters and the interesting plot twiwts!"
1,"Season Three lacks the edge that the first two seasons had, but the characters remain complex and the plots, unpredictable--except for the demands of the formula.  Visually and auditorially effective."
1,I love London Hospital there is never a dull movement. The actors are all wonderful! I would love to see more episodes.
1,"Enough action to satisfy that urge and enough character development to keep your interest.  Not much for this sort of program, but am enjoying this one."
1,Interesting to see how people lived in small English town years ago. Characters are real with everyday & sometimes petty problems. Warm & easy to watch
1,Love the writing for this show and the ideas they present.  A must see!! Definitely add to your watch list now.
1,We have gotten hooked on Who and season two is a big one with the love interest of Rose Tyler at play. We highly recommend it!
1,"When I heard that MTV had plans to update the cheesy eighties movie ""Teen Wolf"" into a modern serialized drama, I can't say that I was filled with optimism. As the network was trying to establish a successful slate of scripted programming, however, a sexy and suspenseful werewolf thriller made sense. I just didn't know if MTV could get the right creative force to put the project together in an interesting way and utilize the budget and effects necessary to make it stand apart from the supernatural crowd. I think it's fair to say that this is more of a complete reinvention of the source film as opposed to any sort of remake. Aside from sharing an overlapping central theme, the two projects couldn't be more dissimilar. But utilizing the same sensibilities that have made ""Vampire Diaries"" a success, this wolf saga is an intoxicating blend of humor, romance, and chills. Starting as more of a frothy comedy, the series gradually incorporated darker elements as the narrative unfolded until you were sometimes surprised just how effective the thriller aspect was working.I used ""Vampire Diaries"" as a specific reference point, because I also think that ""Teen Wolf"" has all the qualities needed to become a break-out hit. It is a show that would certainly be appreciated by people that don't watch MTV. ""Vampire Diaries"" on CW had an uneven (but likable) first season, but turned into a surprisingly sophisticated soap opera for a stellar second season. ""Wolf,"" similarly, has the potential to evolve further into a smart and multi-layered entertainment. The twelve episodes of Season One, by necessity, focused on two major plot points--a boy who becomes a wolf and the search for his maker. In the show, Tyler Posey plays the central character. As he starts to understand what is happening, the scripts deftly blends comedy, confusion, and awe as he gets an unlikely tutor in the form of a more serious wolfman played by Tyler Hoechlin. The early episodes exhibit plenty of charm as Posey relishes his new school status and blossoming romance. As the show progresses, the sense of danger becomes a primary ingredient. I wasn't crazy about every aspect that helped bring the Alpha story line to fruition. The central mystery, when it was finally revealed, lacked a bit of surprise or impact for me. But it was a small point in an otherwise engaging season.While the entire cast is attractive and effective, I've got to throw out props to Posey. Of course, only in TV land would Posey be considered a loser. Adorable smile, killer physique, and all around charming demeanor--the show brands him a geek initially for the apparent reason that he is an asthmatic (inhalers are so unsexy). He juggles the complexities of his role with dexterity and is always a winning protagonist--it is easy to be invested in his plight and emotional journey. As his wacky sidekick, Dylan O'Brien also gets a special shout-out from me. Why? He portrays the biggest cliche' possible as Posey's wise-cracking best friend and still makes it seem effortless and new. I really enjoyed this show. Fast and stylish, with an appropriately impressive MTV soundtrack, this is sheer entertainment. It doesn't have lofty goals--it just wants to give you a fun ride. And that it does. KGHarris, 8/11."
1,"Bubble Guppies is one of my daughter's favorites - it's educational and interesting, and she really gets into it.  Love it!"
1,"Really enjoyed this 360 view of a murder. Loved how they ended each episode with something explosive. Also liked the very flawed characters, and how those flaws got in the way of solving the crime."
1,"Packaging was done well, no missing or scratched dvd.  This series wasn't what I expected.  Thought it be funnier and more humor.  Its just another police show with drama.  Storyline are ok.  Series is not my cup of tea.  Other folks may like it, I didn't."
1,"Well, now I know what all the hype was about and why they are making a movie. Because the series was cancelled suddenly with NO ENDING!!! How dumb are these TV execs to cancel a show without allowing an ending? I must see the movie when it comes out so I know how it ends. Kudos to Kristen Bell and the guy who plays her dad (can't pronounce or spell his name) and all the friends and boyfriends. I hope we get to see all these characters again soon!"
1,Helen Mirren is absolutely the best actress. her character is thorough and  professional  the cast is as in real life-sometimes respectful of their bosses and oft times not.
1,There is only ONE Poirot and his name is David Suchet. Kudos to the other members of the ensemble cast which make this series perfect.
1,John Cleese is one of the funniest people on earth.  I wonder whether there were actual scripts for this old show.
1,"I really enjoy feeling the pressure and urgency these detectives face while trying to solve the crimes.  This show is well made, which all of us cop show junkies really appreciate."
1,"Seems like kids are being exploited.  A lot of money being spent on elaborate dresses for little kids to what end for the kids, cheap trophys and crowns?  Seems like they are really little to have to face personal rejection.  Big girls have enough issues where &#34;beauty contests&#34; are held but to hear some of the mothers telling their little ones, &#34;The judges just didn't like you&#34; is heart breaking.  I will not watch this exploitation of kids again."
1,Awesome series. My 84 year old mom and I watch it together.
1,"StarGate Universe reminds me of StarGate Atlantis that had so much potential that was missed.  When did we start making TV shows that had more action in them than story lines.  Here we have a great premise for a story line that could go on for years.  However, starting with the first episode there was no back story which leave us confused.  That is support to happen.  However, I'm half way through the first season and I'm still trying to figure that part out.  I wish they did like the Avengers movie and did a lot of background with a good amount of action.  Maybe they need to find the MASH writers for help.  Still worth the watch because it will be referred to in future StarGate movies or series.  I'm just glad Ben Browder wasn't in it.  He was good in FarScape, yet he sucked in StarGate."
1,"I had real difficulty just getting on with my life until I'd finished watching this first season. The plot held one mystery inside another until I remained in a constant quest with the hero, well played as a man who had lost his family in the 9-11 tragedy and teetered on the brink of ending his life but held by his need to solve the many layered mystery in which he had become enmeshed."
1,"Top Shot is a good as it gets.  T.V. shows in the America we live in today leave much to be desired, however Top Show is in a league by itself. It is up scale &#34;Reality&#34; with none of the silly, offensive, garbage thrown at the American people every single day.I do not often what much T.V., however Top Shot is a breath of very fresh air way above America's landfill.  John"
1,"This movie has soldiers, swords, fire and blood. That should be enough for you to watch. If it is not, there are Romans. I am not talking about the lettuce but the legion."
1,"Little Britain is a show that you will either Love or Hate...  It's Brash, Racist at times and not at all american humour...  Butttt.....It is one of Britains fummiest ever collaberations...  Watch just one episode...  I think you'll be hooked~"
1,"Don't care much for predictive cliff-hangers, but loved this one. Hard to tell the white hats from the dark, but liked the acting, characters, and ending. Too bad there isn't a sequel."
1,"This is a slow, but interesting story......I do like the characters and the story line.......just wish there was a bit more &#34;jazz&#34; to keep me interested.....the costumes,characters are great !"
1,Another fantastic season for Doctor Who. My son and I enjoyed this episode thoroughly.
1,"Great show!  I enjoy the understated English acting.  The shows are not predictable, which makes them more interesting.  Can't wait for each subsequent episode."
1,The product was in excellent condition and I got it very quickly. I'm very happy with my purchase.
1,"Watched this on the basis of seeing Benedict Cumberbatch in an earlier production and was not at all disappointed.  Ok, I am disappointed there was not a subsequent season to watch.  The Cumberbatch character returns to a much changed England to attend his brother's funeral.  Everyone now must have a personal ID card in order to buy anything, get transportation or enter any where, including your own home.  He meets his brother's wife and is instantly attracted to her.  What follows is a story of intrigue and conspiracies that keeps you guessing as to who the good guys and the bad guys are.  The end of this 5 episode series is as unpredictable as the rest of the series.  Four stars only because I really wanted to see another season."
1,"Minor spoilers!After a rough off-season for Alec Baldwin -- complete with rumors that he wanted to leave 30 ROCK and a parenting controversy that kept him in the tabloids for a spell -- and a surprisingly disappointing season premiere, both Baldwin and the show can be said to be completely back on track.  As the Amazon description reports, the A plot focuses on Jack's effort to outposition Devon Banks (marvelously portrayed by Will Arnett in a reprise of his Season One guest appearance) to become Don Geiss's replacement at GE, the parent company to NBC Universal.  The struggle is quite funny.  Devon, who is a lightly closeted gay, has ""turned straight"" and is courting Geiss's daughter.  He is also using the fact of Jack's heart attack, which he has attempted to keep quiet, to lessen his position within the corporation.  In response, Jack merely recruits a young, very handsome dude who tempts Devon beyond his powers to resist.  All in all, it is gamesmanship on a very funny level.The B plot is quite as good.  Jenna is still very overweight from all her pizza consumption during her involvement in a stage version of MYSTIC PIZZA during the summer break.  The writers attempt to take advantage of her weight gain by having her character shout ""Me want food!"" onstage, which Jenna adamantly refuses to do.  But when a skit falls apart onstage, she panicks and ad libs the line she said she wouldn't say.  Surprisingly, she is delighted when the line becomes a national catch phrase.  Suddenly, the extra weight gain, previously a liability, is now her good fortune.  Unfortunately, she now has to keep her weight up.The first episode of the season had been a serious disappointment, mainly because they stopped doing what they do well in order to restructure the episode around Jerry Seinfeld.  But this episode shows the series completely back on track.  It ramains one of the two or three funniest shows on TV."
1,doesn't quite follow the more realistic aspect of this kind of event but still a very good show. recommend watching.
1,"Hollywood is full of adaptations, sequels, prequels, remakes, re-imaginings, reboots, and spin-offs. The bottom line is that most movies hitting the big screen are familiar territory. When something original does come along, it usually ""borrows"" elements from films that influenced it or pays homage to said influential films that came before it. Truth be told, at this stage in the game, technically everything has already been done. Everything has already been written about or filmed or drawn or created digitally. All that's really left out there is the really bizarre topics. The stuff that you either think up randomly one slow Thursday evening or is obviously the result of one of the heaviest acid trips in history. I like to think that Rubber falls somewhere in the middle...of all three categories.Rubber pretty much had me at Lieutenant Chad's (Stephen Spinella) opening monologue. Hell, he gets out of the trunk of a car just to illustrate the point of ""no reason."" What makes this scene special is that it kind of breaks the fourth wall while also introducing the secondary storyline of the film. Lieutenant Chad explains what we are about to see to the camera and then it's revealed that there is a crowd of people there who are also about to watch what transpires on screen. Mind you, they're watching with binoculars and their fates are kind of questionable given the film's primary storyline, but it was one of the more unique ways to start off a film.Rubber is Robert's story. Who is Robert, you may ask? Robert's a tire; a car tire, to be precise. He wakes up one day to find out he likes to roll over anything that gets in his way, but once something more solid crosses his path like a beer bottle is when things get even crazier. Robert discovers that he has telepathic powers and he uses this gift to make things explode. It starts with a beer bottle and shifts to animals. As Robert lives life to the fullest just rolling around the desert and blowing up whatever his little nonexistent heart desires, he eventually stumbles onto a road into town where he becomes fixated with a woman. Not only that, but we get to see how his special powers work on humans...It's difficult to fully describe a film like Rubber. Its genius use of absurdity is practically overwhelming. The acting is a bit over the top at times, but really solid overall and fits the overall tone of the film like a glove. Stephen Spinella practically steals the show, but Jack Plotnick definitely has his moments. Okay, you got me. It's mostly the turkey scene and his heart to heart with the man in the wheelchair (Wings Hauser) that made Plotnick relevant. Rubber offers a little bit of everything though; comedy, drama, horror. There are a few seriously memorable one-liners buried in the film (""No, come on. It's not real life. Look at you, you have a stuffed toy alligator under your arm."") and it's kind of incredible how you almost come to understand the thought process of a car tire by the time the film ends.Rubber certainly isn't going to be a film for everyone, but you pretty much know what you're getting into with the trailer. The people who hate it probably have justifiable reasons; it's ridiculous, it's unbelievable, it's impossible; it's the dumbest thing ever. It's hard to argue with any of that, but I loved it for all of those reasons. Some people may see ridiculousness, but I saw originality, creativity, and unpredictability. Isn't that better than most of the clich&eacute; tripe that somehow makes all this money at the box office?Rubber is brainless fun covered by a veil of uncertainty. If you can accept the outlandish premise, then it's incredibly entertaining. Rubber has that same kind of vibe that Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans does; it's bizarre and eccentric on the surface, but kind of brilliant at its core. It'd probably be fair to call Rubber cheese, as well. But dammit if it's not some of the richest cheese I've ever tasted."
1,"Wow, I'm going to have to change my mind about romantic comedies being predictable.  While this one does end in a predictable way, the story is anything but that.  I'm not one who cries at movies, but I actually teared up during the sappy moments!  All the actors are great in their respective roles, and the story is funny and moving at the same time.  I was going to avoid this movie because of the lame title, but I'm glad I didn't.  I haven't read the books, but I will now.  Very nicely done!!"
1,"Although this is South Park meets Seinfeld quality stories, the characters are very predictable and the actual story lines get stale. Can't watch more than one or two at any time..."
1,"I have watched a few episodes of this series, largely because of the presence of Judi Dench and am somewhat disappointed.  It is a collection of one-liners with a horrible laugh track.  It seems terribly dated but does have the occasional clever moment."
1,I watched this once out of boredom and felt only slightly less bored when I was done. Haven't seen it enough to get a feel for the actors.
1,I even had one best friend who was an artist. Daria is timeless. There will always be young women like Daria and Jane in high school wishing they were somewhere else. I watch to have a chuckle at the absurdities of social interactions which never change down through the generations.
1,My four year old grandbaby absolutely loves Diego.  She can't get enough and learns well from the format.  Well done.
1,"Cooler than Cool Hand Luke, with a quick draw you wouldn't believe and plots that remind you of the old, good stuff. Amazon: get that latest season on our prime membership ASAP!"
1,"Thank you for the new episodes.  We have been known to watch Poirot shows more than once.  This may be common for many, but our family rarely watches a show a second time.  We do Poirot, though.  He is always interesting."
1,"Watching the ""TRAIN"" is a nightly part of our bedtime routine. Very kid friendly show, and asnightly an adult watcher _ I am happy show is nice."
1,"I came across this show for the first time and I loved it! Especially for my 12 month old daughter. She loved it as well! Normally I can't get her to sit still, especially on a show that she's not interested in so when she sat still for this, I was surprised! This is an educational children's show that she can learn from, besides her other numbers one show which is yo gabba gabba! I would recommend this show to others."
1,"I LOVE The Office, and Season 4 caps off the best 3 seasons of The Office Created. Seasons 2, 3, and 4 are absolute magic. Every episode is amazing and full of hilarious Michael Scott moments, and spectacular character depth. You will find yourself emotionally attached to the characters while still laughing out loud several times an episode. Truly brilliant television."
1,I love this series! I've watched every episode twice and am on my third viewing. There simply isn't anything to compare. I've watched Poirot acted by different actors for a few of the episodes. They are alright but nothing to get excited about. David Suchet plays the part of Hercule with impeccable taste and accuracy. He captures the character with every gesture. It is a real pleasure to watch the master at his craft.
1,I just give them 4 stars because c'mon people! They are under water and have trees and airplanes? My daughter likes the songs and they show an interesting way to learn.
1,"It would appear that there's no room for any more sci-fi on television! Really. ""V"" and ""The Event"" are gone. All that's left now is ""Fringe"" and now ""Falling Skies""! Falling Skies may not even get a second season let alone a complete first season. We'll see. Same for the comming ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome"".Sci-fi is going the way of veriety shows(extinction) and soon no network will even bother putting out a science fiction product. Not unless we pay for it ""directly""!"
1,This is a deep thriller so you'll need patience with the storyline as it eeks out clues bit by bit. To bad AMC didn't think it was worthy of a 2nd season.
1,"I didn't get much from this teaser. It was just a little too short to be a good teaser, because it was lacking in context. All the same: Its Dr Who"
1,"This is an unusual &#34;mystery&#34; series, particularly in that the plot lines are very different from most others. The stories are also quite complex and fascinating in the way they interweave mystery with WWII matters. Nearly all of the acting is top-notch, and the production values are exceptional."
1,I have ordered all the seasons of NCIS so far and have had no problems with any of the DVDs. All have come fast and when they said they would come.
1,"I LOVE this show, the writing and acting is edgy, fun, poignant, a full range of emotions.  Season one for me was rocky the first time around, was much better the second time I watched it, even then I saw improvement with each episode.  Season two shows what the show could be, and now with season three they have hit their stride!  You will not be disappointed with any season of this show."
1,"Great show.  Took me a minute to get into, but it was worth it!  Love the characters and the story line just keeps you coming back for more!!!"
1,"Sometimes you rewatch a show you liked when you were a teenager and you question the taste of your younger self. Not so with this show.Watching the show as an adult is a very different experience (I get all the jokes now, for one), and I'm very glad I decided to try it out. &#34;Daria&#34; is just as funny as it was when it was airing, but now it has an added air of nostalgia - the good kind, where you get to relive all the things you loved (and loved to hate) about the 90s in easily digestible 20ish minute chunks."
1,It is an amazing series of small episodes. Both my kids love watching it. Hope to see few more seasons.
1,"I have had customers asking for this set since June so I was more than happy to finally get it in this week. I cranked through the episodes in a few days and loved everything Toni Collette has made on screen here. Her performance was amazing and in the end, carries the set.The set is spanned over two discs with the both the PC and DVD supplements placed on disc 2, including:* Sitting Down with Diablo Cody, 2:30 minutes. An ambush style interview that had some candid and funny moments but was way too short.* Tara's Alters, 4 clips totaling 7 minutes. Each alter is briefly described by Collette or Corbett with Buck and Alice getting the longer cuts. T and Gimme only get a brief minute.* Tudors episode 301. That set is already available so I guess they are trying hard to push this series.* Sweepstakes entry, 3 minutes. A ad promo clip for travel to Collette's ""home town"" of Sydney. Have to admit I enjoyed seeing the luxury options available to one traveling in an Airbus 380.* Photo gallery. Some decent pics of on-set stuff, lasts a couple minutes.* Bios. Textual bios of the main cast and minds behind the show.PC extras: The disc loads a menu which forwards you to a website for the remaining extras.* Contrary to what the artwork and ads tell you the first two episodes of Season 3 Californication are here - not Season 2.* Podcast Interview with Collette, 2 minutes. Covers some more of her take on the series and characters. The other three interviews promised are not available.* On the set - not available.* Tudors Season 3, first two episodes.* ""More"" - could not find anything different.Overall, I think one would be buying this for watching the series only as the extras are short. The sound is selectable between 2.0 and 5.1 for the episodes, region coded 1, 2 discs in thin cases with episode descriptions in each. Solid acting and writing recommendation. Enjoy."
0,Only watched a small part of the show but the dialog and content was not the kind that I was interested in.
1,"great writing, the cast is terrific, whimsical and amusingthe storylines are interesting and the theoretical physics are...at least interestingone of the shows that starts and .... seems like 5 minutes later, it's overhave no clue (well $$) why they cut the last season out... but this is worth every second in my opinion"
1,"The storyline is interesting and in keeping with some of the hottest broadcast shows on TV - whodunit with a little personal turmoil thrown in.  Credibility is stretched a little, but is necessary to keep viewers' interest.  However, it's not so out of bounds as to be ridiculous.  Good, basic entertainment, worth the time to watch, sorry no follow-up seasons available."
1,"The final season (YES...ONLY 3!!! WAKE UP BBC!) is fantastic. While we never actually find out what happened on the now infamous fishing trip, we still feel like we are in a good place with all concerned. If this show does get legs in its American version, I do hope Ruth Jones takes a very active hand and perhaps allows us to learn more about Nessa. She is the lynch pin of the show. You never know what will come out of her mouth and G & S fans were treated to some cameos that perhaps American viewers might not have picked up on. Again, it will be fun to see how it pulls off in the States if it ever gets off the ground."
1,"The talented ensemble cast is essential in keeping the show interesting. The show features the usual hardships of white, middle class life in suburban Berkeley, California. An autistic son, an unplanned pregnancy, divorce, single mother hardship, empty nest divorces. The reason I watch is because I care about the characters. The episodes are poignant and brilliantly acted.The directing and cinematography are very good, particularly for a network television program. The writing is crisp and authentic. Each character has a unique, resounding voice. Flawed and genuine, we keep watching, wishing our family had the kind of resolve the Braverman's have.The abundance of characters allows a smooth shifting between each life, allowing more realistic events to provide entertainment, drama and comedy. Single subject sitcoms, tend to require increasing melodrama to retain viewers. Not so with Parenthood. I can't stop watching."
1,If you enjoy British television then you really need to watch this one. The acting is amazing and it is so funny in a very  believable way.
1,"I have always found Yo Gabba Gabba to be an interesting show.  My grandkids always enjoy watching the show, the songs are kinda cute and entertaining.  For kids it is definitely a cute show."
1,"I am saying the same thing I said in Season 1.  Nothing is wrong, it is enjoyable to watch, but it never quite comes together.  Everyone is working very hard to be funny and charming, but it is Judi Dench that carries this series."
1,wonderful to be able to rewatch this great series season by season and see the characters change.  Thanks so much
1,"We like these shows set in England in the 1800s and thereabouts. This one had a happy ending, which I like, but plenty of challenges to overcome along the way! The acting was good, I thought, unlike some of the period films and television shows. Sets and filming locations lent to the authenticity, as well."
1,"I have always loved Dame Agatha's writing including Miss Marple but this second series is so well done. The series starts with a 2 hour (approx) special that truly documents the primary meeting between Arthur Hastings and Poirot after Poirot escapes from Belgium ahead of Hitler. Well filmed, excellently characterized and delightful although there are aspects of the plot line that are expected, detracting from the mystery. Lots of clues, lots of red herrings and good viewing while quilting or crocheting."
1,"Wish they had continued on with this.  Husband, sons and I all enjoyed the series.  Great story line.  Seems plausible.  Makes you think."
1,Excellent classic British who done it!  Good series about a quirky detective who uses his brains to solve murders! Strong supporting cast as well!
1,"I love this series. My PBS has shown this for years, and I have seen all the shows a few times. When my PBS cancels my ATGB show from time to time, I have Amazon come through for me to give me my ATGB ""fix"" for the week. The actors make this wonderful series timeless and fun to watch."
1,"Hugh Laurie is incredibly talented as an actor, musician and singer. The other cast members are equally talented and it's quite interesting to observe their interactions while surrounded by humor, angst, drama and intelligent writing. Bravo!"
1,"Between Natalie's driving skills, the special appearance by Norman Bates, and confusion and mayhem between the Julies at the end - Wow.  HILARIOUS!!!!If you're a fan of Adrian Monk and you've never seen this episode and you want to laugh - this is THE episode to watch."
1,"The young man (played by Joaquin Phoenix) is a lonely, self-esteemed gentleman who is constantly pushed by his parents to get out of the runt he is in. Though he is good looking, soft spoken and intelligent, he just falls too easily for a wild spirited young woman who is his neighbor (played by Gwyneth Paltrow). Till the end of the movie you are surprised that he changes his luck of straw! Good Sunday fun day movie to watch."
1,"I have a special needs son and their are a few programs that if he doesn't get to see enough of one day he will pretty much just nut up. So it is a blessing and a saving grace that we are able to have these right at our fingertips to show him and the  quality is just awesome, better then my tv actually."
1,"I don't know why I love this series so much. No violence. No sex. No action, just great humor. A real love story"
1,"I was on an extended work assignment away from home when I discovered this series.  I streamed the first four seasons in the evenings there, and fell in love with the characters, the story lines, and the singing/dancing.  Delightful."
1,"South Park is my favorite show and I watch the season DVDs over and over.  Just when it seems SP has reached its peak, it keeps coming up with creative shows that cover the latest fads in our popular culture and sociopolitical consciousness.  Although ""Make Love Not Warfare"" from season 10 is still my favorite episode, season 11 provides another solid crop of classics, from the openings of ""With Apologies to Jesse Jackson"" and ""D-Yikes"" to the conclusions of ""Imaginationland, Episode III"" and ""The Night of the Living Homeless.""Disc 1:""With Apologies to Jesse Jackson""--Who can ever forget Randy Marsh's faux pas on ""Wheel of Fortune,"" the way he apologized to Jesse ""the emperor of black people"" Jackson, and his fight to ban a hateful slur from society with the help of Michael Richards and Mark Fuhrman?  Meanwhile, a midget author who speaks at the school provides amusement for Cartman and an epiphany for Stan.  Instant classic.""Cartman Sucks""--There are several peculiar incidences in this season that put into question Cartman's sexuality.  This episode is one of them.  Cartman takes a picture with a certain body part of a sleeping Butters in his mouth.  When Cartman learns what such a photo means, he tries to take another photo with Butters to reverse it, but Butters's dad walks in on them and sends his son to bi-curious camp.  Of course, SP fans know Butters's dad has some bi-curious issues of his own.  Meanwhile, Cartman must make sure the offensive photos does not get out.""Lice Capades""--It is revealed that someone in Mrs. Garrison's class has head lice and the students turn vicious with suspicion.  Of course, SP can't just scratch the surface; if you will, it needs to dig deeper by covering a louse community destroyed by the shampoo treatment.  A lot of movie references in this one.""The Snuke""--A new student arrives in class who is a Muslim and immediately sparks Cartman's suspicions.  Turns out there is a terrorist attack planned, but not by Muslims--and it involves Hillary Clinton's unmentionable.  Clinton's voice makes her sound like a down home southern gal, not a Senator from New York.  I like how so much information can be found on the Internet and the blinking 12:00 on the ""24"" clock after the power goes out.""Fantastic Easter Special""--Stan questions what easter eggs and bunnies have to do with Christ's resurrection and learns about the secret ""Hare Club For Men"" (where do they come up with this stuff?) A Da Vinci Code style mystery is unveiled and Matt and Trey get back at the head of the American Catholic League who had been critical of SP and said some anti-Semitic things in the past.  Hmmmm, the papal mitre does look like it belongs on a rabbit.  ""Hippitus, hoppitus,"" indeed.Disc 2:""D-Yikes""--I love the opening to this one!  I remember when it was first aired I struggled to stop laughing after Mrs. Garrison storms into the classroom complaining about men.  This episode is one of the funniest SPs ever.  I like when Garrison announces she's gay and Stan replies, ""Again?""  And the name of the lesbian bar is great!  I've never seen the movie ""300,"" but it's a takeoff on that.""The Night Of The Living Homeless""--SP is suddenly overrun with homeless people begging for change.  When the boys learn to mystery behind the onslaught of beggars, can they, with the help of some old school NWA & The Posse 8-Ball ""City of Compton"" style rap, save the day?Le Petit Tourette""--Cartman sees a kid cussing uncontrollably in a toy store and learns that the kid has Tourette's Syndrome (is this a subject right up SP's alley, or what?!).  Cartman is given an idea that makes him so happy he breaks out in song.  Of course, his plan backfires when he starts blurting out things that, to him, are more damaging and offensive than ""%#@& #$!!*() #%!($#@@&/.""""More Crap""--Randy Marsh passes a world record size BM.  when his record is broken, his life's quest is to get it back--but Bono is bound (if you will) to stop him.  I actually agree with the point they make about Bono, but this episode has a very nasty part--and I'm not talking about the BMs.Disc 3:""Imaginationland""--OK, the bet Cartman made with Kyle is hilarious.  I laughed to tears when I first saw it on TV, but what does it say about Cartman's sexuality?  Is that a prize a straight guy would want?  I mean, another guy performing the task?  What's up with that?  Anyway, the boys go on a trip to a land of imaginary characters--including my favorite, Pac-Man, though I don't like that he's sometimes given teeth--and it's hit with a terrorist attack.  Yes, terrorists have now attacked our imaginations.  Meanwhile, Cartman takes Kyle to court and Stan and Kyle are taken to the Pentagon for questioning.""Imaginationland, Episode II""--That opening dream sequence is from Monty Python.  The terrorists break down a wall and unleash the evil characters of our imagination and now imaginations are really running wild, especially when Cartman's demented Christmas woodland critters show up.  Stan and Kyle help the feds break through the portal to Imaginationland but, just before the troops charge in, Kyle may finally have to pay his debt to Cartman.""Imaginationland, Episode III""--With the help of Butters, the good imaginary characters set out to battle the evil ones.  Kyle has to stop the Pentagon from destroying Imaginationland before the good characters have a chance to win.  Al Gore, however, might doom everyone when he sees the evil character from his imagination.  Oh, and the Cartman/Kyle bet finally gets settled...sort of.""Guitar Queer-o""--Great!  In typical SP fashion, the importance of Guitar Hero is built up all out of proportion.  This episode shows how Matt and Trey keep up with the fads of pop culture.  I also like this episode because I'm a Kansas fan.""The List""--There's a list the girls created ranking the boys in their class from cutest to ugliest and Kyle is ranked last.  That can't be right!  Kyle is adorable!  Something must be wrong!"
1,"Heroes season 2 I think was pretty good considering that they cut it down due to that uselesss writer's strike. I mean the strike was useless, not the writers themselves. It left us with nothing but crappy reality shows through-out most of the year. Heroes season 2 told as good of a story as it could've due to the short time. It does start out a bit better than it ends though. Hiro Nakamura (Masi Oka) still steals the show. Him in the past where he meets his childhood hero Takezo Kensei (an excellent David Anders of Alias) led to some of the more engaging stuff of the season. Parkman (Greg Grunberg) finding out that his father is infact Molly's nightmareman was a little disappointing I admit. However the nightmare scenes were done well enough that I didn't care after awhile. I just wish that their was more of him since he was one of the fresher things about this season. He also was a little creepy.Speaking of creepy, Sylar (Zachary Quinto) is back but powerless. He shows that he's dangerous even without his powers though. He meets a woman with a dangerous power that kills everyone around her when her eyes turn black and bleed. She's a good person but her powers kill people and only her brother's power can control her power if that makes sense. Sylar gets in her head and makes her think that he's a good person that wants to help her. When he's really just fascinated by her power and wants it for himself. Well when he gets his back that is and he thinks Mohinder (Sendhil Ramamurthy) can help him get them back.While Peter (Milo Ventimiglia) mysteriously lost his memory and doesn't remember his brother Nathan or even having powers. He falls for a women who's brother says he can help him remmember. He wants him to use his powers for bad though before he'll help him. While Noah Bennet (Jack Coleman) moves his daughter Claire (Hayden Panettiere) somewhere to protect her from the company. He tells her to stay low. That's easier said than done when a kid there sees that she has powers. It's ok with him though since he can...fly.I was entertained by the season. It has many twists and turns. Does it all lead up to something great though in the end ? No, I can't really say that. Instead of NY being threatened by a bomb it's now threatened by a virus. While instead of Hiro seeing the future and seeing that NY is doomed, Peter does instead. So they could've been more original, it was too familiar to what we already seen in season 1. While Ali Larter has shown she can act as Nikki, she's wasted in this season with little to do.It also bugged me that some new heroes have powers that we have already seen. Such as, one can fly ""like Nathan"", while another can heal ""like Claire"". However those were probably my only problems with the season. Other than that they did what they could due to the strike and it could have been worse."
1,This is a really good show. There is great character building and the writers have created good story lines. Can't wait to watch more!
1,"The actors are all very good and story-lines enjoyable.  I happen to prefer the fast moving dialogue and divergence as the mystery evolves with each episode.  Most that enjoy new mysteries that are meticulously solved with each episode, will like this show.I'm well into Season Two and my satisfaction continues."
1,Very addictive and sometimes even very informative on different topics . writers have great sense of humor and getting very addictive
1,"I tried watching this show a couple of times and couldn't get into it.  I love everyone in the cast, but just didn't find the show funny.  I finally sat down and thought I'd give it another try.  I wound up watching the first season in on day.  It's one part &#34;The Office&#34; with it's mockumentary style along with the varied humor levels of 30 Rock.  Unlike 30 Rock, as I've watched more seasons of the show, Parks and Rec has gotten better while 30 Rock did the opposite."
1,"""Damages"" is that kind of show that has you on the edge of your seat  completely confused as to what is going to happen next and in utter surprise when you discover each piece of the truth. It was one of the best shows of last season without a doubt. The show centered around Ellen (Byrne), who begins to work in the lawfirm of Patty Hewes (Glenn Close) who is a ruthless, self-serving and completely unpredictable lawyer. She focuses her work on a class action lawsuit against Arthur Frobisher (amazingly played by Danson) for insider trading. The first scene of the first episode shows Ellen running half naked in a raicoat covered in blood in the streets of New York. In each episode we discover a new piece of the puzzle and the events that led to that first scene. The past/present technique is masterfully used making each viewer very involved in solving the mystery. The performance of actors is excellent and the show is amazing. Damages is truly a great show."
1,Probably the best bit of research is the drop off in abortions after the demise of the dictator who forced people to have unwanted children in order to create a labor force artificially. There is certainly much one can learn about the intertwining of economics and social research.
1,"I'm kind of on the fence with this one.  Going into a flick called ""Hobo With A Shotgun"" you know your not getting ""Mary Poppins"".  You have to expect buckets of blood, gore, and bullet casings.  In order for a flick like this to work there has to be a certain ironic and tongue-in-cheek sense of humor.  Director Jason Eisener tries hard perhaps too hard.  He lays the bloodshed on so heavily that after a while you become immune to it but not particularly moved by it.  His effort strikes me as that of a student filmmaker attempting a homage to grindhouse.  This is not to say that there's not some things to recommend the film.  I thought the Plague were a bloodchilling and inspired touch.  Though most of the acting is strictly amateur hour, not entirely a bad thing, Rutger Hauer's presence gives the film gravitas.  In a subtle turn, Hauer with his weathered visage projects a man who is mad as hell and is not going take it anymore.  In olden days a film like this would have been drive-in fare or play as part of some triple feature in a seedy movie theatre.  Ironically, this film had a two week run at the local arthouse.  Just goes to show you that given time certain maligned genres are bestowed legitimacy by the ""mainstream""."
1,"Even wittier and more dangerous than the previous series, these episodes get better and better. This is a hilarious addition to the previous seasons and is a must see for anyone looking for a good laugh and a modern day Sherlock in the form of a phony psychic."
1,"the movie was great. love the historical, the costumes. the acting was great. the story had great historical information. very much enjoyed the heroes."
1,"For a number of years, cable networks (USA and TNT) have been coming up with some of the best shows on television. Royal Pains is one of them. Enjoy!!!"
1,Good wholesome watching; ideal for family. The show develops its characters to the point you can't help but falling in love with all of them. Beautiful setting. Please consider watching....really worth it!
1,"Great show love all the characters & their flaws!!! Can't believe I didn't watch it sooner, Raylan Givens is the best!"
1,"i never seen this before ordering this,when i did get it i watched it and i loved it.im very happy i bought it..it was very good,ramsey is even crazier in this season."
1,"Since 1997, ""South Park"" has been a controversial but yet a longest running, highest rated hit for Comedy Central.With 195 episodes broadcast and a 14th season about to begin on March 17th, the animated series which features the children of South Park, Colorado featuring the characters of Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick and friends continues to be a series that dares ""going there"" and being as provocative as ever.In the thirteenth season of ""South Park"", the series utilizes topics that were popular in 2009.  From celebrities such as the Jonas Brothers, the death of Michael Jackson, the Somalian pirates, America's economy and more.VIDEO & AUDIO:It's important to note that for this season, I am reviewing the DVD edition and not the Blu-ray version.  While  ""SOUTH PARK"" is not exactly a series you are looking for extreme special effects or action scenes, for this latest season there is a little bit more detail and texturing and plenty of vibrant colors.As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital.  If anything, the Comedy Central intro really puts your front speakers for a challenge with its heavy bass.  But overall, dialogue is clear and again, this is not a series where you would expect any major uses of audio.  But dialogue is clear and understandable.  Music segments definitely are heard quite clearly and more pronounced.SPECIAL FEATURES:""SOUTH PARK: THE COMPLETE THIRTEENTH SEASON"" comes with mini commentaries for each episode by Trey Parker and Matt Stone.  These commentaries are short (about five or more minutes long) as they discuss the episode.  Outside of the commentaries, featured on disc one are:* Inside XBOX: A Behind-the-Scenes Tour of South Park Studios - (4:36) XBOX's Major Nelson interviews the people behind-the-scenes of the production of ""South Park"".* Deleted Scenes - (7:14) Featuring several deleted scenes from various episodes.""SOUTH PARK"" is one of those series that I've watched since my college years that I can't seem to stop watching.  No matter how far the series goes, how offensive the series may get, I don't really get upset.  It's because the series is known for pushing the button and taking things as far as Comedy Central will allow them.Granted, this is a series that pushes the button and people not familiar with ""South Park"" are going to get offended.  These episodes are uncensored and are filled with plenty of profanity and some with violence and blood and a series targeted for mature audiences.  You do not want children watching this series.A lot of the episodes from the thirteenth season has generated plenty of comments of ""oh, crap...that is so f'd up"". From the first episode of the thirteenth season with Kenny wanting oral from his girlfriend, you know where this season is headed and Trey Parker and Matt Stone try to use the topics of that year and run with it and see how far they can go.  From jokes on the Jonas Brothers, to celebrities that died in 2009, the failed economy, kids becoming pimps, the slaughter of whales/dolphins, even Cartman singing Lady GaGa's ""Poker Face""... A lot of crazy situations this season and plenty of topics the crew had to work with that year and it all comes down to one's sensibilities and if they have an open mind to comedy that has been offensively funny for the last 13 years.If you are easily offend, then ""South Park"" is definitely not for you.  But for those who have been long time fans, we enjoy the series and enjoy seeing how far Parker and Stone can go. ""SOUTH PARK: THE COMPLETE THIRTEENTH SEASON"" goes even farther than previous seasons and pushes the limit of what can be shown on cable television.  And again, each episode is featured in its uncensored glory on Blu-ray and DVD.Definitely prepare for some surprises in this thirteen season of ""South Park"" and even more of the ""oh, crap that's really f'd up!"" moments and yet another entertaining, humorous and provocative season of  ""South Park""."
1,My daughter is almost 2 years old and she really enjoys watching this and so do my boys 4.5 yrs and 6.5 years
1,"We enjoyed this series due to it's interesting plot, the quality of the scripts, the acting, and the photography. Other than that, to avoid introducing a spoiler, we leave it up to the viewer to check the synopsis which comes with each episode and then watch that episode. We don't think that you'll be disappointed."
1,"Great characters, engaging, complex mystery, outstanding acting... I wish for a season two"
0,"In the not too distant future where George Bush has somehow fluked his way into another term as president, a chemo-virus has broken out in a small town. The Z-Squad is sent in to eliminate the problem, but a member of the squad gets infected and flees. He manages to to find refuge in an underground strip club, which has also been deemed illegal by the government of the future. The soldier takes a turn for the worse and finds himself a member of the undead only to take the club's biggest star as his first victim. She continues to dance and the odd thing is...the customers love it. Zombie strippers are the new sex appeal. As the money piles up, so do the victims. Will the chemo-virus continue to spread and if so...how will it be contained?First of all, don't be confused. This is movie is one of the cheesiest films ever. I almost turned it off several times and I honestly can't tell you why I'm reviewing this thing. The sad thing is it's like a trainwreck in slow motion. You can't look away from it once you start watching and you have to see not only how it's going to end, but who's going to make it out alive. Not that you really care, but you wonder whose really deemed worthy of surviving said trainwreck. It is ludicrous, ridiculous, and absurd...but it's amusing as hell.How ridiculous is it? Let's see...strippers being turned into zombies and becoming super strippers, zombies being sexy, having the most stereotypical Mexican janitor...ever, the casts biggest names being Jenna Jameson and Robert Englund, special effects you'd find in Xena: Warrior Princess, a Christian stripping for her nanna, Jenna Jameson shooting ping pong balls and pool balls out her...well...I'll let you see that for yourself, angry dragons, and foamy chewbaccas...the list goes on and on. I'm sure I missed so many more. The sad thing is that despite being the cheesiest of cheese and being as bad as it is, there's still a few good things buried under the cheese. It's kind of like an enchilada made with cheap cheese. All the cheap stuff is on the outside, but there's some good stuff on the inside. The most obvious being that there's a lot of nudity in this, which is good because it'll probably be one of the only things that'll keep anyone watching. Robert Englund's over the top performance as the germophobic strip club owner is pretty memorable. Also, the make-up effects are surprisingly good at times. The special effects are horrid, but the make-up is actually better than you think it'd be.In a film as ridiculously cheesy as this, I can't blame anyone if they turn it off before it reaches the half hour mark. The thing is though if you stick with it, it's actually enjoyable because it's so bad. It's cheesy, it's amusing, the acting is so bad that you'll be quoting it for days, the plot is pointless, and it even has a weak attempt at a twist in the ending! My point is that it's a bad film and I'm not defending it, but if you manage to sit through the whole thing...you may find yourself enjoying parts of it like I did.Rating: 4/10(most people will probably rate it a 1/10...if that)"
1,"Season two of this hit show picks up four months after season one ended.  The Bennett family has relocated to California were Noah has a new job at a paper company, a real one this time.  Daughter Claire is supposed to be staying below the radar so The Company can't find them.  But with a new boyfriend with a special power of his own, that's harder than it appears.Meanwhile, Matt Parkman and Mohinder Suresh are living in New York City were they take care of Molly, who is having visions of a very bad man.  Mohinder has gone to work for The Company, but he is working with Noah to try to take it down from the inside.Hiro has stayed in feudal Japan as he attempts to help his childhood idol Takezo become the hero of legend.The Petrelli family is going through a dark time as older brother Nathan blames himself for what he thinks happened to Peter.  Unknown to him, however, Peter is alive and well and living in Ireland.  The only problem is, he's lost his memory.Then there are siblings Maya and Alejandro are heading to the US hiding a terrible secret.  But when their paths cross with Sylar, things take a dangerous turn....This season will forever be known as the season affected by the strike.  Instead of the regular full season, we only got 11 episodes.  That made some fans happy, however, since they complained bitterly about the show.  Frankly, I was just as hooked on the unfolding story as I was during the first season.  And acting and special effects continued to be great.The main complaints most people had centered on the fact that the characters were spread out all over the country again.  Yeah, it would have been nice if they were together.  But the different storylines were a draw of season one.  I bet if we had been given a full season, we would have seen everyone come together.  These complaints were leveled even more against the new characters, especially Maya and Alejandro.  Yes, I found their storyline bazaar.  But with Sylar involved, I was certainly hooked on it.  I did get very tired of Hiro's trip back in time, however.  That shouldn't have lasted nearly as long as it did.The creator himself as acknowledged many of the problems with this season.  Hopefully, that means we'll get a stronger season three.  While not as strong overall as the first season, I was certainly entertained.  And you will need the background to understand season three.So if you want to join the phenomenon this fall, get this set to catch up on the previous story today."
1,Watched it for Kevin Hart and only Kevin Hart!  He makes me laugh.  The best comedy comes from pain and Kevin does his comedy with a huge heart.
1,each episode is unique in itself and you want to see more. the families have a big responsibility of protecting their men in service and keeping quiet about the unit. the men in the field are quick and respond with efficiency. as I said it's a must see. good writers and excellent actors. I didn't want the last episode to end. I wanted more and to see molly and her husband reunite.
1,"not really in to paranormal shows, but this was ok. The &#34;canned&#34; feel of the shows reminds me of so many other such shows."
1,I like the loger storyline rather than every episode is another solved crime. They are solving it in a more realistic timeline.
0,"I seriously do not mean to offend anybody who enjoys this cartoon, or anybody responsible for its production. That is the last sort of thing that I would intend to do. I grew up watching SpongeBob SquarePants cartoons, and I was so familiar with the few episodes that were around back at that time that I was able to follow along with the dialogue contained within them. These episodes can still be quite funny, but they are lacking in the charm that helped to achieve spectacular fame for the series and a remarkable fan base. This is not the SpongeBob I remember. Buy the earliest seasons. SpongeBob SquarePants just isn't as loveable as it used to be."
1,I am elated when they began releasing Poirot in Blue-Ray. You can't go wrong with this.Keep 'em coming..I want them all!
1,"Season 2 of Eureka was just as good as Season 1. The writing was tighter, the acting was smooth. There were a lot more one off plot driven shows rather than multi-episode story arcs but very enjoyable. I highly recommend the entire run and Season two is a fine addition to both your collection and the show."
1,"Possibly the best police drama series since &#34;police story&#34;  and &#34;naked city&#34;. Filmed on location in and around LA and using real people along with actors, the show purports to show what goes on during a shift and how it impacts on the life of cops who have problems of their own."
1,"When I saw that these famous authors were going to be talking about cases they found fascinating enough to write into novels/true crime, I was quite excited. And the stories were interesting, but the editing of the video was awful. There are numerous repetitions where the time could have been much better used to give more detail or information. The idea is a great one. The execution was fair."
1,"It is a bit odd but cute.  It was pretty clean but for a few words, one of which was the f word.  It was pretty funny at parts.  My husband and I enjoyed it for the most part."
1,"I found this show by accident and fine it hilarious. I love Hyacith, Richard and the rest of the family.  A well written and acted show .  I miss some of the dialog due to the accent but the more I watch the better I understand.  A very funny sitcom."
1,I love Team Umizoomi as much as my 3 year old. We have watched season 1 over and over again and the other seasons you have to pay for. Well they finally gave us a break and made Team Umizoomi Season 2 available for Prime to view for free. We are definitely enjoying continuing to see what the team has been up to.
1,My granddaughter watches this show and series every time she comes over. Great for all ages.Wish II had this when I was a child.
1,"I like the actors and the story line, even if it is a little farfetched. Sci Fi right? I am still waiting to see if the director is a doll."
1,My daughter absolutely loves this show. 2 years old and probably the show she asks for the most. If your child likes Dora and Bubble guppies they may like this one two
0,"I've enjoyed watching this show for three seasons but this third season is problematic. Hank and his cohorts are all over the map. Also, the medical conditions are getting more and more bizarre.  This episode of the man passing out every time he gets in front of his new painting is a case in point.  The answer became so complicated that I began to lose interest.  This is also what is happening with the characters' lives. Plus there are now way too many characters and plotlines. Someone needs to put on the brakes with this series before it implodes,"
1,"Ike Oden, DVD Verdict --The scenarios for each episode are more or less your typical sitcom fare: the boys scheme to pass a drug test, the boys lie to some girls in order to get dates, the boys spend a night locked in their office, etc. Workaholics knows this well-worn territory intimately and filters it through a haze of drugs, pop culture obsession, and frat boy perversion. Scatology, substance abuse and sexual deviance drive Workaholics' creative engine not as gratuitous gross-out humor but as serious philosophical and personal issues for our protagonists. Pop culture is approached with a similarly solemn face, meaning boys don't reference Nickelodeon's Double Dare, Dateline's ""To Catch A Predator"" and The Insane Clown Posse as one-off jokes, but as major story points within episodes.None of these innovations would coalesce if actors/creators Anderson, DeVine, and Holm didn't have such spectacular comedic chemistry with one another. The trio created the show after accumulating years of improv and viral video experience together, making their ""best friend"" interplay organic and believable. Each represents a different archetype of buddy comedies--Holm is the responsible one, Anderson is the quirky guy, and DeVine is the clueless leader. With the meta use of their own names and storylines culled from real life experiences, the guys are play stylized versions of themselves (comparable to Larry David's work in Curb Your Enthusiasm) giving the show a naturally spontaneous feel that's refreshing in a sitcom.This meta premise also adds extra dimensions to the characters, letting the performers take their characters down roads that border skirt the lines of insanity and narcissism without freeing the characters of conscious and empathy. They're bros, after all, and always rely on the bond their friendship to claw their way out of whatever ridiculous problem they face each episode. Unlike the characters populating the similarly anarchic It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, it's hard not to sympathize with stoners like Blake, Adam, and Anders. They love each other, and we love them for it.Great praise must also be showered upon the show's writing. Dialogue consistently crackles with pseudo hip-hop slang and some of the most creative profanity ever realized on the small screen. Not only that, but the show's ability to consistently subvert audience expectations without relying on gimmicks or false plot twists deserves a rousing applause. Though their numbers are too large to list here, accolades must be given to the writing staff and showrunners of Workaholics as some of the freshest comedy writing on television.As if I couldn't recommend Workaholics enough, Comedy Central comes through with a DVD absolutely stacked with content.The technical specs check out solidly. The show is shot on a fairly small budget, so the somewhat fuzzy 1.78.1 transfer won't blow minds, but proves serviceable for a shot-on-digital show about workaday potheads. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track fares a little better, boasting very clear dialogue and a thumping hip-hop theme that you'll never tire of hearing.The extras that are where Workaholics: Season One really shine. Included in the set is cast interviews, deleted/alternate scenes, Workaholics digital originals, a live Workaholics sketch (as performed at Bonnaroo), outtakes, and (fittingly inebriated) audio commentaries for each episode. Rather than pick apart each extra bit-by-bit and step on the jokes, I will only say every supplement sampled here made me laugh as hard as the show itself. If the bonus material is to be trusted, the Workaholics crew are just as hilarious outside the show as they are on it. For fans, the extras are a veritable feast of funny that spans several hours beyond the episodes featured.-Full review at dvdverdict.com"
1,I love anything Stargate!!!!!  One of the very few scifi series left on tv.....sad  :o(
1,"The same exciting cast, with Kadee Strickland (Charlotte King) offering the best performance.  However, there are signs of fatigue among the show's writers:  Many episodes are downright depressing, characters have more or less all slept with each other, and many twists in the plot are difficult to believe.  For example, why would a doctor recommend a procedure that puts his patient at a major risk of dying?  Why would a hospital administrator allow a relative to get into a patient's room, in defiance of a judge's order, knowing that the relative will unplug the machine?  Can a surgeon in the middle of a procedure decide to stop and have his patient die because he just found out that the patient was the cause of an accident involving the surgeon's daughter? Have the writers never heard of lawyers? Have they no knowledge of the hippocratic oath? And, what's with the cat??!!"
1,Pawn Stars is one of our favorite TV programs.  It is very educational especially when they bring in experts to verify items that have been brought in by customers.  We have learned a lot from watching this program.
1,Has an excellent story line with awesome characters. Has that wild west appeal for me. Relaxing to watch but at the same time  puts you on the edge of your seat by the end.
1,one of the more realistic survival shows. From my knowledge of primitive survival These guys are the most realistic. The knowledge that Cody demonstrates and the calmness in which he goes about his day to day survival is amazing.
1,"Leonard, Penny, Raj, Howard, Sheldon make this the best show on TV. No swearing, somewhat educational, geeks rule is a great message. Will buy every season ever made."
1,"Ong Bak 2 was a surprise in many ways.  Gone is Tony Jaa's usual nice guy out of water routine, which has been replaced with supreme Bad @$$, with very little dialogue, and a thirst for blood.  Also, rather than his usual fist fights (and knees), he's using a lot more weapons this time around, making the intensity of the fights better.  In this, this movie shows him evolving in both character and as an action star.  Sadly, the plot hasn't evolved much, really more of an excuse to have fights than anything else.  However, I will say that the end of the film has me looking forward to the third, in terms of plot and development.  Which leads me to the big surprise of the movie (potential spoiler) it ends with a cliffhanger, clearly intending a third movie (out this year it seems) (end spoiler).  The only real complaint I have with this movie is calling it Ong Bak 2.  There is no relation I found between the first and second, in any way.  Maybe the link will be found in the third.Overall, if you've seen any previous Tony Jaa movie, you'll know what to expect: great action, awesome stunts, minor story.  It won't let you down, and it will entertain.  Recommended."
1,"This show keeps my 1.5y/o entertained and presents situations she is experiencing (sharing, manners, etc).  While Its not my favorite kids show, it's easy to watch and we enjoy when the puppets have their little side stories."
0,It started off ok and then it became silly and predictable so my husband I decided not to continue watching it.  The acting was ok but the story line well you can figure it out right away.
1,"And the characters are so well defined and the acting is more than competent. The story is a lot of fun although it becomes a little convoluted in later seasons. Everybody drinks hard alcohol all day, they all carry guns and don't hesitate using them. Character Boyd Crowder is irresistible - bad on steroids. He's just scary. Spectacular acting."
1,Our four pre-schoolers and we love Oswald!  It's a calming show with no violence that really holds their attention. I'm so glad we found it among the other great kids shows on Amazon Instant Video.
1,"I own all seven seasons of The Shield; if you like the show, this was one of the better seasons."
1,"You just can't get a better show for kids. These folks know what they are doing:) Glad its still on the air, I can relive good memories from my own childhood with my own daughter now."
1,"I'm enjoying this series (I don't watch enough TV to know if it's been renewed) and if there's a second season, I'll watch that. There's a lot of drama that borders on melodrama, but hey, we are dealing with teenagers here, so high emotions and melodrama are de rigueur, right? The show is well cast, with good looking people, so on the eye candy factor alone, it is well worth watching. That said, the acting has been good as well.  And while I am getting tired of zombies and vampires and all creatures supernatural, the werewolves in this show haven't bored me yet."
1,"I am giving Dollhouse Season 1 four stars for the concept of wiping memory, replacing it with the memories of others in order to fulfill a mission. Episodes so far are rather simplistic, but seem to be getting more complex the more that I watch. Interesting science fiction series, which is more than I can say of others over the past decade or so."
1,"Is it so weird that a carTOON is better than live action shows on air?  Am I! trying to sound like Archer?? Only in the lightbox of my mind.What is there to say except Archer delivers painless fun - but I have to watch it with subtitles in order to get all the jokes.The extras are HORRIBLE including the unwatchable unaired pilot (it's intentional, I know) and the tedious animation background info - okay, the work is a slog.  What insights!"
1,"Yul is a great Survivor and is the mastermind of the entire season and deserves to win. Jeff Probst declares he was disappointed that Ozzy didn't win because of how well he dominated all the challenges. Ozzy is one of the best players to ever play the game and his game is pure according to Yul. He doesn't screw anyone in his alliance over and physically is a step above anyone else in the game. Yul is much smarter than Ozzy and gets more respect from the other players. Jonathan Penner is pretty funny and owns Probst in some of the back and forth at challenges. In the start of the game the tribes are divided by ethnicities into 4 tribes, which has never happened in Survivor. After the Asians dominate the first 2 challenges the tribes are mixed up. The hidden immunity idol plays a big role in this season. It's pretty cheap that you get to play it after the votes are read, so the person with the idol never gets any votes. This is a great season of Survivor, you should buy it."
1,Books and movies that are not predictable are my favorite. This movie took me awhile to catch on to the premise so I gave it a good rating. The beginning drags only because it is out of sequence to the story. It takes time to get used to the back and forth of the story line and then it hits you what is going on. At that point everything makes sense. I'm trying not to give anything away so details about the story won't be given here. I would suggest this movie to anyone who enjoys something different.
1,Good informative series. In you like to take things apart. You will love this show. Kids can learn a lit
1,Good action and funny situations.It had action.Like a sexy Get Smart. Some real life situations. More real life that get smart.At times thought I was watching a tv show on CBS.
1,"This movie contains a collection of characters that seem impossible in real life even if I actually do think they exist.  I do wonder how many find each other.  While this may be a passable comedy, it wasn't very entertaining.  I found myself cringing when the Paul Dano character holds up a bra as if seeing if it fit. His door is open at his college office.  Now you just know he's going to be found out.  That whole cross-dressing story line seemed terribly unnecessary.  The real focus should have been on Henry played nicely by Kevin Kline.  He was interesting.  Katie Holmes, making a rare appearance as an actress since she became a mommy, plays her small role with low key elegance.  The movie, while a modest time waster, is well made from a production standpoint.  Just not my cup of tea."
1,The Unit season 4 has really up'ed the ante for a secret military action packed series.  I have not always cared for the wives part in the series but was amazed with a well put together series that showed their intelligence and &#34;stand by your man&#34; character.  It got a 5 star rating because it produced a solid written story that was interesting and amusing. It caused me to become addicted to what happens next.  A great series you won't want to miss.
1,One of the best shows ever on tv. It's not the same without Kyra. I bought all 7 seasons! The Closer offers pretty much everything!
1,"If you like adventure survival shows this is for you. Very well edited with just enough humor, drama and survival challenges. What makes it so interesting these are real people in a real tough situation, thinking as htey go, to survive."
1,"The other streaming Net service has removed some great kids' shows lately, and to my knowledge never had Little Bill to begin with, so it's a treat to find it here."
1,"If the value of a story is to draw one from enjoying the story to wishing the characters lived on your block, then Jam and Jerusalem was a terrific success. My only hope is that BBC decides that this is one show worth bringing back at a later time."
1,"Season 1 did more for me than season 2.At its core, it's the same formulaic cop show that ever station on TV has 40 copies of, and has been showing nonstop since 1998.  However, it puts an X-Men-ish spin on the crimes themselves and the people solving them, and it makes the characters more dynamic, and the resulting cases a lot more fun.  The dialogue is perfectly servicable - no one's gonna think they're watching HBO, but it's equal or better to any of the swathe of Criminal Minds, Numbers, etc. shows that are on these days.Good (but not great) cast of characters.  The autistic kid who can see electromagnetic spectrums was by far the most fun character in the show, with the lead Doctor a close second.  As you can tell from my review, written 6 days after finishing the series, the names weren't exactly distinctive enough to make a memorable impression.Solid show - especially considering that it was a Syfy original!"
1,"Best military series on TV, someone missed the boat when they cancelled this one"
1,I wish there was more.  Loved the series.On a side note Amazon's video quality seems to have improved from just a few months ago.  They need to work on their app for the Roku 3.
1,"I was kind of skeptical, mainly because I really liked Christopher Eccleston in Season 1, but Season 2 was no disappointment."
1,"This is my first time giving Foyle's War 4 instead of 5 stars.  It isn't that the stories aren't great, but that following his resignation, there seems to be an emptiness as to Sam and as to Milner.  By 4 stars, I'm not even saying that the episodes are merely &#34;good&#34;.  They are better than that; just not eye watering for me as were the other 5 seasons.  I was late to discover this series and I took in the first 5 seasons in weeks instead of months or years.  I may merely be showing anxiety at nearing the end of the line.  With season 7, I'll just have to pace myself better.  I hope this helps."
1,"While I like seeing the real Roman life and it's politics and social nuances, it gets a bit boring after a while. There is little or no action and drama seems to have escaped it unharmed. It's sort of a glossy documentary? No narration, just great costumes and sets with very talented actors saying their lines and hitting their marks."
1,"It was what it was.  With approximately a billion jokes tailored &#34;for the fans,&#34; it's an easy pass if you aren't already a fan of the series.  There isn't much of a story here, and it about equals the quality of the show it's based on.  That said, if you're a fan, you'll probably enjoy it and laugh harder than everyone else in the room.  It'll make you intolerable to everyone else, but you'll feel special."
1,"I am dreading the day I have to say good-bye to this series. The only character I don't like is Foyle's son who is very cocky. Sam warms your heart as does Foyle himself. I have loved this series as well as others from BBC. Watched The Grand, London Hospital and Downton Abbey. I don't watch regular TV anymore."
1,Season 6 has been eclipsed my more modern series such as Lost. The formulaic plotline is old hat and getting long in the tooth. 24 was a groundbreaker but is okay for my treadmill workouts.
1,I enjoyed watching the 4th season of In Plain Sight. This was a very funny and entertaining season. Always makes me laugh.
1,"Up to season 5 House was known as focusing a lot on the comical witticisms of House as he insulted his colleagues and his boss. This particular season takes a more serious turn, and although there does exist the comedy that it's famous for, there is a more serious aura around the entire season and its characters as all is not well in the land of Dr. Gregory House. For a medical drama, House is pretty special as it retains a very formulaic style of storytelling and wholly stays away from soap opera dramatics; instead replacing them with casual love stories, complex medical cases and an even more complex main star.Just when we think we know House, the show takes another massive turn and shows us a completely different side to him that we never thought existed. Season 5 seeks on exposing a new emotional side to House. At the end of season 4 we saw the end to Wilsons girlfriend, Amber and what we are lead to believe to be the friendship of House and Wilson. Season 5 opens with our worst fears, Wilson quits and tells House that they can no longer be friends and in order for Wilson to be truly happy, he must have House out of his life.In comes a private investigator hired by House to spy on Wilson in his new life and also his team. The split doesn't last for long and House & Wilson end up back to their old tricks of childish friendship antics. Chase & Cameron gain a more prominent role in this season as their relationship is explored in more detail as Cameron struggles with the possibility of a permanent relationship as she still can't let go of the memories of her husband who died a few years prior to their relationship. This presents a higher purpose for them still remaining in the opening title sequence and hopefully, this increased prominence will mean they become a stronger part of the team in season 6.Thirteen is also forced to struggle with the fact that she has Huntington's disease, and to a certain point takes it very badly. Foreman also gains a bit more purpose in this season and develops a relationship with Thirteen, but I felt like this relationship was only brought into the picture to avoid having to fire him as even now his presence just seems pointless. Taub and Kutner are their usual selves with nothing really important happening to them other than House torturing Taub over his affair. There are quite a few delightful surprises that take place during the season, some are more important than others, but they're all designed to keep us watching to the next episode.As with every TV show, the finale is always the most special episode that will keep you wanting more up to when the next season starts. House is no exception to that rule and although most TV shows may create a cliff-hanger to keep you wanting more, they would also wrap a few stories up so they don't have to be revisited. House very rarely does that. Instead it gives us riveting cliff-hangers that makes us question the true brilliance of what we have seen, yet if you're not a fan of the primary cliff-hanger, there's also a few other stories that you will want to know what happened next. This is a truly brilliant season that exposes a more emotional and loveable side to House that have only briefly been explored in previous seasons. There is one massive shocker that most reading this review will have probably heard about by now, but it's just an overall great season and worthy of any House fans DVD collection."
1,This Animated story is very well done. It expands the interesting cover ups of governments in all nations to hide the truth about aliens from the people. No wonder the Doctor has to come and help us so much as a people.
1,"I passed this series up more than one time thinking it was just another reality show.  When I finally did give it a shot, I was hooked!  Having watched the first season on Netflix, I knew I had to buy the rest to find out what enterprising shenanigans Michael could come up with next.  I really really don't like the way the last season ended.  I think it was a rip off to &#34;set aside&#34; a very big part of this series in a two hour dvd that isn't part of the original seasons."
1,"Season two ended with the murder of Caitlin Todd by the double agent Ari.The NCIS team is not going to allow this to go unpunished and the first two shows deal with this.Former Mossad intelligence officer Ziva David's replacement of Caitlin is not without problems as the team deals with both loss and acceptance.Complicating matters is a new director that has a romantic past with Gibbs.This season the Director of NCIS moves out of the shadows and into the light.  From now on, the Director is a full-fledged character and an important part of the story.Tony, Tim, Abby, Ducky and Jimmy are perfect in their roles.Jethro is boss, maverick and teacher while being larger than life.The cases are engrossing, complex and intelligent.The on-going interactions and personal stories support the show and fit the characters.This is an excellent series and this is an excellent season."
1,"surprisingly good shnow.  didn't expect to like it,  but I do. would like to find more shows similar to this one."
1,"Team Umioomi is a bit derivative; it uses the same conventions as Dora and other shows to ask kids to participate. However, the pattern and geometric object recognition aspects are wonderful introductions to mathematics. The episodes are never &#34;scary&#34; and they always seem to have a positive emotional outlook."
1,"The Bones tv series is a great show.  David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel work so good together and even though it is a crime drama, there are also plenty of light moments that will make you laugh.  I love it and hope this series goes on for many more seasons."
1,"I am watching each season of 24 on Amazon Prime Video and thoroughly enjoy each season. The twists and turns in each story are amazing, plus the shows give you mystery, action, love, betrayal, and so much more. It can take some time to get through an entire season because there ARE twenty-four 45 minute episodes. But whatever time you have to devote to this series is well worth it."
1,"Really enjoying this show. I am sad to say I missed it when it originally aired.Happy I haver found it again. For the most part, all the characters are smart and well written. No one does anything stupid or unbelieveable. Good to see TV writers are actually thinking before they write."
1,An excellent program! Can't get enough of watching the U.S. Marshal service hunt down and capture wanted felons and murderers. A great show.
1,This years' series is not as good as previous years. Bought it thinking that it would be.
1,am almost a fanatic when it comes to viewing DOCTOR WHO.will enjoy all issues of the doctor. watching season 3 now
1,I have always heard that Chicago has been a very corrupt city. This series focuses on some of the corrupt practices. I keep wondering what the current situation is in the windy city? Can be any where as bad as the show portrays? I am assuming the show has overdone this. It is still very entertaining.
1,Parts of you  want the gator to get free and get away.  Yet it is cool to see such a massive creature over taken by a person less than a quarter its weight.
1,I love Justified and this season I thought was even better! Everything moves quickly and the gritty nature of the show continues in season 2. I have binged watched season 1 and 2 with my wife pretty quickly and we can't wait for Season 3
1,"The 3rd season with Earl and his friends is as funny and crazy as the previous ones! If you like dark & dirty humor, then here's the show for you!"
1,"This show is amazing. So many talented performers putting a great musical-comedy every week. Seems impossible to do. These actors and writers are the best in TV. I'm not into much current television, but this show surely brightens my evening. Everyone should give it a chance. You think this shows not for you? You're probably wrong. Haven't loved a program so much since Buffy went off the air. Instant classic. Up there with Buffy, Twin Peaks and a couple of other landmarks. Give it a shot."
1,"Dexter Morgan - blood Spatter Expert and Serial Killer. He's been living a double life for a while now and has kept that paart of himself shelves and out of the way. The only person who knew was someone from his past, and that person taught him a great many things on staying alive in such a mad world. Dexter also has a squad of people aroudn him you will get to know, a sister you will get to know even more, and a case you will grow to love featuring The Ice Truck Killer. In this episode we see Dexter (and see the overlap better book 1 and this season) and the way he sees blood, not to mention the Dark Passenger. We also see the ITK and the way he kills and the way Dexter admires the person's style.Its like living in Dahlmerland - that's how the book put it - except there are no rides (thank goodness).M.C. Hall is the PERFECT Dexter. After 3 seasons of him I can say he is the reason that Dexter connects with people and is not a monster to us. Watch the show - you will see. Jennifer C - his sister Deb - is also a unique personality here and you will grow to enjoy her. She has a sailor's mouth and keeps in shape and loves to pick the wrong type of people. She plays it to a tee. And the rest of the cast are great as well and, if you think you know how it all ends because you read the book, you are wrong. The book and this are different in a lot of ways AND the end is a strong part of it. So, readers, watch this as well.Closing this up, the twists and turns are great and learning about Dexter's past is a wild ride. You learn a lot in this season, too, and you see how Dexter was ""made."" You also see other things, bits that are spooky and the things he does away with, making you wonder exactly what the Dark Passenger is doing riding shotgun with Dexter.So many rules - so many graves. He is in the perfect place to be himself, that's for sure."
1,They did a nice job.  Characters were interesting.  Plots plausible and stimulating.  Good resolution to issues.  Dialog allowed to be genuine.
1,"Fans of Phyllis Logan, who plays Mrs. Hughes on Downton Abbey, will enjoy seeing her in this show. She plays the often tough, but ultimately heroic Squadron Leader Helen Knox. The story has a few puzzling twists, and there's way too much military trigger-happiness. The sets have that ""BBC Drama"" familiarity, yet they somehow seem out-of-place for this story. Nonetheless, if you like Phyllis Logan and/or Downton Abbey, then this show is definitely worth watching!"
1,I haven't personally seen it. My daughter watches it. I hear the songs on it though and like it. My daughter doesn't watch something again if she doesn't like it. However I've seen her watch this over and over again.
1,IT is an enjoyable series and the leading man is a different kind of law enforcement character.  If you like different twists and turns you will enjoy Justified
1,At first I thought this might be way tooo nerdy but honestly after a few episodes I'm really enjoying the series.  It's light yet portrays an Aspie really well.
1,"Bring it back!!! This is the fourth time I've watched it and every time I watch it, it's like the first time! My favorite HBO series period.!"
1,I was looking for something new and had never heard of this series.  I liked the concept of an alien race living among thepopulation and thought the government response to every real or imagined threat was accurate.  The cast was very good.
1,"5-star rating simply because it's an interesting, intriguing, suspenseful, engrossing program with an early hook that keeps you coming back for more. Recommend to anyone that likes to get involved with their entertainment viewing."
1,"Madonn!  What a way to go!  Time to Say so long to a certain cable company's saga of an Italian-American Family neck deep in a certain Subculture. It'sSeason 6- The final 21.As we reach this TV milestone let's review what we've learned from the Sopranos:  the Family comes first, never break a soldier's oath, beware of Cousins from Italy, a little therapy never hurts (just don't deface your therapist's magazines), the Don't-ask-Don't tell policy works best for mob wives and goomars, you don't have to eat every dish of Rigatoni, e.g. don't sleep with the Boss' ex-mistress, 'Made men' shouldn't play competitive Monopoly and absolutely do not be a Rat!An amazing final season for one of TV's all-time finest! The Saga of Jersey crime fam comes to a close as  Tony borders on life and death after season opener. Anthony Jr. Struggles with the burden of avenging his father and begins to go to dark places as the season progresses. Johnny gets a prison day-pass for his daughter's wedding just long enough to lose all street cred. Artie and the restaurant are struggling.  Paulie learns he isn't who who he thought he was and Vito, is outted, goes into hiding in New Hampshire. ER's Julianna Margulies briefly joins the cast as goomar and enabler to Chris, who continues his Hollywood pursuits as his Mobster/Horror film Cleaver is final released ...&#34;F' Ben Kingsley. Danny Baldwin took 'em to F'n actin'school.&#34;Uncle Junior has been committed, begins running a game there and has other troubles fitting in at 'the home.' Phil Leotardo, now running Brooklyn in Johnny's stead, continues to break balls & press Tony's buttons but still has time to talk to Vito Junior leading to Tony doing some counseling of his own. Tony must deal with his lack of remorse over his part in the death of another friend. All this and the Feds are hot to nail Tony's gang, but not as hot as the Brooklyn gang. It's all come down to this, measures are taken... mistakes are made... a blood bath ensues.. Seriously.There are no weak stories this season. &#34;Join the Club&#34; & &#34;Mayham&#34; are two amazing episodes, mid-season closer Kaisha is terrific. Mid-season opener &#34;Soprano Home Movies&#34; was excellent.  &#34;Stage 5&#34; is  Johnny Sack heavy but good, This season Anthony Jr Blanca/collage/therapy arc is over heavy but it's mercifully Meadow light (and then she's only cheering A.J. up, but at least it's not moaning about Finn). &#34;Remember When&#34; are &#34;Walk like a man&#34; are solid. &#34;Kennedy & Heidi&#34; is a terrific ep when the asbestos hits the fan and Tony goes on a Vegas vision quest. In &#34;Second Coming&#34; there's more than one scene that will make even tough guys cringe, but the Sopranos never shies from showing the violence. &#34;Blue Comet&#34; has some of the most stylistic executions of the entire series.  In spite of all internet debate on the subject &#34;Made in America&#34; is an ok closer for the series run.The throwaway line at the Cleaver Film premiere: &#34;The Sacred & the Propane&#34; ... Exemplifies the series itself high crime drama opposite the darkly funny. As my 15th anniversary re-screening comes to a close I gotta say the series, as a whole, has aged well like a fine italian wine... It means what it means."
1,"This British sitcom about life in the small English town of Clatterford is penned by Jennifer Saunders of Ab Fab fame. It I enjoys a cast of who's who of British Comediennes. It revolves around the eccentric group of women involved in the church guild of the small town. Sue Johnston plays Val the central character a nurse for the town doctor who happens to be her husband and who is widowed in the first episode. Her best friend, the bitingly funny Irish woman Tip is played brilliantly by Pauline  Mclynn. She works in the medical dispensary with Val and knows the medical secrets of the entire town. Dawn French (of French and Saunders) plays Rosie the town's lovable split personality with warmth and humor.  Joanna Lumley plays  elderly blue blooded Delilah in the first season a deaf and clueless eccentric.  Rounding out the Ab Fab team is Saunders herself playing name and double entendre dropping horsewoman Caroline. The list just grows from there  as the women of the guild get up to lots of trouble trying to cut a swath in the ever changing modern world. This series has plenty of heart seasoned with wickedly funny situational comedy, a real character driven piece."
1,"This is the premature end of a really great series. It was probably the best on TV since The West Wing. Like the WW it had a great cast, strong writers and great directing. The only real problem with Boston Legal globally was besides the 3 main characters, the continuous change in the secondary characters between all seasons. This led to the loss of mainly some great female characters that were indispensable. This was in line with Ally McBeal where characters disappeared between seasons without much explanation. This has been the main problem with the series since it has not permitted continuity. Otherwise the series has been perfect. The acting from Shatner, spade and Bergen is simply wonderful. The series does end in a slightly weird manner but weird episodes was a recurrent phenomenon in thie series as well as in Ally McBeal. All I can say is may they all live happey together but we will miss them."
1,Mysteries are interesting.  The tension between Robson and the tall blond is good but not always believable.  She often seemed uncomfortable.
1,While the finale of the series could be call ambiguous it also left a decent ending that will still leave many fans of the series happy enough so there should be little disgruntlement felt by them.  This season saw the removal of Sam Carter as leader of Atlantis and the Representative of the IOA placed in charge though he isn't the puppet many expect him to be. Also we see a much stronger showing of some of the background characters which is appreciated especially since this is the final season I guess the writers and producers felt that those characters deserved that.  While we say goodbye to this sci-fi series which started weak but ended strong a sad farewell you can add this series to your other t.v. show dvd collection to watch again at your leisure and for the price very much worth it....
1,"Poirot is always the best!  You will never guess who the culpret is.  Always give him 5 stars.  You will positively love the plots, the background, the estates used, the costumes, in a word, all."
1,first few episodes pretty interesting. but as the season moves forwardthe plots are not as interesting and dont develop as much as they could.
1,As much as I love this series the buyer should be aware that Amazon is slow in downloading the videos where you buy a season pass.  If you want it fast you should choose ITunes.  They are quicker.
1,Hot in Cleveland is my daily treat of good humor.  The ladies represent the every woman in the most humorous way! Great writing and acting make this a show to share with any adult.  Not for children.
1,"My wife & I remember this series when it was on TV, but we did not pay it much attention. The teen-love-triangle-high-school-drama had been playing itself too much. However, recently, while being on bed rest for a few weeks & coincidentally seeing the new movie previews; I was intrigued by the hype. Then I decided to give it a try. (We are Amazon Prime Members & I saw it each time I logged in to watch a streaming show) It was better than we expected! It genuinely delivered - Veronica (Kristen Bell) sublimating her grief & pain into finding her best friends murderer, while helping her dad & fellow high school students with individualized cases - after they had all abandoned her due to the events of her father, then the sherif of Neptune, suffering at the hands of the wealthy, powerful parents. The stories, the filming, the writing was very good! We were completely addicted to the show and watched it until it came to the final episode. Yes, it had it's cheese & some Episodes did not quite hold true; it was still a very good series, launched many young Hollywood actors & actresses as well as showing up some faces of previous young Hollywood actors/actresses now playing adult parents to this generation. We will be seeing the movie this weekend-now that I'm off bed rest! (Can one be a Marshmellow in post-haste?)"
1,"More fun from the behind bars, okay they are on the run now, oops hope that doesn't spoil it for you!!"
0,"Season 2 just ends in the middle of the season leaving the viewer with a HBO Soprano's ending.  Purchased a prime membership so the family could have a movie night. Thinking about going to Netflix it is only 1 cent more and has CC for the hearing disabled.  Like many Amazon rebroadcast television seasons are not CC or have a few of the episodes that are CC and  the rest are not in the same series. So if a member of your family can not hear or has trouble hearing Netflix or Hulu might be a better option since Amazon carries little selection for the hearing disabled. Called Amazon customer support about CC their programming :i.e. Jericho , Falling sky, etc., waste of time."
1,"First off, start with season1.  It'll mean more if you watch them in order.  Season 2 was a little random for me, but I really liked the way they pushed it forward with Season 3 (in college).  We are all looking forward to the Veronica Mars Movie next year! (thanks to a GREAT Kickstarter campaign--the fans have spoken and we want more!!)"
1,"They are always entertaining. Wish some people would cuss less. Hey Rick, could you laugh less when your haggling? It looks too passive/aggressive."
1,This series has some excellent writers which make it as much about comedy as they do about crime and violence.
1,I enjoyed this show. Maybe I was just surprised that lawyers could be entertaining. Likening the cast was. Plus too.
1,"Great Show, especially if you love math, common sense and reasoning! Very Educational but also lots of action. Fast paced action! Characters are endearing. I have watched all 4 seasons!"
1,"This is a very graphic story line that viewers should watch but be aware that there is lots of sexual and violence related graphics. It is however, very well done relating the story line without taking too much time in unnecessary (but there is some) sex scenes. Otherwise the graphic nature of the violence is the only other aspect to be aware of as it is not a normal t.v. show that holds back at some level. This show shows it all.... almost.That said, it is well done and worthy of watching all the same -- just go into it knowing that it will not hold anything back"
1,no really we can't get enough i wish more seasons were available for instant. we just keep re-watching the same season
1,"If you haven't seen this show, see it.  If you like vegan, metrosexual life type shows, go watch ""Friends"" and eat a tofu burger.  If you are a man or woman who likes drama and entertainment without the neurotic crap, this is a show."
1,Love it! only wish the series would have continued and/or the made a movie! I liked the characters interaction and loyalty.
1,Like reading a cool SciFi/fantasy novel where the underlying theme is about networks killing off TV shows like mindless drones set in force by some unknown beings from long ago. Maybe there will be a rebirth of this show after the suspended animation wears off.
1,"This film opened and disappeared quickly in the DFW area, so I'm certainly glad I caught up to it via Blu ray.  A first time director (J Blakeson) puts together a taut thriller using only 3 actors and a minimalist set...not to mention a minimalist plot, albeit filled with twists and turns.  Alice, a 20 something lass is the daughter of a rich businessman somewhere in England.  She is kidnapped and taken to a well prepared (soundproofing, locks, etc.) apartment to wait for an eventual ransom.  Alice is played by Gemma Arterton whose previous credits include eye candy roles in ""The Prince of Persia"" and ""Clash of the Titans"".  She's something else here.The girl can act as well as look good.  In a demeaning, vulnerable role, she is stripped naked, force to pee in a bottle, tied to a bed and ruthlessly gagged with one of those ball-in-the-mouth things that sex dominatrix like to use.  It's fun to figure out what's going on because we suspect Alice is familiar with one of the kidnappers.  So really, what's going on? Yes, a big surprise. Even after we find this out, our questions aren't answered.  The film is filled with tension and is certainly an obscure gem of a picture."
1,I like The Glades: The Complete First Season DVD.  It was nice to watch it again expecially with out commercials.
1,"Cal is still going strong in this series and I still admire him. I do think Jillian needs to decide whether she is with Cal or against him. And Emily is a great addition to the show. I know she has been in all three series, but she seemed to exceptionally stand out in this one. I hope this show continues. It is the best."
1,I wish the actors had watched &#34;La Fea Mas Bella&#34; so they woujld have learned to do a love scene.  Judy and Alistair particularly need help from Letty and Fernando.
1,"This is an enjoyable Psych episode that pretty much follows the show's normal format of flashbacks and improbable coincidental occurrences, and it works well. We like Psych and tend to watch the older episodes on Netflix over theRoku 2 XS 1080p Streaming Player, but this episode wouldn't stream so we bought it on Amazon since it was the next in the series.No spoilers from me: This is a Christmas themed episode that has Gus and Shawn going to Christmas dinner at Gus' parents house where Shawn tries to impress Mr. and Mrs. Guster, but things don't go too well when a neighbor is found murdered.Sometimes the acting is a little over the top and often boarders on downright silly, but it is a very clever and fun show.Highly Recommended!CFH"
1,"a relative recommended this show to me, and I'm glad she did (because since I don't subscribe to Showtime)...I wasn't aware that this series existed, until recently.  Thankfully, Netflix took care of that little problem for me.Dexter plays a vigilante of sorts, a hero with a very dark side...he gives justice to those that the criminal justice system can't find or put behind bars.Michael Hall is a great actor, balancing a killer on the one hand and a likeable, lovable professional forensics expert on the other.....as he interacts in his various relationships.The show has comedy, drama, tension....it had just about everything...I guess one would label this a ""dark comedy"" type of series.  Very dark.All the other characters in the show are interesting and fun to watch, and we see the dramas played out in their life through the eyes of Dex.This is a truly original series that hooked me quickly with its stories and interesting characters- highly recommended!"
1,"I am watching it now and really enjoying it. Canadian show from the Sci=Fi channel That was recommended to me. After the first 8 shows, I ordered the second season. Like Murder She Wrote, this is set in a small town in main. Here at least there are some reasons given for all that is going on from the long term point of view. Cabot Cove just seemed to heve to many people being murdered each episode. The show started to take place elsewhere after awhile wich was a good move to keep the show moving forward."
1,items from history and lore with strange characteristics with a search and recover team to bring them back and store them
1,A great show about the Cybermen.  The episode centers around the tomb of the cybermen and the old look of them is pretty cool.  I only wish there were more episodes in the AMAZON library.
1,"This season was awesome.  If the DVD release is anything like the previous 2 it will be an awesome set.  The only thing I am upset with is the fact that there were only 16 parts of this season.  Petty, yeah, but hey, I can be petty.  The acting, writing, and episodes are pretty spot on.  As for Bella, I really dont think she will be in season 4.  Well, unless she can crawl.  All in all, a great show, great acting, great writing, just was missing to much for me to be totally happy.  I wanted more, not less!!!"
1,I was skeptical about this show after reading that it was reminiscent of M*A*S*H.  It has it's own personality but with that special touch that M*A*S*H had.  A wonderful cast with crazy stories and personalities I'd love to see again and again!  It's painful to know that this is the only season but it's worth watching time and again.  And I will continue to watch it as long as it's available!
1,"I notice the strong influence of Elia Kazan (On the Waterfront,Splendor in the Grass) in James Gray's intimate 2009 character-driven drama, the signposts being the human scale of the story and the realistic dilemmas faced by the main characters. The director/screenwriter manages to achieve a somber stillness to the film that allows the actors to breathe and inhabit their roles in a more subtle manner than you would expect from a story focused on working-class lives in Brooklyn's Brighton Beach neighborhood. The plot focuses on Leonard Kraditor, a moody, suicidal young man in the aftermath of a nervous breakdown triggered by the end of an engagement forced by genetic disorders running in both their families. Consequently, it would have been impossible for them to have healthy children. Grappling with bipolar disorder, Leonard has moved back with his parents working half-heartedly at the family dry-cleaning business, as they seek out a suitable replacement fianc&eacute;e. She comes in the form of Sandra, the eldest daughter of his father's more successful business colleague.Leonard, however, has unrealized dreams to become a photographer rather than default to running the family business. Life gets more complicated when a new neighbor moves in upstairs, a pretty blonde named Michelle, who turns out to be a law office assistant in an unsteady relationship with one of the partners, Ronald, an urbane married man who is hesitant to leave his wife for her. Unlike the tame girls he is used to dating, the emotionally fragile Michelle becomes Leonard's object of passion and obsession. The story follows their tentative romance from friendship to a desperate love steered by Ronald's inability to make up his mind about her. Interspersed between their clandestine episodes are scenes from the other half of Leonard's life, a more traditional existence as he becomes further involved with the calm, nurturing Sandra and her welcoming family. Things come to a head when Michelle, having suffered a miscarriage thanks to Ronald's indiscretion, decides to move away to San Francisco, and Leonard must then decide between stability at home and the prospect of an exciting life.Joaquin Phoenix excels at these types of inarticulate roles, and Leonard provides him with the ideal opportunity to express the inchoate romanticism of a badly damaged character. In certain respects, it's a more impressive performance than even his turn as Johnny Cash inWalk the Line. As Michelle, Gwyneth Paltrow once again proves to be a better actress than she often aspires to be with a performance pitched precariously between entitlement and neediness. Vinessa Shaw has the least challenging of the three roles, but she brings natural warmth to the unsuspecting Sandra. On the sidelines, Elias Koteas makes his two key scenes count as the conscience-embattled Ronald. As Leonard's protective parents, Israeli actor Moni Monoshov and a surprisingly aged Isabella Rossellini are affecting with Rossellini particularly heartbreaking in a climactic scene with Phoenix. The ending has a haunting quality that signals how Leonard's fragile state will forever be challenged by the choices he makes. The 2009 DVD is short on extras with a couple of making-of featurettes and three deleted scenes, all wisely cut since they would have provided an unnecessary imbalance to the characters' relationships."
1,The most consistently entertaining series I've seen. Love the cast and the story lines . Witty dialog funny situations. I've seen all 4 seasons and am waiting for the 5th.
1,"Caillou is about a four-year-old boy (with the same name) who interacts with family, friends, and classmates as he goes on different adventures. Caillou has a sister named Rosie and two of the most patient parents around. It's a classic American family model: a married couple with 2.5 children. The show's family values are straightforward.My two-year-old daughter loves this baldheaded fella. The show has plenty of bright colors, fast-moving scenes, and synergy between the other characters. My daughter stays glued to the tube while this show is on (in fact, it's on as I write this review).On the other hand, I HATE the show because Caillou has a fresh mouth and talks back in a disrespectful way to his parents (I'm too old school, I guess). Sometimes the rugrat throws tantrums to which his patient parents resolve the issue (in one episode, the dad reaches a boiling point and finally ""puts"" Caillou in his place).The show has some good aspects--including a catchy intro--yet it also reinforces behaviors that often leave me vexed.  Watch it at your discretion."
1,"This is a great film to add to your collection of mysteries. It is up there with Christy and Sayers. All the elements are there and blend well.The actors are well chosen to match the characters and the acting is bang on. The sets were perfect and not distracting from the story.There are several approaches one can take while telling a story. One is like Tony Hillerman who usually has two parallel stories that have characters periodically crossing each other and may not converge in the end. The other is the worlds within worlds approach as with the book ""Sophie's World"" or the film ""The Thirtieth Floor"" (1999). This story was more standard mystery with the usual suspects that all could be guilty. All the clues are there and the butler does not come out of the closet just before the end. Yet in the end, we get not one twist but a series of plausible twists. Leave it to a Mathematician.In the film we get a statement ""I believe in Pi"" this give away the armatureness of the math section of the film as everyone in industry knows the  Pi (~.7854816) is the formula to convert form one geometric figure to another look it up. You do not need a calculator if you remember 7854 in your head.The story starts with a famous woman being murdered, no doubt, about it, two people find the body and a mysterious mathematical clue points to possible future murders. Can the clues be deciphered using a mathematically attitude and future murders prevented; or will we have to rely on good old-fashioned detective skills?Be sure to watch again to see what clues you may have missed."
1,"I thought this was a great movie with a weak plot (I know that sounds contradictory). The film had  great acting, character development, special effects, etc. - perhaps the best of any Trek film. I loved the way the film tied together the main TOS characters.On the other hand, I thought the plot was a bit too  grandiose - especially for a 2-hour film. I won't reveal any spoilers, but I will say a lot changed in the Star Trek universe - yet, it seemed way too quick. I'm not a Trek purist, but I just felt like the whole ""villain develops planet-destroying technology"" plot has been done a bit too much (e.g., Wrath of Khan, Generations, Insurrection, Nemesis) that the actual storyline seemed mundane. However, the character development and the chance to see Kirk, Spock, and Bones on the big screen more than compensated.Trek purists beware!"
1,"Very well-done epic portraying a period during the Ching dynasty. Jet Li did an excellent job in this gritty, dark film. this film concerned itself with brotherhood and love during the wars, and although I would rather have seen a more historic piece, the directors did use some of the historical facts in this movie. It was definitely worth the watch as it really tells a tale that sucks you in. 4 stars simply because brotherhood and love were more important to the story than the actual historical reasons behind the events of the period. This is an excellent film, however, and like so many Occidental movies that include some 'unsolved historical mystery', this one at least attempts to give an answer to the question. All in all, I would watch it again, and will recommend others watch it too."
1,"My son still loves Blue's Clues and it is a show that I never worry about him watching, as I know it is very sweet and appropriate"
1,These kids are energetic and talented. My 3 year old granddaughter dances around the house listening and watching them. She loves the Fresh Beat!
1,"Ever wonder what Samus did before the world was infested with tentacle monsters for her to go around blasting? Well this is it. You can watch the early days of Sam as she sports her blond boy cut and bandaged blaster arm as she travels through Mexico with a man that apparently graduated from the Nicholas Cage acting school. Yes, this is the movie we have all been waiting for Metroid fans! I cannot wait for the sequal when Sam finally puts her Gold and Red suit on and takes flight into space to find Mother Brain. Yes! This is the film of the year. Metroid the Other M(Montsters) the movie."
1,"Law and Order LA Rocks! Unique ideas, excellent characters, top-notch acting. Law and Order LA Rocks! Two thumbs up! Word!"
1,my young great grandson loves this app.  he watches for hours and thoroughly enjoys it.  glad to see him so engrossed.
1,"The producers of this program really attempted to accurately portray historical events, so much so at times it was difficult to remember that the program was an reenactment."
1,I can hardly finish watching before my husband takes over.  We both love them all and will continue to watch.
1,"The Burning Plain starring Charlize Theron and Kim Basinger is a very interesting drama from start to finish. Theron really shines in this film, she shows remarkable emotional depth as Sylvia, a woman who suffers from depression and a secret she has carried since she was a teenager. This film is non-linear which I love, three different stories that somehow connect through time and distance. The Burning Plain is an amazing film, I highly recommend it! Enjoy."
1,"We love Fresh Beat Band sooooo much that we actually bought tickets for our 3 year old to see them in concert in February! She loves them and aside from some silliness on the part of the character &#34;Twist&#34; it is positive, fun, enthusiastic and more than that...nice to listen to from the other room."
1,My girls love Olivia.  I think it's cute.  I would give it 5 stars if it had some educational content.  It is a sweet fun show though.  Olivia does learn life lessons during most of the episodes and I like that a lot.
1,I've always loved this show. I guess a lot of people do or it wouldn't still be running this many years. A welcome relief from the typical TV fare. In a TV world full of 90+ percent garbage this show always amuses me.
1,"This is one of my favorite comfort series and is great for a good cheer up.  Hyacinth's life revolves around appearing &#34;better&#34; than her station would really allow and is hilarious.  Having someone of high quality nod at her in her mind makes her best friends that she can brag about.  Patricia Routledge is excellent in her role as are the actors her play her husband, friends and family.  If you haven't seen this show, you need to.  You won't be disappointed!"
1,This is truly family fare!  Real life problems on the screen!  Recommend for the whole family.  The whole thing is very sweet!
1,"This is the funniest MST3000 ever!  The bad acting, lousy plot, and outrageous (in a bad way) special effects make this a real howler."
1,"I love Doctor Who and I can't wait until the Christmas specials every year but the latest one starring new companion Clara Oswin Oswald  makes you so curious, you almost forget you're still hurting over Amy & Rory."
1,"The best complient an actor can get is that his or her character is memorable, and you care about them. The best compliment a writer can get is that the stories are beleivable and unpredictable. This show is compliment rich. I'm not a fan of the big hair, y'all crowd but these are real people in real situations that are not overly dramatized. Each season does get better and as you know some characters are leaving the show, their exits are done realistically and without detachment. We started watching out of boredom and are now hooked. A great series!"
1,We love reality/ true crime dramas. This was a great series!  Always waiting for a new season of our favorites. The first 48 is a really good fast moving drama.
0,"I just discovered this little gem. I had been seeing that it was on the USA network for a couple of years now, however, I had not taken the time to watch. Today, I watched 2 episodes from season 2 I would guess and I absolutely loved what I saw. I am a huge fan of this sort of happy ending character driven (though not to deep) type of show. The stories are simple yet realistically believable. There is a certain continuity as well. The two stories that I watched also involved a much older Henry Winkler playing the father. I won't go into details of the story-lines, however, I will say this show is worth the time, if not the money. However, not for the price that is being charged here or by the manufacturer. There are only 12 - 13 episodes to these sets by USA as that is all they do to make a season. It's the same with all of their shows. The shows are great, but the price is ridiculous. That is not to say that I won't purchase the sets, just not at this price. I will wait for a sale or get them used. I refuse to pay more than $10 - $13 with tax and shipping for a season of less than 14 episodes. The good thing is that Amazon and other sources sell not only used copies but have great sales. So, if you can wait, it's well worth your time and investment to own this show.wasitchuRead all my reviews here at Amazon.com, just look for wasitchu."
1,I wanted to watch season 6 to get caught up in this series. I held off getting into this show because I thought it would be too hard and time consuming to catch up. Not hard at all. The characters really develop over time. Doctor 11 is fun and wonderful. Great stories if you love scifi and fantasy all rolled in one.
1,This is funny and I can almost believe the actors are real. Very entertaining. I would watch this series and recommend it to all my friends
1,"One of the great things about DVD is that classic television shows can be not only recalled but watched again. Some of them upon second viewing make you think ""Did I really think this show was good?"". But then again others make you realize that the shows you enjoyed from your youth were not just memories but were actually good shows. VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA is one of those series.As with the previous releases of the series, SEASON 4 VOLUME 1, holds up as well as the rest. The improvement of color over black and white is an obvious one when comparing to season one. But the characters have now had a chance to develop on screen and become familiar to us all. Too bad the series left the air not long after.The sixties gave us some of the greatest science fiction television ever seen. As early as THE TWILIGHT ZONE and moving forward to THE OUTER LIMITS we had anthologies that held our attention. And as for serialized tales, we had the original STAR TREK and more. No person helped this era out more so than Irwin Allen.Allen was the creator of some of the most remembered sci fi series from the time including THE TIME TUNNEL, LOST IN SPACE, LAND OF THE GIANTS and of course VOYAGE. Each of these series has had a release to DVD and have had the opportunity to give those of us children of the sixties the chance to relive those moments that held our attention each week, an hour at a time, as we watched incredible worlds unfold before our eyes.As for VOYAGE, the story mixed a combination of military and peacenik in one. It told the tales of the submarine Seaview, a high tech sub designed and operated by Admiral Nelson (Richard Basehart), a man who sees great things for the future and who uses his sub not as an offensive weapon but as a means to an end to help people around the globe.Along with Nelson are several main characters. The main one of these was Capt. Lee Crane (David Hedison), his second in command. While Nelson offered an elder statesman, Crane was the young eye candy to draw in girls, a man of action who took control when needed. Robert Dowdell as Lt. Comdr. Chip Morton, Del Monroe as Kowalski and Arch Whiting as Sparks helped round out the all male cast as they tackled world crises around the globe, saving the world over and over again.This particular season gave us a number of items to be concerned about opening with an episode that showed the Seaview tossed about was a volcano was about to blow cracking the world in two. Vincent Price paid a visit to the Seaview as a puppeteer who took control of various crewmen. A well loved plot device of the sixties, the ability of a bad guy to transform his appearance to do harm to whoever he chose was used. And time travel was brought into the picture again as well.VOYAGE played out like STAR TREK taken to inner space instead of outer and with an all male crew instead of one more integrated. But then TREK was in the future and VOYAGE in the present. Scenes of both ships being tossed about due to either underwater explosions or photon torpedoes gave us the cast tossing themselves about from side to side of the set. One could expect anyone from either cast feeling comfortable changing sets.For me it was glorious to watch as the flying sub once again lifted off out of the bottom of the Seaview and broke surface to fly across the sky. Like many I was lucky enough to have purchased the Aurora model kit and make my own flying sub to take a place of honor on the top of my desk. To find one today means a prolonged ebay search and paying an arm and a leg. Better it remains a fond memory.Not so this series. It no longer has to be a memory. Instead it is something that can be enjoyed again and again. And it can be shared with my son and later perhaps my grandchildren.One of the best things that we can take with us, those of us who watched these shows when they were fresh and new, is the sense of hope that they offered. Rather than a post apocalyptic world of bombed out buildings and survivors clad in furs and remnants of clothing, we were shown a world where we could use science to help build a better world. We were offered a world where not just races and genders got along but aliens as well. Wouldn't it be great if the world had that same sense of hope once more? Perhaps sharing these old television shows might just be the first step in that direction."
1,"This season continues to please with it's twists & turns. When characters behaving predictably, it is believably so. The last episode clearly shows that the season ended and the producers pulled the plug without completing the story line, leaving the audience wondering what happens next?  Or what happens to conclude the story line?  Maybe the moving coming out in March will pick up the thread. However I hope to see some of the same characters. We have a girls night out planned for it."
1,"I enjoy this show because it shows old stuff that I remember from my childhood, and those guys fix them all up so they are like new. These guys are quite talented."
1,The unusual use of the victim's voice is the only thing that saves this show from the dull normal level of story telling in most of the reality TV shows out now.  It is still maddening to spend most of the show recycling a few scenes from different angles although editing does seem a bit better than average.  Not worth my effort to see again.
1,I was disappointed when Heroes went out of production.  At least I was able to view the series again and enjoy it again.
1,"This season dives into exactly who River Song is and how she relates to Amy, Rory, and the Doctor. It starts out strong with quite a few mind-bending twists and some fun interactions between the Doctor and River. Things go well until mid-season. Then things seem to drift and the season finale leaves some glaring plot holes and serious paradox issues. However, the not-quite-companions of Craig and Stormageddon make Closing Time one of my favorite episodes ever."
1,Whit and sarcasim rule this series. Mary McCormack is great. I have enjoyed every episode and recommend is to everyone.
1,"I really liked this documentery. It was informative, as well as, inteertaining. I especially liked the narriator and the artifacts. And, the photogrraphy was good too."
1,"Whatever History A&E is doing, they're really messing up the order of the shows. Only 2 Discs:From 2010:  Disc 1: Hobo Jack/Laurel & Hardy/Frank Flips & Mike's Breakdown. Disc 2: Pint Sized Picker/A Nanner Pick/Danielle Goes Picking & What's in the Box?/Have'nt ordered Volume 4 yet because once again V.4 has only 2 Discs & stuck on 2011's just like Pawn Stars. I've tried to email & write them but get no replies. Stay tuned..."
1,"It's been working wonderfully, raunchly for two seasons; why mess with it?It's recommended I write between 75 and 300 words. So...So the theme is extended nicely, maybe into more-believable CA lore. I lived for20 years in the Hollywood Hills, LA; CAFORN's rendition so isn't far off. It's nowunobtrusively ABIT more serious and mature. No preaching. No harsh knockingof doing naughty stuff, just a few more implications there are consequences andbeing bad does come with some painful (or inconvenient) lessons from whichone should learn.But the girls are still beauiful, the sex is as close to X as possible, Hank as horny as ever,maybe moreso. A few 'immorality/substance abuse are bad' lessons are slipped in, viatouches of angst, trouble, embarrassment and ennui; not enough to curdle the cuddle-the-voyeaur formula. Okay, I'm between 75 and 300 words.I hope they keep doing versions of what they're doing. It's like visiting the old homesteadyou grew up on. For a lucky few. You go Hank, or David. America needs more sticky-gooey irresponsible, edge-nudging vicarious sports to turn off the recession.."
1,I like it. I wonder if the facts are true? I think that people of all ages would like. I recommend it to anyone who has a liking for history.
1,I gave this 5 stars because it's suspense! I love a good mystery of trying to figure out who did it. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good suspense and mystery type show.
1,"I found the first season to be cool and fun but it never totally scared me or creeped me out. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th season however have had some scary, creepy, brutally violent and disturbing episodes though. No matter how many times I see someones neck snap on the show it still makes me squirm. Season 3 I think has some of the more memorable episodes. There's nothing more messed up and disturbing than the Christmas episode. While the episode where Dean thinks a young boy of an ex is his son, is one of the funnier episodes despite some creepy scenes. I love when the kid says ""AC/DC rules!.""It's also one of the more engaging seasons, as Sam races against time to find a way to get Dean out of the deal he made with a demon. Dean has one year to live according to the deal. While a hot blond demon says she can help Sam save Dean. The first season never really felt like I was watching a scary horror movie every week, but the seasons that followed have more than a few episodes that have made me feel that way."
1,"Some shows, by the time they get to their third or fourth season, are getting tired and less fun and enjoyable. Not this one. JAG was the same way, good all the way to the end. The sixth season of NCIS still has fun and interesting stories, the actors are on spot and the chemistry between them is still great."
1,"I am a deadwood fan, So Timothy Olyphant playing a US marshal is a no brainer. He was excellent as Seth bullock, And just as good as Raylon. I like the writing in this series, All the actors are very convincing. The setting is in Kentucky and if you think hillbillys are dumb, You would be wrong."
1,"Season 3 as a whole, especially its ending, was just a bit short of a disaster, with its device for having Eric Millegan's character, Zach Addy leave the series, as the totally improbable assistant of the cannibalistic Gormagon master. The two episode opener for season 4 is a very nice twist, putting the series back on track, with Booth and Brennan both giving lectures in London, and are called in to assist in the investigation of an American's murder.The sub-plot with Brennan's father (Ryan O'Neal) becomes a bit more interesting, although that thread in the ongoing story never caught my interest. Another rather dull thread is the effort to have Angela's husband from the South Pacific sign divorce papers, so Angela and Hodgins can get married.True to the theme in the opening two episodes, it seems as if Booth and Brennan spend a lot of time away from the lab. One especially tense and entertaining episode has Booth and Brennan solving a murder while on a plane to China, which they must do as long as the plane is in the air, and still sovereign U.S. soil. Another story traces the victim to Norway, and Sweets is a big help in solving the case. In fact, in seasons 3 and 4, Sweets is a more serious character than he becomes in later seasons with his entanglement with one of Brennan's assistants, Daisy.The season also ends with a bang, with an episode based entirely on a dream, in which all the actors, including returning Eric Millegan, and all other regular and recurring characters appear as characters not their own, and Brennan and Booth are married."
0,"This is clearly a Thai film! You can tell Tony Jaa and crew got alot more money to make this film compared to the others but it leaves alot to be desired! In most martial arts flicks the fighting barely borders on believavble but this movie goes way past that line. Mainly at the end. It's like Rambo without the guns. Other than that the sequences are a bit jarring and the acting was kinda over the top in small doses. The costumes were fantastic though. I know it sounds like im ripping on this movie but im comparing it to Jaa's previous movie ""The Protector""! Now that was amazing. This movie would definately appeal to younger viewers. Perhaps 12-18 years of age? I cant wait for the day when Hollywood gets together with Tony! That's gonna be good!..."
1,"Overall, the actors do look like their real-life counterparts and are fairly convincing as the Kennedy family. However, as others have noted, there are factual inaccuracies in The Kennedys and the series seems to rush at the end. I tend to be forgiving about minor factual inaccuracies if they are necessary to further the movie or appeal to a wider audience. However, The Kennedys makes a bit mistake by totally ignoring Ted Kennedy. It's as if Jack and Bobby didn't have a younger brother! I understand the producers wanted to fit the series into 8 episodes, but to leave Teddy Kennedy out completely? I like the idea of a TV mini-series about the Kennedys, but it should be done right and give due attention to all three of the brothers."
1,"I was originally turned on to BBC's crime procedural ""Luther"" with some pretty strong sentiments. It was supposed to be ""wild,"" ""unpredictable,"" and ""unlike anything else on TV."" I'm not sure, ultimately, that ""Luther"" lives up to such effusive hyperbole--but that doesn't mean that it isn't thoroughly entertaining and compelling in its own right. While ""Luther"" can certainly be wild and unpredictable, it is not breaking the mold of many other rogue cop hero shows that have populated the modern TV landscape. As the titular Detective John Luther, Idris Elba brings much passion, conviction, and gusto to the standard role of a cop who must sometimes cross the line to do what's right. But to the program's credit, Elba can be extremely erratic as well and does push the notion of a ""good"" cop to an uncomfortable, and at times, violent level.Elba, though magnetic, is not the show's primary asset in my estimation. Nor are the actual crimes, for that matter. It's all about presentation. One story line revolving around a cop killer had some quite unexpected and shocking violence. One thing lacking from most TV procedurals are a palpable feeling of tension--of ""anything can happen""--and ""Luther"" can leave you effectively unsettled. And as the season progresses, that latter episodes become progressively more unhinged. Another routine abduction case was brought to vivid life with a diabolical, super creepy villain and notorious face licker. But my favorite element of the show, by far, is that ""Luther has managed to cast a psychotic murderess in its leading lady role. Ruth Wilson provides a fantastic foil for Elba and I loved every moment of their interactions!As is typical with British TV, this season is short by American standards (some call it a mini-series) with only 6 episodes. But if you like cop shows with flawed heroes battling their inner demons (and who doesn't?), this is an easy recommendation. Not revelatory TV, but dirty fun. 5 HUGE stars for Ruth Wilson. Sometimes, however, I did miss her when she wasn't around and I wasn't always enamored with Elba's domestic issues, ex-wife, etc...But overall, solidly entertaining. If this sounds appealing to you, you'll probably enjoy it! KGHarris. 11/10."
1,"It's Wonder Pets... Friends to the Animals and 4 and under crowd alike. Good Messages, catchy tunes... Kids seem to really stay engaged when watching"
1,"13 Assassins is a contemporary version of Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" (1954), inflated I guess, to adjust for the times. Although the theme is different, it is basically a small band of warriors intent on doing good and battling a much larger force of evil doers. The important thing in a film like this is that there be a minimum of exposition and a maximum of sword play and daring do, and that the quality of the battles be exquisite.It's hard to view a film like this without thinking of Kurosawa's Samurai films and, of course, Toshiro Mifune (1920-97), who played a central role in many of Kurosawa's best films. Mifune made 16 films with Kurosawa (""Seven Samurai"", Yojimbo"", ""Sanjuro"") and without Kurosawa made the ""Samurai Trilogy"" with Hirtoshi Inagki.Koji Yakusho (1956) has the main role. Yakusho has been in nearly 100 films and is a favorite of director Kiyoshi Kurosawa (""Memoirs of a Geisha"", ""Babel"") who is not related to Akira Kurosawa.The film is directed by Takashi Miike (1960) who is known for the extreme violence in his dozen plus films (""Triad Society"", ""Dead or Alive"", ""Ichi the Killer""). Miike won the Japanese Professional Movie Awards as Best Director for ""Ichi"" (2002) and ""Rainy Dog"" (1997) and was twice nominated for a Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.At 2 hours plus the film is a little long, and the initial set up could perhaps be shortened. But once the action gets started, it is non stop and there is no time for a bathroom break. Miike gives us an assortment of warriors using an assortment of weapons, but at some point, more is less. It's hard to keep track of who is dying, and with 13 Assassins instead of 7 Samurai, the impact of the death of each is substantially lessened.Miike has also failed to draw out his characters in three dimensions, undoubtedly due to the number, and so the combat and the death are less dramatic. We are watching the fights rather than emotionally participating in them.13 Assassins was nominated for numerous awards and won for Art, Cinematography, and Sound at the Japanese Oscars and for Best Production Design at the Asian Film Awards.This is certainly an entertaining film, but far from a classic."
1,"The reason I gave it that rating is because the 1st 8 episodes moved slow , but the last ones were awesome and kept us totally engrossed. We will start to watch the second season this week and on our Netflix we have 36 episodes so we will be able to watch for a while.  The character Holden is truly a good actor just the right amount of sleeze and sincerity.  We are trying to figure out his angle, the next episodes will show that i'am sure."
1,"I could be anyone, it would be Det. Poirot. The actor is a most amazing person...just like the master detective of all time."
1,"The third season of this SyFy series is a vast improvement over its disappointing, uneven second season.  The stories are constructed in a ""two plot"" fashion, resulting in more fast-pacing and a better use of its cast.  Most of the artifacts are more intriguing and the actors seem to have more confidence and better understanding of their roles and their relationships.Eddie McCormack and Joanne Kelly's playfulness seems more natural and mature; Angela Scagliotti has matured without losing her wit and precociousness; Saul Rubinek is still goofy as Artie, but he's acting more human; poor Genelle Williams isn't given much to do this season as the innkeeper Lena, but she adds a touch of sanity in the warehouse's insanity.The guest stars are great this season:  CCH Pounder as the stony Mrs. Fredericks; Aaron Ashmore as Jinks, the human lie detector; Kate Mulgrew as Pete's regent mother; Jaime Murray as the sleek HG Wells; Lindsay Wagner as Artie's unrequited love interest; Judd Hirsch as Artie's gruff estranged father, and Anthony Michael Hall, of course, as the season's nasty villain.The only episodes I didn't care for were the video game Eureka crossover and the expectedly derivative bonus Christmas episode.Overall, WAREHOUSE is a good series that fortunately is getting better.PS----how will the 4th season rescue the decimated warehouse?"
1,"I loved the format. If they writers had spent a little of developing a storyline for characters, it might have survived the cuts; I think the Goodwife is great example of this. They did lose a little steam towards the end, but I think he staff already knew they had been axed."
1,"This movie transcends relationship cliches and has the bravery to stay focused on it's 3 characters without any trite or whimsical artificial plot twists.  This guy is in a rut and assumes the erratic romance which is more difficult to attain must be valuable. Conversely, the calm stable romance he doesn't quite trust.  All 3 characters are headed for some challenges regardless of their choices."
1,"This show has gotten to an intense level that makes you, not want to answer the phone, go to the bathroom til ads come on and not answer the door.  It was a bittersweet finale. What will that bring to the unit. It's a keeper."
1,As with any series by season four the show is looking for new direction.  Its no longer just the con of the week.  The characters really develop and plot lines begin to span the entire season. As expected the tech stuff is good no sound or video problems.  I was a little disappointed in the extras.  The shows all have commentary and maybe a deleted scene or two.
1,"A workshop in being scary. Amid the dreck of the genre, this movie shines. Dread fills the room as you watch. There is a moment of insight, as in ""Don't Look Now"", that fills us with despair. What great movie making. Run out and get this. Put it on your netflix."
1,"This is an improved rerelease of the Midsomer Murder episodes. Now with SDH subtitles. For those who do not own them, they can be purchased in sets that come in the correct order of the UK airings. If you own previous DVDs, be sure to check that you are not duplicating. If you are new, sit back and begin to enjoy one of the best cop/crime shows ever produced in the WORLD, and it continues today (2013), 16 years running. And expect multiple murders.TOP British crime drama, with a twist of humor and romance. And then there is the awesome footage of British village life, as spectacular as any English documentary/travel DVD. The characters are believable, and the crime solving is reasonable, although complex enough for the most avid of mystery fans. I have never watched an episode that was not a 5-star production. Speaking of stars, every British TV & film star now wants to be a guest star on this show. Guest stars began in the beginning, and are a part of what makes this such a delightful series. Prepare yourself for some very tender moments or a belly laugh. It has it all.Tom Barnaby (John Nettle) became an icon for Murder Mystery TV fun. Episodes are based on novels of Caroline Graham. Eventually most reviews of other crime shows get around to comparing to Midsomer. It's that good.SUBTITLES NOW INCLUDED, an update from the old releases. Midsomer episodes are 100 minutes each.1-The Killings at Badgers Drift  -March 19972-Written in Blood  -March 19983-Death of a Hollow Man  -March 19984-Faithful unto Death  -April 19985-Death in Disguise  -May 1998"
1,"I absolutely love this show! Took me 4 years to finally give this gem a try, and once I started watching it...I couldn't stop! Pretty Little Liars: Season 1 is highly addicting. But to tell you the truth, every season I've watched so far has been amazing. The cast is incredibly talented, the writing is clever, and the plot is well-crafted. So join Spencer, Aria, Hanna, and Emily as the they try to discover who &#34;A&#34; really is, and why he or she wants to mess with their them. Secrets have a way of coming out as you know. My first impression of this show was so dead wrong. It's not predictable, fluffy, or insipid...it's insanely entertaining! Buy season 1 today. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy."
0,"Half an hour into the series I was bored out of my mind. The premise of the show revolves around 2 U.S. Marshalls that work for the Witness Protection Program. The dialogue is forced, the voiceover is annoying, the domestic squabbles are comedic at best. Marshall Mann has zero personality. Bobby D (Todd Williams) is probably the best and only good thing in this show."
1,"The series is in the older square video version.  Made for the older TV types, but it's still a great series.  Inspirational and mind boggling.  Some of the amazing things they come up with are absolutely incredible."
1,"I thoroughly enjoyed this show.  Enjoyed the Braverman family.  A must to see.I saw all 4 seasons and hope there will be a Season 5.  Season 4 was a tear jerker, but so real and the acting was excellent.  I am going to watch it again....you just fall in love with the Braverman family.  They are a close knit family even though every family member have issues....loved the tv show.  Hope it will return with a season 5.  Fell in love with Max, and loved Kristina, Crosby and Jasmine, Adam is great, all the actors and in their roles was simply wonderful....."
1,I love watching these episodes and it is uplifting that these kids change their attitudes after visiting the prison.  I think this would be beneficial in all states where kids are just starting to make bad choices.
1,This was a really good episode of Doctor Who. It was surprising and infrmitive and action packed. No spoilers here but really if you have not seen this one do. It will make you want more Doctor Who.
1,"The Poirot adventures with David Suchet--which began nearly a quarter century ago and just recently concluded--are some of the best classic British mysteries on television. That they were saddled for years with crappy DVD transfers was a shame. But now you can enjoy pristine Blu Rays of the original Super 16 footage; they look fantastic. If you watch your Poirots as much as my wife and I do, you owe it to yourself to pick up the Blu Rays. It's well worth buying the shows a second time."
0,"This show should have been ONE Season only. The writing has become stupid whereas the producers think the public is gulable. For instance, they try to add drama to the scene when they have caught a gator and the hunter puts his hand into the water to pull up the rope. It is supposed to make you uneasy since a gator could bite him. Yet the camera is below his hand (in the water) shooting up.When they are wrestling with the caught gator, the people on the boat are yelling out different things to each other, such as:&#34;Watch him!&#34; OR &#34;Shoot him!&#34; OR &#34;Oh...he's a big one!&#34;. But when you watch these people, their mouths are NEVER moving. It's as if these comments are added in later for effect.Personally, I root for the gator."
1,"Dr Who has always continued to thrill me, what with convoluted plots, snappy one liners and twisted endings, what's not to like.I am holding judgement on the new Tardis, though. Each time there is a change, it indicates the general mood of the series. Don't think that this year is going to be light and fluffy. But there is a reason for everything, as we all well know. Just food for thought, you, the fans, do remember that he has a clone &#34;daughter&#34; out there, right? Am looking forward to the new season with anticipation."
1,I liked the addition of the newest mermaid.  Missed the young man who got the scholarship.  The series ended on a positive note with closure and enough side story lines for further spin offs.
1,"Interesting idea, decent special effects. Though it reminds me of theThe Blair Witch Project, which I did not much like.Very clever ending though."
1,"I was quite pleased when I ran across Monsters on Amazon. What a hoot! I remember catching a few of these back in '94 when the series premiered, but never caught many as life, the universe and everything caught up with me. Occasionally I would think back and wonder if maybe it would come out on disk sometime. How much fun when I found both Monsters and Tak and the Power of Juju both on Amazon Prime!The monsters live in the tunnels under an unnamed city, going to Monster School, and learning how to frighten humans. The 'stars' of the show are Ickis, Krumm, and Oblina. Oblina, the female sidekick, is striped black and white, with a huge mouth, bulging stalk eyes, and the ability to reform herself into various and sundry horrible looking creatures, while Ickis can grow his big-eared, big-mouthed body to an impressive size. Krumm, (yes, Krumm is rather dumb) holds his eyeballs in his hands and attacks with a case of BO strong enough to knock over a warthog. Together, they go through the same (but different) trials and tribulations of any trio of class nerdy-misfits, working together to get through school and find their own identities as monsters.This is a lower scale of violence from some other cartoons in the &#34;old style.&#34; I haven't worked my way through all of them - I am taking my time and enjoying as there won't be more when I get through the ones on Amazon, but so far no worries for parents of the younger set. The monsters can be scary, of course, but in a gentler manner that shouldn't frighten the little ones. If you are an adult and like good animation, this is one to check out also."
1,Some of the sequence themes are repetitive from season one and so that makes them predictable but the show remains entertaining.
1,"[brief review:  the time is 117 A.D.  The place is north Britain, near the boundary of present day Britain and Scotland.  The natives to the north, the Picts, are wrecking havoc on the border and the Romans are having difficulty maintain their power on the border.A Roman general is captured by the Picts.  One of his leutinents then stages a raid on the Pict camp to free the general.  They are unable to free him, and during that time kill several Picts, including the son of the Pict leader.The Pict people vow revenge and the leutinent and several of his soldiers try to escape the camp and survive with hopes of meeting  back with the Roman legion on the west territory.]first, I'm a big fan of the director, Neil Marshall, who also made ""The Descent"", ""Dog Soldiers"", and ""Doomsday"".  Characteristic of his films (including ""Centurion"") is violence, which is always well-shot.  Also characteristic of his films is great cinematography, which ""Centurion"" is probably the best example of.The plot of this film is straight-forward tale of revenge (by one party) and survival (by another party), set in a historical back-drop.  This was a fun film to watch, but I would recommend you also watch the three aforementioned films he has previously done to fully appreciate this director."
1,This show has so many funny characters that you have to find at least one thing you like about it.
1,"I have watched this show in the past and got hooked on it then, but it was on broadcast television so the number of episodes available was limited.  With Netflix I am starting from the beginning and going to the end, and like it even more now than then."
1,"i missed this on its original tv run. I took a chance on amazon and binge watched both seasons. a terrific show, terrific cast. especially season 1. the cast is terrific, really a sci fi (sort of) classic, highly recommended."
1,"Prison changes a man, and it certainly changed former LAPD police officer Charlie Crews. From 1995 to 2007 he served hard time for murders he didn't commit. When DNA evidence surfaces proving his innocence, Crews is released and reinstated in the force (he also lands some serious settlement money). Now Detective Crews finds himself working with a new partner even as he covertly seeks answers to what the hell happened.LIFE looks to be a very promising cop detective show, and not because the mysteries themselves are dynamite stuff or anything. No, the viewing addiction lies in watching the lead actor work his craft. Britisher Damian Lewis is simply fabulous as the wounded, brooding protagonist, trying to piece his life back together. It's fun watching Crews apply his askewed perspective on his cases. I'm normally not a fan of folks who sling zen about, but Lewis makes it such a quirky and integral part of his character. And if it's a loose cannon with an agenda slinging that zen, all the better. After all, zen helped Crews survive the penitentiary. I also like the little touches which remind us that Crews is still coping with his new found freedom, whether it's his habit of munching on fresh fruit (they never have fresh fruit in prison) or his preference for light and open air or the fact that he still doesn't have furniture in his home.Lewis's supporting cast is so-so. I do enjoy Sarah Shahi, who's a former Dallas Cowboy cheerleader. She plays the no-nonsense Dani Reese, Crews' new partner and not ecstatic about it. It's true that her character tends to fall in the generic character-saddled-with-demons category, so, yeah, nothing new from that angle. But I think she has very good chemistry with Damian Lewis, and I just love her bemused or irritated reactions to Crews' barrage of philosophical quirk. Two other actors who nicely play off Lewis are sexy Brooke Langton as Crews' smitten attorney and Adam Arkin as Crews' former inmate and current best friend and financial adviser.I like the show's use of interview clips. They reveal certain insights and usher several sub-plots into the light. We learn, for instance, that Crews' former partner didn't stand up for him and that Crews' beautiful wife had divorced him while he was serving out his time. We even get a teeny whiff of the conspiracy surrounding Crews' frame-up. More layers and foreshadowings, thanks to these interview clips.SPOILERS now.With the steady influx of crime drama on TV, I wasn't planning on tuning in to this show. Then the pilot changed my mind. Other standout episodes? ""Powerless"" is the powerful sixth episode, focusing on Dani as she pursues a rapist who'd been haunting her AA meetings. ""Farthingale"" (episode 8) is a fun one, an intriguing mystery which begins with a man having been half blown off by an exploding stove. Then there's the intense two-part, season closing story arc (episodes 10 & 11: ""Dig A Hole"" & ""Fill It Up"") as Crews finally tracks down the man who committed the murders for which he was incarcerated. In ""Dig A Hole"" we also get to see a showdown of sorts between Crews' new and former partners.SPOILERS end.I can't stress enough how good Damian Lewis is on this show. I remember him from HBO's great wartime mini-series,Band of Brothers, and he made big noise back then, too, and was even nominated for a Golden Globe (although he didn't win). Damian Lewis, with his complex performance here, elevates LIFE from a humdrum procedural into a riveting police drama. And since NBC has already indicated that this wonderful drama series will be picked up for a second season, well, LIFE is good."
1,"First, if you've never seen a Trek film, now maybe the time...this is a solid movie, Trek or not...visually stunning, a wild paced trip with J.J.Abrams superb character banter.Star Trek is such a cultural icon and so a part of the collective unconsciousness that even a passing familiarity is plenty enough to enjoy the new TREK MOVIE. J.J.Abrams of TV's LOST & the Mission Impossible series shows how the famous crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise first comes aboard to explore strange new worlds. Talk about ""no win scenario""...the big question in the minds of fans and non-fans alike: can younger actors fill these enormous space boots.The answer is yes, but with a major role for the original Spock, Leonard Nimoy, time traveling of course, there's no need to worry about the absence of the original crew.Chris Pine's take on impulsive space cowboy James T. Kirk is no SNL parody of Shatner's portrayal but recognizable (although as the climax draws near he scores some very Capt. Kirk classic moments ""I've got your gun.""). Zachary Quinto a.k.a Sylar-Spock is perfect as a young Vulcan (with a girlfriend!). Karl Urban is dead on a Leonard ""Bones"" Mcoy with maybe the coolest intro in the film. Uhura is played by Zoe Saldana who is a great likeness of young Nichelle Nichols, but with so much more to do, than poor Nichelle. The same can't be said for Chekov, Sulu and Scott who had less important places in the big picture, but were each well played, Simon Pegg's Scotty was great fun.Without given too, much away, some answers....Does a ""Red Shirt"" die? Ho yeah...Does Kirk tear his shirt? Nah...Does Bones declare someone ""Dead, Jim?"" Sorta...Nerve Pinch? Got `em....Warp Speed?  The Best ever!!!....Beam ins and outs? Yes and much more (can you say space-dive?)...How about the KOBAYASHI MARU test? I prequel has to have it right? Yes, it is in there and may even live up to expectations, too!Due to interference by a future Romulian, Nero, play brilliantly by Eric Bana, an alternate timeline is created. While strikingly similar to the original Trek, the movie ends with many things already clearly different from the series (like Capt. Pike's final fate).  In doing this 2 things are ultimately accomplished 1.) many Prequel / Series discontinuities are dispersed due to interference by Nero. 2.) the future of the Trek film franchise can continue without fear of rewriting any aspect of the show or films using the new cast.The Star Trek prequel hopefully will herald the reboot of the Star Trek franchise, it sure has the potential. Star Trek Lives!"
1,"Very lively and wondrous. I don't mean to sound like an advertisement, but it really does bring on the smiles and giggles."
1,"Victorious is a probably the best show out there the entire family can watch; this show is enjoyed by all of the kids in my neighborhood through high school and, as an adult, I enjoy watching it with my kids.  The jokes are pretty funny and what I really like the most as a parent is the show doesn't cross the line like a lot of children-focused shows seem to do with being a tad risqu&eacute;.  The singing is excellent!We have watched all of the episodes of this season for free via our Prime membership vs. the regular price of $29.99 for the whole season: not a bad deal!"
1,"I really enjoy this updated, new timeline of the Star Trek franchise!  Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto have the most amazing chemistry in this edge of your seat thrill ride!"
1,"Enjoyed this series, and the plots.. They were really interesting, and I would recommend it as light entertainment.  Acceptable for young people."
1,I'm a Stargate fan since the original movie came out.  The original TV series SG-1 was a good one that lasted many seasons.  I checked this one out after watching the SG-1 series to the end.  This one has a different spin but a similar show (same creators).  I've enjoyed this one as well.
1,Watching this production is like taking a lovely vacation to a different place and time where the struggles are real but they are different than those we face today.
1,Truly enjoyed this series and watched it up to the 4th but was left hanging.  Wish the TV stations wouldn't do this all the time.
1,"the first season was great, but I just never got around to this one. This stuff is fun if you don't take it seriously. Hey it IS reality TV after all."
1,Suspenseful series. Where is Volume 2 available? I have looked on Amazon.com and did not find it? Can anyone tell me where I can get the subsequent volumes of this series?
1,"Since it's summer and there aren't a lot of shows to watch I decided to watch Teen Wolf. I wasn't very sure about it when it originally premiered, so I skipped it, but now that I started watching it I can't stop!Teen Wolf is maybe too good for MTV, it has blood, a little bit of comedy (without being too cheesy), horror, and a great talented cast. The storyline of season 1 is so well told, and you're hooked since the beginning. There isn't a bad episode on this show.The chemistry is there, and you never know what's going to happen next, this show is definetely filled of &#34;OMG moments&#34;. With each season the show gets better, but the first season was pretty solid and addicting. It's good to finally have this show on DVD, it's worth it and I can't wait to see what's next."
1,"HBO and the BBC have really outdone themselves with this first season. A brilliant action-packed and highly  emotionally charged violent series doesn't just tell the story of the rise to power and death of Caesar, but portrays the most violent ancient Roman world, where we of today forget just how cheap life was back then. You see for yourself through the eyes of two centurions, who get wrapped up in the intrigue and as mere pawns tragically manipulated and toyed with by all levels of society.Joe Wocoski, Author"
0,"I had big expectations because I love English TV, in particular Investigative and detective stuff but this guy is really boring. It didn't appeal to me at all."
1,"Having watched every episode of Burn Notice, my wife and I, along with several friends and family members, are completely hooked.In a way this show reminds me of another series we thoroughly enjoyed 20 years ago, Stingray. Although Stingray was completely under the radar, and Michael is always blip number one, there are still similarities. Michael's skill at going undercover and improvising a role comes to mind. Also, Stingray's stories were a trade in 'favors', and Michael and friends often help someone as a favor, or for only expenses. Both had secretive but evidently quite successful histories in secret ops.One of the things I enjoy most about Burn Notice are the little 'spy tips' that grace every show. Some of them make sense, some are utter nonsense, and some of them I'm not too sure about, but they're all fun.Another thing I like about it is the way in which the 'bad guys' often come to grief in very satisfying, often funny ways. The late 2nd season episode where Michael foils a bank robbery is hilarious.Whether it makes sense all the time or not, obviously the writers of this show care, and are putting a good effort into each script. That makes up for any sins and makes for a quite entertaining show.Season One obviously contains the ""origin story"" in the pilot, which is a big advantage. However, this series is remarkably consistent throughout its run, and all the episodes are of very consistent quality as well. Although there have been a few stand out shows that I particularly enjoyed, I can't really think of any ""stinkers"" that I had to overlook. USA Network just keeps coming out with many of the most entertaining shows on TV over the last few years, and Burn Notice is part of that group."
1,"This Agatha Christie mystery had an American actor (or a British actor portraying an American).  I was intrigued with the women's fashions, as well as the culture.  The premise was interesting as well - a murder at a &#34;disadvantaged youth&#34; home, which also happened to be a grand mansion."
1,Invasion Earth is a very slow moving Sci-Fi that you really have to try hard to get through the first few episodes. I would not recommend this series.
0,"I watched this because I was in the mood for an alien movie. This is 95% about a man and a woman who gradually fall in love, amid a journey from Central America to the US border, made difficult because of travel restrictions due to an alien invasion.  I'm making it sound better than it is.  For one thing, a lot of Spanish is spoken, with very little translation. For another, this felt more like a three-hour movie, with the man and woman gazing at each other, alternating with looking out for the monsters, who conveniently only appear in the dark. There's about five minutes of monster activity, not counting the ending.  There's even a &#34;War of the Worlds&#34; (the one with Tom Cruise) ripoff scene with monster tentacles investigating a building while the woman tries to be quiet. Things happen with no explanation or purpose for the story.  What a waste of time and what a misleading title."
1,"I like the different alphas and their ablities. They all have their own little quirks,and are funny the way they fight and argue. Just like a family."
1,"It was originally the title of the show that made me avoid it and today years after it first aired I just finished watching the first season. The series was consistently intelligent and the characters tend to grow on you. The show, despite it's violent nature, seems to keep growing on you with every passing episode. This is the story of Jax Teller, vice president of the gang called SOA. He is one of the more encrypted slow-burner characters that I have come across. It is the effortless nature of the show to portray characters and storylines effectively to the audience that makes me a fan.I've often jumped off my chair waving my hands in the air, I've always often just been dumbstruck and at times I've been over eager for the show to be done with because all hell will break lose in just one episode. There are some women in this show but they take a back seat but don't be mistaken there is a queen bee played magnificentally by Katey Seagal who plays Jax's mom ""Gemma""It would be not incorrect to assume that the show is very inspiring and seems to somehow always have a couple of tricks up it's sleeve. My hats of to the creators. I can't even believe I have three seasons left to be watched. I tell you I feel lucky.PS - Some very solid rock tunes that I have never heard before often play in this show. I also wonder if the next seasons will be even more ruthless."
1,Mary Shepherd would hate being called a heroine.  She does her job in a no nonsense manner while juggling and caring for her wildly dysfunctional family. This is a not-to-be-missed series.
1,The acting the writing the concept.....it has great replayability as well for viewing a second time. It's like silance of the lambs/six feet under/CSI all rolled into one quality show.
1,"As MST3k is sort of a show within a show within a movie format, I like to review the sections of each episode in order to give it a final rating.The movie: If you are wondering why you never heard of this movie even though it was released in the late 90's, don't.  There are films from the 50's that have better special effects (and acting, and directing, etc.)  With this movie you get dinosaurs that are 20 feet tall in one scene then 5 feet tall in the next; the nicest smoking, swearing nun that used to be a drug running prostitute; and several fights in a factory that apparently ships air in their boxes.  Need more proof that this is a great bad movie:  per Wikipedia, the movie crew predicted that this film would be shown on MST3k - while they were still shooting.Host Segments: The first few are not that great.  But Pearl and Crow save the show with some really funny skits at the end.Riffs: Constant and steady wins the race so kudos to Mike and the bots.  There were several good riffs and I loved Mike's presentation during the ending credits of the movie.Overall: Bad movie, funny segments, and funny riffing.  Not a top 10 classic but one of the better episodes."
1,Both my grandsons love this show.  They watch it one our Kindles and my iPad.  The streaming is perfect so the picture and sound quality is great.
1,"A terrific show detailing lives of workaholic lawyers winning cases and coping with different points of view. This show is full of lies, untold feelings and everyone trying to keep their own secrets under rapes."
0,"Folks, there are no aliens. *Nobody* saw any aliens before the 1930's. I believe Guy Ballard on Mount Shasta was the first. Why the 1930's? Why in the United States? Because of SCYFY PULP MAGAZINES, that's why. Sure, people have seen strange stuff since time immemorial, but nobody specifically saw ""aliens"" until the 1930's.Why don't the aliens tell us anything terribly important which we don't already know? When people were afraid of a thermonuclear war, the aliens warned us about...surprise...the perils of the A-bomb. Thank you. When people began to worry about environmental destruction, the aliens started to sound like Al Gore. When Barack Obama was president, a particular alien faction revealed that *he* (Obama) was an alien. Yet, during the primary elections, when Obama was just one of several candidates, the aliens were silent...And, good people, if the aliens are so damn sophisticated, WHY DO THEIR SAUCERS ALWAYS CRASH? HA HA HA.But OK, I admit that none of the above definitely *disproves* the existence of 57 breeds of aliens, visiting Terra for no better reason than mutilate some cows, drop a Bigfoot off in Pennsylvania, or make a fool out of Jimmy Carter. Planet Earth *could* be the fun house of the Galaxy.I mean, it certainly LOOKS like it! :-D"
1,Another great BBC series.  I was sad to see it come to an end.  I would recommend if you liked Little House on the Prairie type shows.
1,my wife and i love the show.  can't wait to watch the other seasons which are also on amazon prime.
1,Everything has to start somewhere but as a viewer there is only so much nostalgia one can have for sci-fi.  Thus is a 50 year old season and it shows.  Campy at best.  If you want a good starting point for Dr. Who I suggest starting with Dr. #3 in app 1970.  This is also the start of color. That being said seeing Cybermen as an original 'bad guy' shows the connection to the past.
1,"Gotta love the sponge Bob, great show, it's awesome how the humor can make kids laugh and older, adult kids laugh even harder.Just a great show."
1,A little quirky at times.  The lead character is definitely quirky but in a good way.  The homicides can be a little quirky and weird but it makes for an interesting show.  The characters are strong and the actors are good.  Sad to see only 2 seasons to watch and nearly done with Season 2 but I've enjoyed it.
1,"This show has a lot to offer with adventure, love story and suspense.  It is a good show to watch"
1,Love his character...and series. Cases of national importance. Hastings and Ms Lemon are perfect in their roles as well. Good stuff.
1,Foyle's War has excellent actors and story lines. It's a &#34;do not miss&#34; in our home. Watch it sooner rather than later.
1,"The season starts out with a bang, and follows through all the way to the end of the season. Rose continues to work well with the Doctor."
1,"Love the writing, love the characters, and am sorry to find out they only made two seasons. Wish I had watched this when it was on the air. Bring it back for a season three!"
1,Cumberbatch is excellent.  The story line is great about the new surveillance environment we are living in and what is to come.  Watch if you are interested in how subtle we loose the rights we have come to be consider in alienable.
1,"This was interesting for the series to go from High School to college.  Most of the cast remains and Veronica is on the case again.  The sizzling romance with Logan is rekindled .  The college scene is somewhat believable, but I thought needed a little bit more work.  The last scene was a heartbreaker."
1,I'm giving this five stars because not only does my daughter loves it but both my husband and I love it too. We love the music in it.
1,Another great BBC production. This one has the former Mr. Holmes as a mild mannered mathematician who continually does what no one else can do.Great series looking forward to more form BBC/
1,"This like season two of lost in space was the time when a serious show went into the land of silliness, although it's alot of fun and fast moving the whole concept of the show was scrapped for this more kid friendly romp that could be said to be the fantasy season part one.  I like this but after the first two seasons I just wanted the noncamp era back.  That being said this camp era is a blast if you just enjoy it like that."
1,"AMc first broadcast The Pilot and The Cage as a two-for-one sort of deal. It meant that everything was going out at the same time, and that you got a complete picture. you still can see then this way, too, but I'm not sure for the duration.When you go into the show, it has this Twin Peaks feeling that you just can't shake. Laura Palmer's murder inches into the mind, only Palmer did not have anything like this. First of all, the clues are not ones that pop into the mind like some kind of odd notes. They have meaning and, on top of that, they have things that say something to the viewer. They also have something in them that goes deeper than death. You see the impact and the grief, and you see the people that are after the people who did this. It would be easy to dismiss parts of it but, in a good show, it all counts. Then this show leads to the Cage, where a lot of the stuff takes on a shape.If you have yet to watch, you are missing out. The VOD showing is great and it is one you might want to get before you fall too far behind. Besides, it is worth watching and then some, making you on of those that is in the in. I personally see a 5/5 program starting up and continuing, and I like it. i like the way it all feels, and I like the fact that I can keep on keeping on with it. I have just finished a 4th show as I write this and it all fits. Even the sadness does not go away.I do not cry normally, either, but this chokes me up. It is rare and then some, for sure."
1,"Interesting movie with good acting and plot. Was interesting to see To, Hamks in his cameo role."
1,"This film is about things that are reversed:  people look in the mirror and see the reverse image.  They look into X-rays and see a heart that's on the wrong side.  They look at their spouses and don't recognize them at all.  But it's also about things that are broken:  those same mirrors moments later, the windshields in their cars, and even broken people and relationships.It's hard to review this film in a way, because if you discuss any of the plot, it seems that you may be introducing a spoiler.  But in reality, even after watching, I'm not completely convinced that I know exactly what happened.  I will say that I considered an alternate universe idea -- with an evil doppelganger, perhaps everyone has one (physicists would argue that there are infinite universes, and in each of those, at least where ""you"" exist, ""you"" are different) -- and I did consider the old she-died-and-is-in-purgatory-but-doesn't-know-it-yet idea.  But the ending seems to at least dispel the latter.  I'm still not sure about the former.This film was filmed mostly in London, a city where I have been.  I liked ""The Tube"" scenes.  ""Mind the gap!"" is all that I could think about while watching those scenes, especially when the lead risks her life to fish a photograph off of the tracks.  At any rate, ""mind the gap!"" is surely advice that Americans should heed more often here in the States.  Especially lately.I also really liked the color palette that the director chose; mostly cool and cold blues to set the mood and tone.  And I definitely liked the fact that this was more of a psychological thriller than what Hollywood seems to like to pump out on a constant basis.  Aren't you as sick as I of all those slasher flicks?  At least this is a ""thinking man's"" -- or ""woman's"" -- film I suppose, even though I'm not convinced that all that thinking did me much good figuring out what was really going on.Maybe more of a 3.5, but I'll round up and give them an A- (or B+) for effort.  For execution?  I'll let you decide on a minor recommendation."
0,"Season One of Lie to Me was promising. The premise was interesting, the plots engaging and Tim Roth is a wonderful actor. However, by Season Two, the flaws that are inherent in a show about someone who ALWAYS knows when people are lying started to wreak havoc. (Hey, why bother with a judicial system? Just have Lightman ask, ""Did you do it?"")The main problem with Lie to Me is that Cal Lightman is the only character who is interesting.  I mean, what do the rest of them actually DO? There are twenty or so people running around a fancy office suite that is called the ""Lightman Group"" but where's the group? They've got an intern, Eli Loker, whose job it is to look scruffy.  Although, later he gets promoted to ""vice-president"" after a year of being an UNPAID intern.  (I should only be so lucky.  And who's president anyway?  Who's on first?) Torres is obviously window dressing.  (She doesn't even have any training in psychology--let alone acting.) And Lightman's partner, Foster, is there to say ""I feel your pain"" and stumble around on 6-inch stilettos. (To be fair, all the women in the show wear 6-inch stilettos. And don't get me started on the collagenized lips.) And because Lightman is the only person with brains, the writers had to invent juvenile stuff for the other characters to do (i.e. almost kissing, nearly kissing, finally kissing) which didn't require any. Bo-ring.The other glaring problem is that by the second half of Season Two, it becomes manifestly clear that the writers have no idea what they are doing. First, Lightman has to pay off his ex-wife in order to keep her from taking their daughter to another state. (That NEVER happens in real life. With joint custody, neither parent can move the child out of state. Didn't these people watch Boston Legal?) Having paid off his wife, his business is about to collapse. (What is his business anyway? Why does he need all those people? And if all he has to do is stare at a person to figure out what they're thinking, why does he need all that equipment?) So, he gets involved with Clara, who has scads of money but is dumb as a post. (They eventually get rid of Clara because she really, really can't act. She just has these enormous LIPS, which they figured would distract the audience from the fact that there was NO PLOT.) Then, Lightman does something stupid with some Peruvians (who weren't from Peru, by the way. They were home-grown Latinos. You could tell by the accents, and the fact that the Sendero Luminoso has been defunct for about 30 years, give or take a decade.) Now Lightman's afraid of losing custody of his daughter (When did he get custody? I thought his ex had custody). So the FBI agent who hangs around the Lightman Group (doing what exactly?) breaks the law not just once, but several times, so Lightman can keep his daughter. (Although, frankly, I'd give her up.  She's an airhead, and that ""deer caught in headlights"" look wears thin after awhile. And why is she ALWAYS hanging around her father's office? Doesn't she go to school?) But the agent doesn't get fired, because by now the Lightman Group has broken so many laws it would be ridiculous to fire an FBI agent for impersonating an officer, withholding evidence, obstructing justice...you know, all those little things you'd normally go to jail for.With all the inconsistencies, logic errors and contrivances, the plots got increasingly incoherent, until NOBODY could follow what was going on. Not even the Harvard grad who came up with the idea for the show in the first place. Even if you think you know what the stories are about, you really don't, because nothing the characters do makes any sense...not in this world or the next. (Why get yourself admitted to a mental hospital to have a two-minute conversation with someone.  Why not just go and talk to her?) And when you haven't got a decent story, the obvious thing to do is to keep transmogrifying your main character (all you Buffy fans know what that word means). Now he's a psychologist, now he's a former criminal, now he's Rambo, now he's a gambling addict, now he's an overprotective father, now he's sleeping with that awful Clara with the LIPS god help me ... and then add enough bombs, terrorists, and psychokillers until, you hope, the audience will have completely lost sight of whatever it was the writers thought they were doing when they should have been WRITING.I have to stop, because the more I think about this show the worse it gets . . . and I really like Tim Roth. (sigh)"
1,A series about health group lets flu epedmic out and everyones dies except for ages..  I recommend it for ages 18 and up.
1,"or so this documentary will tell you. I have enjoyed all of the Charlton Heston movies I have seen. One of my top 5 favorites is THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH, his first major movie. Even the off-beat movies like WILL PENNY, were entertaining. The man had a mind of his own - unusual in Hollywood: particularly at his rise to fame."
1,"You know, I really like plucky McCormack and her seemingly hopeless family.  She's got my vote and I'm sorry the series came to an end."
1,Here you have a cop that understands how to justify doing the wrong to bring about the right.  He tracks down killers and bends the rules to make sure they no longer victimize people.  He's ethical and unethical at the same time and it's interesting to see to what level of insubordination he'll go to right a situation.  Compelling and thought provoking.  You root for Luther as he is consumed with bringing the criminal to justice.  Same for season 2.
1,"JT is one the strongest players to play Survivor. Stephen is one of the smartest to ever play the game. These 2 paired up makes up one of the greatest duos in survivor history. Coach is an obnoxious player who thinks he knows everything and is a big joke. This is his first appearance out of his 3 times playing and is one of a kind. Eddie George's wife Taj is in this game and probably would be voted out early but she finds something that helps her stay in the game. Tocantins is probably the worst location Survivor could ever choose. The island setting is more fitting for survivor and Africa is a good switch up because of the wildlife. There really isn't anything good about the Brazilian highlands. Exile island is a big sand dune and 2 people from opposite tribes get an opportunity to form an alliance. I didn't like Tyson at first, but he grew on me and I realized he's great at challenges and he can have a really tight knit alliance. Give Tyson a chance and he will win you over. There is a surprise vote in the beginning and turns out that it really is a good or bad thing depending on the decisions the players make after they get voted for."
1,"It used to be that the only European films that could succeed in the US market were war films being able to pull in the ticket sales and the Academy Awards.  Examples include Battle of Algiers, Battleship Potemkin, Das Boot, and Lawrence of Arabia.  More recently, European filmmakers have been successful in other genres, such as romance (A Very Long Engagement), crime (Stieg Larsson's Millenium trilogy, Layer Cake), fantasy (Pan's Labyrinth) and comedy (Waking Ned Devine).  This success has been geographical in spread, starting with movies from the UK, France and Spain, and spreading West to the rest of Europe.  Finally, Scandinavian films are catching up.  Starting with the Swedish Millenium trilogy, followed by the cult horror classic, Let The Right One In, and last year's Finnish Rare Exports, 2011 saw the release of the Norwegian film Trollhunter.  Part comedy, part horror, and part fantasy, this film follows the mockumentary style of the Blair Witch Project, though it is less scary and less shaky.  This feature-length film follows a supposed trollhunter, an employee of Norway's government, who is assigned to track down and kill trolls that have left their refuge.  For those willing to put up with subtitles, this is a very impressive film.  The special effects are quite good, though this is helped by the fact that all the trolls are seen at night, which allows the filmmakers space in leaving out visual details such as skin texture, hair movement, etc...  The overall story-line is quite original, and the movie is quite enjoyable."
1,"Great BBC period piece with solid cast (many who have appeared in Doctor Who) including Matthew McFadden (Ripper Street, Pride & Prejudice, etc.) and Andy Serkis (Gollum in LOTR) chews up the scenery as a French serial killer. Music, costumes, and enough time (8 hours over 14 parts) to develop the story & characters.  Charles Dickens' father was in the debtor's prison featured in the story & the satire of poverty, class bigotry & government bureaucracy (the perfectly name Circumlocution Office will drive you nuts as you realize our own experience with impenetrable government agencies show nothing changes over time). Sad, funny, scary, moving & thoroughly entertaining. See it free with Prime and spot the Doctor Who actors like a license plate game."
1,Everyone needs to own this movie in it's original version...black and white.  It is something I watch every Christmas.  The best Holiday movie ever made with my two favorite actors...and zuzu too!
1,"If you have a dark sense of humor and enjoy your sci-fi, this is the show for you. Comes in bite-size installments."
0,"Wait, there is an Asian character in the show?  Is she the main character? No. Oh so it is like every other show about snotty evil white people.  I'm bored. Really really bored of this stuff.  I don't even see pictures any more.  It's just a blur of white people, credit cards, and soft porn.  I keep hoping to see something different but nothing ever changes."
1,Having voices in one's head to assist with one's work is not crazy. That detective R gets a visual is a bonus. Really fun to watch each case unfold.
1,"The story lines and acting are superb in Season Three of Stargate Atlantis.  The best thing about the series is the varying episodes emotions from humor (Tao of Rodney & Irresistible) to sadness (Sateda & Sunday).  I really feel the actors are comfortable with their characters and are willing to explore more.  As always, I love the extras.  The behind the scenes and the commentaries are always good.  This is definately worth the purchase."
1,"Have only watched a few episodes, but very good.  Historical detail  is good, gives a pretty good insight into the times, political and social.  Colorful, and it makes history fun to watch."
1,"I am so glad that JUSTIFIED was renewed for a fourth season. There was a website that reported that it had been canceled after the season three. It is a wonderful cast of characters and of course, Timothy Olyphant is just wonderful!"
1,"Don't get me wrong. I really enjoy SOA. Very good show, BUT it would even be better if they kept the small talk down to a minimum. They are constantly having one on one conversations that are on the boring side. Especially Gemma and Tara,Turning out to be more soap opera than action."
1,There are good actors and good writing and a concept that does not get much air time- consequences for our actions.
1,My 4 year old loves watching the show. He said he would give it 4 out 5 stars. Glad amazon has it in the library.
1,Olyphant is just as crazy as he was in Deadwood. So many great Cameos from past actors from other series makes It more interesting.
1,I love mermaids! It was good to find a TV show featuring them.  The stories are good and the water scenes are beautiful.
1,Nice off-shoot of &#34;Greys Anatomy&#34;. The actors characters have diverse personalities and interactions that makes each episode different and interesting to watch. Tends to be a bit too serious at times.
1,"Every body lives Sesame Street. It's nice to have it handy on our kindle, especially when my little guy get up before dawn."
1,"Whiel the first season of Bones was slightly imperfect, partly due to the real geekiness of its actors, it was a pleasure to watch. Fortunately with Season two the craetors have managed to make this an even better series. Boreanaz' stigma of having played Angel in the Buffy franchise is now completely gone and we can identify him with agent Booth completely. Bones social ineptitude is also put more on clear display this time. These are the two main things that mange to make the chemistry between them even stronger than last season."
1,This is a HILARIOUS SHOW!  Each actor has been perfectly picked for their role. I love Betty White. I think this is the best series she's ever starred in. They all have great chemistry with each other. You can tell they genuinely live working together. Great guest stars too.
1,"finish a story, and do it well, very rarely. This show did that, and with style, it should be considered the standard."
1,Each episode ends leaving you with the &#34;have to hurry and watch the next episode&#34;. Outstanding cast of actors. I recommend this tv series to all adults that enjoy mystery policemen shows.
1,"I like this show.  It's a little different than most cop shows and I like the difference.  The characters make the show, of course, but the story lines are fresh, too."
1,"Suits is a fun lawyer series & you will find yourself routing for the under dog here to get a job a this law firm...so he can turn his life around. This series is also full of twists, there is always wheels within wheels working together in this series...a must watch."
1,My husband watches this he likes it. I am not into science fiction so I don't really like it it's fast moving
1,This is a great show if you like a continuing story. It's got plenty of interesting characters and lots of action. Every show is filled with excitment and never a dull moment.
1,"Who knows what lies on the other side of life?  Not that this series will answer any questions about that, but it's interesting to watch what these other folks have experienced.  Is it all true? I don't know.  I watch TV for entertainment purposes...don't you?"
1,"Eureka has outstanding actors cast perfectly in their roles, and what great roles. The situations the script has them in have me laughing out loud! I find myself eagerly forwarding to the next act!"
1,This said it was used but you couldn't tell. The box had just a little wear on the corners other then that it looked new. Would order from them again.
1,"Season three continues the Primeval saga but with several cast changes. While the time travel aspects of the storyline are better than the dinosaur attacks, the change of cast is kind of frustrating as I didn't feel much affinity for a couple of the newbies. However the time travel story is further developed with the dinos and future monsters being kind of a sideline. The finale for this season is very intriguing including  a twist I don't see how future seasons will recover from."
1,"I am so sad that this series was cancelled...it could have gone on and on as far as I am concerned.  Very good story premise, wonderful scripts and the chemistry with all the actors was superb especially Crews and Reese!"
1,A good season but seems like it is losing its umph. I am hoping with the new characters coming up in the 9th season it will get back all of its fire.Each episode was standard fare with little question the crime scene investigators would get their culprit. The last episode is a bit suprising so be ready.
0,This movie didn't strike a nerve with me. It seemed to drag. Others may enjoy it tremendously. Suggest you go ahead and watch at least part and make up your own mind.
1,"One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'and 'Breaking Bad'.Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature,not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like agreat novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich&eacute;' world of the copshow to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'BattlestarGalactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robotwars the same way.This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to bea human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recentpolitics and real world situations.My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we torethrough 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members areremarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity andcontradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters tochange and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seeminglyinexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking -but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they'vetaken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV,even if they're not really why you watch this show.It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've everseen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out andblown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad tofinish a great book.I haven't bought it in other forms, so I can't compare, but generallythe blu-ray set (the non-Cylon box) is quite complete, and well packaged.However, I have read accounts that quality control was a bit of a problemand I didn't escape the bugs. On a couple of my discs there wasa slight 'pulse' to the image at times. At first I thought perhapsit was a strange, but intentional, lighting effect, but looking at it carefullyit seemed more a reproduction problem.This isn't just the intentionally added grain, a look I don't love, but acceptas an artistic decision.Since then, I've read similar comments from others, so I'm not crazy(or at least not in this case!). So, if you do order this, you might wantto make sure it's returnable, and try to do a quick quality check the bestyou can. Of course, if the problem is intermittent, and mostly in the laterdiscs, as was in my case, by the time I saw it it was way too lateto ask for an exchange.None-the-less, for me, the quality of the content way over-rode theoccasional image problems (and I'm a perfectionist - my wifenever noticed the pulsing until I pointed it out.).As far as getting the individual seasons on blu-ray, it looks as thoughyou can do better buying the box set, although prices fluctuatequickly here on Amazon and elsewhere, so I'd advise you do the mathand figure out the most reasonable way to own the complete set.Also, Amazon UK currently has a complete region free blu-ray boxset for about $100 with shipping.  It seems to have all the same extrasas the US box set.  Well worth considering as long as the price holds up."
0,This is a rehash of the dreadful &#34;reality TV&#34; junk.  Just terrible.  Why any published author would participate in such a venture is difficult to conjure.
1,"I was a little disappointed in the 2nd season of Heroes.  Not because of the acting, but because it was so short.  Turns out this was filmed during the writers' strike, so they had to cut the season down to eleven episodes.This meant that the story-lines weren't as fully explored as they could have been, and there was a lot less content.All of that detracted from an otherwise entertaining show.Moving on to Season 3...."
1,my husband and I  really have been enjoying this show just found out about it from our grandkids and have had fun watching it
1,My little ones figured out how to purchase videos and shows on our kindles and this one happened by accident! Fortunately its a good one and they love it.
1,This show grabs ahold of you and does not let go watched all prime available seasons in a couple days. Just one more episode either myself or my hubby would say. Just one more. Riviting with characters you care about. Well done show. And not predictable.  Watch but be sure you have time and do not plan on much sleep. Oh and have snacks on hand. :)
1,very very good show lots of violence tho like the actors winona boyd arlo and the chief marshall watch if you can
1,I enjoy all of the acters and actresses in Cranford and enjoy the English shows and this was as good as any I have seen.
1,"Although there are scenes seen in other documentaries, this series is interesting, the photography is stunning, and very interesting. There's also new information and geographical information ties things all together very well."
0,"2012: Apocalypse of the Dead (a.k.a. Zone of the Dead) is one of those flicks that is so horribly bad, it's good. In a way, you almost have to laud the commitment and conviction presented by the filmmakers because it takes those traits to follow thru with (let's just call it) their ""vision."" Anyway, a good time was had at the movies by me and my snarky homies.But it's not a good time to be in Pancevo, Serbia, not tonight. Pancevo is reputed to be the most toxic city in all of Europe. Legendary Interpol Agent Mortimer Reyes (Ken Foree) and rookie agent Mina Milius (Kristina Klebe) are the principals in overseeing a prisoner transfer of which route will take them to Belgrave and then London. Did your eyes roll, like mine did, when Reyes reassured a nervous Mina: ""If ever there was an easy assignment, this is it."" Oboy.But before they get to easy street, they have to pass thru Pancevo, just in time for that unnatural chemical leak  at the railroad track and the resulting zombie outbreak. Cornered by zombie hordes, desperate to survive, the agents join forces with their enigmatic prisoner (Emilio Roso) who seems to be more in the loop about what the ef is going on with the walking dead.Later, the group crosses paths with a sniveling reporter and a berserker soldier (fresh out the nunnery) who spouts doomsday propaganda. Weird? Surreal? Creepy? Offputting? Yes. This crazed warrior would go on to say (with gusto) things like: ""Smells like the end of days.""Oh, where to start, where to start? I'm tempted to give this a higher rating, only because I had ba11s of fun. But I won't. This is the first ever Serbian zombie movie, so congratulations, but it's crap. The production is so low budget I suspect my 6-year-old niece was the money behind it. The acting - I'm not sure if the English was dubbed for the Serbs or if the Serbian actors spoke their lines phonetically. Theirs is some of the worst delivery of dialogue I'd ever heard. The intonations, the inflections, are weird. The body language is off. But I don't want to cut slack on the other cast members who flaunts English as their native tongue. They're also ridiculous. The entire cast is so wooden no one had better light a match. My main reason for tuning in was to watch Ken Foree, who was so badass in Romero's seminal Dawn of the Dead (and maybe the best zombie film of all time). Here - and, given, it's some thirty years later - Foree seems comparatively subdued and worn down.The gorehound elements? Are weak. The zombie make-up is passable. But there's not much in the way of authentic scares. The zombie feastings are executed so cheesily. Neither are there memorable zombie kills. What's more, the zeds can't make up their minds whether they're slow shufflers or fast, hyperactive runners.The film isn't well served by its characters making moronic decisions (given, most are there to engorge the body count). Or by that horrid shaky cam.The positives? Yes, there are some, other than the happy accident of the film's sucking so hard, it gets good. Three good things. The Serbian setting is appropriately moody. I liked the nod to Assault on Precinct 13. The prisoner here is no Napoleon Wilson but he affects some of Napoleon's cool under pressure and shaky allegiance. The other neat thing is the meta-reference to Dawn of the Dead:- Jan the d0uche reporter: ""Wait, maybe we should find some shopping mall or something.""- Agent Reyes: ""It'd be too hard to secure. And believe me, they would get in anyway.""Best moment in the movie.Parting observations off the top of my head (and, I guess, a SPOILERS alert):- In the midst of fleeing the zeds, folks will insist on having meaningful discussions- snapping necks shouldn't kill zombies because the brain isn't affected (but it works in this movie)- Yes, absolutely, a desk with some chairs on it shoved against the door will keep out the zeds- Until a girl has a panic attack and starts dismantling that desk and chairs because, quote, ""I need to get out!""- Lovin' the prisoner's dramatic but absolutely unnecessary midair leap while gunning down zeds (who are still blocked by that desk)- Living legend, ex-CIA, 20-years-in-the-field, Interpol Agent Mortimer Reyes needs to work on his stance when holding a firearm. Also someone needs to teach him the proper technique for holding a gun and flashlight together.- When the group encounters a bunch of zombies lying prone on the ground (sunbathing?) in almost perfectly spaced order, Agent Reyes opts to walk thru them instead of, say, around them.- A professor decides to check if the area is finally clear of poison gas. How? By removing his gas mask.- So what happened to that girl who was abandoned at the dock by the creepy reporter? She gets saved by the prophecy warrior but then we don't see her anymore.- Stick around for a mid-credits scene to see what happens to the reporter. It's a lazy nod to the opening sequence of Lucio Fulci's classic Zombi 2 (1979)."
1,"A very, very good Samurai film which builds to a tremendous battle. And not a CGI action battle but real, actual actor and stuntman action. OK, no doubt a some CGI was used, but it is mostly invisible (except for the CGI bulls which look completely artificial - but that's 60 seconds out of a two hour movie).""13 Assassins"" is being compared toSeven Samuraiand it's easy to see why, butSeven Samuraistill is top of the class by delving deeper into the psyches of it's outnumbered samurai and by giving us a clearer understanding of the planning and preparation that lead up to its climactic battle. Both of these give the audience a deeper investment in the characters and the outcome. ""13 Assassins"" makes efforts at both, but doesn't reach the bar set by its predecessor."
1,I love this series!  Stories are interesting and are concluded with each episode and not carried over to next time. I love Dennis Haysbert as Jonas. His voice is incledible and what a tall man. Sorry it is no longer being made.
1,"I love this entire series with David Suchet as Hercule Poirot. The adaptations of Agatha Christie's novels or short stories are very well done. When I wish to watch a mystery, I always come back to this entire series, just as I reread Agatha Christie Books from Kindle. Thanks Amazon for making  these available!"
1,Too bad this did not last. Everyone needs to keep up with these surveys so that maybe we can keep shows like this from going away
1,"Answer Manmanages to be both philosophically deep and lightheartedly funny at the same time. If you want to see a romantic comedy,Answer Manworks well. It has some funny scenes (including Jeff Daniels' monster collection) and the usual awkward romance. However, if you also like pondering the BIG questions,Answer Manprovides some interesting food for thought. It doesn't so much provide any meaningful answers as to suggest where to look for questions. Perhaps most important question is whether our lives are shaped by our choices or events that happen to us - or both."
1,What a great series this was.  need to get more series like this one.  I wish it was still on television.
1,This is the best of the best comedy Stand-up. The fact that I was able to just watch continuously one comedian after another was great. I had the best laughter I have had in a long time.
1,My favorite cartoon from when I was a kid! I've been waiting a LONG TIME for these DVD. Thank GOD!! I'm all for Ickis! He's my favorite!!! I'm glad these are back. Check em out! You'll love these little guys!
1,"Nice continuation from session 1.  The romance between Gavin and Stacy develops, helped an hindered by their odd cast of friends.  Good fun and well worth watching."
1,I love British TV anyway but this series blows everything out of the water! I think everyone should be playing attention to what this show is showing and even through the host makes a point of stating this is just a TV shows these things are already in place and growing! I am not sure it is still on because there was only one season available on Amazon.I love everything I ever watch with Benedict Cumberbatch in he is such a great actor and so believable in every part he plays whether it is in this show or Sherlock Holmes. He is the best Sherlock! He stole each scene he was in! Love this actor he is brilliant ! The Brits really produce and write excellent shows! Bring more seasons to Amazon!
1,"This series is based on a Danish series, set in Seattle. The Killing is one crime being investigated in this series, a 17-year-old girl's murder. I am so used to there being a crime that is solved if not in each episode certainly by the end of a season. Each episode is a daily portrayal of the police investigation. It is great, it is engaging, it makes you care about what the police are doing and how they are doing it. It follows people connected to this little girl and makes you care about them and I truly want to find out what happens to all of them. I recommend it absolutely! I am starting on Season 2 and really looking forward to it."
1,"WELL MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT AND WONT STOP ASKING TO WATCH IT. IT HAS A REAL WAY OF SHOWING KIDS HOW EVEN WHEN YOU ARE FRIENDS YOU WILL FIGHT BUT THEN MAKE UP. LIFE WORKS OUT. I LOVE THE OLD WWAY ABOUT IT. KIDS OUT PLAYING USING THEIR IMAGINATION, WHAT MORE COULD YOU GET FROM A BEAR."
1,"In the time since Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) was kidnapped, the United States has become a dangerous place.  Suicide bombers hit the country on a regular basis, and no one is safe.  New President Wayne Palmer (D. B. Woodside) has arranged Jack's release from a Chinese prison camp.  Jack is to be traded to the terrorists in exchange for a promised cease fire.Jack agrees to give his life for the peace of his country.  But when he finds out that it was all a lie, he escapes to begin another cat and mouse hunt with the terrorists.  Only this time, they've already struck once, leading to a calamity.  Meanwhile, the trail leads Jack to his own family.  What secrets are his dad and brother hiding?  Can he stop the terrorists before they unleash even more terror on America?And more importantly, what happened to this once great show?  I've been a fan of this show since season one.  While my favorite season was the third, I've thought all of the previous seasons were great.  But not this one.Part of the problem was the been there, done that factor.  The writers seem to be out of plot twists, so they are relying on the same one stand bys.  Unfortunately, loyal viewers can see those coming.  There was very little here that we hadn't seen before, which made the season boring.The other big problem was the dropped storylines.  Several times, a story was introduced and dropped in a matter of episodes.  Sometimes, they came back, sometimes they didn't, leaving us hanging.  Add to that the increase of personal drama over suspense, and you've got a lack luster season.Now, it wasn't all bad.  This season was still entertaining.  But compared to the previous years, day six was a real let down."
0,I  rated it  one star  only because the  review  requested  it. It started  with  great  promise  but  the  ending  stank.
1,"The Gate to Hell is closed, but not without it's consequences.  Demons are out, and now, Sam and Dean are in a race against the clock.  That year Dean has is wasting away."
1,I choose 5 stars because who doesn't like to be competitive and what better than with guns you judge a person by how he look but most of the time your wrong on his skills as the show proves that
1,This is a great show for children in pre-k or even younger. It really helps introduce counting and small arithmetic operations such as adding and subtracting small numbers. The characters are very kid friendly and their adventures involve real people as well as other animated characters. You cannot go wrong with this show!
1,"This is one of the best series I've watched in a loooong time.  The characters are loveable, unforgettable and endearing.  I recommend this to all my TV-watching friends."
1,I love these true stories on missing persons.  It's so interesting to hear what has happened to these people.  I can't stop watching...
1,"Suits is good in spite of being packed to the gills with unrealistic scenarios.  A lot goes on that would never be seen in a law office but that is what TV is all about, isn't it?  The awkward love/hate between Harvey and Mike is saved by Louis.  Louis is one top notch bad person who takes heaps of abuse and yet manages to remain likeable - sort of."
1,"I am a dinosaur when it comes to TV.  There are so few TV shows today that I like.  The format for today's shows bores me.I still use an antenna and had never seen this show. When it was syndicated a friend told me I had to watch it.  I was hooked immediately!  What a great show!  The writing is excellent, the cast is brilliant.  Whoever cast that show deserves an award!  Since I don't have cable I have not seen Season 5 yet and can't wait for it to come out on DVD."
1,"The Backyardigans is a great show that focuses on the brilliant creativity of kids' play. The fantastic music is always a hit and the stories often have a subtle lesson in manners, sportsmanship and addressing misunderstandings."
1,An entertaining slooth series of historical importance. This show gives a sense of what England's people went through during the war while weaving in murder mysteries in the story.
1,"update: I did not keep watching this series because it was identical to the Danish one, almost frame for frame.  Imagine my surprise then to hear that viewers were in an uproar when it finished this week because there is a cliffhanger instead of a resolution plus (evidently) the murderer in the American version is not going to be the same person as in the Danish original. I was amazed because the Danish one could not have ended in a more clear cut and logical fashion.  The murder was solved.  The murderer was someone quite logical and a ""person of interest"" throughout to the investigators.  My recommendation is now to go find the Danish one, which is excellent.  It is too bad that the Americans didn't just keep reproducing it frame for frame, the way they started out.This is an American remake of a Danish tv series of the same name.  I have seen the entire Danish tv series.  This is a very faithful and well done recreation of the series yet changes it to English language and Seattle rather than Copenhagen.  There are some fairly minor differences so far between the two scripts. For example, the lead detective, a woman, has a real battleaxe of a mother staying with her in the Danish version as she's getting ready for her second marriage in three weeks time.  She has been eliminated in the American version but she is the only character to be eliminated.  Since I found the mother very annoying, I don't see that as a flaw.  Some other slight differences: her underling male detective in the American version is not hostile to her like he is in the Danish one. In fact, they seem to get along; the male politician in Copenhagen is a lot more complex character than he is in Seattle but that may be because Copenhagen politics are downright baffling.  Otherwise we are pretty much right on point scene for scene right down to the music for the show. My original review follows.The action for the two detectives is discovering a 17 year old girl who has been murdered.  She was discovered in the trunk of a car in a lake.  She was put in the trunk alive and took about ten minutes to die once underwater.  The detectives are up close and personal with the family and the family goes completely to pieces (in both versions). The car was owned by the male politician's political campaign and it was he and his workers who used that car. The girl was supposedly with a female classmate for the last three days but it turns out that she hadn't been.  No one knows where she was after the school Halloween dance. The first suspect interviewed is her last boyfriend, a spoiled rich kid  The detectives will continue combing through everyone and everything.  The quiet doggedness of the woman detective is what really stands out in the series and she is in almost every frame of the show."
1,I am not a critic but have found this series very enjoyable.  This is so much better than the original series that it is simply a step up in entertainment.  A good way to fill in some winter and bad weather hours.
1,Hilarious classis British comedy.  Cleese is great but I enjoy all the characters.  I wish there were many more seasons!
1,"Intriguing sequence of events catapult the viewer into the world of a English period piece. Aptly done with great acting, action, and romance. To disappear into a bygone era is a pleasure indeed through this presentation."
1,I like this series because of the historical information provided.  The subject matter is very interesting and fun to follow along as they track down the various &#34;mysteries&#34;.
1,"Season 2 is as good as season 1: a cop show with quirky characters (very much reminiscent of Elmore Leonard, whose stories inspired the series), a strikingly handsome and charismatic star, and violence that is sometimes seriously and other times humorously handled. If you like the show, you may find yourself looking up what US marshals do on Wikipedia--we did. So you enjoy yourself for 45 minutes or so AND you learn something."
0,Very disappointed wouldn't recommend it at all! It downloaded good but other than that it isn't worth any ones time!
1,My received a pup for a gift and it is a &#34;hog dog&#34;. We wanted to see why and we learned different kinds of dogs can be trained to be &#34; hog dogs&#34;. I did not realize how fast these animals reproduce and the damage they can cause. The people who do this for a living won't have to worry about job security!
1,"This is one nicely filmed but mean as heck crime thriller with as many twists and turns as your favorite roller coaster. The two kidnapping criminals play the main part. These unsavory individuals are not there for the viewer to like or to identify with. They are innately repugnant. The worst of the two of them is suspicious of everything and ready to get crazy violent at any second. The victim is pretty, but she is no more pleasant than the criminals. The bad guys have the whole thing planned out and practiced really well, but a lot of unexpected stuff happens and the plan gets desperate really quickly - and the viewer has no idea who will survive this scenerio. There are some really suspenseful moments that will keep the viewer on the edge of the seat. There is a ton of tension and drama between the three characters. The acting is all around very good. Beyond the kidnapping, a few tussles and some bondage, there isnt much violence. There is no need for extreme blood and gore. There is some (hetero and homo) sexual content, and there is a healthy dose of (male and female) nudity. If you start this movie, you wont want to stop until it concludes and you can finally stop holding your breath."
1,Coffee!! The characters are either making coffee or drinking coffee...all of the time. If there is such a thing as a Columbian Coffee Bean Grower's Association? I am sure they are behind it. :)
1,"This was a memorable season for the show, revealing a lot of tension.  I am not sure, however, how satisfying it was.  Yes, I'm giving the season three stars and they produced quality work.  However, while I am enjoying the events, I'm not sure that I'm enjoying the characters.  I find myself in the odd position of not being sure if humanity -- as represented by the main characters -- is worth saving.  All of these people are deeply flawed.  I don't feel actual respect for any of them.  Of course, they are in a situation like none in which I have been, so perhaps I'm being overly harsh.Battlestar Galactica is a decent show.  The actors for the most part do their jobs well and the individual stories are interesting.  I'm just finding myself questioning whether I should be rooting for the enemy... or for anyone at all."
1,Really like this show it is so nice to get the seasons that I missed earlier.  Thank you Amazon
0,"I understand the existential concept of this movie. That's not the problem with it. The problem is simple, while concepually it has merit, the whole thing is so slow and boring that it was next to impossible to sit through. The film appears to have been made by people who were sleeping through it, from the mystery woman, who was stupid enough to leave her motel room door wide open while she was showering...a cruddy motel too no less to the Greek chorus watching the tire villain. The film plods along like an 18 wheeler goin through the gears. I'll never watch it again and that's for sure. It was a waste of 1.5 hours of my life."
1,I am enjoying the Tudors very much. Some acting could be improved but overall the action is exciting. It is entertaining.
1,This shows is full of good scientific information. They come with a formula that make complex topics easy to understand. They present all kind of topics in the show from animal intelligence to the universe. I highly recommend the show.
1,"4.5 starsI knew nothing of this until a friend lent it to me this weekend. I laughed. Often. At things that aren't supposed to be funny, but as any serious fan of comedy knows, those can be the best laughs. I walked away feeling lighter and happier. If that ain't comedic success, what is?IASIP is like Seinfeld if the SeinFour were ten years younger, Irish, and ran a bar in South Philly. These guys have clearly studied Sein and Curb very closely, and their tight timing and topics and banter are all very Larry Davidesque...but they go places even LD won't. The best two shows of the 7-episode first season are about cancer and abortion; I howled at some moments. These guys have done what so many guys want to do: make a show about how funny they are. Except, these guys really are funny. Sometimes. But hey, no one's always hittin' homers, even on comedy 'roids, so I cut these three some slack and marvel at how tightly they work together. There's a lot to be said for working with old friends, if they have talent: the camaraderie and timing here are born of many years of drinking and laughing and thinking and falling down, no doubt. And these three guys are each pretty dang funny, each in his own fashion.DeVito is ok but I liked the first season best for its rawness. Still, as the later shows get a little more polished it's often in good ways.If you don't like drinking, if you insist on PC language from your friends and neighbors, and if you are in general just plain uptight about people living and thinking the way you want them to, look elsewhere. But If you enjoy tying one on and laughing your butt off at the endlessly silly idiocy that accompanies being alive in America these days, you may just find Always Sunny to be almost always funny."
0,"Swamp People was an ok show. I chose to watch this show after seeing it pop up as a recommendation here on Amazon. I love the show Mountain Men and I love the show Duck Dynasty and Swamp people seems to try to capture some of the same feelings from these shows. You have the &#34;redneck&#34; feel from Duck Dynasty and the &#34;tough guy&#34; feeling from Mountain Men. While it was definitely interesting to get a peek into the unique lives of the people on this show, I didnt feel like any of the characters really had that appeal or charm that a reality show needs to keep viewers interested. Plus, there are really only so many times one can watch people catch crocodiles in a swamp. &#34;Meh&#34; is my overall opinion of this show. I wouldn't recommend it or choose it again."
1,I DO NOT HAVE CABLE TV IN MY HOUSE &  HAVE WATCHED THIS AT A FRIENDS HOUSE ....BUT IM TOO CHEAP TO SPRING 4  CABLE WHEN TV IS FREE....SO WHEN I SAW IT OFFERED ON MY KINDLE FIRE ON AMAZON PRIME FREE APP... I JUMPED AT  IT....LOVE THIS & THERE ARE NO ADVERSTISEMENTS.......LOVE IT
1,"This show has it all with the sexiest guy around! You know Matt Bomer! He is smart, clever and all those things wrapped up in a Man body. The show is great with all the other characters mixed in. You should get a copy and see for yourself."
1,At first I didn't think I would like it because the main female actress didn't seem to be strong enough for her part but I changed my mind after the first couple of shows.  It is something I am watching now and enjoying it.  Time well spent!
1,"Great way to fill that gap before the new episodes come out, I highly recommend this to those who love the Doctor."
1,"A very interesting premise: can a man with eidetic memory and perfect score on LSAT play a lawyer without having even been tocollege let alone law school? More broadly, do lawyers have scruples and/or consciences? The series attempts to answer thesequestions through video narratives."
1,"Has some educational aspects which are a must for me for my kids, there are cute songs and my kids really enjoy it!"
1,"...and the episodes for this season got stronger and stronger throughout the season. Epilogue is an excellent episode.I thought this series ended too soon. It had fantastic talent not only in front of the camera, but behind it too.It was my favorite of the three SG series.It is good to see that the talent has gone on to other shows like Once Upon a Time, Longmire, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. that are successful.I highly recommend SG:U for your viewing pleasure. It is great TV."
1,"I hate that this show only lasted 2 seasons - it is amazing, interesting and a great way to spend a weekend"
1,"Season 6 is OK but the novelty is wearing off.  Jack is superhuman, of course.  Supporting characters Morris & Cloe are interesting. The rest are basic carryovers.  We will see if the new (12 hour) 'Live another day' comes up with something new.  I have been working my way through from season one over the last few months.  Could be better with long breaks between seasons so you get ready for a fresh Jack Attack fix?  That's how I see it.  Have fun watching!"
1,good family show seen by 250 million people for each show at it peak.  just look at what the actresses are doing now: Phoebe tonklin in the originals with Clair holt.  both were also in vampire diaries.
1,"I'm a big Robert Carlyle (&#34;Once Upon A Time,&#34; &#34;Hamish Macbeth&#34;) fan and this is one of his best roles. He isn't the main character - that would be Benedict Cumberbatch, BBC's most recent &#34;Sherlock&#34; - but he steals every scene he's in and his character is designed to keep the story line moving. Also, the &#34;Big Brother is watching YOU&#34; aspect hits VERY close to home these days."
1,"Storage Wars is an awesome TV show. It's a very fast pace show and it gets right down with the premise in every show. It works!In every show does the same thing will happen. You see all the same characters going around looking in storage units and bidding on the units if they like them. Then, after auction, you find out what they bought exactly in the units. Sometimes they getting their money back, sometimes they losing money, or sometimes they make a profit. That's it! You going to see this exact same thing in every show. But it's so good because everyone loves watching to seeing what they bought in each unit. Then, finding out if they were right or not before buying the unit.I think this shows makes more and more people come out and try to do what these people do in the show. They try to go out and bid on the units themselves, but we usually won't see other people bid and win a storage from the stars of this show. It does happen but we don't usually see that. I believe I only saw that happen once for all 19 episodes.I'm looking forward to watching Season 2 next."
1,"The plot is fascinating. The mysterious illness and deaths are all wonderfully connected to our trusting, naive math genius protagonist. A few weak lines pull the overall score down a bit, but mostly it's a fun, suspenseful, entertaining ride. The ending was unexpected, which made the whole series better. Plus, shirtless Benedict. Almost enough for five stars by himself."
0,"I was extremely disappointed by ""The Great Buck Howard"".The Great Buck Howard (John Malkovich) is a stage performer way past his prime.  A mentalist, he bounds up on stage and proceeds to astound his audience with mind reading, hypnotism and other mental games. The only problem is that he now plays broken down theaters in places like Bakersfield and Fresno and his audience, while still very enthusiastic, is aging and dwindling. In his heyday, he appeared on ""The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson"" sixty three times, a fact he mentions repeatedly, and Carson was so taken by the performer that he called him The Great Buck Howard, a title he has determinedly kept ever since. Preparing for his big comeback, his business manager (Ricky Jay) sets up a meeting with a potential Tour Manager. Troy Gable (Colin Hanks, son of Tom) has just dropped out of Law School and moved to LA to become a writer. But reality quickly settles in and he realizes he needs a job to pay the bills, so he interviews to work with Buck. He gets the job and heads out with the performer, making sure Buck's every request is filled, that the venues have everything set up, stagehands are ready to go, and the like. The problem is that Buck still thinks he is a huge star and expects the venues to treat him as such. Buck is very bitter that Jay Leno has never had him on his new ""The Tonight Show"" and plans a big stunt, guaranteed to kick-start his comeback. He decides Cincinnati is the place and asks his management company to send a publicist. Valerie Brennan (Emily Blunt, ""Sunshine Cleaning"", ""The Devil Wears Prada"") shows up and begins to set everything in place. But she is bemused by Buck and attracted to Troy and her presence causes things to begin to fall apart.Written and directed by Sean McGinly, ""The Great Buck Howard"" misses a very key element to make the film successful and memorable. It lacks the right tone.John Malkovich is interesting as the fading star who feeds on his self-perceived fame and glory. Buck trots out on stage at every venue and shouts, ""I love this town,"" and he really seems to mean it. He plays in aging theaters and is barely able to fill them with his aging audience. But they also seem to genuinely enjoy his show. Buck enjoys performing and seems to eke a living out of it and we can't fault him for this.But Buck Howard is not very funny. We have seen this type of character before. Many times. And many of these performances have been more insightful, more daring and more interesting.For ""Buck Howard"" to work, we need to realize the character knows his career is fading. He doesn't seem to. He enjoys the shows so much, you get the feeling he could perform for one person and he would be having fun. In fact, much of the time, he seems to be trying to make Troy's life more difficult simply to have something to do and maintain his 'great' status.But Malkovich never portrays Howard as being self-aware. If Buck never has any doubt about his ability or standing, are we supposed to either laugh at or with, or feel empathy towards him? He isn't desperate enough and enjoys what he does, even on a smaller scale, too much.Colin Hanks is OK, but he spends most of the time standing to one side, observing everything.Its difficult to tell what Troy is thinking or feeling because Hanks rarely changes his expression. The only clues we seem to get come from his narration. And his narration never seems to stop, rambling on and on. Film is a visual medium, a visual art form, so hearing consistent narration throughout a movie is the equivalent of trying to read a book and having someone consistently shove a DVD player in your face to watch video of what you are reading. Narration is useful and necessary in some instances. It isn't necessary to provide an ongoing commentary about what characters are feeling on screen, when we can't tell this visually. At least it shouldn't be necessary.I can recall two recent examples of narration in film, both bad. In ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"", Woody Allen uses an omniscient (and ever present) narrator to tell us the feelings, thoughts, likes and dislikes of the characters we are watching on screen. It quickly grates on the viewer's nerves. Worse, the narrator isn't even a character in the story. It's like he is reading us a story as we are trying to watch the same fable unfold before our eyes. The narration in ""Buck Howard"" seems designed for a different purpose. In many low budget, independent films, a narrator provides a useful tool. They tell us about things, bridging the gap in the stories, saving the filmmakers some money and allowing the story to proceed. I generally overlook this, because it isn't quite so obtrusive into the experience and it often helps enhance the film. In ""Buck Howard"", I get the sense the narration is designed for the same reasons, to help show things they couldn't afford to film, but Hank's descriptions go beyond this. They start to describe what he and other characters are feeling, thinking, want to do and accomplish. Why aren't we seeing this in the characters themselves? Why do we have to be told this?Hanks is not a very magnetic force in the film. He stands to the side a lot, observing, watching, rarely speaking. When he does, he always seems kind of flat, as though he can't muster up the energy to feel any real emotions. I can't help but think how much different his father's career would have been had he done similar work in the beginning of his career.When Emily Blunt's Valeria shows up, Troy becomes a little more energetic as they begin a romantic relationship. Troy actually smiles a few times and seems to enjoy the companionship.Emily Blunt provides a little bit of fresh air. Valerie arrives in town to help Buck navigate the press corps for his big presentation. From New York, it quickly becomes clear Valerie comes from a different world. She moves faster, registers faster, reacts faster than the people in Cincinnati and seems like a little tornado whirling through the town. As soon as she meets Troy, she begins to flirt with him (she must see something we don't) and he picks up on it, relishing the new relationship. At one point, Valerie can't help but laugh at one of Buck's statements, providing a little ray of sunshine among the group of people who are taking his every word so seriously.Steve Zahn and Debra Monk pop up as a brother and sister designated to be Buck's official hosts in Cincinnati. It is an amusing idea, but the roles don't really go anywhere and they end up simply disappearing.And there is an amusing ongoing joke about a feud between Buck and George Takei (Mr. Sulu on ""Star Trek). But even this leads to what should have been a memorable moment and this moment just falls flat. It almost seems like everyone is playing the scene straight.I suspect ""The Great Buck Howard"" will enjoy a lifetime in obscurity, much like the fictional subject of this forgettable comedy."
1,Fun little movie that you used to be able to find on regular television in the past. Grandchildren enjoy it and learn from it.
1,"5 stars because of the continued excellent acting by all of the regulars & guest actors.  Myka, Pete, Artie, and Claudia could not be better pairings of actors & characters.  Suspend disbelief & enjoy!"
1,The support characters add more to the story than the &#34;star&#34;. I don't recommend because the episodes are too similar.
1,"Epic conclusion to an epic series.  BSG continued on it's wonderful trek in the stars (sorry for a &#34;Trek&#34; reference!) with an ending, while likely controversial amongst the BSG community, still managed to work albeit somewhat bittersweetly.  I have mixed emotions on the finale, but I can't deny this overall series."
1,A funny cartoon however I would not let children watch it.  The humor is meant for adults not small kids.
1,My kids love this show! It's fun and the kids learn social skills and problem solving.We had no problems with streaming it on our smart TV.
1,"The things these characters do are very interesting and somewhat sordid.  They carry on from show to show doing outrageous things and their reasons for doing so are also outrageous.  Not for everyone - the first season is without Danny DeVito, then he joins the group and things get more outlandish.  It won't take you long to know if this show is for you."
1,Discovered this quite by accident and watched the entire season in one weekend.  Love the interaction between Crewes and Reese and the mystery within a mystery concept.
1,"When I saw the first Flashpoint episode, I was totally sucked into the action. It is a compelling series that I thoroughly enjoyed."
1,Just one episode and so far I love it and I will make sure I finish all the ones you
1,Ralan stays true to his code even in the face of defying his criminal father.  Shows all others that crossing the &#34;line&#34; has consequences they can't afford.  Ralan becomes aware of how corrupt Harlan county has become with presence of 3 gangs including Limehouse.  Great scripts with awesome writers makes this one of the best shows and entertainment is at the highest level.
0,This series just drags and drags____ i lost interest and have not watched the rest of the season. I got about 3/4 of the way through the season waiting for a big moment of some sort to happen. It never happened. I may try to finish watching it
1,"We came into the seasons after they were over on the TV, but thought all three seasons were well written, entertaining, and fun.  It was easy to get attached to the characters and were glad we could watch two at a time because you are often left with cliff hangers.  Sadly, the end of this season left us with a major cliff hanger that will not be resolved until hopefully the movie coming out does.  That was my only complaint.  There should have been more seasons following this one."
1,"Fan-tastic. This is a show about terrible people being terrible, and it's hilarious and mean and perfect. Watching the characters grow into such vile monsters is a real joy. Seriously!"
1,"As with all the previous years, this is a great series. The show has not lost its appeal and the acting is still above par."
1,Teachers do the most interesting things these days and teaching doesn't seem to be one of them.  Breaking Bad is an about a Chemistry Teacher who learns he has lung cancer.  He wavers on treatment but doesn't waiver on learning a new line of work to help his family after he is gone.  It's called drug dealing and he makes crystal meth.  He even enlists a former student and high school dropout to help him in his new endeavor.  The show is absorbing and very interesting.  It is low key and not showy but doesn't hesitate to see humor in the man's predicament.  His wife is pregnant with their second child.  Their first child has cerebral palsy.  His sister in law is a shop lifter married to a fervent DEA agent.  The dropout he ignored in school now becomes his favorite pupil.  So much for role models.  Good show with a lot going for it.
1,My son loves Batman and this is a decent show for him to watch. While he does prefer live action - this seemed to entertain him.
1,"Love this show.  It shows positive ways to solve problems and learn from them. Really wonderful interaction  and realationships with family and friends. All the drama and dysfunction in most families could take a lesson from this show. It is wonderful to see a close, loving family that interacts respectfully to one another . Very healthy and realistic. Great values. One of my favorites. Thanks Bill Cosby."
0,"This is a very strange movie. It is an Independent film shot on a very small budget, the characters are ultra quirky marginals, and there's a sense of wonder if the two will actually get together or not, and what is really wrong with the 'woman', why can't she be in love? But then the whole thing has this strange porn thread that runs throughout the film. And the ending is just plain flat out painful with Tom Arnold as the creep out father of the century. Tom Arnold has now hit a home run in the creep category.The director, writer, and lead female is Marianna Palka. Jason Ritter (John Ritter's son) is the lead male actor. The film meanders back and forth between Marianna's apartment, the video store where Jason works, and Jason's car where he lives. In the opening montage, Marianna walks into the video store and goes sheepishly over to the erotica film section. She quickly chooses four movies. Jason tries to convince her that one choice was a bad one, and she should not take that movie. He leaves off renting her the fourth movie, she leaves with the three films. Jason then stalks her at her apartment building.The film is claustraphobic, the apartment is small, Jason over stays his welcome, the two end up just too close to eachother, the car where he sleeps is tiny. The only place that is somewhat open is the video store. Both of these characters have strange habits. She wears baggies over her hands to open the DVD's, she hates to have her hair washed, she collects trash in her apartment, and likes to act out forcing herself on Jason. Jason likes to tell people what movies to watch, he has a regular job but can't afford a place to live, he is creepy about peeking through windows and shower curtains, and following Marianna around.I had a very hard time believing these two characters. It was as if the director / screen writer was trying so hard to make them both seem strange, like outcasts, outsiders; but yet they were both somehow brilliant and deeply misunderstood. And then there was this annoying constant reference to pornography and Marianna's distaste for genitals, male and female. The fact that the two of them are attracted to eachother, well that was reasonable.Technically, there were some problems. The audio was absolutely awful, the music was way overboosted and the dialog was poorly recorded. This is a film that relys heavily on dialog to build the craziness of the two characters, sadly the dialog was frequently muddy. This was a simple shoot, very few locations or sets; the video store, the car, the apartment complex entrance, and the apartment. The director did not use framing to her advantage at all, Marianne changes fairly dramatically in this story; but yet she ends up in random frame positions. There were many jump cuts that were too abrupt. Moments where incredible detail and slow paced filming, butted up against a jump cut to a much later time. The film had a hard time developing a decent rhythm. One moment the camera is in the apartment, the next in Jason's car the next morning.The DVD includes a few trailers, oddly Confessions of a Porn Addict trailer is included. A gag reel that has the poorest sound recording I've ever heard. This is a not so funny 10 minute reel.At One hour and 25 minutes, the movie is a bit long. The ending beats a dead horse a bit too hard. The film is definately R rated and not at all for younger viewers. Oddly, there is virtually no nudity in the film. Everything that makes this film R is verbal.It just seemed to me that Marianna Palka tried to do too much with this film; write, direct, star in, and over play a not so bad love story. Just not a very well made film."
1,"This film was shot in 1994, released in 1997, and aired on MST3K in 1999. I would have to say that this is one of the best episodes of the last season, if not in the top 20 of the entire series."
1,"I'm partial to Samurai and Kung Fu movies, but whether or not that was the case, I still loved this movie.  Nothing is better than a gritty tale of correcting injustice.  This movie did an excellent job of pulling you in to the actual plight and the motive of the 13 assassins.  There wasn't a lot of special effects to rely upon, and as a subtitled movie, the dialogue was concise and good at conveying the plot.  I especially loved the speech given to the Samurais as they were training:  &#34;If you don't have a sword use a stick... if no stick use a rock... you'll die but make the enemy feel pain.&#34;  It's not a precise quote, but those are some very inspirational words."
1,Most of the episodes are well-done and the plot lines are interesting. The interplay among the principal characters is great and the writing is superb.
1,"I never heard of this show.  I watched the first episode. there was something different about it, not sure I liked it.  I had to watch a few more to see if I really cared about the show and the people in it.  I began to care about what was going to happen next--so I liked Life.  Lots of positive messages as well as you never know what is going to happen at any given moment.  Live your LIFE everyday-ON PURPOSE!"
1,"Love this show! A no-holes barred look into the pageant world.  It's amazing how much time, effort and money parents put into it!"
1,Ran across this little gem completely by accident.  Watched the first episode and was hooked-so much so I purchased the entire season based on seeing one episode.  I am very happy it has been granted a second season.  Can't wait for this to come out on dvd as well.
1,Well produced series for teen girls and their moms.  Not disrespectful to elders or other kids.  Just a lot of fun.
1,"Great show, but not one you can pick up in the middle. You'll want to watch it from episode one."
1,I have really enjoyed watching Eureka. The first to seasons introduced all of the key characters and a lot of the projects of the company that built the town. Season 3 brings several changes including that the children have grown older and graduated or advanced scientific minded teens. I love seeing the new projects and their results. The roles of Fargo and of Jo change. Excellent show. Very good imagination.
1,"It's apparently not for everyone, but if you IQ is high enough to understand a plot rather than watching a &#34;reality show&#34;. I thought it was well done. Apparently didn't find the viewers and was dropped after one one season"
1,"What can I really objectively say, I am a total BSG junky and this was a great season.  The writers and actors really put a human face on a concept of a maybe not so distant future and then make the characters human in every sense.  Fos BSG junkies this is a season of healing after a traumatic start to the season and it's one of those seasons where you have to see it from beginning to end to really see this season unfold."
0,"I understand what they were going for, and I enjoy 70's/80's grindhouse stuff, but this isn't it.. Okay, it's a world gone wild, in all places, Halifax, Nova Scotia?? (renamed scum town). My mother would be turning over in her grave. The scenes make absolutely no sense and the extras all seem to know they're extras, because they can't act, especially the ones where the moms are with their kids; it looked like were out shopping on a Saturday and were instantly begged to be in the movie.. The two sadistic brothers were as intimidating as Corey Haim and Corey Feldman... This movie isn't fun, campy or witty, it's sadistic, low budget and completely pointless. I've seen a lot of bad movies, and most of them were Troma films, but I doubt even they would produce something this horrible."
1,But they missed the boat now making into seasion DVD for USA > Its only on PAL. I want ot buy the DVD season not individual episodes
1,I think the acting is brilliant....and the characters they play are interesting. This is more of a phsycological detective show which never shows graphic viiolence...it leaves a lot for the imagination and keeps you wondering. I think the Sherlock series was better but this one comes close...
1,Good to see a cop show with a sense of humor treated like every day life (which it probably is).
0,"I gave it 2 stars because I liked the concept -- alien life purposely brought back to Earth, accidentally let loose -- so I decided to give it a go.  So not worth it. Nothing happens.  Nothing.  It is boring.  No, let me correct that.  It is BOOOOOORING!!!!  Way too many areas of the plot left unexplored; way too much meaningless conversation that does nothing to advance the plot; way too little character development; way too many unanswered questions; and the &#34;plot twist&#34; at the end was incomplete."
1,King Henry VIII to me will always be remembered for having 6 wife's and beheading  two of them. And for being  was a religious nut that forced others to think like him or be burned alive.
1,"Reminds me a lot of the film noire TV series Top of the Lake (gritty themes like drugs, police corruption and incest).  Slow paced and deliberate, kind of like the weather on the western shore of Ireland. Got to dig for redemptive factors but main character is complex hero."
1,"It's been years since Veronica was in Neptune but her departure from New York as a recent law school graduate and promising law firm prospect was masterfully done.  Veronica finds her way back to Neptune to help Logan and ends up not only finding herself in the midst of a case that could potentially clear Logan's name for the murder of his high profile girlfriend but a mystery of the murder from the past.  The movie lives up to the three seasons of the show that saw the series end to soon.  One of the many casualties that resulted from the network changing from UPN to the WB to The CW network (i,e. Star Trek: Enterprise).  Both Veronica Mars and Enterprise series didn't die out because of a lack of viewership but the confusion of the changes of the networks.  If you were a fan of the show then you will love the Veronica Mars movie and will make you want to go back and revisit the series' three seasons.  I"
1,This is an interesting way of living! So different from most people. But so honest and real. An enjoyable way to earn history. This is real reality tv.
1,"My partner is a Political Science Professor and watching Parks & Recreation with her has been wonderful to help understand some of the little innuendo that comes with understanding a comedy dealing with local government.  There are some issues that are so politically incorrect that you'll just have to laugh.  I've loved this series and have them DVR'ed and watch them over and over.  I look forward to the actual release of the DVD (which I have pre-ordered) so that I can watch the episodes without commercial interruption.The characters are extremely funny and stereotypical to what you might imagine a government worker to be like.  Lines like:""What I can accomplish in government can actually be measured"" (after one of the characters is commended for lowering a speed bump two inches).The humor can be dry at times (love it) and it brings out a wonderful side of Amy Poehler[...]A mockumentary series at it's best!"
1,"I tried to get my kids interested in this show, but it is just not happening. It just cannot grab their attention. Seems like a good production though."
1,"This show is worth watching. A cop show with everything. Humor, romance and a man who thinks outside the box . I am so intrigued with the writing and the characters of this show. I just wished it had gone on more seasons. The settings were awesome the premise of the show  well thought out and I didn't find any one show boring or dull ."
0,"Not so good. A bunch of &#34;smarmy, look at me&#34; crooks and murderers that want to get a little bit more noteriety by bragging about their despicable deeds. Would not recommend."
1,I love this show! I can't wait for more seasons to come. I love how it keeps u on your toes. I just which they were longer.
1,"What an incredble series!  Very well written.  Never knew what would happen next.  Extremely intense and you will be ""hooked"" after the 1st episode.  Anxiously awaiting season 2!!"
0,Don't like subtitles in my movies.  Most Asian movies turn me off completely..  They are not my idea of entertainment
0,"After enjoying &#34;Wild China&#34; and &#34;Wild Africa&#34; so much, I was expecting so much more, but unfortunately this was extremely disappointing."
1,"Inspector Morse isn't a likable character. He's snobby, intellectual and frequently less than kind to Lewis, his &#34;sidekick&#34; so to speak. Nonetheless this is a very watchable series, full of twists and turns, not like the pat formula detective/crime shows we're used to. Sometimes Morse is wrong or off track, only stereotype here is Morse's iffy relationship with his higher ups. As always, in shows about professionals who don't follow standard procedure or obey orders, Morse comes under fire....."
1,"I agree with the reviewer JW. The best of the Morses are concentrated in and around the Oxford colleges-so that is perhaps why I only liked this season - very much -instead of loving it.The first episode is the best one, centering around the murder of a police inspector who is writing his memoirs, which includes a chapter on unsolved cases. The discovery of the theft of that chapter during the course of the investigation causes Morse to open a cold case, that of a 17 year old child murder --and its resolution has both moving and shocking consequences.What I always love in the Morse episodes is the dual thread story lines: in search of one thing, Morse discovers entirely neglected byways which lead him to the elusive truth. And it is no different in the other episodes which deal with the death of a feminist cleric, the murder of a local painter, the garroting of a Greek restaurateur and a trip to the Australian outback, which rounds out season five. Four and half stars."
1,"The first season is definitely setting up some of the characters and the story.  The dark technique used in the show is intriguing.  There are times that each episode kind of lags, but somehow the end of each episode always seems to pique interest."
1,"Ryan Gosling has been a household name this past year. This is for good reason: the man has good range. Whether it's playing a ladies man with his Photoshopped abs or a  wheel-man out for blood, he can get us believing in his characters. Last year's All Good Things is another surprising role for Gosling. He plays David Marks (based around the real life Robert Durst), a young man from a wealthy New York real estate family.The story starts off simple and fairly slow. Marks meets Katie (Kirsten Dunst) and they fall in love. They move to Vermont to run a health food store called All Good Things, however they soon return to New York after David's father's urges for him to be a part of the family business. It's at this point things start getting interesting. Once David and Katie get married, things really start getting strange.David soon shows signs of some kind of mental disturbance. From talking to himself, to distancing himself from Katie, it's clear that something isn't right. Gosling handles the many different sides of David with eerie accuracy. The bouts between David and Katie are emotional and intense, which really start to set the tone for the rest of the film.The chemistry with Dunst and Gosling is great (well, despite the dark circumstances that take place). I can't say Kirsten Dunst has done a lot to get my attention since The Virgin Suicides, but in this film she did an excellent job and really had me feeling for Katie. Similar to my response to Gosling and Michelle Williams in Blue Valentine, Ryan and Kirsten really have me believing they are a couple with serious marital problems.This is far from just a relationship gone wrong drama, however. We see glimpses of shady real estate escapades in the background as well as a status-loving family and the pressure that can have. The second half of the film also turns into a dark crime mystery with multiple murders and curious hints placed throughout different scenes. All of these events comprise a bizarre character study that is even more fascinating when considering the facts of which it is based.I found it surprising I haven't heard more about this film, especially considering how ""in"" Gosling is these days. The film is solid with great directing and cinematography, and a top notch cast. Perhaps a lot of people don't enjoy a slower burning drama that builds up character development and story and would rather have the good stuff dished out to them right away. Or maybe I'm just partial to a good dark crime thriller based on real people and events. Whatever the case may be, All Good Things was a great surprise.Source: criticnic.com 25-January-2012"
1,This series was a great show/series!  I find it hard to believe it got cancelled after only 1 season.  It was not shown or promoted because it is much better than shows that have made it for years.  The humor is fabulous...very similar to the M.A.S. H. television series.  The major networks all want criminal minds and csi type shows...we loose  with this all the same philosophy.  I wish they would make more seasons to THE UNUSUALS!  Maybe Netflix or Amazon will make their own series of this show!
1,"This tale is really sloooooooow in the first third and then it picks up some. Inspired by the accused murdered, Robert Durst.Gosling plays a wealthy man named Mark who marries a working class girl named Katie (played by Kirsten Dunst). Their marriage begins with promise but his unstable mood swings create friction to the point where we are left wondering did he murder her or not?Arguably too many flashbacks and back stories did damage to the tale.That said it had its moments in which some scenes were done well, especially when the Dunst character is trying to get certain information from her husband's office.The budget for this picture was $20M but it didn't even clear $1M at the Box Office. I'm not terribly surprised.STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C plus to B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; SOUND/MUSIC: B minus to B; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: December 2012 to January 2013 (streamed)."
1,The extent of denial this mental illness comes with is beyond comprehension. This series presents the cases well and treats the affected with respect. Hoarders is very well done.
1,"If the BBC produces it, I usually give it a chance.  This is a drama not a mystery but it is tense and absorbing.  It is based on true events but it in no way represents a ""boring"" documentary.  It did make me appreciate how far medicine and societal attitudes have advanced in a relatively short time period.  I watched all the episodes and was sorry the series ended."
0,"The film says, ""75% of people believe in the supernatural."" Do you know what that says about 75% of people? They're MORONS!What is the NUMBER ONE thing you NEVER see in ALL this ""ghost, these, and ghost that"" shows...HMMMM? Anybody?GHOSTS!"
1,"So many things going on in each episode, yet foyle figures it out. Plus we get valuable history lessons all along the way. This is another series where I'll really miss the characters when foyle finally retires. Thankfully we had a Cold War, too. Plus, we all get much-needed lessons in manners, from both foyle and his trusty driver. Wonderful example of what true media heroes should be portrayed as. Oh by the way-- very entertaining stories, too"
1,"Quentin Dupieux's RUBBER is many things: existential horror comedy, commentary on the filmmaker/audience relationship, obscure dream-like ode to non-sequiturs.  It's a rather straightforward story--tire malevolently comes to life, ignorantly (perhaps) kills everything in its path--framed by a Greek-like movie-watching chorus and a wise-cracking, fourth-wall-breaking sheriff (who encourages one of his deputies to shoot him to prove that nothing is real).  And, as you may expect, none of it really makes sense.The acting is solid, but ultimately inconsequential--which is perhaps the film's biggest flaw.  When your star is a mute piece of rubber, you need solid directing and interesting visuals to keep the audience's attention.  Initially, Dupieux delivers; the open scene is beautifully orchestrated, and there are other killer (pun intended) scenes as well.  But it doesn't really add up.  Which is largely Dupieux's point, of course; he's making a statement here.  The problem is, his message doesn't come across too clear.  RUBBER is worth a watch for fans of off-kilter comedy, or anyone interested in the philosophy of film-making, but it isn't a movie for everyone.  If the title of this review (quoted from that marvelous opening scene) appeals to the film aesthete in you, then this movie is definitely up your alley.  If it seems like nonsense...best look elsewhere."
1,Helen Mirren was especially good in this series.  She is elevated to the position of lead detective after the death of the former.  She is the first female to hold this position and is not accepted as competent to lead by the squad.  She proves them wrong after working the case and solving the murders.This is a show that women will love.  It proves that given a chance. they are as competent as the men and very devoted to getting the job done.The acting is especially good and the suspense builds throughout the episodes.
1,"What can I add about this very clever and hilarious TV series, which I just discovered even though it's in its sixth season, when there are already 441 reviews posted here? Probably not much but I'll try.Though the Complete First Season has been released before, a new ""Combo Pack"" is now out (as of July 10th) with both Blu-ray AND DVD versions plus the new Ultra Violet concept - all in one package. (So you will never be without a chance to watch these episodes again and again.). For those folks who complained that the only ""bonus"" in the original First Season set was the ""Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory"" featurette, you'll be happy to know that they added a gag reel this time. I'm not sure that is enough to replace your earlier set but it's a nice bonus for those - like me - just discovering it.There's no reason to go into the plot of the show - again, it's covered in other reviews - but I did notice that after the first for or five episodes (which at 22 minutes - no commercials - are like potato chips: you can't stop with just one) the characters changes in odd ways. Leonard seems less nerdy and Penny less overtly sexy (plus she must have lost her job at The Cheesecake Factory because by the fourth episode or so she is serving the ""guys"" at a local hamburger place in a non-TCCF uniform.The ONLY thing I found a bit of a downer - and I don't see it mentioned in other reviews - is that the series uses a ""laugh track"" which was very popular in the 1960s before TV comedies started being recorded in front of live audiences. It is really annoying because it sounds phony and you will hear the same laughter over and over, sometimes even before the punch line. It bothered me a lot during the first three episodes but I guess I got used to it a little as time went on. It's just too bad that they felt need to use these.So, I'm jumping on the bandwagon for this series and in the process of ""catching up"". If you've read this review before the others, I hope I've encouraged you to scroll down and read some more. Better yet, just sample an episode and , like me, I'm sure you will get hooked!I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic"""
1,"In a dramatic HD recording. What more could you ask for. Rome has it all for a men's audience sex/violence/blood/womenI would not recommend this for the quisy, but if you lik the mentioned above rent it"
1,"I look forward to Storage Wars each week as the colorful cast of characters go in search of hidden treasure among the abandoned storage lockers of the Los Vegas area. I need to suspend my critical judgement a bit for the fun of seeing the gang bicker and bid for what appear to be endless mounds of trash. Invariably someone comes up with a box of jewelry or a valuable antique, but it's best not to look too closely and just settle back and watch Brandi and Jarrod, Barry, the mysterious prankster, and Dave, the bully of the group. These are supposed to be real people, and they probably are, but it matters not because they entertain far more than most scripted comedy or ""unscripted reality shows"". Lots of fun, and no distasteful antics!"
1,"I loved the story of Amy Dorrit, the child of the Marshalsea Prison, which was where she was born and where, at the beginning of the novel she still lives with her aging father, The Father of the Marshalsea. The Marshalsea is a debtor's prison Dicken's father had resided in the Marshalsea after he fell on hard times and although Dickens did not reside in the Marshalsea, he did visit his family there on Sundays.If a man is thrown into prison due to his inability to pay his debts, how is he then to pay his debts while in prison? His children leave daily with their mother, if there is one, to work. Amy Dorrit leaves the prison daily under the admiring eyes of Joe, the gatekeeper and works for Mrs. Clennam, the paralyzed matriarch of a family business. There Amy meets Arthur Clennam a much older man who is visiting his mother and who has spent years abroad working with his father. Arthur has returned to London due to his father's death.Social justice and social class again define this Dicken's novel. Amy is a working girl while Arthur is merchant class; Mrs. Clennam sees herself as something more than merchant class, although the house she is trapped in which symbolizes herself and her facade, is falling down. Joe loves Amy and wants to marry her and keep her at the Marshalsea. Amy loves Arthur but Arthur won't admit that he loves Amy, he thinks he loves &#34;Pet&#34; and the plot, so cunningly devised, goes round and round.Great characters. Great settings. Fabulous film and I will watch it again."
1,"The story is still good, even In to the 3rd season. The characters are well developed and varied. It keeps you interested from start to finish, and still believable."
1,I wish real - life work could be this silly and we could make fun of ourselves and also say wild things and have crazy flashbacks and laugh at work. the cast works well together as if they actually were these characters. fey is brilliant and I love her woman-whose-got -it -all but totally doesn't character. she's a mess on the inside.
0,Just finished watching season 6 on DVD. (I live in Europe and it has been out a few weeks already) Dumbest ideas ever in 24. Fox should definetely fire the writers! There got to be more qualified people out there?Don`t buy it. Rather buy season 5 (which was great)
1,"This is another season of the great British mystery series of Foyle's War.The series is set in Great Britain during World War II and each successive season sees the progress through the war from the point of view of the Detective as he oversees the small constabulary of his town that covers the town and its surrounds.  He is a quiet and very effective detective who is constantly observant of his surroundings and great at deduction.  He refuses to be bullied or pushed around.  He knows what his job is and what is right and will not deviate from either.He can be thought of as a predecessor of the American police detective, Colombo."
1,I recently watched this with my wife who had started watching gold rush on season 2.  I had originally skipped it thinking it would be boring watching it again.  Boy was I wrong.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and seeing how the different miners of season 2 and beyond joined the crew.  It was great seeing Parker as a young quiet kid.  Totally worth the rewatch.
1,"This is a great show, the people on it make the show. They seem to be for real, without a bunch of acting. I love all the different things they can catch in the swamps of Louisiana its a good show for anyone. Its how life is in the swamps."
0,This could have been an interesting series if not for the turgid script and the banal soap operish love triangles.
1,"English humor can be a little hard to understand sometimes, but funny enough to keep me laughing & watching repeatedly until I began to get it"
1,"Liked this one from the first episode.  Interesting characters, good stories and familiar actors from other shows such as Downton Abbey, Whitechapel, Zen, Mr Selfridge, etc.  Looking forward to the other seasons."
1,"""What I wouldn't give to have tired of you.""  After a party makes her feel uneasy Joanna (Knightley) thinks that her husband Michael (Worthington) is cheating on her.  The next day he leaves on a business trip, with the women (Eva Mendes).  The same day Joanna runs into her past love and spends time with him.  Both are tempted to do what they shouldn't.  This is a movie that you have to let form.  The first half hour or so is a little slow, but then it really starts to take shape and the ending will leave you wanting more.  Being a man, this is not usually the type of movie that I enjoy, but I really did like this one.  I would call this a more subdued version of ""Closer"", much less overt sex and much more subtle love.  Much like ""Closer"" you are pulled back and forth between who you like and who you don't.  Who is right and who is wrong. Who you want to root for, and who you shouldn't.  Either way this is a very emotionally powerful movie that will leave you wishing there was more.  Overall, I surprisingly liked this movie a lot. This is a very emotional movie that will leave you thinking.  That's a good thing.  I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - I actually think I might."
1,5 year old granddaughter loves it on TV.  How great to be able to let her watch it on a portable device...my Kindle Fire.
1,"I enjoyed season two.  Shocking end, but very well done.  I used to think only here in the USA that we had gangs, illegal guns, terrorists and good old fashion poverty, but this series is set in Toronto and shows human nature at its most vulnerable and that these human condition exist everywhere to one degree or another.The characters are very likable.  You see just enough of their private lives to be interesting and engage your interest without overwhelming the show.  Enrico Colantoni, is a spectacular actor and never disappoints no matter the role.  I have seen him in Veronica Mars, Just Shoot Me, and most recently in Person of Interest.  He is able to adapt to a role and make it believable.  Hugh Dillon is wonderful and David Paetkau is just plain HOT!  Where's the fan?  :)This is a police procedural with all the trimmings and well worth watching."
1,"My daughter loves to watch this show. She started watching Umizoomi's at about 21 months. She loves watching this right up with Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, Backyardigans, Dora and Bubble Guppies..."
1,It's a dumb show but it does have some funny moments... I got it for the kids and they seemed to enjoy it.
1,"I am a huge fan of the show, and with it rumored to be ending next year after the eighth season, having the set on DVD is a plus. It is time for it to end as the last couple of seasons haven't had that &#34;feel&#34;, but I still enjoy it."
1,My grandson loves the Blues Clue song and Joe is in these episodes singing along  so he loves it even more
1,"It's not really my cup of tea, but my daughter loves the series.  She reads all of the books and watches all the episodes.  She generally has good taste in general so there must be something to this series.  I'll have to give it another try some day."
1,"I loved the humor of the stand-up comics featured here. I only got the free episode listed at the beginning of the season, but it probably gives a good idea of what is contained in the rest of the season. I have actually watched several episodes of this season when I was having a free 30-day trial membership in Amazon prime, which I eventually plan to become a paid subscriber to."
1,"The last season of Chuck is almost as fun to watch as the previous seasons. Almost because you know it's going to end. There are only 13 episodes, but there's a lot going on! I enjoyed it and can highly recommend the final season on CHUCK."
1,"This is by far the bst series of its type I have ever seen.  The characters are solid, you either love or hate them,  The actors are all superb in their roles.If this series has not won a bunch of awards then something is wrong."
1,"Being a fan of Betty White's, I'm happy that they brought my beloved Golden Girl to the show.  She makes an excellent, crazy, and horrifying witch lady.  I hope I've seen all the episodes now.  I recall a few months earlier when I was surfing TV late night when I saw Betty White in the description for this show.  I've been hooked on it ever since.  TBS re-aired the episode, so hopefully I'm now all caught up.  Too bad that the show was cancelled fairly early on.  I really did like the simple lessons that Earl gave.Honorable mention: I love Nescobar-A-Lop-Lop name.  It always puts a smile on my face.Earl is just as naive as ever in this episode.Joy is just as bitchy as ever.Darnel is just as ""nice"" as ever.Randy is just as simple as ever.Kenny is just as gay as ever.Catalina is just as cuckoo as ever.and ex-deputy Mike is just as lackadaisical as ever.I love the creativity of the writers - this show is hilarious with all the funny flashbacks.  Don't drink the tea!"
1,I watched ths once before and loved it so much I had to see it again.  Well worth the time spent! A very good production.
1,Hunky Werewolves and other scary creatures that scare the bejesus out of you. It's a must see if you like supernatural shows and lots of action.
1,"Love this show and love having the DVD's to watch anytime I wish. I am looking forward to purchasing seasons 7, 8 and 9 (when available) to complete my collection. We purchased seasons 1-6 for Christmas :-)"
1,"I am truly facinated by this TV show.  I have all 3 seasons and can now watch each one, uninterruped by commercials.  It's so amazing how they plan each caper."
1,The new Dr. is cool.  The depth of character development continues.  I am still addicted.  The ability to get in and out of trouble and needing each other makes this a good series.
1,I have enjoyed learning about the privileged in England and how their lives contrasted so much with the downstairs  where their servants lived and worked for very little reward.  The rigid rules of society dictated how both groups behaved and interacted with each other.
1,"Tina Fey is an intelligent (read: thinking) Lucille Ball. In her zany skits and amongst her madcap crew there can be a redeeming moral found - life lessons if you would. For instance how to handle homosexuals who all seem to believe that if you don't allow their advances that makes you a hater not so. I don't care what sort of perversion that you practice behind closed doors as long as your not practicing them on my children or putting in my face. Jane Krakowski plays a self-involved actress that epitomizes America today and of course Alec Baldwin represents everything wrong with capitalissssm.edit: For instance, how to handle unwanted advances from homosexuals. How to recognize situations where your child's innocence could be compromised by pack leaders, teachers and other people in authority."
1,"The group in question is the Travelers--a band of con artists who have apparently been in the U.S. since the 19th century.  This show offers a glimpse into their world, and how odd and sometimes difficult it is for them to try to live among the rest of us.  Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver do some pretty decent American accents as the husband and wife posing as the Riches.Complications ensue as they attempt to fill the deceased Riches' shoes, working, living, and going to school among the so-called Buffers (non Travelers).  Never a dull moment, as they say."
1,I had never heard of this program before but I must say that I enjoyed itimmensely.  This program is very well written and acted.
1,"This series features political corruption, detective frailty, including both professional and personal errors in judgment, and characters who are all both sympathetic and detestable.  It is beautifully acted, directed and written. In our house, we tend to watch series mysteries all at once, like reading a book; not week by week.  This one was to TV as a &#34;real page turner&#34; is to written mystery.  We could not stop watching and we were sad when it ended."
1,Really funny show. Nick kroll never disappoints :) I don't follow sports but this show is still hilarious . I recommend it
1,Watching this is like watching ER set in London in 1906. The production values are fabulous and the performances as you would expect -- great. Don't miss it.
1,"I am sorry to admit that I have only recently discovered this series, and that too by way of the remake, which is available via streaming as well. I was not sure what to expect with the original, but I had read glowing reviews of the show, and decided to give it a try (it didn't hurt that season one of this show was available free for download for Prime members, but alas, not the subsequent seasons).This show has an amazing cast, not to mention riveting plot lines. As a costume drama, it is pretty enough but due to the age of the show and the budget constraints back then, the production quality is not as great as contemporary period dramas such as seen on hit series Downton Abbey, the remake Upstairs, Downstairs and others. Some of the episodes in Season One are rendered in black and white instead of color due to a strike back then. This however did not spoil my enjoyment of the show.The series ran for five seasons from 1971 to 1975. The primary setting for the show is 165 Eaton Place, a roomy townhouse, and the time frame spans Edwardian England, the First World War up till 1930. The series explores the lives of the upper-class Bellamy's (upstairs) and their servants (downstairs), and some of the themes covered during the show is the difference between the upper and lower classes, societal changes, marital strife, relationship problems, and the plight of the poor, among others.The Bellamy's are made up of Richard Bellamy, MP (portrayed by David Langton) and his wife, Lady Marjorie Bellamy (played by Rachel Gurney), and the couple have two children, James (Simon Williams) who is serving in the military, and strong-willed Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).Meanwhile, the servants downstairs comprise competent and firm butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson); cook Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley); head house parlour maid Rose Buck (Jean Marsh, who returns in the remake and takes on the role of housekeeper); a footman, and a kitchen maid (and the occasional changes in secondary staff).I would advise those new to the show to begin by watching Season 1 first as there is much background to the characters and stories that can be better appreciated and understood if watching chronologically. Season Three is as intriguing as the previous two seasons though dark clouds hang over the Bellamy household. A terrible tragedy causes much strife and chaos in the Bellamy household. Son James falls in love with a woman not of his social class, and the staff downstairs are also experiencing problems of their own. Finances in the Bellamy household are tight this season and the residents of 165 Eaton Place are forced to economize, both upstairs and downstairs.This third season of the show sees a death in the family, a marriage, a murderer putting the lives of the residents of 165 Eaton in danger, and the possibility of romance! The writing as always is engaging, and the plot lines keep me riveted to the screen! I am hopelessly addicted to this show now, and the new remake truly can't compare to the writing and acting in the original!Forget the insipid shows that pass off as entertainment these days - I'll have a cuppa and watch these over any day!"
0,We found it difficult to get into - didn't seem to be building the characters in an easy way.  Also some of the accents were hard to decipher.  Probably just not our cup of tea.
1,Glades is an enjoyable watch because the actors play interesting characters and do it well. The surprising thing is that after watching 4 shows I now know how to fully predict each story. The writer's formula is overly simplistic and repetitive.  Humor saves most scenes and in the middle of a weak thread we get to like the main characters and actually care about them. There just needs to be a bit more intrigue and mystery than currently exists.  We'll see how the seasons develop.
1,"I don't know how they do it. Each season just keeps getting funnier and more twisted. I don't care how much time they take between seasons, it's worth it. Everyone on this show cracks me up and I have no idea how far each episode is going to go. This is one of the best comedies I've ever seen."
1,This season followed suit with all the others. It was awesome and there were so many cool artifacts!  Keep it up Syfy!
1,I love to watch Oswald especially when I'm trying to calm a rowdy bunch. Call able lessons are learned in a peaceful way and I love how the Grands look both ways and say bleep at each head turn like they do on the show.
1,"Already perched on the mountaintop of cinematic stories in the first two seasons, the third actually raises the level of excellence to new heights. Much of the characterization  the initial seasons developed so well actually becomes still more integral in this, the third season. I became more invested in the safety and sanity of what I have now begun to view as colleagues - their varying motivations, whether well-considered or foolish, with pride, joy, fear, or disapproval. WIth so many human issues being addressed and so many characters involved in simply dealing with the hardships of their trying life, I'm now feeling, as I watch, that I'm living it with them. At this point I find myself wishing the series will never end!"
0,"I don't know where to start because it was that uninteresting. Save yourself the trouble and watch something else, you'll be more entertained with anything but this show."
1,"Very entertaining. I like the historical value of it but a little to many sex scenes. Seems like the Romans had a little to much time on their hands. The scenes, sets, and costumes are all wonderfully depicted."
1,It seems like I watch only to see everyone get whats coming to them.  The only character I do not wish ill is babies!!
1,"From the moment this precient narrative begins, viewers are transported to another world, in the not too distant future. The whole ensemble cast, from Benedict Cumberbatch, to Anamaria Marinca and Robert Carlyle, make this dark futuristic tale by Peter Berry more believable. Cumberbatch is superb as Stephen Ezard, a research scientist just returning to London from China to attend his brother Michael's funeral. After all his years away, he is bewildered by an England he does not recognize; London has become a police-state. Unlike his late-brother, Stephen Ezard is a recluse who abhors germs and personal contact. Despite his walls, he's drawn to his brother's complex widow, Yasim (Anamaria Marinca delivers a finely nuanced tough/gentle performance), a medical doctor. They become embroiled in a swirl of conspiracies while he works on the government's super-database. Ezard's struggle to survive is a superb character study enriched by a marvelous performance by Cumberbatch. Robert Caryle is perfect as a menacing rogue government agent - quite convincing. Despite the subject matter, this isn't a political left/right film or story. As one outsider-character states, people have the right to be anonymous. ""The Last Enemy"" explores what happens when populations lose that privacy. A topical, haunting story, quite relevant to issues today, and also reminiscent of Ray Bradbury's masterpieceFahrenheit 451: A Novel."
1,I don't watch it personally but I hear the theme song every time my daughter has the kindle. That means a lot because she's very picky on her shows. I Love the songs. Once in a while I would glance in it and see cute characters. Its good for little kids. Cleaner than sponge Bob. I would totally recommend it to those that have little ones.
1,I was looking for a good series to watch and found this by accident. It is factually and brutally honest. The acting to superb.
1,"I don't want to go on at length about Justified. It's one of those things you either get or you don't. I come from a place not too different from Harlan County and it's a pleasure to spend an hour listening to people talk right and acting pretty much like people I know. Obviously the time and tempo are ramped up, but I dig these grits."
1,"I love all of the actresses and saw that Sean Hayes was a producer, so I figured I would like it. It was very fun and entertaining."
1,"Thankful for closed captioning.  Single-handed is a police procedural set in Ireland.  If not for closed captioning, I wouldn't have understood 2/3 of the dialogue.  The stories were serious and dark, and the language was quite foul at times.  However, the stories were well written and well acted.  Not for children."
1,"Excellent shows. While I wasn't sure I'd like Matt Smith as the Doctor, he really is quite funny. Excellent addition."
1,This was different than an average show. You will probably have a lot of it worked out before the main character because it shows you more. It is still worth watching.
1,"Battlestar Galactica was (and still is) the best of its genre ever aired.  All 4 seasons were fantastic, but season 3 was superior (outside of the series finale). Even if you're not a sci fi fan, if you haven't seen it you're missing out..."
1,"Someone in the comments section said this movie was a remake of 'Ch&#363;shingura'.  Huh?  Ch&#363;shingura is a 47 Ronin movie. This is clearly a 'Seven Samurai' type movie.But it - in an effort to bigger and better than the original - has almost twice as many samurai. And that's a problem.Movies follow certain conventions. For example almost all movies are about two hours long. There are no thee minute movies released as feature films in theaters and there are no 37 hour movies. Experience has shown that audiences will sit for an hour and a half or two hours. Less than that and they feel cheated. More than that and their backsides go numb.We also have a convention that the star's name goes above the title in the opening credits. Then we list the players for the major roles and finally the supporting players.A movie plot normally will have about five major parts. These are the characters who get enough screen time that the audience can remember who they are. There will often be a dozen minor characters whom we usually won't recognize at first or remember afterwards.This is obviously a problem with a movie like 'Seven Samurai' or it's American spinoff 'The Magnificent Seven'.  There are too many characters for a two hour (or three hour) movie. For example in 'The Magnificent Seven'. Brynner and McQueen are the stars. Wallach is the villain. So we really only have room for a couple more. Bucholtz is the young lover so he gets some screen time.  But the other of the seven are really only sketched in. There are just too many of them. It is a tribute to the director that we can remember any of them like Brad Dexter or James Coburn. They are each only on screen for only seconds.It is worse however when you move from seven samurai to thirteen. Much worse. There is still only room for about five real characters so most of the 13 assassins are just faceless troops.This is a mature samurai movie. The bad samurai movies - or &#34;chop 'em ups&#34; - have a lot of sword play from the beginning and usually some fantastic elements. These are junk cinema. But '13 Assassins' follows the other path. There is at first little action. The characters sit in paper walled rooms knelling in front of each other and bowing a lot. They discuss duty, obligations, honor and clan relationships. The plot is about how one of them is caught in an impossible dilemma. Then typically the aggrieved party explodes in violence in the final reel. I love these kind of movies.Most samurai films are from the period of the Tokogawa Shogunate. This one is at the very end just before the Meijii Restoration. The historical setting is well handled and contributes to the story. This story would not be the same in the early seventeenth century."
1,"The third season is super dramatic and even tragic. It is the time of resurrection and sacrifice.Annie is brought back to this world by John Mitchell from purgatory. She is back in the world she loves - as a ghost - and WITH the man she loves though she is rather limited along that line. But she assumes a power and an authority she should not even dream of, since she is a ghost. What right does she have to meddle with the affairs of the human world and what's more with the business of a vampire and the punishment he deserves for being a killer? If you don't want the man or the person you love to be a killer you better not love that person if he/she is a killer. But to reform a killer, especially a vampire, is like wanting the sun to rise in the west.What's more that Annie becomes the easy prey of another dead ghost, one of the victims of John Mitchell's in the Tunnel Box 20 massacre, a student in the real world when she was alive, who is absolutely exclusively leaning towards vengeance, trying to bend the world of the living towards her own ends and predicting that Mitchell will be killed by a werewolf, though she knows she has no foreseeing power. How could she since she was not even able to avoid taking the train that was going to lead to her death. Once a seer forever a seer but if you are not a seer from the very start you will never be a seer ever ever.George, the werewolf, and his enamoured Nina, find their life very complicated when Nina discovers she is pregnant with a monster that was impregnated into her on a full moon episode, and when in their adventures they get to know and help two other werewolves who are hunted by vampires and particularly the band of Herrick's aficionados - a Herrick who is officially dead, killed by George by dismembering, which is not kosher for a vampire - because the two werewolves killed quite a few of these vampires, well more than a few, quite a lot indeed. But we will find out that Herrick is a bloody torturer, organizing dog fights between human beings and werewolves on full moon nights. That way a certain McNair wins but is scratched by the werewolf he kills and becomes a werewolf himself. That's life of course: one cannot win on all sides at the same time. There is always a flaw in the beautiful picture of a victory. But this McNair is important because of the ""son"" he brings into the picture, a young man who was made a werewolf some time in Scotland and this Tom McNair is a very effective vampire killer especially when Herrick kills his ""father"".That's one of the twists of this third season: Herrick who was not properly killed with a stake in his heart, but dismembered by George comes back full and healthy though without his memory. But he will recapture that one and then will become an avenging vampire, but he will fail getting a fight between George and Mitchell, thanks to Tom McNair and then John Mitchell will have to do what was not done properly before: never entrust to anyone what you can and should do yourself, because that's cowardice and totally misguided because your substitute will never do things properly, that is to say the way you would like them to be done.But all that is brought up by the insistence on the side of a female inspector or someone/something in a police uniform to arrest John Mitchell for the Tunnel Box 20 massacre. She will succeed as for that but then a real massacre will ensue because that will trigger Herrick's recovery of his memory.The last point here is that the series tried to widen the scope and bring the Old Ones into the picture, the vampires who are more than one thousand years old. They want to recuperate John Mitchell as something like their killing Cerberus and the confrontation is dramatic. John Mitchell wants George to kill him. The representative of the Old Ones wants to recuperate John Mitchell. George does not want to kill John Mitchell but he cannot let him become a killing machine in the hands and at the tips of the fangs of a bunch of old cronies who want to declare the age of the vampire finally reached and the authority of vampires over the whole world finally achieved.But George Sands loves John Mitchell and he cannot eternally hide his head in the sand of some desert: his dilemma is between loving and killing, not killing because loving and killing because loving. Can one kill someone because they love them? That's the dramatic last scene or nearly of the third season. Will John Mitchell crumble into ashes or not? But this love scene between two ""men"" is absolutely marvellous in intensity and yet modesty: two men can love each other that intensively and yet keep that love where it belongs first of all and above all, in their soul, in their mind, in their mental spiritual force and power.If he does kill John Mitchell the future of the series is bleak and will require a miracle to undo what love has brought up. If he does not all morality and ethics are out of this perverse series that becomes the melting pot of all crimes in the name of love.You choose your favourite solution and you enjoy that suspense.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
1,Great show loved it since day one. It's like mission impossible and the Italian job had a wild child and this is it but in a good way. The cast gels well together and I love how the cast feeds off each other the missions are good.
1,"Hi All,Warehouse 13 is due to be canceled after 12 or so episodes, which is hard to believe as it is one of the best shows on TV. There is nothing on TV like it and with a great cast as well.Joe"
1,This is a great series.  The acting is superb!  The plot develops at a great pace w/o holes or overlaps.
1,The characters were believable and drew me into each quest they set forth in doing. I wanted to watch more just to see how they were going to end. At the end of each episode there seemed to have a surprise...and I could not wait to see what was next.
1,"The creators of this show really struck gold with a winning formula. It's a fine, strong ensemble cast. Hutton is very effective in the lead as the somewhat flawed, highly eccentric ""mastermind."" Aldis Hodge as Alec is always edgy and frequently hilarious. Beth Riesgraf as Parker brings equal amounts of sheer gorgeousness and sheer CRAZY to the role, but she is never ""over the top."" Put everyone together and you get a sense of balance where each cast member nicely complements and contrasts with the others, a true rarity in shows of this mind.The basic concept is also stronger than many of the ""expanded basic cable"" shows. Case in point, the Rob Morrow / Judd Hirsch vehicle ""Numbers,"" in which every single episode offers up an unsolvable, baffling crime which can only be solved when Morrow's idiot savant brother steps in and wraps everything up in a tidy little bow by concocting a mathematical formula. Movie of the week, amusing. Weekly TV show, tedious and predictable.The labels are accurate...""Robin Hood Meets Mission Impossible""...and yet, episode after episode the creators manage to come up with an entertaining premise and the cast pulls off with charm to spare.Read Amazon's description, read the reviews....if any of it sounds the least bit appealing to you, take a chance and order this set. You won;t be disappointed."
1,"It's Nova, it's been around forever, because it's the grand daddy of all the science shows around now. What's not to like?"
1,"I really hate sponsor product placement in movies. The ""Degree"" body deodorant is all over the episode, I get it okay, you want me to buy some deodorant, I already do, but it just looks stupid when I am supposed to imagine that this is a real ""GD"" ""Eureka"" secret genius town, and then you remind me with your Walmart Deodorant advertising, its stupid and annoying. Why cant they just have a list of sponsors at the end of the episode for someone who actually gives damn?"
1,"Five stars for the original footage, which is spectacular. The narrator, who voiced Hal the Computer in 2001 , A Space Odyssey, sounds like a wartime newsreel commentator, which is fitting, I suppose, given the material. The script, however, is only informative if one has never heard of Operation Barbarossa or knows nothing about the Russian Front. Additionally the prose is really purple, since the writer seems to think it enhances the dramatic content to repeat words. Eg: It was a drive that was relentless. Relentless. RELENTLESS. But the worst part of it was the dissonant score- imagine Nora the piano playing cat, only without the cute fluffiness. At the end of both volumes the endless pinging of the piano keys was relentless, Relentless, RELENTLESS.  Recommended with the sound off."
1,"Great show, script,  acting,  etc.  What a shame that it was dropped!  I have never understood why really high quality shows get cancelled and so many ""moronic"" shows make it season after season!  Does TV programming always have to appeal to the lowest common denominator?"
1,"Love Eddie Izzard, good to see him straight acting, proves he can do it. Minnie Driver is great also.& supporting cast."
0,If your into history you'll love this!!! ***** for all seasons!! It's a must see. Not for younger children!!! I love to see how people lived in the 1700's.
1,"&#34;It's okay&#34; pretty much says it all, but to be fair, we got so spoiled by watching Justified (all five series on Prime), that nothing is measuring up.  This gets better with each episode; I guess the conceited detective kind of grows on you."
1,"i love the lead detectives personality. He is quirky and makes you think he is not really aware of what is going but in reality, he is on top of all of it. i enjoyed watching this limited series and look forward to more."
1,"I thought this was going to be one of the worst seasons, because their pick of chefs this year was seemingly desperate. I don't know how they search for and select the cast, but it appeared to have been at some sort of shelter. But it has been very entertaining and the chefs are doing better than I had anticipated."
1,"I like the show due to the fact that I like to look at old items and, at time, work to restore them.  I don't do it for money, I do it on account I like to see it through.I also like how the group works well together, and often jokes with one another."
1,I watched the original Battlestar Galactica with Loren Green years ago but this one is so much better. Good si-fi  and a great cast of characters and story lines to keep the series interesting. I was hooked after season one and looking forward to season three.
1,Little ones love anything to do with the Bubble Guppies. She knows all their names and Bubble Puppy too.  Hope there are more soon.
1,"My kids found this series while on a trip to Reno.  They loved it and after watching it quickly converted me to loving it also, it ranks right up with the other who done its, only this is taking down the bad guys who hurt the good guys.  Which I like better."
1,"Saw it on cable, got rid of cable and started streaming.  Exactly the same and it is one of my kids' favorites."
1,Amy Poehler  shines in this series about the small town ups and downs in the department of Parks and Gardens.Quirky characters add to the fun in the series.Will watch more seasons. Relaxing and fun!
1,Spooky true ghost stories told by people like me and you.shows state town house everything and has some pretty impressive spooky footage and evidence to back it up.makes me very glad I don't rent or plan on moving ...ever!!
1,"After what I felt was a lackluster second season, this short season's returns to the action that made the first season amazing.  The stakes are a little high in some of the episodes (I wont spoil things, but I'm sometimes amazed that they dont mobilize The Army instead of The Unit when faced with the trials and tribulations they do), but the interaction with the wives and families is a lot more complementary than a separate drama.The only thing missing?  The theme from seasons 1 and 2!  I like the new song by Robert Duncan, but I thought the ""Fired Up"" cadence from the first two seasons was a rare case of a flawless theme song.  But I'll forgive it."
1,"There will always be great TV shows that get cancelled before their time. But the cancellation of Life was especially painful. The first season, like many other series, suffered from the writers strike, and only 11 of 22 episodes were made. This didn't stop the creators from producing a quality product, but the reduction in episodes made the tail end of that season feel rushed. The second season has 21 episodes, and they make the most of them.Life succeeds where many shows fail in that the show is able to focus on the main characters lives while still delivering interesting storylines that play off said characters quirks. Some shows feature characters with great chemistry, but the creators seem to think that chemistry is enough to hold a show together. Storylines will often take a back seat to the minutia of the lead characters, and hurt the show.In Life the characters personal problems are intergrated into the storyline making them feel organic, and much more enjoyable to watch. The cases they go on are never normal, but they never cross over into being wacky. The criminals are never your cookie cutter bad guys, but instead individuals with their own unique motivations that make them far more dangerous, and alot more fun to watch.Damian Lewis gives an incredible performance giving his character a wide array of emotions that never feel forced. Sarah Shahi is wonderfully grounded when standing next to Lewis and acts as a friend and not just the straight man that has become standard fare, though she does that very well. The new captain, played to great effect by Donal Logue,  complements the cast perfectly and never feels lile his character was forced on us. When Sarah was with child, Gabrielle Union stepped in and delivered a performance that did not try to copy Sarah's, but made the character her own.This is a phenomenal show that was cancelled long before it's time, and you will be doing yourself a disservice if you do not see it."
0,"Seeing as SpongeBob SquarePants has still remained so overwhelmingly popular after all of these years, I know I may receive a few negative votes from customers for my negative critique. But, before you press that unhelpful voting button (which, please, don't do until you have read my entire review) I just want to let you know that I am not criticizing the whole series. At the beginning of its lengthy run, it was so phenomenally hysterical and witty that episodes were bound to generate at least a few chuckles from you, and the very best ones would leave you wishing that you had thought of some of the jokes featured in the episodes. Sadly, that spectacular quality has declined.In more recent years, the program has underwent a deterioration in quality (I sincerely apologize to the makers of SpongeBob SquarePants). The negative qualities of a majority of the main characters have been enhanced (stupidity, greed) as pointed out by many other people, and the episodes and specials have a ""rushed"" feel to them. They defy the boundaries and limits set by the older seasons (which, albeit they may not bother many other people, enhanced the comedy of the program and became traditional jokes for the series) and the humor has grown more grotesque and stupid. The characters are all now more annoying in an attempt to make them appear funny, and I know lots of people have noticed the same changes and also can agree that the cartoon has lost a lot of its heart. If you want to watch SpongeBob SquarePants episodes, watch the earliest seasons if you want to be truly entertained. I genuinely apologize to anyone who may have been offended, but it's just the way I feel. I'm very sorry and hope I did not insult anyone."
1,"GREAT STORY LINE, BUT NOT FOR KIDS.  PRETTY VIOLENT BUT ACCURATE.  MUCH BETTER FARE THAN REGULAR TV.  NO COMMERCIALS SO YOU CAN FOLLOW THE PLOT BETTER."
1,the entire series from the first season through the final fifth season is a marvelous creation of imagination. I love the characters and a course the city with all it's amazing technology listening leo's be under comprehension in some cases shouldn't even be in a position. The monsters better created each week or dangers of the universe springs both in outer space in technology lovers races that they came in contact with. The rating the central 1. I enjoyed the up organic feel the race very similar to the movie series alien having that to organic look to the interiors of the ship and there insect always of preserving food and consuming the life force of human being
1,"There are 5 double-length episodes here that increase the episode count from 14 to 19.  And at 19, that is just 3 episodes short fo a current full season.What does puzzle me is the varying lengths of the half hour episodes, some are as short as 20 minutes & 30 seconds; others clock in at 21 minutes & 40 seconds.  Are some cut?If you get the 5-disc version some retailers are selling for the same price, then it is worth picking up!  Disc 5 has a Q & A session from the Scranton  ""The Office"" convention."
1,This is a charming story with wonderful characters and the delictdful Dorcas is beautifully done. I can't wait tk see where the story takes me in each episode. I hope BBC will continue thF story.
1,"We love this show.  The characters are fascinating whether you love them or hate them, and sometimes that line gets blurred because they are so doggone interesting and funny.  Best TV since the great seasons of &#34;24&#34;, and frankly more believable.  Beware, though ... you might start funnin' around and picking up their mountain holler accents.  LOL"
1,"A well written and narrated overview of the ground war.  This is directed towards an audience in search of an easy to watch, somewhat educational video.  It won't get you through West Point, or even to West Point but it will help you get a grasp of the basics."
1,"This is a quirky, fun show to watch.  Would just love a smart house.  Each episode they seem to come up with some interesting future device.  I look forward to what is next."
1,For anyone with grown kids you will see the humor in this show.  I enjoy watching poor Lionel having to deal with three women in one house.  Lionel does not have it in his nature to discuss certain topics and the women in the house sometimes enjoy putting him on the spot.  This show can be humorous.  Enjoy it.  I plan on watching it all again.
1,I have been following this show ever since it came available on TV.I enjoy every episode as well as Seasons and look forward to this tv show as it becomes available.
1,"At first I thought it was going to be a corny love comedy but as the movie continued, it kept me interested. The cast is great. Every one is going through something and money plays a big factor for some. There is drama, comedy, and love. The story between mother and son is beautiful and though her mother was not the best mother, her son has a huge heart for integrity and loyalty. Truly enjoyed it."
1,"This is a really nice film with a good storyline that is set in the 1860's as the Qing Dynasty struggles with forces from the outside and from within. The cast of actors are solid, and my only real quibble is with what happened to Lady Zhao, but I feel that all of the characters, including her, developed nicely along with the story."
0,"After watching it for 15 minutes with my wife, I turned it off.  It was just too confusing of a plot and I have heard enough of the new morality philosophy.  ugh!!!"
1,"I liked all the seasons of 24 because of the fast moving action, never bored, always something happening. I would recommend it to anyone who like action movies."
1,"This is a very good second season. Granted they are not in Prison anymore. They broke out and are on the run with other prisoners. Added new people to the mix and they fit in well. This show has a lot of good action, drama and story.Has a lot of intense scences as well as surprises. The bond between the brothers is done well. The man that steals the Show is Agent Kellerman. A very good series to own."
1,Smart and free of junk.... really enjoy the solving of problems. A must see for those who love mysteries. Watch it.
0,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!This is NOT the episode.It is the under 2 minute ""prequel"" that is available FREE at the BBC America website.Someone at Amazon is either incompetent (at best) or greedy (at worst).I OFFICIALLY ****PROTEST**** BEING CHARGED FOR THIS."
1,"Acting was good in this series. The story line was interesting, but for the first couple of shows was not done that well. By the third show, it was beginning to be more realistic with better concepts and dialogue, and really began to bring the peoples' personalities and issues into the script. This made it 100% better."
1,"Steve is a genius with children -- he really knows how to elicit their feedback and engagement with the story, and it never feels like he is above his audience.  And it is not too jarring or obnoxious like some children's shows can be."
1,Clean and fun Sci-fi. Not as dark and mature as Stargate Universe. Most of this felt like a clear good vs evil. Excellent effects budget and decent acting for a TV Sci-Fi. This was probably the best season for this series.
1,"OVERVIEW:  The comedy series ""Archer,"" created by Adam Reed, was first announced on FX in the fall of 2009.  Reed credits the inspiration for the show to a personal experience in which he was unable to muster up the charisma to hit on a beautiful woman; he later fantasized about a suave, debonair spy who would always have the right moves.  I have absolutely fallen in love with ""Archer;"" I can't get enough of the continuous wit and exceptionally clever dialog.  Unlike other animated shows, ""Archer"" utilizes complex plotting as well as character development, allowing viewers to watch and rewatch episodes without sacrificing entertainment value.  I am personally humbled by the various cultural references employed by the writers--it just goes to show how involved intellect must be in creating comedy.  I fully understand that much of the show's content may be deemed offensive to some viewers, so to enjoy it, it's best to keep in mind that ""Archer"" is written in a satirical manner.  It is fair to warn, however, that the series earns its TV/MA rating quite well through use of crude language, violence, and sexual situations; basically, it's probably not suitable for children or anyone who isn't a fan of that sort of comedy.The storyline centers around Sterling Archer (H. Jon Benjamin) who is the sort of spy Reed had imagined, only with a few extra character `flaws'--he is pretty much a sociopath.  Despite bearing the codename Duchess, Archer is considered the world's most dangerous spy; were he not absorbed with promiscuity, alcoholism, expensive toys and tactlenecks, he might also be considered the world's best spy.  Archer works for his self-centered and emotionally distant mother, Malory Archer (Jessica Walter), at the International Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS) based in New York City.  Fellow ISIS employees include agent Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler), comptroller Cyril Figgis (Chris Parnell), agent Ray Gillette (Adam Reed), HR Director Pam Poovey (Amber Nash), Head of Applied Research Dr. Algernop Krieger (Lucky Yates), ISIS whipping-boy Brett Buckley (Neal Holman), and nut-job secretary Cheryl Tunt (Judy Greer).  Other recurring cast-members include:  ODIN agent Barry Dylan (Dave Willis) and Archer's valet, Woodhouse (George Coe; Roy McCrery in flashbacks).Season 1 Guest Stars:  mole agent Crenshaw aka Kremenski (Shelly Desai), Cuban agent Charles (Thomas Lennon), Cuban agent Rudy (R. Ben Garant), UN Intelligence Committee Chairman Torvald Utne (Jeffrey Tambor), head of ODIN Len Trexler (Jeffrey Tambor), freelance assassin Elke Hubsch aka ""The Needle"" (Audrey Wasilewski), former Cuban spy Ramon Limon (Ron Perlman), German freelance assassin Mannfred (Ren&eacute; Auberjonois), German freelance assassin Uta (Kat Cressida), and double agent Conway Stern (Coby Bell).ARCHER:  THE COMPLETE SEASON ONE--premiered on January 14, 2010 with the episode ""Training Day.""  The first season focuses on introducing the main characters and their manners of interaction.  The various plots also set in motion a few themes that carry into later seasons; just a few examples:  Who is Archer's father?  Will Lana and Archer get back together?  What will come of the rivalry between Barry and Archer?  Why does Woodhouse take such abuse?SPECIAL FEATURES:  [10 Episodes/2 Discs]  The Original Unaired ""Archer"" Pilot*, Deleted Scenes, Unaired Network Promo, The ""League"" Pilot Episode, ""Louie"" Pilot Episode, and The Making of ""Archer"":  3D Animation, Art Direction, Backgrounds, and Storyboards.EPISODES:Episode 1*:  ""Mole Hunt""--(unaired pilot)  The season opens on a simulation exercise where Sterling Archer is being interrogated by fellow agent Crenshaw.  We learn Archer's codename, Duchess, is actually an homage to Malory's beloved and deceased Afghan Hound.  When Archer is pressed to settle his ISIS expense account, he fabricates a mole hunt in hopes that fear-mongering will convince Pam to grant him mainframe access.  Once he realizes none of his coworkers are going to help him get into the mainframe, Archer employs his super-spy techniques to break in.  During his after-hours ISIS infiltration, Archer accidentally discovers a real mole, Crenshaw/Kremenski, misappropriating funds for his escape back to Russia.  Now that the fabricated mole, coincidentally, turns out to be real, Archer must use his powers of `classic misdirection' to save ISIS (and settle his expense account).Episode 2:  ""Training Day""--A drunken Sterling accidentally foils the plans of an IRA suicide bomber, thus saving the `bacon' of an English diplomat (who Archer refers to as Santa Claus).  Lana, to the dismay of Cyril and Malory, appears a little gaga over Archer's knack for heroism.  In order to keep Lana's attention on Cyril, Malory intervenes and orders Archer to train Cyril as an agent; Archer takes it upon himself to prepare Cyril for failure, prostitutes, and other smut.Episode 3:  ""Diversity Hire""--Due to some recent `vacancies,' ISIS is low on minority agents.  Malory hires Conway Stern, a `double whammy,' to fill the diversity quota as is mandatory for tax deduction status.  Lana, for fear that her continuing tenure as top agent may be threatened, questions Conway's legitimacy as an ISIS agent; Archer focuses on intercepting the possibility that his mother and Conway might engage in a sexual relationship.Episode 4:  ""Killing Utne""--In order to swindle a lucrative contract, Malory plans a dinner party to seduce Torvald Utne, the chairman of the UN Intelligence Committee.  Even though Sterling is forbidden to bring a date, he runs into Elke Hubsch on the street.  Elke, aka ""The Needle,"" gives Archer the impression that she is `for hire,' but she is actually an undercover assassin tasked with killing Utne.  Meanwhile, Malory has hired Mannfred and Uta (German freelance assassins) to pose as wait-staff; she actually arranges for the fair to pretend to assassinate Utne so that her ISIS agents can foil the plot and save Utne's life, and thereby secure the UN contract.Episode 5:  ""Honeypot""--Ramon Limon, a Cuban spy, obtains a sex tape that stars Nikolai Jakov, head of the KGB, and Malory Archer, head of ISIS.  If the video is leaked, Malory can be charged with treason, which is possibly a ploy by Nikolai to force Malory to defect to Russia.  In order to retrieve the video, Malory gives Ramon her South Beach condo.  Archer is then dispatched to carry out the `honeypot,' which involves Archer attempting to seduce Ramon.  In the meantime, Woodhouse regales undercover Cuban agents, Charles and Rudy, with romantic war stories from his past.Episode 6:  ""Skorpio""--Lana takes a job recovering stolen missiles from notorious arms dealer Skorpio; the bounty will allow her to remodel her kitchen and the cruise of the French Riviera, aboard Skorpio's super-yacht, will given her a much-needed vacation from clingy boyfriend, Cyril.  Malory tags along for a `conference' that is actually her own romantic cruise aboard a boat with Nikolai Jakov.  Back at ISIS, the crew torments Cyril with thoughts of what Lana is ACTUALLY doing.  When Lana's mission goes south, Archer is dispatched to rescue her.Episode 7:  ""Skytanic""--The new rigid airship, Excelsior, receives a bomb threat which targets its maiden voyage.  ISIS is contacted to place agents Lana Kane and Sterling Archer aboard in hopes that they can thwart the terror plot.  Malory, jealous that her neighbor Trudy Beakman will on board for Excelsior's premier voyage, uses her connections to con a VIP cabin, thus bumping Trudy from the trip's roster.  Fearing what may come of Lana and Archer sharing a cabin, Cyril sneaks onboard along with Pam and Cheryl; Cheryl continues to blackmail Cyril into sleeping with her.Episode 8:  ""The Rock""--In hopes of gaining a security contract, Lana and Archer infiltrate San Mariano's palace, exposing any flaws in the security system.  Despite their work, the long-term contract is awarded to rival agency ODIN, headed by Len Trexler.  Cyril reveals to Pam and Cheryl that he has bought a ring and plans to propose to Lana; he is humiliated when the girls laugh at the tiny ring, spurring all ISIS employees to reflect on their meager salaries.  The `drones' form a union and go on strike; Lana, Archer, and Malory are considered `management' because of their more significant incomes.  Because of the strike, Lana and Archer must attempt a mission designed to reap revenge on ODIN and San Mariano without the aid of agency intell and satellite support.Episode 9:  ""Job Offer""--Lana becomes frustrated when Archer fumbles during the pursuit of Kasparov.  After ODIN swoops in and takes credit for the capture, Barry Dylan (Archer's nemesis) offers Lana a position at ODIN.  Cyril fears Lana may leave him for Barry, so he follows her to Paris for the interview.  When Malory fires Sterling, he seeks employment with ODIN as well; Malory retaliates against her son by blacklisting him.  Archer further antagonizes Barry by sleeping with his fianc&eacute;, Franois, in his new office.  Once ODIN receives the burn notice on Archer, Barry happily accepts the opportunity to assassinate him; Lana has to choose between Archer and her new job.Episode 10:  ""Dial M for Mother""--Now that Cyril's secret has been exposed, ISIS puts a ban on interoffice relationships.  Lana seeks revenge on the cheating Cyril by sleeping with everyone in the office.  Malory's secret about Sterling's paternity comes into question as well, and the top candidates seem to be Nikolai Jakov of the KGB, Len Trexler of ODIN, and Buddy Rich.  Upset that he may not be Archer's father after all, Nikolai arranges for Mannfred and Uta to capture Sterling and implant a mind-control chip in his brain; Nikolai intends to use the chip to force Archer into killing his mother."
1,"Luther is a gritty English police procedural.  Idris Elba is magnetic as the detective Luther.  He's brilliant, edgy, mercurial and has a background in psychology which allows him to outthink the bad guys.  Some times he figures them out too late.  He breaks the rules when it suits him, and is always just about to get fired, it seems, but he's so good his boss wants to keep him around.While I didn't mind some of the violence in the beginning, it began to intensify.  I had to turn one episode off when a character got their tongue cut off and they showed the severed tongue and the character's bloody face.  Geez.  If that kind of ""grit"" bothers you, you may have to pick and choose on the episodes.  But the show is worth it.Luther has a kind of cat and mouse relationship with one villain whom he can't convict for the crime.  They almost become friends which adds to the fun of the series.  If you like edgy, somewhat dark, police procedurals with a magnetic main character, you may want to sample this series."
1,"Tough, unvarnished, complicated, and that's just the Cops when they're NOT at work! This is an awesome show and how a Cop show should be done--like The Shield--complicated people doing an unbeliveable job that most of us wouldn't do, getting shot at and crapped on emotionally by the public . The best character by far is Michael Cudlitz (""Bull"" from Band of Brothers)the street Cop who has seen too much, done too much, has no life apart from his job and is spiraling out of control in his personal life. This guy has nailed every role he's had since 'BoB', he is great in my opinion. Regina King is also wonderful as the tough detective with a 'do nothing' partner played by Tom Everet Scott. The stories are really well done and I immediately bought season II half way thru watching this. If you are a fan of The Wire, Law & Order, you will love this show I guarantee it."
1,More excellent lawman shoot 'em ups in Season 2.  We love this series....for anyone who loves modern cowboys who are smart and dead-on shots...this is for you.
1,Again I really Love this show and the people are great the story keeps you wanting for more each week...
1,"This is like the lesser red haired brother no one talked about of Fringe. Acting was good except for a couple people who seemed emotionally detached. I know that people handle grief differently, but if I was told my family was murdered I think I would have done more than sit there quietly with a smile on my face. You might get that she didn't like her parents, well you would be wrong, she loved them. So you might see why I said the acting was good except in a couple areas. Its not a terrible show, but its not a great show either."
1,"This show is fairly uneven, season 1 though, for the most part I loved it.Young kid, gets detoured from his life at Harvard;  Seems he's a &#34;once he reads it, he doesn't forget it, and oh by the way, he understands it all....&#34;.Meets lawyer with a bit of a weak moral compass, who has to hire a pleb lawyer into the firm in order to become a senior partner and by hook or by crook hires the young kid.  (Even though he hasn't graduated from any law school)Everyone in the series has their part to play, they play it well, and the character interations are priceless.The in-house villain of the piece &#34;Louis Litt&#34;  (Get Litt) gets funnier and actually more likeable as the show progresses.And they don't necessarily take the obvious / easy way out plotwise.Each week, plot is pretty stand alone, but each season generally has an underlying arch of some sort that you can follow along with as well.A lot of depth of characterization, decent plots, highly recommended (this season anyway)"
1,"This ended up being a few hours well spent, and I hope more people get the chance to share this film with someone. This was not released locally, or anywhere really with that 20 screens over a month thing, but it did make the release posters and the buzz has been great.The story follows the lives of two families over twelve years, edited non-lineally so we see the consequences of their actions early that then shapes what becomes of their shared tragedy. Outstanding performances by everyone (nice break-out showing by Jennifer Lawrence), a beautiful score, elegant filming, powerful landscapes and some great editing all make for a worthwhile time investment. The Blu quality is reference material from beginning to end, from the ocean scenes to the burning desert trailer set made popular in all of the ads and artwork. Line definition gets tested immediately with that opening bedroom scene: Theron against the outdoor lighting - nothing left to the imagination anymore. The DTS was mixed eloquently, especially the airplane dusting scenes and even the brief explosion sequence. Even if I were to rate this film less than five, the main supplement is a near-perfect documentary about film making itself and it would still give this the highest rating.* Making of, 43:27 minutes. A lodef director-narrated piece that covers every facet of what it took to make this film. He did this in a unique way through job descriptions and casting choices instead of the drier logistics. He describes and shows some of the jobs you never hear about and the trust he had in this group. Highly recommend giving this a try as it is even edited in such a way that it keeps interest.* Music, 15:33 minutes. Was the only thing they left out of the main documentary, they cover it adequately here - a solid score but it does cater to the music fans only.* HDNet promo, 4:46 minutes. The standard ad plug that once you watch the movie, you realize how little this actually represents the quality of the story.* BDLive, nothing there.The sound is a 5.1 DTS, with English and Spanish subs. No region coding shown. Wonderful product that I feel is worth the time. Enjoy."
1,"Stargate went ten seasons, this alone should tell you how good the show was. The military man, the alien warrior, the nerd and the sexy scientist. Get it them all and you will have entertainment for some time to come."
1,"This film was a minor letdown after reading all the five star reviews.  There's nothing intrinsically wrong with the film.  My theory is that after years of being out of circulation it's reputation exceeds it's actual artistic worth.  Everything here is aces, though.  Good direction, atmosphere and writing.  The acting is superb with the stolid Robert Mitchum leading the cast.  I particularly liked Steven Keats' gundealer and Richard Jordan's duplicitous fed.  I think we've been spoiled by the high quality of films in this genre with Sidney Lumet's ""Prince of the City"" and Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed"".  Recommended without reservation but not as enthusiastically as some."
1,"""Psych"" is a hilarious show, and the second season improves upon the wonderful formula established in its first effort. Once again, this show is all about character, and the chemistry that exists between series stars Shawn and Gus is second to none, on any network or any show. It's a delight to watch these lifelong friends engage in their wildly inappropriate adventures as they attempt to solve mysteries that they really have no business getting involved in (not to mention the hilarious flashbacks to their childhood). Lassiter, O'Hara, and ""Dad"" all continue to shine, rounding out the wonderful cast of characters who each complement the show perfectly. Though every episode of these season is fun to watch, a couple of standouts for me were ""Gus' Dad May Have Killed an Old Guy"" and ""65 Million Years Off"" (in which Shawn accuses a T-Rex of murder!)."
1,I love this series. The episodes just keep getting better and the consistency is wonderful. The cast is great and I just love the series.
1,"Don't get me wrong, Bones continues to be a family favorite at our house, but the new plotline about the therapist for Brennan and Boothe just doesn't quite work, and some of the momentum seems to have died with the writers strike this year, now that the show s going again, it doesn't sound like we are going to get a full season out of any show, but at my house we are hoping that our favorites like Bones are exceptions to that.When you have a favorite like Bones, and you want the DVD set, you want a whole season! If that doesn't happen I guess I will download all of these episodes, since they can be stored in the Amazon digital locker, to avoid crowding my Tivo."
1,Wish I had watched this show when it began back in 2001.  Very happy that it is available from Amazon to stream.  I've watched 5 seasons in 3 weeks!  Will keep you on the edge of your seat (if you suspend reality a little bit).  Highly recommend!
1,I enjoyed all 4 seasons of BSG. I think this season finished off the series in a way that wrapped up most of the story lines just right
1,Season 2 picks up where season 1 left off. The usual suspects and gang are all back again with their perspectives and takes on a multitude of history's and antiquities best unanswered or unexplained events locations and stories.
1,This also is only one season but it's a very delightful series. The humor was funny. You should see it.
1,"Michael Fassbender really gets his (perfect) teeth into this role as a centurion caught in a battle with the Pictish inhabitants in the far north of what was the Roman Empire in 117AD. The real stars of the show are the Scottish countryside and what I believe to be the woods around Buckinghamshire, not far from London. You can die of hypothermia just looking at some of the shots of the Highlands. This is a gore fest of the first magnitude, like Warlords with Jet Li in terms of sheer splatter of blood and brains. Dominic West has a short but telling role in the movie and David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham are first rate. Talked about scarred old soldiers.  Great. JJ Feild does not get to do much, but what he does is important.  The female tracker Etain looks like a young Catherine Zeta-Jones, especially with the woad on.  It is not historically accurate and their Scots Gaelic dialect needs work, plus that is not likely to be what the Picts would have spoken; we have very few records of their language. But for a rolicking adventure with excellent music, scenery and a life and death struggle, there are many worse ways to spend a couple of hours. The ending had a few twists, and left me hoping for a sequel."
1,"This is a great syfy show you could not ask for anything more in one show. Action, creatures and unexplained powers."
1,Very well put together drama.  The characters were perfect for the stories being told.  Some of them were new faces who I will look for on other movies and TV shows.  Sometimes the music was too loud and took away from what was happening.  I liked this series.  The end left you to wonder how it all would turn out but it seemed pretty apparent the good ole USA would prevale.
1,"If you like to watch a group of awful people lying and doing awful things to each other, then this is one for you. It's hard to find anybody to like in this show. Add that to a bizarre editing style that keep jumping around in time previewing what is to happen in the future -- then jumping to the past? Where's the present?Lots of character and plot manipulation to keep the story going to the point of ridiculousness.The acting is very good and the casting very good, just a hateful story.It being a serial, I got sucked in and slugged it out finishing 2 seasons, but the ending of the 2nd season didn't even make sense, other than, incredulously, setting up for more seasons. I was so glad to not look at Glen Close' face anymore, that it was a relief that it was over. Out of complete boredom, I may take a peak at the 3rd season, if nothing else, to see how the heck they will try to patch the absurd ending to season 2."
0,"Dumbest series, not funny, cute or smart. Why watch such losers? This isn't Amazon's fault; it's the producer's of this lame show."
1,Watch this with my daughter all the time. keeps her interested. she calls every dog 'blue'added all the seasons to watchlist!
1,"We enjoyed the writing, and the characters were strong. The nice part is that even though you got enough information to care about the characters, the patient care and the way it was done at the time was very interesting."
1,outside! outside! everybody outside!line up! line up! everybody line up!and i'm starting to understand that when they are telling stories they are still underwater but are subject to the laws of nature and physics that would be in place if they were in the place where the story is being told. when they are not acting out the story they are really underwater and for the most part the environment reacts the way you would expect to to react. sometimes i still get frustrated when they swim up ladders or spray water or drink from glasses.
1,"Those who like such films as ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Others"" (or Jack Clayton's ""The Innocent"" and Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"") should not miss ""The Orphanage"" (""El orfanato"") directed by Barcelona-born Juan Antonio Bayona. The Spanish film is a rather remarkable effort in that, like a classic ghost story, the film, which cleverly uses some of the familiar elements from horror genre, favors atmosphere over logic, and it works.The following paragraphs contain a mild spoiler.[STORY] Laura (Bel&eacute;n Rueda) comes back to the abandoned orphanage by the sea 30 years after she left the place. This is where she was raised when she was a little girl, and Laura is going to open a new orphanage here for the handicapped children with her husband and adapted son Sim&oacute;n. When everything is going well, however, some strange things start to happen. And finally during the party Sim&oacute;n disappears suddenly, as if spirited away.Some say ""The Orphanage"" is a ghost story, some a supernatural thriller. Whatever the film is, it owes its success to Bel&eacute;n Rueda as Laura. The Spanish star literally becomes the character she plays, a tormented mother whose beloved son is long missing. Her acting is so strong and her character's sadness sometimes so painful to see that ""The Orphanage"" ultimately becomes an intense mother-and-son drama, even though the son is not always there.True, most of the narrative devices in the Spanish film ""The Orphanage"" are not particularly new - a little boy ""speaking"" with his ""imaginary friend"" or the ""secrets"" of an old house have been dealt with so many times before. But there is something very unique about The Orphanage,"" that is, something unnerving that curiously stays in your mind long after watching the film itself. It is hard for me to describe the nature of it. Maybe it is the shocking ""truths"" about the orphanage and the missing case. Or maybe it is some of the film's very spooky scenes or the ending that defies our expectations. All I can say is see for yourself.The film is co-produced by Guillermo del Toro, of ""Pan's Labyrinth."""
1,"My husband and I started watching ROME a couple weeks ago and are finishing the second season tonight.  It is really fascinating to see the cold, dry facts we heard growing up come alive this way.  Of course, it isn't for youngsters.  It is an HBO program after all.  Be warned that it contains lots of nudity and lovemaking."
1,"Not as good as season 5, 6 or 7 but okay too.But I was very disappointed with the ending.Stargate definetely deserved a big impressive ending.For heavens sake! - such an awesome TV show - we are talking TV HISTORY:and then this weak lame ending........zero stars for the creativity of the writers involved."
1,I love the Agatha Christie's Poirot Series for season 11. David Suchet is such a marvelous actor and his portrayal of Poirot is wonderful. I love to be able to stream the series whenever I am ready to watch it. I highly recommend this series and streaming video.
1,Loved it on TV but missed some episodes. Was nice to be able to watch the whole thing. Don't know why they didn't keep it going.
1,I loved this show. The premise was just fabulous. it's a shame the show was cancelled by the network. The DVD's are great to be able to watch when I have nothing to watch and need a cerebral-pick-me-up-show..
1,"I wasn't ready for the show to end.  I wan't a new chapter, the traveler part.  I didn't know who eddie lizard was before this show, and to put minnie driver with him was brilliant.  There was so many chapters to choose from , why end something so brilliant?  This season is great , I just wanted to it to continue..."
1,"Excellent fantasy!  This has a continuing story line and the more you get to know the characters and their lives prior and after the events, you will be hooked.  I am only sorry that they were cancelled.  I did not like the ending."
1,The series kept getting better and better.  The interaction between Bones and Booth started to really progress.  The cases took on some weird overtones.
1,"The writing and the acting in Justified are excellent. I don't want to spoil it for you but a lot of people get shot this season, maybe even more than last season. Yet it remains fun to watch and retains a human touch. And lets face it, all the people getting shot are pretty terrible people.Fun fact - the entire thing is shot in Santa Clara, California."
1,"This is not a great movie, but for me it was entertaining. I enjoyed the relationship between the two lead characters and it was a new take on the aliens have landed story. It does a decent job of keeping your attention and some good thrilling moments when they come into contact or within proximity of the aliens. Not a bad flick overall, definitely worth viewing."
1,This film was extremely well done and historically accurate. One could wish that Hollywood could put forth films of this quality.
1,A quirky police mystery show with appealing characters. A wronged police officer returned to the force after 12 years in prison for a brutal crime he did not commit. Tempted to seek revenge but now with a new outlook on life--will he ever find out who set him up?They had to wrap up this series way too soon!
1,"As MST3k is sort of a show within a show within a movie concept, I think it is better to look at the individual parts of the episode to determine if the episode works in totalThe Movie: After finding a relic from Venus, an international team of scientists are sent to Venus to determine why Venus will not respond to Earth's radio signals.  This is a very serious and straight forward science movie that has more in common with ""2001"" and ""Star Trek"" than the normal MST3k cheesefests like ""King Dinosaur"".  It is also sort of dry with most of the movie being about the scientists interacting with each other and performing scientific experiments while traveling in their spaceship.  And yet I found myself sort of caring about the team and I became very interested when they finally arrived on the alien surface of Venus.Host Segments: The invention exchange segment is extremely funny due to the interaction between Frank and Dr. Forrester - both seem to enjoy screwing around during the skit.  The remaining segments range from bad to ok.  Even worse, Joel plays around with Tom Servo's sarcasm meter.  It is supposed to be fixed by movie sign but yet Tom keeps spouting a sarcastic comment that quickly wears thin.Riffs: Joel and the bots start and end strong but the riffing is very sparse for most of the movie (the part when the scientists are on the ship).  There are moments when an entire minute passes before the next riff.  Except for the first and last ten minutes, the riffs were not all that funny with the occasional chuckle.  And Tom constantly saying ""Ooooo... &lt;&lt;Sarcastic remark>> Sign me up!"" went from mildly funny to quickly annoying by the end of the movie.Overall: I am a big fan of MST3k and will probably have to turn in my red jumpsuit for saying this but... I actually became annoyed with the crew as the few riffs in this episode always come when something important was about to be explained.  I guess I started to pay too much attention to movie during the riffing silence and found myself actually caring more about the movie than when the next riff would be delivered.  I would grade this episode a slightly below average episode with a slightly boring but yet watchable movie offset by bad segments and riffing that reminded me of season 1."
1,"I have a 9 year old son.  We used to watch this series when he was younger - it was one of our favorites.  Recently, he began watching them again with our prime video subscription.  We both enjoy it as much as ever."
1,"I may not personally like it, but my kids sure do! Definitely keeps them entertained and the silly songs stuck in their heads :)"
1,My boys age 3 and 5 absolutely love Diego. It's an educational show that teaches them all about Animals. I love that all the season are available on Prime.
1,"A gray and dystopic future, evil megacorp taking over the world and the people in it - OK, that part's been done. 'Metropia' stands out for doing it brilliantly. It's a lot more than that, though.Animation has explored the super-realistic, with just enough success that the discrepancies become especially jarring. This goes farther, well into the surreal. That allows for exaggerations of faces and figures, wide-eyed blankness and evil scowls that wouldn't be phyiscally possible for human actors. And, despite great advances in computer-aided post-production, animators can build their worlds from the ground up in the image they want, with no need to retrofit them into scraps of reality. This movie really does use animation in a novel and very distinctive way.Very enjoyable in many ways. Certainly not one for the kiddies, it scarcely qualifies as as ""adult"" movie - but body-shy viewers might have trouble with brief- and semi-nudity.-- wiredweird"
1,Call me shallow but I like babies.  I like to see crazy moms and grand moms .  This is very light watching.  No Anthony Trolllope but a fun bit of semi child abuse with moms sticking eyelashes and hairpieces on little girls who sometimes rebell by behaving badly.  These children usually perform ala STEPFORD WIVES and make Mommy proud to spend thousands of dollars to win a crown and sash that are too big and tacky.  Enjoy
1,"What a clever premise!  A sociopath with serial killer tendencies is spotted at a very early age by a seasoned police officer (while the child is up for adoption).  The Officer adopts the child and takes the opportunity to carefully ingrain in him that he is ONLY to kill others like him...serial killers....who have managed to slip through the system and remain free.  Dexter learns to be one of the best blood spatter experts at the police station.This is extraordinarily interesting as Dexter narrates his inner most thoughts, and we get to learn how a sociopath, with no empathy or understanding of how ""normal"" people feel, navigates through society mimicking how people behave.  That is fascinating.  The acting is dead-on and the writing is crisp and taught.  My ONLY issue with this series is the foul, gutter mouth of Dexter's sister...it is so extreme that it feels like slaps in the face.Really good television."
1,I like watching ancient aliens because of all the facts that are given to you.  Even if you don't believe in aliens this is great to watch because it opens your mind to other possibilites that are all around us!  If you want to have something to think about watch this series!
1,"Joel Kinnaman is brilliant, direction is fantastic, the light (and DARK), the rain, the music is distinctive and effective.  Usually, I can't take writing about subjects that dark, but it is so assured and thorough you don't ever feel beaten up or depressed.  This team is in control of something very special,  and of course I'm crazy in love with Joel Kinnaman.  Enos has the harder part, less flashy, handles it well, but her face is severe (with her hair pulled back) and a little odd/devoid of emotion.  I think this oddity is ok (her short stature and long red ponytail), but there are other actresses - Monica Bello, Cassidy Freeman? - who have expressive and serious chops and might convey more with just the slightest curl of a lip...?  ANyway, I would not miss an episode and even (unheard of for me) watch them twice, sometimes more.  It's an education in great episodic filmmaking."
1,Beautifully written and acted by a phenomenal cast!  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys historical dramas.  There is a fair amount of humor as well.
1,Great family show. We really enjoy it. Science fiction is a family favorite. The characters are easy to relate to.
1,My children enjoyed this movie; they played it over and over. They even learned the songs and danced to the music.
1,"This program gives another look at the behavior of people during the war with Germany and how local law enforcement were able to squash many terrorist activities and local violence as well.  It is interesting and well written, gives the viewer England's beautiful towns and country side and gives a bit of insight into the thoughts of the people of the time."
1,"I love the show, I can't believe it ended after only three seasons. I think the main actress should get an award."
1,Great show and gets better as it goes.  Arrived quickly and in great shape.  Must watch from the beginning. Amazing!
1,"Great show for my 3 year old! Keeps her entertained and happy, without anything that could be either over-stimulating or not age-appropriate. Love it!"
1,"Is it possible?  I love this character!  Maybe because of my childhood fascination with Nancy Drew and this is her come to life in the modern age, maybe because this is the chic I wish I were with the feisty and the smarts and the always getting her man (or lady criminal).  I don't know, all I can say is yes, thank you, more please!  Thrilled for the movie and I really hope we can get a new movie every couple of years, even made for TV.  Keep Veronica Mars alive!"
0,"I read some of the other reviews before watching this and although they warned about the later parts of the series, I found even the beginning unclear and poorly developed.  We watched the first episode only and couldn't be bothered to follow up any further.  It simply was not entertaining and that is all we wanted it to be."
1,"If you enjoy a good comedy then this is a must have for your collection!  Hysterical!  After watching season 1, my friends and I set up a Fantasy Football League and heckled each other all season long.  Can't wait to see season 3, season 2 was great as well."
1,"Dexter is the most amazing, clever, funny, dark and thrilling program I've almost ever seen.  It is brilliant and unique and interesting and thoroughly enjoyable.  The fact that we can actually like a serial killer is amazing in itself.Michael C Hall is fantastic as Dexter.  He is intelligent, lost, and almost unable to feel love for another human.  The story lines are chilling and keep you on the edge of your seat - you are always guessing.  The writing is superb and witty and smart.  I never read Jeff Lindsays books, but now I think I'll go buy them and read cover to cover.Trust me; this show is one that grabs you and won't let go till the ride is over.  Just when you think you have things figured out, they might take a different turn.  It's addictive and one of the best programs you'll ever see.  It's great and I love this."
1,I've watched all of the Foyle series and have become a true fan of all the characters. The timeframe of WW II and the civil problems faced by the English are very interesting.
1,"'The First 48 Hours' offers an interesting view of psychological profiling. The emphasis is not on sensationalism but the efforts to find the perpetrators. The episodes chosen were usually those that took place in Harris County, Texas. Since this was a TV series, there is repetition (noted in another review) that allows time for commercials. Some episodes switch back and forth between two different criminal investigations and others address a single incident. The episodes take place in different locations and feature homicide detectives in the area. Emotions run the gamut from tragic to humorous. The narrator gives both a description and an explanation that is easy to follow. If you like this genre, the portrayal and cases are well presented. Note that this program is produced by A&E; Television Network and is probably of better quality than other similar productions. The name is derived from that 48 hour window after an investigation begins. Each episode ends with this quote: "". . . presumed innocent until proven guilty."" Certainly a reminder of our criminal justice system . . . in theory and probability.Personal comment:Now I know why my 'recommended list' changed. 'Secrets of the Dead' offered several episodes concerned with WWII and military history is within my study background. The puzzle has been solved. . . it took me longer than 48 hours!"
1,"It's a little-known fact that none other than Lucille Ball is responsible for the birth ofStar Trek. As the titular head of Desilu Studios in the 1960's, she green-lit former LA cop Gene Roddenberry's idea of an intergalactic western and championed the series during its brief three-year run on NBC. It is amazing to consider how the franchise continues to thrive 43 years later, so much so that director J.J. Abrams (Lost) and screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have been able to re-imagine the legacy of the series without sacrificing the fidelity needed to satisfy the throngs of rabid fans who pushed the grosses north of the $200 million mark in its first week of release. As someone who is not remotely a Trekker, I have to admit the creators have done a fine job of reincarnating the familiar characters into their youthful counterparts and concocted an engaging, time-traversing plot that smartly avoids heavy exposition in favor of action and pyrotechnics. The result can be sometimes mind-numbing and trivial, but the 122-minute movie is never dull.The densely populated plot throws us forward to the year 2233 (or backwards depending on your perspective on ""Star Trek"" lore) as the USS Kelvin confronts a major alien vessel captained by an embittered Romulan named Nero. An alternate timeline is revealed, and inevitable tragedies ensue. Years later, we meet the familiar characters from the TV series culminating in the USS Enterprise's maiden voyage. James Kirk is a cocksure hothead with obvious Starfleet Academy potential, but he is haunted by the father he never knew. The half-human, half-Vulcan Spock is a brilliant student-turned-control freak by his nature but sometimes unable to reconcile the two sides of his identity. Their initially hostile relationship provides much of the film's spark, as they one-up each other in face a common enemy in Nero. This provides a good excuse for the CGI-enhanced action sequences with a plethora of explosions and characters zooming in and out of frame. By the time you start to feel the excess and redundancy in this approach, the story wraps the viewer up in its core ethos - that the Enterprise crew is an extended rainbow coalition of a family even as entire civilizations are destroyed.Abrams and crew are smart enough to recognize that the movie has to capture the heart of the original series in a way that doesn't patronize fans yet engage us non-Trekkers. Most of the casting choices are solid, although a couple of them are rather distracting. With the lightweight veneer of a tween idol, Chris Pine captures the braggadocio and roughhewn manner of a youthful Kirk in a way that tethers him to Shatner's real-life personality without doing an outright imitation of the elder actor. Even better is Zachary Quinto who has little latitude to vary Spock from fan expectation, yet he brings subtle but palpable currents of humanity to his stoic character. The rest of the crew is painted in broader strokes with Karl Urban coming closest to caricature as ""Bones"" McCoy; Anton Yelchin, laying on a thick, Cold War-era Russian accent as the extremely young Chekhov; and Simon Pegg (Hot Fuzz) pulling out all the comedy stops as exiled engineer Scotty. Somewhat more subtle are Zo Saldana (Guess Who) as linguist specialist Uhuru, who has a surprising relationship with Spock, and John Cho (Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay) showing that he can handle action sequences with dexterity as neophyte helmsman Sulu.Covered with latex, Eric Bana is hardly recognizable as Nero, although he makes the most of his character's stock vengeance motives. It's genuinely odd, however, to see Tyler Perry (Madea Goes to Jail) as the head of the Starfleet Academy and especially the still-doe-eyed Winona Ryder trying to look maternal as Spock's human-side mother. Among cinema's comic book franchises, this one is closer toThe Dark KnightthanX-Men Origins: Wolverineon the quality scale. Visually, it doesn't disappoint with Daniel Mindel's dazzling, kinetic cinematography and Scott Chambliss' creative production design that mixes retro and futuristic elements seamlessly. At the same time, the convenient timeline jumble doesn't really give rise to any complex moral quandaries beyond the importance of building friendships and trusting your colleagues. Nonetheless, the movie is propulsive entertainment which doesn't tamper with its genesis and focuses squarely on the humanity of the familiar characters. For that accomplishment, we should all be grateful."
1,"This show is like Heroes, Lost, and real life.  The characters make you care.  Good plots make you come back for more.  How I wish I had the hero's talent of remembering everything I've ever read. His mentor evolves into some one afraid to show that he cares, lest someone use that against him.  Throw in some idiots that are learning, some insecure people that take advantage of the system in place, and the hero, of course, who tries not to care, but fails."
1,"Fortunately, the second season of BONES mantains the high standards achieved int he first season.The chemistry between Bones and Booth only improves. Also, the additon of a new female head chief (Cam)for the Jeffersonian team was a clever idea and worked nicely. This, adding to intriguing plots, superb support roles by Ryan O'Neil and Stephen Fry, scaring villains like Eppes and the guy that buried BOnes (the first case to not be solved - probably until further episodes!)and the ""love angle"" with Hodgins and Angela conspired to make this great television."
1,Awesome series so glad to have Amazon Prime so I can see those shows that I didn't have the time to watch.
1,"Unlike the romanticized depictions of Roman life that previous cinema has given us, this mini-series is not afraid to depict Roman life as according to historical accounts.  It is not recommended for children."
1,"Season one was great, surprises without being super strange, decent characters, nice story progression while keeping each episode interesting.Season two is what killed this show though, bringing in the new character as a love interest for the partner was a joke, not that they brought someone in, but who and how.  Other than that the second season is worth watching too."
1,"American audiences will feel right at home here:  other reviews have already noted the similarity that ""Lark Rise to Candleford"" bears to beloved American programs like ""The Waltons"" and most especially ""Little House on the Prairie"".  Perhaps Brits themselves felt at home with this series for the same reason, as I'm sure those American shows were seen on British TV at some point.  Even the landscape looks more American than British.  Hardly a cloudy day, golden fields of barley everywhere, and the fictional ""Candleford"" could easily pass for Topeka, Kansas during the same time period.There must have been a lot of morally righteous fathers raising bright young women in the late 1800s, because Laura Ingalls Wilder and Flora Thompson, who wrote the series of books this show is based on, were writing very similar stories at about the same time (early 20th century) across the pond from each other.  ""Look how simple our lives were in the High Victorian era!  Take that, you Depression-era hedonists, with your cities and automobiles!""  Our young heroine does not lack for mentors to exemplify, either through lecturing or through their own mistakes, good moral lessons:  that morally righteous father, plus an always-practical mother, and a worldly employer at the town post-office.  Julia Sawalha as the oddly-named Post-Mistress ""Dorcas"" Lane, and Fergus Drysdale as the father, are the acting stand-outs.  This is Sawalha's show all the way.  The show suffers when she's not in the frame.  Not because there's no acting talent among the rest of the cast, but because the characters are not terribly well-conceived.  There's a postman who acts like a child, is terrified of women, then starts beating a bible in high moral dudgeon.  I think he's meant to be comic relief.  Well, he wasn't funny enough.  There's Dawn French as the World's Sloppiest Mom in the ""Lark Rise"" hamlet, who belongs in a modern reality show, like ""Honey Boo Boo"", rather than a period piece.  There are a pair of spinster-sisters who run the local clothing store, who wear the same garish outfits every day.  Some of these characters change from sympathetic to antagonistic, depending on the episode.Lots of comments here praising the ""cleanliness"" of this program.  Yeah.  Just a little too clean, for my taste.  It could use more grit and less silly characters.  I'm also surprised by the rampant sentimentality in a British production: tears hang trembling in bottom eyelids a lot.  Oh well, I guess English people like to cry, too.  But many praising the wholesomeness of life depicted in this show would not choose to go back in time to live in Candleford, and not just because there would be no cell phones.  Class system is in full force here ... and the show appears to believe in that hierarchy, as demonstrated by the local Squire who goes around adjudicating disputes and determining sentences for violators of the law, all with perfect justness, a justness you get the feeling could not be achieved by a jury of peers.  They'd be too hungry from their serf-like lives to devote much attention to anything abstract like justice.Sentimentality's a dangerous road.  Leave the coach-and-four at home and just drive your car."
0,"this is the exact type of garbage which sends tv viewers like me away from the networks in general and nbc in particular away in DROVES.the creators of this show dont seem to know the difference between nerdy and prissy-effeminate. one character looks like a guy in a clown suit and the other is a recycled version of niles crane from frasier.the characers are retarded and this sitcom belongs in 1982 right between hello larry and the facts of life.the most offensive thing is the laughtrack which screams at you from almost the first moment.this show is an absolute insult to the viewer will be taught as an example of what not to do with a sitcom. the idea might have been a cool one if it wasnt written in giant crayons.if they are going for the youth demo with this one, people need to be fired."
1,Centurion is a pretty good movie overall. It had plenty of battle scenes and the plot will keep you interested throughout the film.
1,"To me, season four is the last of the great NCIS seasons, until season Nine. Gibbs is in Mexico, Ziva is on the run after being framed by a former massad officer who everybody thought was dead. Tony is the team leader, and Mcgee is no longer the probie. Ziva calls Gibbs in mexico, and he agrees to come back to the states to help. The F.B.I gets involved. But in the end, Ziva proves that she's an Investigator first now, and gets the killer to talk. Which clears her, and allows Gibbs to go back to Mexico. But not for long, as Fornell asks Gibbs's help in solving a case, which he does. And decides to come back to NCIS for good, the stories in season four are outstanding. The Halloween story alone is worth watching, as a marine is attacked in his home. And his daughter is kidnapped, and all throughout the case, Ziva thinks that the Daughter's mother is the one who kidnapped her own daughter. But alas, in the end she is wrong.  Or the creepy episode, ""Smoked"". Where a body is found in a chimney, the body of a sadistic serial killer with a toe in his stomach, only come to find out his wife was the actual killer. As she buried the bodies in their yard, and the episode ends with Gibbs asking fornell how he thought the toe got in the guys stomach. There are two threads of stories throughout this season, one is Tony has a new girlfriend, and Gibbs has a Girlfriend Col. Hollis Mann. We also find out, that Mcgee is a fictional writer. We're introduced to Shariff, in two incredible episodes, where they stop the terrorist the first time, and Gibbs is almost killed the second time they meet. Also in this season, we eventually find out that Tony's girlfriend is his undercover assignment for Director Shepard. As she tries to get an international arms dealer  La Grenoulle, now Ducky had been mad at Gibbs for quitting, but eventually they become friends again. And Paula Cassidy and her team are killed in an explosion, in a really powerful episode, season four ends with Jeanne and Dinnozo getting in a limo, which is her father's, and there is La Grenoulle. Season four again, is the last of the great NCIS seasons."
1,"I enjoy this series, especially the interaction of the two brothers and their father. I recognize it is not especially realistic, but it is nonetheless, thought provoking and enjoyable."
1,"want to know why amazon doesn't have several seasons - it's annoying to go through 1 to 5, skip 6 to 10 and then juimp back to season 15 - get with it amazon! Those of us who love this series want to watch it in order"
1,Good effects and storyline. Suspenseful images and story. This is where Chris Egan got his name. I can't imagine this was cancelled after only half of a season.
1,"I really enjoyed this season, the bond between the Epps brothers is a great side story. I suggest this series to everyone!"
1,I really loved watching this series and the reality of how life was in London so many years ago. The situations are heart breaking but things that actually do occurr in life. Amazing cast!!!
1,"&lt;strong>Rubber&lt;/strong> (Quentin Dupieux, 2010)I probably saw the trailer for Quentin Dupieux's debut film, &lt;em>Rubber&lt;/em>, more times than any other over the spring and summer of 2011. It tells a silly tale indeed: that of a homicidal, psychotic tire (named Robert, the trailer tells us, though that is never mentioned in the film) who goes on a murderous rampage at a hotel in the middle of the California desert, and the cadre of law enforcement officials on Robert's tail.It looks like, not to put too fine a point on it, just about the dumbest, funniest movie you could possibly want to see. At one point, the trailer also calls the film ""visionary"". I assumed that was meant, like I assumed everything else in the trailer was meant, as a joke.I have never been more wrong with an assumption in my life. And I have never been as happy to be that wrong.Because the trailer does such a great job at hiding so much of what makes this movie great, and because the reviews of the movie I've read surprisingly do the same thing, I will do my best to dance around the parts of this movie that no one has told you about yet even while noting that they are the parts of the movie that make you really, really want to see it. Unfortunately, that precludes a plot synopsis other than what you get from the trailer (which I recapped above). I will go as far as to tell you that the rest of the plot, which is far more interesting than the sentient-killer-tire bit, poses a lot of the same questions Michael Haneke did in &lt;em>Funny Games&lt;/em> vis-a-vis the way in which an audience consumes a film. But where Haneke's films always feel kind of artificial to me (this is not a criticism; I'm a huge fan of Bela Tarr, how could I criticize artificiality?), Dupieux takes that artificiality and blows it up to six-foot-tall-neon-red letters and tattoos it across the forehead of this movie. It is so completely absurd that it works. It is the best movie I have seen of its kind since Peter Greenaway's infamous, and long-banned, 1993 film &lt;em>The Baby of Mcon&lt;/em> (yes, including Haneke). I will say right up front that this is a movie that thrives on its own meta-ness, as do &lt;em>Funny Games&lt;/em> and &lt;em>The Baby of Mcon&lt;/em> (one could even draw a comparison, perhaps, to Makavejev's &lt;em>Sweet Movie&lt;/em>); if that's not your cup of tea, this won't be, either. And if you're looking for a straight horror comedy, that is not what this is at all. I suspect those two factors account for much of the film's low rating at various movie sites (68% at Rotten Tomatoes as I write this and 5.8 at IMDB), but that's the risk Dupieux took in keeping so much of the genius of this movie hidden. Since I'm doing the same thing, all I can do is tell you to see it. You will love it or you will hate it, and I can't tell you which. ****"
1,"I think that whenever you love a television show, you should get the DVD as homage to a show that you loved but also because of the DVD extras. This DVD provides the extras that I like but unlike Season 1 & 2, the casts (Aldis, Beth, Christian) do commentary.The contributors are a chatty group so make sure that you've watched the episode so many times that you know what's going on without hearing. And they appear to have made a conscious decision to not ""watch"" the show rather to comment. So they aren't watching the show with you they are talking about what went on behind the scenes. We learn early on that Aldis Hodge likes to refer to himself as ""Sexual Chocolate"" when he sees himself on screen. As he does commentary for the first 7 or 8 episodes and then returns for 15 & 16, it becomes a bit of a running gag.As season three is about the pending meeting with Monreau, the commentators make a point of reminding you that Eliot had a pretty dark past, which is important because as they stated, Christian is such a charismatic and charming guy that sometimes the audience might forget how dark he really was. In addition to that, the commentary likes to talk about the improvisational skills of Aldis Hodges and the strength of the other actors and the things that they bring to the screen.One of the things that I like that runs throughout the seasons that I've viewed so far is that they like to talk about where a story line comes from and how much research goes into the stories. It might be surprising to hear but some of the things that we see on Leverage like phone cloning, or the ability to trick a laser security system or how to fool a motion detector are all things that they've researched and that can truly be done. My favorite statement came from Aldis Hodge who said that all of the criminals watching just learned something. It was my favorite statement because a second before he said that I looked at my own motion detector and said, ""Did they just tell criminals how to fool my security system.""There are other goodies including deleted scenes, a gag reel, and Aldis doing a Job but there is nothing like watching the show with commentary. I think that the average fan will like this but also film students because the commentators talk a lot about things that you might learn in film school. I don't remember all of the terminology but they discuss blocking, bullet shots, set design, and how kind the people to Portland where when allowing them to use offices. It's a must get."
0,"MST 3000 is often hilarious.  This episode was slow and tedious with a smart and funny barb coming in at a pace of 1 every 15 minutes.  Dull and boring, I'm sorry to say."
1,"&#34;You do know the man is nitroglycerin,&#34; warns a colleague about John Luther.  This detective in London, Luther, is played by Idris Elba. Most notably know from the series 'The Wire'. Luther is a different man, volatile, crazy, and engrossed in his job. We meet him as he is chasing a very bad man. Something awful course and the next time we see him seven months has gone, and his career and marriage in shambles.Back he comes on the job,  fragile in some ways, but Luther becomes involved in a weird murder case where he meets a crazy and possible killer Alice Morgan, played by Ruth Wilson. he has met his match. Alice can see Luther has a troubled mind. One grisly murder after another occurs, and they all lead to Alice. The cases get more disturbing until the final two episodes where things start to boil over.Luther becomes addictive, so watch it!Recommended. prisrob 09-16-13"
1,"I don't understand what the other reviewer is complaining about here.  This isn't a random episode selection from Season 4 like he says.  It's just what it claims to be ""Volume 4"".  This set contains the second 16 episodes from Season 3 and continues in chronological order where ""Volume 3"" leaves off.  They are releasing all the episodes just in instalments of 16 episodes.  And I think it's just fine considering the content you get for the price.  I'm glad they're picking up the pace on this aswell as American Pickers...just wish there was news about the next set of American Restoration."
1,"The grandkids really love Caillou, Especially our four-year-old who identifies with Caillou who is always four years old. This is a great babysitting tool for when the grandkids get tired and just want to watch TV."
1,"Right off the bat, let me say that the acting in this series is great. I think the actor who plays Harvey Spector, Gabriel Macht, does a great job of portraying a high functioning, successful psychopath. People get the wrong idea about the character traits of psychopathy: fearlessness, the ability to shut down emotion, to be ruthless in pursuit of a goal, these are not necessarily bad things in context. If you need a great trial attorney on your side, a guy like Harvey is your man, hands down.  Even his decision to hire a guy who has no law degree, no bar membership and is running from the law as his associate is a very psychopathic trait. Psychopaths don't care about breaking rules, laws, mores when it suits them. It's important to remember that psychopathy, like every other personality trait lies along a sliding scale from high functioning to totally screwed up.But I do have a problem with the basic premise that somehow the pretend attorney can get away with it in the high power world of New York Corporate law. (Not to say it hasn't been done by real people - it has - but not forever. Sooner or later everyone gets caught.) The very fact that EVERY lawyer who works in this firm goes to Harvard Law makes it even more improbable. The law is a set of small worlds that revolve around the court system like planets around the sun. Lawyers who graduated from Harvard Law would be the planet Mercury. Lawyers who went to Harvard Law and worked in New York City would be a moon orbiting Mercury (if Mercury had a moon). You can see the issue here. Even more improbable is the idea that the Managing Partner of the firm would put up with it for a single moment after she discovered the truth.If, and it's a very BIG if, you can suspend your disbelief, then this show can be a lot of fun. And again I have to give kudos to Gabriel Macht for such a fine portrayal of a high functioning, successful psychopath. This is what these men and women look like in the corporate world.Patrick J. Adams also gives a great performance as the guy who slides along on the strength of his brain thinking that he can make it through life without paying the bill.Gina Torres as Jessica, the managing partner - great performances.Like I said, the cast is great, the storyline is fun -- it's just hard to keep believing."
1,"I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the Norwegian tales about trolls.  The movie explained why Norway is so full of rocks, boulders and mountains.  I learned about different trolls and their range, electric &#34;fences&#34; that enclose trolls into their territory, and, most of all, the responsibility of troll control belongs to one person.  I loved the college students who set out to find the troll hunter and how they became &#34;believers&#34;.  It's a great story."
1,"""How I Met Your Mother"" continues the search for the mother in Season 3, but doesn't try very hard. After Lily played by Alyson Hannigan and Marshall played by Jason Segal got married at the end of season 2, they start looking for their own apartment to live in and think about the future. Marshall tries to find just the right job and is finally exposed to the mountain of Lily's debt that he has been saddled with. Ted played by Josh Radnor and Robin played by Cobie Smulders are no longer dating and things are tense between them all season. Barney played by Neil Patrick Harris continues to be AWESOME, but starts to develop feelings for Robin.This season was the season of guest stars! Starting with Enrique Iglesias (""Would you dance....if I asked you to dance..."") as a boyfriend Robin picks up while on vacation, James Van Der Beek as Robin's ex she never got over, Heidi Klum playing herself, Sarah Chalke of ""Scrubs"" playing Stella who is Ted's new major love interest of the season, and Britney Spears plays Abby who is a receptionist in love with Ted and manipulated by Barney. Ted is occasionally a horrible person in this season and his behavior often contradicts his lofty goals and morality of past seasons.Bonus Features:The ""Series Retrospective"" is a great sum-up of the first two seasons narrated by Bob Saget as older Ted. Lily & Marshall's Honeymoon videos are pretty cute and home video authentic which makes me wonder if they were originally supposed to incorporated into some episodes, but they made a great extra. The ""Cast Favorites"" Featurette is where each cast member tells what their favorite episode is and why.Behind the Scenes of ""We're Not From Here"" Featurette is just like the last two seasons where they kind of show the process of getting from the read-through, to rehearsal, to run-through, to rolling for the episode. For the additional scenes: How It Really Happened just shows the extended and deleted scenes from episodes.The ""You Just Got Slapped"" music video is just Marshall behind a piano being very serious and does not feature NPH. The ""Sandcastles in the Sand"" music video is just as awesome as ""Let's Go To The Mall"". The Gag Reel once again does not disappoint and includes a random makeout session between Marshall, Lily, and Barney and the actual words yelled during Lily and Marshall's fight that had been dubbed over in a previous episode and features more music from The Solids. The ""Ted Mosby is a Jerk"" Audio Track is playing during ""The Bracket"" episode because Barney once posed as Ted Mosby to sleep with a girl and confronts her and she made a website called TedMosbyisaJerk.com. It's a weird slow song playing with girls being mad at Ted while subtitles of the show dialogue appear in black.There is commentary on ""The Platinum Rule"", ""Ten Sessions"", ""The Bracket"", ""The Chain of Screaming"", ""Sandcastles in the Sand"", ""Everything Must Go"", and ""Miracles"" and they split up individual actors again and also have Sarah Chalke with Josh Radnor for ""Ten Sessions."""
1,"I love this series. It is science fiction, good guys, bad guys, and is full of surprises. It is well written and well acted. All of these ingredients are rare to find in any show, let alone science fiction. I never knew this show existed. It has been a great surprise. Quality entertainment. It does not take place in the same boring settings every show. Not your typical TV series."
1,"Overall, really loved it. Again, Timothy Olyphant and Walton Goggins did  a great job. I really enjoy the humor and sarcasm that Raylan is so good at."
1,"Had some trouble accessing some of the episodes, but very enjoyable.(Might be my old DVD player).Linda Sheean"
1,Not just Damiano Lewis - the entire cast is superb. The writing is taut and directlng way above average. Don't know now I missed this series during it's original run but glad I stumbled across it! Given it an hour and you will be hooked!
1,"The Wonder Pets is such a cute show. Linny, Tuck, & Ming Ming are the best. My son loves the songs and all the adventures."
1,"Definitely my favorite seasons were seasons one through six.  The supporting cast was terrific and the story lines superb.  But what is extra special is the attention to detail and some of the sly humor (esp in the early seasons).  If you love rich settings, incredible acting, British humor and great unpredictable story lines, then you will love Poirot!"
1,"When I am well entertained and my interest is involved in what will happen next, it's a good program and worth continuing. I highly recommend for entertainment value. Good acting too."
1,My kids love this program. They like the way Caillou interacts with his little sister and love to watch his adventures. They can't get enough!
1,"I was recommended this movie by a friend.  I saw it in theatrical version but I understand that there is also a ""direcor's cut"" version that is almost three hours long.  Theatrical version was dubbed in English.  I personally prefer subtitles, but for audiences who do not like to read subtitles, this version will be great.Story is set during Chinese Han Dynasty.  One of the top advisors to the emperor is staging a war accusing local leaders of betraying the emperor when in fact, this advisor's desire is to overthrow the emperor and take over leadership of China.  There is also a subplot tot he story.  He is enamored with a beautiful woman, married to another nobleman and the intent is to win the war and claim her as his.What is amazing about the film is the production of the battles.  They are combination of war strategy, martial arts and ""Art of War"" philosophy.  Cast is delivering story that is compelling to watch and mesmerizing in its story plot and wonderful scenery of nature, not to mention costumes that are both elegant and visually pleasing.I absolutely loved this movie and I will strongly recommend it.  It is a combination of chinese history, love story and great action (both military and martial arts).  It is a must see movie."
1,Love the bubble guppies. My kids have learned so much from this show and the songs are catchy but not irritating.
1,"It is a very serious, intense story about cops finding the murderer of a teenage girl.  It shows you what this murder has done to each of her family members, candidates running for office, and the community at large.  It does hold my interest, but sometimes the subject matter is almost too sad and dark."
1,"This entire series is part Grimes Fable, part Stephen King's horror books, part all that is British, and mostly fun.  How a group of morally suspect young adults could be so easy to identify with is amazing and an indication that the writing works. It is goofy and good."
1,Life is the best cop series I have ever seen.  I wish it had had more than two seasons but think it would have ruined the whole concept of the show.  The characters and acting is superb.
1,I Really Enjoy The Movie It Was Very Good Movie Like I Sayed That My Favorite Movie Zombie I Never Got Tire Too Watch The Movie.
1,"We all know how it goes by now:  Monk gets a case, Natalie helps him, the captain maintains order, Randy is still a goofball, and Natalie's daughter barely appears. It's a formula, but it's enjoyable.There is a nice inclusion of Mr. Monk's 100th case, which is apparently the 100th episode, and it features some alumni such as John Turturro, playing Monk's brother.I'm hoping that the final season will really pull out all the stops."
0,"I spent the whole time waiting for a point. There was none.  Some of the acting was okay, but ultimately something was lacking.  It just didn't make much sense and was not interesting.  The whole concept had potential, so it was disappointing that it didn't deliver. It dragged on so much that I had the feeling that the story could have been better told in half an hour rather than an hour and a half.  I'm glad it was free to watch."
1,It took a while for me to get interested & thought it would be a series I could read while I was watching but soon realized it had more of my attention than at first thought. Strathmore is always interesting & the general topic reminded me of another series I have seen in the past but the characters & their inner conflicts kept me from reading!
1,I wish there were another season to watch because I am so hooked on this series.  The actors are believable and the premise so entertaining that I get completely absorbed.  Watch just one or two episodes and you will be riveted!
1,"When I watch Warehouse 13 it gives me the opportunity to just let go off the tough days, and imagine living in the wildly appealing life of a Warehouse agent.  Oh to escape to a magical place like the Warehouse.  The stuff dreams are made of."
1,"Love a good ghost story, wonder about some of the truth to them.  Know about ghosts or spirits and love hearing from other folks who have had experience with them too.  There is another side we do not conciously see.  Being a therapist, wonder about the mental and emotional state of some of these story tellers.  Could it be that thier emotional state lets them be more open to seeing?"
0,"I felt that the new show &#34;Life&#34; was interesting. The pilot episode offers some background on a cop that was wrongly convicted of a crime. He is released and after negotiating a multi million dollar settlement with the Police Deaprtment goes back to work as a detective in the Police Department. He has a very zen approach to life and is trying to solve the crime for which he was convicted. His partner is a young woman that is a recovering addict. She has little patience for him and is suspect of his methods.Still, I found that the show was not compelling. I think it went over the top and released too much information on the first episode when they should have held back a little. Everyone loves a good mystery!Dani Reese's (the woman agent) emotional responses were confusing. On one hand, she has little patience for her new partner ready to disclose everything he does wrong to her superiors and at the end of the episode, protecting him. She seems overly emotional in some scenes and then stoic in others. She is a recovering addict. I would have disclosed Dani Reese's addiction history maybe a bit later. The show just needs better writing.Damian Lewis played his character well, if he was going for the quirky Zen guy. But, the way he speaks (an attempt by the writers to make him interesting) is not that compelling. He has no censor and that's ok. But, the writer's attempt is so transparent as to make every line that comes out of Crews (the main character played by Lewis) unbelievable.Claudia Black is a good actress, why they would recast her is beyond me."
1,"NO SPOILERS : this season was amazing. i accidently stumbled onto this season....i hadn't watched survivor since the third season...so i knew nothing about any of the cast. so once i caught the first episode i immediately was hooked...the entire season, J.T., Steven, The Dragon Slayer, Taj....all excellent. the games are exciting, the rewards were awesome, and seriously some of the best backstabbing ever. this season, however, also had alot of heart...i truly did love the final four....good and bad...they all deserved to be there...i watched the entire series in two days...GORGEOUS scenery, excellent editing, music on point, Probst is excellent.cannot recommend this season enough....im not ruining any surprises here....im not...but three words...FAKE IMMUNITY IDOL = BRILLIANT."
1,"enjoy the show, but lately show is not as interesting as on early shows.  Cal seems too much into himself and insaulting.  wish  he was a bit more human like."
1,Interesting story line. The characters are real-life and shows good and bad of persons actions. Hope this show will continue for sometime.
1,Olivia Season 1 was great for my grandchild. He enjoyed watching it. It held his attention. He likes the characters.
1,"I cant wait to see and buy the 5th season. We watched and bought all 4, and sold them, the day after we watched them, instantly. This is what tv and entertainment should be like and isnt! The acting is superb! The characters amazing and believable! they take something that I didnt think Id be interested in and just made it real, even though, it is is so unbelievable, but you KNOW and love or hate all of the characters, and the love and hate changes and is soooooooooo believable! Cudos to these guys, for real!"
1,"Well, I've loved Dr. Who over the years. But I think the writers are making a mistake here. I thought River Song was supposed to be the love of his life, but now he's entranced with someone else. It's an OK story with a very silly Sherlock Holmes crossover. So, to like this one, you need to forget all the angst of the last couple of years. The Pond family, poof! As if they never existed. So I guess I have a continuity complaint.Matt Smith is a sweetie, of course, always a lively performance. But, I think I'm getting tired of the series."
