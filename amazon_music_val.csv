1,"Blood on the Tracks stands with the best of Bob Dylan  the best of American music. This is latter day saint Dylan  Bob after poet for the masses  Bob after RnR hero  Bob pre- country crooner  Bob 70's comeback as wished by Elvis.This 5.1 recording stands fine up against the other 5.1 re-mixes of ""Bringing It All Back Home""  and ""Blond on Blond"".The guitars are sharp, clear and in your ear. The vocals whisper when they want and shout when they should.This is as good as it gets......."
1,"I can never make up my mind on this!  Which do I like better, All Over The Place, or Different Light?  Both albums have a hallowed place in my all-time favorite albums list, but which has the higher position?I bought All Over The Place three months after Different Light, and it was when I got into the Beatles the following year that I realized the similarities to their music and the Bangles' style on All Over The Place.  Well, after all, they were originally called the Supersonic Bangs, later the Bangs, until Bang[s] +[Beat]les=Bangles, so duh!  The first two songs, &quot;Hero Takes A Fall,&quot; and &quot;Live,&quot; as well as the ballad &quot;Dover Beach,&quot; could easily have fitted on a Beatles album, especially with the Rickenbacker guitar on &quot;Dover Beach.&quot;  It wouldn't be out of place on Help!, as it is reminiscent of &quot;Ticket To Ride.&quot;  And dig those closing lines:  &quot;If we had the time/I would run away with you/To a perfect world.&quot;Debbi Peterson has lead vocals on &quot;Live,&quot; and I've heard this song so many times and was always keen on the rhythm and chorus, but upon a recent listening, some of the verses just jumped right at me.  Yes, it's all very well doing what one want within the four walls of one's room, but is it living?  As she says, &quot;If you're gonna go, you better live your life before you pass away.  Don't waste today.&quot; and &quot;If you don't know what life's about, just go on and live.&quot;  She insistently repeats the title of the song inbetween verses.  Okay, now to determine the definition of &quot;live,&quot; because like all words, &quot;live&quot; can mean anything one wants it to mean.The rocking &quot;Going Down To Liverpool,&quot; sung by drummer Debbi Peterson, is a nod to the Beatles and is the decisive track that tells the listener why the Bangles merit listening to, although for me, I would have been instantly won over on the first song.  Katrina and the Waves would later cover this on their debut album.Susanna Hoffs is my favorite Bangle and she does the lead on &quot;Hero Takes A Fall,&quot; &quot;James,&quot; &quot;Dover Beach,&quot; and &quot;He's Got A Secret,&quot; as well as sharing lead with Vicki on &quot;Tell Me.&quot;  Her voice is sugary but strong.  Vicki definitely has the strongest voice of the quartet.  And bassist Michael Steele doesn't get to sing lead, but that would change on Different Light.However, there are places where the quartet carried on the new wave sound, except with heavier emphasis on rocking guitars rather than bubbly pop, especially on &quot;All About You,&quot; &quot;Tell Me&quot; and &quot;Silent Treatment.&quot;The closing track and ballad, &quot;More Than Meets The Eye,&quot; is a perfect closer to an album that spent most of its 31:10 minutes(!!) rocking for all its worth.  The first release in the Bangles Trilogy is yet another desert island CD.Memo to Susanna, Michael, Vicki, and Debbi:  The Go-Go's recently got back together seventeen years after their last studio album.  Hint hint!"
1,"I was not quite familiar with Sonny Rollins before this album.  I just picked it up at the store one day because one of my friends was raving about how awesome of a sax player he was and also because I read that he was a big influence to one of my favorite saxophonists, John Coltrane.  When I heard the first note from Sonny's sax I noticed something that I've never heard in any other sax's tone.  I heard a real controlled rich sound that was truly brilliant.  St. Thomas written by Sonny has a bit of a latin touch to it.  Max Roach first lays out the beat then comes Sonny blowing down the head.  Sonny's solo is just awesome with those octave jumps.  Moritat is a very familiar tune but under a different name, you'll know what I mean when you hear it.  To me there are two tracks that really stand out above the rest, Strode Rode and St. Thomas. On the swinging starts and stops of &quot;Strode Rode&quot; and the dreamy blues cycles of &quot;Blue 7,&quot; Rollins began his solos with simple melodic motifs, and orchestrated them into grand, elongated thematic statements--every note made meaningful by Rollins' extraordinary sense of development and intuitive musical architecture. Any body wanting to listen to a good saxophonist should really check out Sonny Rollins' Saxophone Colossus."
1,"An album this far of left field can rarely be described as addictive, but I've played this one about a million times and I never get tired of it. I have to admit though, I have purchased ""Rain Dogs"" three times in my life and ended up selling it the first two times I owned it because I just didn't get it. I don't think I was open minded enough to listen to this one the whole way through in my teen years, but the third time was a charm and this disc got its hooks into me completely. On ""Rain Dogs"" Waits continued to experiment with the unique instrumentation he used on his previous release ""Swordfishtrombones"" and really took it to the next level, the result being one of his best albums. Not to mention he employed the likes of Keith Richards, G.E. Smith, and Robert Quine (a Richard Hell and the Voidoids and Lou Reed alumnus), which didn't hurt. While some of the songs off this disc are bizarre and abrasive, there are others that are so accessible one wonders why they didn't take the world by storm; for every ""Singapore"" there is a ""Time"", for every ""Clap Hands"" there is a ""Downtown Train"". I can't think of any other album from the 1980's which has aged this well and is loaded with so many great songs and great moments: the classic Keith Richards riffs on ""Union Square"", the screeching ""Midtown"", (which would have been perfect for a car chase scene in the movies), the bluesy groove of ""Gun Street Girl"" (which is achieved through such minimal instrumentation that it's genius), the explosive vocal Waits delivers on ""Anywhere I Lay My Head"" which threatens to blow your stereo speakers out with its intensity, the country feel to ""Blind Love"" which features Waits' gravelly voice backed by Keith Richards' harmonies, and the list could go on and on. Like most of Waits' releases ""Rain Dogs"" was critically acclaimed but didn't sell in big numbers and has gone on to achieve a large cult following. It stands as one of his best albums, and I would include it as one of my favorite albums of all time. Once it gets its hooks into you nothing else will hit the spot the way ""Rain Dogs"" does. Also recommended if you like this one is the live album ""Big Time"", where Waits bends and twists the arrangements of some of the songs off this album with great results."
1,"Although &quot;Don't Speak&quot; was terribly overplayed on the airwaves, (so much so, that after a while I used to change the station whenever it came on) this album as a whole is excellent. I enjoy it more now than I did when it first came out. Gwen has a voice that is different from the run-of-the-mill girl vocalists these days. And the band is very talented, the songs are melodic with great riffs and hooks throughout. No Doubt are one of those bands that write, play and sing their own songs. True talent. The booklet contains all lyrics and lots of photos."
1,"Three of the greatest, most intense fusion tracks ever recorded by homo-sapiens make their permanent residence on this album. These are ""Dance of the Illegal Aliens"" by Percy Jones (who plays bass on tracks 2, 4, 7 & 8), ""Rhesus Perplexus"" by John Giblin (an incredible bassist, who played on the first 3 Peter Gabriel & first two Phil Collins albums, and one of the few good enough to fill in for Percy on tracks 1, 3, 5, & 9 & duet with him on track 7) and the mind-blowing ""And So to F..."" by Phil Collins (his drumming-highness rocket-blasts his incredible sounding & very loud set in all directions on tracks 1,3 & 5-thru-9, monster ex-Herbie-Hancock drummer Mike Clarke, also known today as 'the-most-sampled-drummer-in-hip-hop', filling in for Phil on tracks 2 & 4).The rest of the album is good but these 3 are the tracks where everything clicks and comes together to a level of perfection that just knocks people's socks off into the next dimension. These gems of uber-musicianship and non-compromise that not only succeed but soar into the skies are what have made Brand-X a legendary band, especially in Japan where to this day, 30 years later, they have almost rock-star status. John Goodsall's hyper-speed guitar solos that always tend to seek to raise the intensity of a Brand-X tune a few more notches still above its already wired state into the red without combusting the group fit in perfectly here. The traditionally understated patented Brand-X analog keyboard sounds by Lumely & Robinson provide just the right level of relaxed respite and playfulness to cushion and cool things down in high gear for a while before things torque-up again. ""Rhesus Perplexus"" even shows some Pat Metheny and George Benson influences but a funky, melodic, jazzy track with a louder, thicker drum-and-bass sound and a more odd meter you will search for for a long time and never find. ""And So to F..."" has the distinction of being simultaneously the most accessible tune and one of the most intensely propulsive in the Brand-X universe, using an odd-meter, but with a danceable, hummable rhythm on top that the scorching, fire-breathing, hyper-speed Goodsall guitar solos seem to rip to shreds before it returns again, as Collins, Percy and company give the world a master class in how to play with dynamics and maximum intensity at the same time.""Product"" was recorded in 1979 and is probably the best-sounding Brand-X album overall as it benefits from the workaholic studio perfectionism that Phil Collins was getting into at the time right after Genesis had their biggest hit until then with ""Follow You, Follow Me."" The unique drum sound he had perfected on ""Trick of the Tail"" & ""Unorthodox Behaviour,"" sounds even more perfect and refined here and Phil seems to have made sure the engineers got Mike Clarke's sound & Giblin's bass sound recorded as close to his & Percy's sounds as possible also so that the Brand-X experience overall sounds consistent. But to hear all this to best advantage you need to get the 2006 Japanese remaster, not the old 1990 release. There is 16 years of technological improvement there and Japan is where Brand-X truly gets their proper respect. It is definitely worth it for vastly improved sound and you can find it on yab-e for about 15 to 17 bucks."
1,"This CD although not highlighted as one of the best banda certainly can not fail to be recognized. Songs are melodic with the right dose. In my opinion is among the best. The remastering is excellent. There is not one bad song. It's a good album for anyone who wants to know the band, there's no way waive the collection. Very good!"
1,Bobby Caldwell's What you won't do for love is one of the best love songs of the 1970's. This album should have gotten more exposure.
1,"Yes, it sounds like Pink Floyd and no, the rest of the boys in the band are nowhere near.  What does that say about Gilmour's contributions to The Floyd?  A lot, I'd say.  Nice instrumentals, and the harmonica lends a perfectly swampy atmosphere to 'There's No Way Out Of Here'.  But there was a way, and here it is."
1,"Crass as this may seem MJ's recent passing has lead me to review some of his albums on here.I actually thought I had early in my years on Amazon but this is as good a time as any to start.This album was critical for Michael in a lot of different ways. First off obviously it had to follow upThriller,a really good album made that due to it's record breaking sales was made to seem inhumanely perfect. In short,the standards for this album were'nt set very high-not even by the artist himself so it seems. He was convinced afront that if he didn't change,he wouldn't be able to outdo his earlier feat. So he set about with Quincy Jones on making what basically amounted to music that was generally tougher minded.It has all the basic elements of the previous album but everything is a lot more dramatic and diliberate.Does it work in the end?You bet!! The heavy funk of the title track alone,with an excellent solo by jazz organist Jimmy Smith of course grabbed the most attention right off. Being how his commerciality is a huge part of Michaels artistry he really puts a huge amount of energy into what ended up being the hits here.""The Way You Make Me Feel"",with it's edgy sexual shuffle is the prime example of that,with some unusually swaggering singing from MJ. The other hits were ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You""...more or less a latinish pop ballad that Michael and Siedah Garrett sang the pants off of.It has recently been pointed out to me that there's an unexpected mix of funk and.....operatic classical chordal patterns to the edgy ""Smooth Criminal"",another of the tougher hits from this collection.""Man In The Mirror""....is a song I've always loved and respected.As I've grown older I have to admit it's been one of the more imitated styles of message songs and that can make it sound slightly corny musically by todays standards.But whatever you think about the arrangment the yearning,consciencious song more than makes up for what energy it may lack in the musical department for some.""Another Part Of Me"" is one of the better uptempo songs on here,even if it was a minor hit only for him (who know MJ in the 80's would ever have a MINOR hit) and wasn't actually recorded spesifically for this album but rather for the Disney World based 3-D film 'Captain Eo',starring Michael and which few people who never visited Disney World have ever seen say for that MTV airing of it in 1995 or so.It's on some of the non hit material that you really hear the toughness in sound Mike was going for.""Speed Demon"" sadly tends to serve as this albums whipping boy.It's aggresive funk-rock approch is not as hit worthy as most of his music in terms of how the pop world approches this kind of music but it was definately something that seemed to be written based on his dancing style than for the purposes of getting on the radio.""Liberian Girl"" was never officially a hit but was such a great,sexy groove that it became very popular and even got it's own music video as well.It's definately a highlite of this album,for me anyway.""Just Good Friends"" is the ""forgotton"" song here,a duet with Stevie Wonder that.......well lets just say little screams ""late 80's urban contemporary/R&B;/funk dance crossover song"" louder than this. But again the toughness of Quincy's production and Bruce Swediens excellent Acousonic recording process keeps it from being what I once heard referred to as ""tinky tinky dance"",someones description of a very dated and poppy style of 80's electro funk-disco.""Dirty Diana"" is a good tune and an okay hit.I admit it's not my favorite on the album;Michael drove a rock kind of tune home more directly with ""Beat It"" from the previous album but this was okay in a big arena kind of way;the addition of audience noise was a good effect.On the CD of this album you also get ""Leave Me Alone"",a tense dancey-funk tune that introduced itself as one of his first direct rantings about his own negative press. Overall this album puts Michael in a possition where being commercial and an artist of some not musically and otherwise began to become a complication rather than a clear career choice. But no matter how you look at it the album was good enough and successful enough to end up becomming a success even at this point.And how many obvious pop albums of recent years can you say that about?"
1,"After releasing a critically alclaimed hit with ""Reasonable Doubt"" and having one of his best friends pass (The Notorious B.I.G.) Jay-Z came out in late 1997 with an excellent sophmore release ""In my Lifetime Volume 1"". The album is far different then his first, with more full beats and a different style of lyrics. For this album, he was lyrically more focused on becoming the best after the passing of his friend, then story tales of the hustle which were heard more often on the previous album. Not to say all his lyrics were of a self proclaimed nature on becoming the best, he still brought it hard on songs such as ""Streets is Watching"" which lyrics stem to the title, and ""Where I'm From"" which has Jigga talking about life in the Marcy Projects in Brooklyn. My favorite track on the album is ""Imaginary Player"" which has a beat which sounds a lot like one from ""Reasonable Doubt"" but the lyrics are different then what you would hear on that album. Again the title pretty much sums up the lyrics and they are about people who think they are of Jay's status when they are not, Jigga's voice works perfectly over the beat and he spits the lyrics in a nice easy going flow which add to the excellence of the song. Another great song from the album is ""City is Mine"" featuring Blackstreet and production from member Teddy Riley. The song has Jigga proclaiming himself king of New York and the rap game after the passing of Biggie. Jigga also has some revealing tracks with softer beats, ""Lucky Me"" being one of them, and one of the better tracks on the album ""You Must Love Me"" being the other. This song really brings out some inner feelings from Jay, and the beat and soulful chourus add to it. ""Sunshine"", which was hated on for being an attempt at a pop crossover, is actually in my opinion a very good track. Getting aid from Babyface and Foxy Brown for this one was a good idea, they helped bring the whole song together, I feel this song should definetely get more respect. What really makes this album so different from ""Reasonable Doubt"" (aside from the lyrics) is that Jigga decided to make more party songs and all of them are good. ""Who You Wit II"", and the back and forth track featuring Sauce Money ""Face Off"". The only song which is not up to par on this album is ""I Know What Girls Like"" featuring Puff Daddy (P.Diddy) and Lil'Kim, Jigga, Of Course, keeps it thoro on the track but you can't expect much from Lil Kim, and Puffy wasn't great either. The beat just sounds like too much and it doesn't fit with Jigga's style. I feel this album never did and never will get the respect it deserves. Following his 1996 classic is very tough to do but I think he defintely did a good job of doing it and I also feel is gives ""Reasonable Doubt"" a run for it's money. Jigga brought it on this album switching up styles almost completely, a very good piece of work and one of the better albums to date."
1,"The SONGS IN THE ATTIC album released in 1981 did not promote the music Bill had been performing in recent years.  Before the release of THE STRANGER in 1976, Billy had already released 4 albums, all of which had done mediocre or poorly, though the songs on them were first class.  Bill wanted to draw the attention of his fans to his early songs, songs that he held dear to his heart.  At his concerts in the early 80's, he played songs like &quot;Everybody loves you Now&quot;, and &quot;The Ballad of Billy the Kid&quot;, to which some fans reacted as if they were hearing new material.  Joel took these live recordings and compilated them into a new live album.  In SONGS IN THE ATTIC, Bill succeded in popularizing his early works that otherwise would have been lost to obscurity.All of the songs on the album have a harder emotional impact live than do their original studio recordings.  When Bill plays these songs live, they acquire new meaning and life then in a polished studio form.  These types of songs, such as &quot;Miami 2017&quot;, &quot;Los Angelenos&quot;, and &quot;Captain Jack&quot;, were meant to be played live before a reacting audience.  The emotional aspect of their performances give the songs a new flavor that the listener finds pleasing.  Bill and his band play the songs first rate.The album begins with an amazing(minus the sax) performance of the intriguing and wonderful &quot;Miami 2017&quot;.  Bill then handles wonderfully &quot;Summer Highland Falls&quot;, and struggles through &quot;Streetlife Serenader&quot;.  A harder version of &quot;Los Angelenos&quot; is played.  The nearly forgotten COLD SPRING HARBOR songs, &quot;She's got a Way&quot;, and the bitter &quot;Everybody Loves you Now&quot; are played.  &quot;Everybody loves you now&quot;, in particular, is notable due to the addition of acoustic guitars and a harder, more impactful sound.  Also, &quot;Everybody loves you now&quot; is performed in a small smoky nightclub(as seen in the video), which permits close audience interaction.  &quot;Say Goodbye to Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Capitan Jack&quot; are also performed.  The valentine's day song &quot;You're My Home&quot;, is performed, with a particularly more powerful vocal by Billy.  Bill closes out with &quot;The Ballad of Billy the Kid&quot;, and &quot;I've loved these days.&quot;Several notable early songs such as &quot;Piano Man&quot;, and &quot;The Entertainer&quot;, were not released on this album, since signature versions of these songs had already been released.This is a good album for anyone who wants to easily become familiar with Bill's early works.  This album shows the original Piano Man in all his glory.  I strongly reccomend this album for anyone who takes more than a passing intrest in the history of Billy Joel's carrear."
1,"""The Best Of Leonard Cohen"" is distilled from his first 4 albums, and nicely summarizes his earliest 8 years as a singer. Prior to this he was chiefly known in his native Canada (since 1956) as a published poet/novelist. Cohen established himself as a major songwriter right off the bat with ""Songs Of Leonard Cohen"" (1967) - and continued to do so on ""Songs From A Room"", ""Songs Of Love And Hate"", and ""New Skin For The Old Ceremony"" (1974).I think ""The Best Of"" (1975) was his most important album. He gained many new fans that were too young to know his 60's output, and were happy to catch up. Most of the people I know came to Cohen through this - then went back and bought his first four. Their continued devotion has ensured his stardom to this day. Some other examples that served the same purpose: Judy Collins' ""Colors Of The Day"", and Rolling Stones' ""Hot Rocks"".As a late starter (not recording until in his thirties) - Cohen bypassed having any youthful embarrassments. From the first album on he came off as urbane, witty, debonair, thoughtful, and well-travelled. These were the songs of a man who had been around and learned some things. I once read that the writer Gustave Flaubert toiled for days over each sentence of ""Madame Bovary"". It's known that Cohen did the same, and the evidence is here. He's only recorded 7 more studio albums since (for a total of 11), and they are all worth having. His later involvement with Buddhism has only deepened his understanding and empathy. It pleases me enormously that he can still sell out a concert hall no matter where he goes in the world.There's ""More Best Of Leonard Cohen"" (1997), and a 2-disc ""Essential"" - but for me and countless others this was our introduction. Let it be yours."
1,"This album is what so many bands today try to be... an actual punk band. The Misfits were one of those rare groups that, even though there were only three-chords, they were awesome chords, and they made some of the best music I have heard.I have recommended this album to many people who think that Good Charlotte and Simple Plan are 'what punk rock is all about'.DO NOT BE FOOLED BY CHEAP IMITATIONS!"
1,"Originally conceived as three-record set with other King artists, this live recording is his most soulful, partially because it is a complete JB performance, with (reportedly) only two tracks omitted. Whereas the  RELEASED '71 live l.p. from the Apollo was a composite of many shows and is  stronger vocally, here the listener gets more of a sense of an  &quot;event&quot;. Ofcourse it is an indispensible collectible."
0,"terrible supergroup schlock.  If this is their best cd, I wonder how terrible the others are.  mind alteringly dumb lyrics that are mindless pervade this cd, by the official ""prog rock supergroup.""  supergroups tend to suck hard, and I would say that this band blows more than most.  Avoid at all costs, there is much better prog music out there.  I was previously a fan of the work these guys did in other bands before, and I am extremely dissappointed that something so aseptic could be brought forth by them.  Maybe they didn't have that much talent in the first place."
1,Barry Hit paydirt with this album. The hit songs Never Gonna Give You Up and Honey Please are not the only hot songs. My sentimental favorite is Girl its true. A must for The Barry White Fan.
1,"When I bought Four Non Blondes (FNB) back in March of 1993, I thought this  band would have more of an impact on the music scene. Of the eleven tracks  here, there are no bad tracks. Linda Perry's solo material hasn't even come  close the to great music on FNB's debut. This is a must have for any rock  collector."
1,"Continuing the Wu-Tang Clan's saga of sword swinging chambers strikes member Genius or GZA's Liquid Swords.  Wu-Tang's sound provider RZA produced all with the exception of one with the Clan's signature style and sound to fit GZA's lyrical assault.  The album begins with the title track filled with looping keys and simplity, but animated by GZA's delivery such as ""...lyrics are weak, like clock radio speakers...""  Keeping the formula of success and sword swinging ""Duel Of The Iron Mic"" featuring Ol' Dirty [...], Dreddy Kruger, Inspektah Deck & Masta Killa blended the streets with the orient tales.  Genius shows his versitility on ""Living In The World Today"" by combining harsh street with sharp punchlines and wizardry.  ""Gold"" is a hustler's tale with aspirations of having more than what is given to him.  Reality of casualties from gun play and nonchalantness on ""Cold World"" featuring Inspektah Deck & Life is quite vivid.  From Wu's debut album Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) a hint is found on this album on ""4th Chamber"" featuring Ghostface Killer, RZA & Killah Priest is a gem.  ""Shadowboxin'"" featuring Method Man is one of the highlights of Liquid Swords to every degree.  ""Hell's Wind Staff/Killah Hills 10304"" this one verse no hook life of a narcotics dealer over a high pitched, yet well orchastrated organ/keys.  ""...calling all cars, calling all cars..."" for the well knit lyrical content for ""Investigative Reports"" featuring Raekwon, Ghostface Killer & U-God adds support for this LP.  Questioning the meaning of crime on ""I Gotcha Back"" was concluded as an acronym criminals robbin' innocent [...] everytime was a bit short with only one verse.  Produced by 4th Disciple, ""Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth"" featuring Killah Priest does not include a word from Genius, but this scripture tale of soul searching and a higher existance along with ""Swordsman"" completes the album.  There may be something missing for the masses, such as a mainstream or commercial track, but this album exercises your mind over off-beat track to keep your head nodding."
1,"Given Diana's limited vocal capacity and her counterpart artistry in the show business, i do believe she released probably the best album of the '90's when it comes to her career.She chose carefully amongst producers and came up with a solid product thanks to the work of Narada Michael Walden and Jon John.Not leaving Nick Martinelli out of the whole project.The first single off the album, TAKE ME HIGHER, sees ms Ross in top form, then she slides thru magnificent ballads (I THOUGHT WE WERE STILL IN LOVE and I NEVER LOVED A MAN), gets into some R'n'B (SWING and KEEP IT RIGHT THERE - thanks, Babyface), shows some chart action with GONE and tops it all with a great disco cover of I WILL SURVIVE: very good tracks, real nice album."
1,"...If fans stopped trying to play ""Can You Top This?"" between The Beatles and The Beach Boys? Sure, RUBBER SOUL inspired PET SOUNDS which inspired SGT. PEPPER'S which inspired SMILE which inspired THE WHITE ALBUM, etc., so forth, so on, and who cares?The fact is that each of the aforementioned records was a major musical milestone on the road from Rock 'n' Roll to Rock, from the concept of adolescent rebellion to young adult protest, and from craft to art. When one considers that all this happened in the space of about three years, the spirituality of it is overwhelming. 1967 was the high-water mark of the so-called Counterculture, and these are its anthems.PET SOUNDS is Brian Wilson's first and most successful attempt to transform simple surf and car tunes into chamber music. Audacious and yet hauntingly familiar, PET SOUNDS works dynamically to present us with a uniquely artistic All-American sound. While not as seamless as SGT. PEPPER'S, PET SOUNDS avoids the LSD-fueled visionary pretentiousness of that Beatles entry. Whether PET SOUNDS is a ""better"" album than SGT. PEPPER'S is impossible to say. They are both glorious, different enough each to stand alone, and yet they complement each other, being two views of the same musical landscape.This PET SOUNDS release is rather unique in itself, being two versions (mono and stereo) of the same album. There are some interesting variations in music and lyric sprinkled throughout the different versions, and with it's variegated detail, PET SOUNDS commands your attention. Plus, the hits just keep on coming. Thanks, Boys."
1,"1971's Inner City Blues is jazz great Grover Washington, Jr.'s debut album.  The title track shows what would be his trademark for the rest of the decade, adding jazz touches to r&b sounds while keeping the soul intact. ""Ain't No Sunshine"" & ""Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)"" further this point."
1,"Billy Joel's first three albums of the 80's had the advantage of being huge creative and commercial triumphs. All three albums embraced a completely different atmosphere and all had a wonderfully unique quality all their own. One could tell with the wayInnocent Manplayed out there was a possibility he might not be certain just where to take his music next. The fact his 1985Greatest Hitscontained two new songs,one of which was a huge hit it was obvious he was still pretty hot property in terms of commerciality. But the mid 80's didn't always seem to embrace sure fire creativity. So what this meant basically is that someone like Billy Joel would have to work a little harder to achieve the same sort of general success that seemed to come without extensive effort before.One of the things that is most different album this album is that it doesn't have the unifying theme of his previous three albums. It's especially noticable as the album goes on. The first six songs on the album show as much promise as anything that came before it. And even the synth-ska Police/Sting influenced opener ""Running On Ice"" and the glossy synth pop of ""Modern Woman"",the most obvious victims of the ""antieightiesitis"" as I call it of later decades  are part of that promise. ""A Matter Of Trust"" is an okay Springsteen type tune,decent but not as singular as one might be used to from Billy Joel. ""Baby Grand"" finds Billy and Ray Charles blending together beautifully on a song that sounds very much of the 50's Ray Charles tradition. Maybe it's just a little much viewing ofMoonlightingbut the big triumph here to me is ""Big Man On Mulberry Street"",a big brassy jazz number with no other than Ron Carter on upright bass. It sums up a lot of what Billy Joel is as a person as well.Aside from the well crafted ballad ""This Is The Time"" the remaining three cuts,that close off the album including the Cyndi Lauper duet ""Code Of Silence"",""Temptation"" and ""Getting Closer"" just seem to lack musical spunk. All of them are as strong a composition as anything he ever did. But the music,even though again he is apparently trying something new is just a little bit too spare and empty for his type of songwriting. It means that,to a degree there's something of a mild dead spot towards the end of the album. A lot of people might love these songs being here and totally disagree. Probably has a lot to do with the fact that this album is uneven only in comparison to the albums that came before it. None of these songs,even the best quality ones don't necessarily sound as if they belonged next to each other. In a lot of ways this began the beginning of a period when Billy Joel would really begin to lose steam with the public,culminating in a bit of a disappearing act in the early 90's he's only beginning to re-emerge from. Still what's amazing here...is still amazing Billy Joel."
1,"This a a brilliant album from Toni. Beautiful ballads throughout and her voice is so soothing and sultry. My particular favourites are &quot;Un-break my heart&quot; and &quot;How could an Angel break my heart&quot;, but all songs are good. This is an album I can listen to over and over again...beautiful. The 24 page booklet contains all lyrics and plenty of photos of Toni. If you're looking for an album for a romantic dinner or 'something', then look no further. Track #12 though, I think is a trick...it doesn't exist."
1,"I believe the first time i heard this album I may have been 3 or 4, i dont remember. What i do remember is that i loved it. I remember dancing to ""All Through the Night"" & ""She Bop"". Hearing this cd again, now that im in my 20's really takes me back to the days of the 80s, when i was little, and music was good."
1,"While not a concept album such asA New World Record, Discovery proves that Jeff Lynne is a natural born story teller.  It takes little more than listening to Diary of Horace Wimp or Midnight Blue.Jeff Lynne is far more than a musician.  He's a miracle marker.  I've said this before and I'll say it again, ""Any person who can 'hear' those sounds in their heads and translate them so that others may hear are marvels"".  There's no doubting Jeff Lynne is marvelous.  He has the knack and ability to put down on pen and paper the lives of people in his minds and translate those thoughts to music.To quote another album title, Ol&eacute; ELO!"
1,"How many albums can you say that about? With &quot;Bridge Over Troubled  Water,&quot; it's not hyperbole to state that every song is memorable and  marvelous. This is Simon and Garfunkel's last album and possibly their  greatest. Simon introduced horns and brass arrangements when previoulsy  they had been an acoustic duo.Though casual listeners only know the  title track on this album, there is an amazing amount of brilliant music on  this disc. This is virtual perfection from Paul Simon and every song is a  genuine classic. What's interesting is that the hit songs from this disc  (the incomparable title track and &quot;El Condor Pasa&quot;) are probably  not as good as some of the sleepers. Listen to the simple poetic beauty of  &quot;The Only Living Boy in New York&quot; and the driving  &quot;Baby  Driver.&quot;  An innovative touch in the latter song is the faux-race car  announcer talking at the tail end of the song. Another incredibly catchy  tune is &quot;Keep the Customer's Satisfied,&quot; which never got any  airplay but which is quirky and memorable.But the outstanding song here  is the &quot;Boxer,&quot; containing arguably the greatest lyrics of any  song written by anyone in the Rock generation. Just read the lyrics on the  album sleeve... they are poetry! &quot;The Boxer&quot; shows eloquently  that Paul Simon is unmatched as a lyricist, nothing Dylan or Lennon and  McCartney (not even &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;) can compete with the poetic  majesty of this man. Listen to this record and find out for yourself or  confirm what you already knew. A magnificent album!"
1,"By 1982 Adam Ant had ditched his band The Ants and gone solo. ""Friend Or Foe"" was his first solo album and probably his best. Following off the mega-success of his previous album ""Prince Charming"", he and Marco, the only band member he kept, came up with another brilliantly catchy and fun album. Again, in America, unfortunately only ""Goody Two Shoes"" hit the top 40. There are other greats here, and again, like ""Prince Charming"", not a wasted note. ""Friend Or Foe"", ""Place In The Country"", ""Desperate But Not Serious"", ""Here Comes The Grump"", a cover of The Doors' ""Hello I Love You"", ""Crackpot History And The Right To Lie"" are all great!Besides the original 12 tracks you also get an overwhelming 12 bonus tracks, most of which are demo versions of album tracks and forgettable. There's not much difference between the Chris Hughes mix of ""Goody Two Shoes"" and the original. ""Coup d'Etat"" was only okay. ""And So You Shall"" as a demo is funny and shows promise. It's too bad it didn't make a final version. ""Yellowbeard"" is average fare, same with ""I Know They Know"" and ""Gargoyles Are A Go"". ""Good Sex Rumples The Clothing"" is actually amusing and catchy though it sounds like a blueprint for ""Crackpot History And The Right To Lie"".Again, the lyrics come with the booklet and the graphic design and artwork ties in nicely with the other remasters in this series. All in all, another great album!"
1,"Imagine waking up in the morning, feeling a bit tired and sleepy, washing, dressing up, getting into your car, then you look at the CD's u've got, and put this one on, AND THEN YOU REALLY WAKE UP!  It is a great, energizing  record, beautiful and intelligent lyrics (for a change) and a perfect mix  between heavy metal, punk and rap! The guitar solos are just great, very  innovative, but the album is something completely different from any heavy  metal or hard rock CD. I don't listen anymore to HM, or Hard Rock, but I  could listen to this forever! The mix between rap and hard rock is totally  new, imagine a harder and tougher version of Red Hot Chili Peppers, with  very provocative lyrics, a real must! You'll get to the office and kill  your boss!"
1,"Any band's studio output is only as good as what they do on stage...WAR, James Brown, Tower of Power, Earth, Wind & Fire, New Birth, etc., all put it way out there...but, the funk was simply too much.Going to see Parliament/Funkadelic was almost like seeing the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  The fans (funk[Clones]freaks) were there to fulfill the prophesy.  They came to 'Do That Stuff', they were 'Children of Production', they came to 'Tear the Roof off the Sucka' they had to get more of that Funky Stuff...if I've got to explain, you'll never know.  Anytime the Mothership landed, it was the 'Night of the Thumpasaurus People'...you always felt free to freak freely..."
1,"Neil Diamond is a rare gem in the solid gold oldies of Rock and Roll.Neil gained superstardom in the '70s with his bombastic concerts and his determined top 40 hits. But there was a truer Neil  before  thenIn the mid/late '60's, Neil wrote/ recorded songs that squeeked the edge of Pop and Punk. His early recordings on Bang records evoke a time and place. That time of a young man being a believer and the place of the new. Listen! a year period produced ""Cherry Cherry"" ""Solitary Man"" ""You Got to Me"" ""I Got the Feelin'"" ""The Boat That I Row"" ""I'm a Believer"" ""Thank The Lord for the Nighttime"" ""Girl, You'll be a Woman Soon"", ""Red Red Wine"", etc..This is early Neil at his best, stereo and hard to find. Latter day Neil found him on UNI then Columbia, and with each new recording, a bigger head of hair. And less fun.Stick with him with sideburns and no dye job"
1,"Wall of Voodoo / Call of the West: ""Mexican Radio"" was the big radio hit but all the songs here are very good. This is an enjoyable album, but not as fun as their ""index"" CD.  Four Stars"
1,"With the departure of their longtime keyboardist Mike Pinder in 1978, the Moody Blues saw one major chapter in their long musical career come to a close, and, with the dawn of the 80's, it was time for the Moodies' second chapter to begin. Obviously, the band's first hurdle to get over was to get themselves a brand-new keyboardist, but who could possibly step into Mike Pinder's giant shoes? Enter Patrick Moraz, the one-time keyboardist for Yes (he played on 1976's ""Relayer""). Moraz's contribution to the Moodies was NOT to play mellotron as Pinder did, but to add a more synthesized, 80's-friendly keyboard sound to the band. Some fans pondered whether or not the Moody Blues could survive without Mike Pinder, but the finished album, 1981's ""Long Distance Voyager,"" was a HUGE success, both creatively and commercially, hitting #1 on the U.S. album chart. Mike Pinder may be missed, but there's no denying the freshness that Patrick Moraz's keyboard touch brought to the Moody Blues, and, on top of that, the band rose to the challenge and came up with some truly fantastic songs. Not only does ""Voyager"" feature the Moodies staples ""Gemini Dream"" and ""The Voice,"" but also such gems as John Lodge's lovely ""Talking Out Of Turn,"" and Justin Hayward's gorgeous ""In My World"" (interestingly, both tracks clock in at exactly 7 minutes 17 seconds). Drummer Graeme Edge contributes the thunderous, steady rocker ""22,000 Days,"" one of his very best songwriting contributions to the band, while flautist Ray Thomas wraps the album up in a playful, colorful bow with the circus-themed ""Painted Smile,"" the poem ""Reflective Smile,"" and the classic Moodies shuffler, ""Veteran Cosmic Rocker."" With ""Long Distance Voyager,"" the Moody Blues re-invented themselves and entered the 80's with tremendous power. ""Long Distance Voyager"" is one of the Moodies' all-time greatest albums."
1,Luther Vandross is one of the few singers who has a voice that allows him to sing anything and still sound good. Any Love isn't his strongest CD but does feature classic songs such as the title track and his cover of Major Harris's Love Won't Let Me Wait that out-does the oringial.
1,"Elton John has so many classic songs - unfortantely this cd doesn't have all of them. Someone Saved My Life Tonight and The #itch is Back are not included but some of the goodies are here. Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me, Rocket Man, Candle in the Wind, and Saturday... are the standouts. Who says Elton John doesn't have a strong voice? I think it's great and Bernie Taupin's gifted lyrics don't hurt either. Enjoy!"
1,"This collection of EJ rarities is for the die-hard rather than the casual or curious.  I'd prefer to give Rare Masters 2 1/2 stars, but that's not an option on Amazon.  The effort to present Elton's hard-to-find B-sides,  demos, and other marginalia is noble, I guess.  But just like EJ's studio  release, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Rare Masters would've made a heck of a  single record if the fat had been trimmed off.  Biggest mistake, without a  doubt, was the inclusion of the ENTIRE Friends Soundtrack.  Yeah, I know  that Friends is out of print.  But there's a reason it's out-of-print:  because it's almost unlistenable.  Friends contains a handful of Elton John  cuts (second-rate cuts, at that) and a whole lot of sappy, stringy schlock  that wasn't even written by Elton (so why is it included on Rare Masters)  but by orchestral arranger Paul Buckmaster.  I do have to agree with one of  the reviewers below that &quot;Into the Old Man's Shoes&quot; is wonderful,  and I have no idea why Elton didn't include it on the dull Tumbleweed  Connection."
1,"I still like the Beastie Boys' ""Licensed to Ill"" today!  I played that tape over and over on a bus trip to Florida in April of 1987 during spring break!  The lyrics are still funny!  They mention White Castle hamburgers on just about every song that it's so funny!  White Castle's sales must have tripled in 1986-1987 because of the Beasties'numerous mentions of them.  Mike D, King Ad Rock and MCA were some funny fellows from Brooklyn on this album. The basslines on ""Posse In Effect"", ""Slow And Low"",""Slow Ride"", ""Hold It Now"", ""Time To Get Ill"", ""The New Style,"" ""Brass Monkey"" and others have this smoothness to them and have you dancing in a sleazy and sneaky way! And have you moving your hands in crazy, wild directions too!  I still dance to them today the same way at 34 than I did at 17! This was raw, no-nonsense hip-hop here and they really pulled it off!  It's still catchy today!  And the rock-based numbers ""Rhymin' and Stealin"", ""Fight For Your Right to Party"" and ""No Sleep Til Brooklyn"" are still solid, proving the Beasties could rap over loud rock guitars! Girls is so funny for its short 2 minutes and dorky music.  A year before '86, they were the opening act on Madonna's tour.  This album really made them big stars and that's why they're more in demand today for tours!  Their new single from their upcoming 2004 album is so funky!  They still have it a strong 2 decades later!!!!!!!  ""Licensed To Ill"" is still a classic and still funny and funky today!"
1,BUY IT -- juvenile is one of the best rappers--- try 400 degreez as well.
1,"Answer - because they are fundamentally opposed to what the Hall stands for! and they know it! (the Hall that is). It really doesn't bother me, except that my kids are dying to go to the Hall but we WILL NOT until/unless the Moodies are admitted. But that's O.K. Their music lives on in our hearts, so to speak. This album is also weaved together seamlessly by the craft of Tony Clarke. I love this music. I wish there were more bands that were this intellectually honest about their art. It's obvious that the MB's were more concerned with a faithful portrayal of 'what it means to be alive' than with the current party scene, or the current Rock-n-Roll sound/persona. Thank God for that. Pick it up. You cannot lose."
1,"elvis costello is never easy to pin down. he's a punk, a crooner, a folkie and a jazzman all at once. one thing is certain, he is a brlliant artist and a great songwriter, with a healthy pop sense. before costello branched out into other styles, his main focus on the punky side of pop. and this is his most defining moment in that era. each song on here crackles with the tight energy associated with punk, but there is too much tongue and cheek for this be hardcore. moreover, the songwriting is just too clever to ignore, further removing ""this year's model"" from the general english punk movement. elvis was always too civilized to be chaotic and angry, more of a crossed up lover than anything else. this year's model is just a brilliant album overall and should be in anyone's collection."
1,"I enjoy listening to the music on this CD, I respect the man who wrote and performed these songs.  Think about what you might do if the film deal for your most recently assembled recordings fell through?  In addition to that, you endorsed a president responsible for the worst political scandal in post-war US politics.  If that were not enough, if that did not discourage you to the point of despair, in the same year these two set backs occurred, James Brown lost his son in a fatal automobile accident.  Think about what you might do.  If you are James Brown, if you are the Hitman, if you are the Godfather of Soul, you fight back with 4 hit records, 2 soundtracks while constantly touring including in Europe (5 weeks), and at the Apollo (1 week).  Then, if that weren't enough, for a man who, in mid-year, understandably spent one week in Hill Crest Hospital to rest, he released the PAYBACK in January 1974.  The album reached #34 on the Bilboard Pop Album Charts and went certified-gold.  Two singles were released from the album: STONE(D) TO THE BONE (November 1973 #4 R&amp;B / #58 Pop); THE PAYBACK (January 1974 #1 R&amp;B / #26 Pop).  I just have to respect a man who can fight like that.  If you have not listened to James Brown, yet, this may not be the best CD to start with, however, it has some of the best grooves and mature soul funk.  If you are interested in some of the best funk performed by a great band, or if you are interested in the music of James Brown in the early seventies, this CD will interest you."

1,"Wham's 1984 album Make It Big certainly did that for the English duo.  The lead single ""Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"" received massive rotation on MTV and the single shot all the way up to number one.  At the time they were generally dismissed as light weight bubble gummers, but almost thirty years later the album holds up as solid release.  George Michael is an r&b singer at heart and the production puts a nice poppy, glossy sheen over his white soul singing.  ""Careless Whisper"" is a true pop gem with a spot on vocal by Mr. Michael and is carried by a longing, wailing sax throughout the plaintive song.  ""Everything She Wants"" has a sultry thumping vibe and ""Freedom"" like ""Wake Me Up"" is pure bubblegum."
1,"A great singer can make *anything* sound beautiful.  From Enya (whom we can all be grateful for NOT going pop) to Des'ree to Sarina Paris...aw, heck, let's throw in K.D. Lang for good measure...it's been proven to me again and again.  So it is with this collection from my favorite East Coast liberal, Sophie B. Hawkins.She has no boundaries here.  Start off with the straight romantic pop hit, As I Lay Me Down.  Segue into a tribute to jungle living (Swing From Limb to Limb).  Take a break with something slow and sensual (True Romance), and then a little mild electronica (Did We Not Choose Each Other).  She can do upbeat cheerfulness too (Don't Don't Tell Me No).  But perhaps the defining song is Let Me Love You Up, where she...get this...sings in French.  For about half the song.  Okay, I'm sure she had a specific purpose for this, but still...French.  On a mainstream-release American album.  Forget dropping 100 F-bombs, THIS is bold.And the best part is that Hawkins' voice is so beautiful, so natural, it actually works.  The result is eleven tracks that have nothing in common...except that they sound great."
1,"This is one of the greatest Starts in rock history! Along With The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Velvet Underground, Van Halen, and Guns N' Roses this is one of the greatest break-through albums in history.-Make it, is an awsome song and the best song to ever start off an album! 4/5-Somebody, is a really cool song with a rockin' riff its got a great blues swagger about it 3/5-Dream On, this is the greatest song in the word enough said 5/5-One Way Street, This is a classic Aero song about getting fed up with a chick. (Joe and Brad play a killer solo) 5/5-Mama kin, one of my all time favorites and one of the greatest hard rock riffs ever, Mama Kin is the mother of everything good in life 5/5-Write Me, is a cool song and Stevens voice sounds really cool along with the riff its a sure winner! 4/5-Movin' Out, I love the song, the riff, the lyrics, the everything this is the first song Joe and Steven ever wrote and its one of a kind, really it is take a listen! 5/5-Walkin' The Dog, a great Rufus Thomas cover that was also coverd by the Stones and I honsetly think Aerosmith did it the best 5/5So as you can see this album is just as important as Led Zep, The Doors, and yes even Guns N' Roses' first album!"
1,"This was the best hip hop album i've ever heard and what makes me mad is that the legendary Krs didn't get noticed because of his looks, but his lyrical talent is what should be noticed bacause by far he remains the greatest lyrical rapper ever, and some other great lyrical rappers who don't get noticed that much like Keith Murray, Mos Def, Skee Lo and Dead Prez should because they are the revolutions of hip hop, and if the game is interested in looks more than talent, then hip hop is dead. But nontheless, this is the man that inspired many known rappers today, including LL Cool J, Jay Z, Nas, Twista, Public Enemy etc and in my point of view is the greatest rapper alive. So if you like hip hop, Krs One, fresh tracks and collaberations, this album has it all, the legendary Krs One will forever remain the greatest lyrical rapper in the world, no one can reach his level."
1,"&quot;Chinese Wall&quot; is the &quot;solo&quot; debut by Earth Wind and Fire's Phillip Bailey.  It might be a bit unfair to Bailey, but 80s superstar Phil Collins plays a major role on many dimensions of this album.  Collins plays instruments or provides vocals on every track on this album.  Collins also serves as the album's producer and is co-writer of the mega duet he does with Bailey &quot;Easy Lover&quot;  Collins takes his long-time studio and tour musician Darryl Stuermer to play guitars on many of the tracks.  Despite the heavy hand of Phil Collins, much of this album still has the footprint of Phillip Bailey on it.  Bailey's unique voice is heard throughout the album and contributes to some of the songwriting.  For Collins, the mid 80s was his hey-day - he worked with his solo career, Genesis, producing artists like Bailey and Eric Clapton, and even joining Led Zeppelin at Live Aid.This album is a good album, but for a solo album it seems to suffer from 'too many cooks in the kitchen' and as a result, I don't feel there is the type of cohesion between the tracks that I would expect from the album.  There are TWENTY songwriters on this album (including Collins and Bailey in the total) - with a different combination of songwriters on each track.  That is way too many songwriters for an album.  As a result there are some good songs and some weaker songs..  Producer Phil Collins at getting the most out of Phillip Bailey on each of the tracks, but it is tougher to get the cohesion I normally look for on every effort.  A little more cohesion, I would have rated this album much higher.For the most part, this is more of an R&amp;B album and Bailey's vocals shine in many areas.  The most popular song from the album is &quot;Easy Lover&quot; which is the duet between Collins and Bailey - this is more of a Rock song.  Collins riveting drums are clearly heard on this particular song.  It's a shame that Collins and Bailey have not done more duets because there is great synergy between them as evidenced on this album.  The best song on this album is the title track &quot;Walking on the Chinese Wall&quot;.  This song also doesn't has more of a Pop/Rock feel than an R&amp;B feel - but it is a great and moving song.  As it the song it really discusses &quot;Ancient Tale of hidden Chinese Love&quot; using a lot of symbolism.  Bailey's voice is the best I ever heard it - and that goes back to his Earth Wind and Fire days.  Collins has some trademark haunting drums as well.  This song got some airplay in 1985, but never got the type of attention or popularity it deserved.  It's a shame that the songwriters - Roxanne Seeman, Marcy Levy, and Billie Hughes didn't get to have another track on the album.There are highlights with the lesser known tracks.  As for some of the classic R&amp;B stuff, two great tracks are &quot;For Every Heart That's Been Broken&quot; and &quot;Go&quot;.  &quot;For Every Heart...&quot; is a slower track while &quot;Go&quot; is a very catchy song with some catchy lyrics &quot;Life is full of passion; cavier and fashion; Go, go out and play&quot;... &quot;Go, for whatever reason; Go, it's the time and season&quot;.  The song &quot;Time is a Woman&quot; is nice fusion between R&amp;B and Rock&quot; with some great guitar work by Stuermer.  It also contains great background vocals.  &quot;Woman&quot; is a nice song that has the Collins' trademark horns in it.  There even is a &quot;latin style horn interlude&quot; toward the latter part of the song.  The interesting thing about &quot;Woman&quot; is that Bailey uses a more baritone voice than he has ever used.  Collins again comes in with some great drumming as well.  Another underrated track is &quot;Children of the Ghetto&quot; - its a slower, more R&amp;B feel to it.  Collins' drums sound outstanding and have a 3 dimensional effect to it.  This is also a well written song that basically describes as the title indicates - children living in the ghetto. The opening track is weak - &quot;Photogenic Memory&quot;.  Yes Collins has some nice drumming, but it is a very weak dance style song with some computer-like voice by the background vocals.  It also seems to go on forever and doesn't excite me.This CD has outstanding liner notes.  All of the lyrics are included.  Each song has all of the appopriate credits in terms of songwriters and musicians.  There is a nice gallery containing pictures of some of the faces behind the music (this is always a pleasant treat).  Of course, there is a picture of the Great Wall of China even though the album has very little oriental influence other than the title track.This CD is still worth getting in your collection.  Whether you are a Collins or Bailey fan (or both), there should be something for everyone in this collection despite what I feel is a lack of cohesion."
1,"This is definitely one of the greatest live albums ever recorded. I'm not all that into a lot of live stuff, but the Jackson's put it down fo sho. I recommend any Jackson fan to have this in their collection."
1,"Of all the remasters I have purchased, this title undoubtedly has the most striking improvement in sonic quality. The Hurting isn't my most favorite TFF release, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.Even if you already own it, go ahead and buy again...I promise you'll be plesantly surprised!"
1,ted's at his best live and outragous.growing up in the 70's this was one of the live albums you could not be caught without.
1,"It is here that Simon & Garfunkel's folk yearnings, rock & roll upbringing, Simon's flourishing songwriting, Garfunkel's deft & subtile arangements, and the duo's pop sensibility begin to mix to produce the near perfect 60's folk/pop album. And it is here that they caught the world's attention. The Beatles had ""Rubber Soul"" and Simon & Garfunkel had ""Parsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme"".This album sets the tone straight off with ""Scarbourough Fair/Canticle"", a brilliant interpretation of a traditional English folk tune paired with a Simon-penned anti-war counter melody. Simple and sparse in it's construction (which marks most of the album), yet powerful in its delivery. The tone continues through the album with delecate, intricate and deliberate arrangements through such songs as ""Patterns"", ""Cloudy"", ""A Poem on the Underground Wall"" and ""The 59th Street Bridge Song"" (featuring members of the Dave Brubeck Quartet). The arrangements grow bigger Simon's road-weary ode ""Homeward Bound"" with a simple rock rhythm section adding some punch, but not overpowering the acoustic guitar/vocal balance. The gorgeous ""Dangling Conversation"" features a powerful string section with one of S&G;'s best vocal performances, reaching from plaintive to empassioned and pleading and back again in a single refrain.Even the two ""missteps"" here are fun in their own right. ""The Big Bright Green Pleasure Machine"" is an upbeat parody of comercialism, and ""A Simple Desultory Philippic"" is Simon's tounge-in-cheek jab at 60's cultural icons and those ""hipper than thou"" done in a meant-to-be-bad Dylan impersonation.Garfunkel, way underrated in the S&G; duality, is at his best here with one of his most powerful vocals on the majestic yet simple ""For Emily, Wherever I May Find Her"".The album ends with the deeply haunting and brilliant ""7 O'Clock News/Silent Night"", pairing the Christmas carol with an increasing louder and disturbing news report. Although the news reports are of the times (Vietnam, Nixon, the death of Lenny Bruce), the effect is still chilling.Some of the songs here are deeply imbedded in their times, and others are timeless. And nearly all are essential. Simon & Garfunkel created a folk/pop masterpiece, and a perfect Sunday morning album. And they would only get better..."
1,"This is one of the best RandB singers with a soft touch I really did like his music he had so many good songs I really did like Billy I still hear his music on the radio now he sings so well that you understand every word that he says I would truly recommend anoyone who likes Rand B music to definitely buy this album because it contains a lot of good songs from Billy . It contains: Love Zone, Loverboy, When The Going Gets Tough The Tough Gets Going, Caribbean Queen, Suddenly, Sad Songs, and many other good songs so therefore this is a very nice album I really do enjoy this album!!!!"
1,"I have always been a fan of Scarface since his first album. His aggressive stlye of rapping plus the social commentary puts him above the average rapper from the south. This second album has a lot of gems in it which are COMIN AGG, THE WALL, LETTIN EM KNOW, LET ME ROLL, YOU DONT HEAR ME DOE, DYING WITH YOUR BOOTS ON, NOW IF FEEL YA(deep old school classic), MR SCARFACE PART 3 FINAL CHAPTHER, HE'S DEAD and IM BLACK(deep record about police brutality). Filler: Still that n***a, Strictly For The Funk Lovers(stupid filler wher they pretty much say doodoochaser all over the record) and Funky Lil N***a(the little boy so wack its sidesplitting hilarious. Bottom Line: The World Is Yours is a classic that is that any Scarface fan will enjoy. Scarface's raps are still on point, the production was solid and he gave you a little insight on certain tracks. A definite must-have!"
1,"This is the first album by Public Enemy. Though not as political as the albums to come, this is a good hip hop album. The songs showcase the sound of old school hip hop. Favorites are You're Gonna Get Yours, Sophisticated Bitch, Miuzi Weighs a Ton, Public Enemy No. 1, and Yo! Bum Rush the Show. Get this to see that political giants in music like Public Enemy get their start. Highly recommended."
0,"If you like squeaking boys, accompanied by a mostly boring orchestra, then buy this CD. Otherwise, you may hardly wish to listen to more than three or four songs (the well known Ben and a few others). Don't get me wrong, Michael Jackson is a great artist, but not as a boy. Buy HIStory or Thriller instead!"
1,"The best and sincere white blues there is, Erics masterpiece, this and Peter Greens Fleetwood Mac is the real deal. ""Skydog"" Duane Allman plays his heart out here also. One note about the guitar(s) sound on this album. This album was recorded using 5 watt Fender Champ tube amps from the 50's, that is why the GTRS sound big, small amps = big sound in the studio."
1,"Mystikal is back and after signing with JIVE, decides to join the No Limit Records team as well. This sophmore release takes no prisoners with a slicker and more enjoyable release from No Limit. Includes appearences from  the No Limit rappers as well as the track &quot;HERE WE GO&quot; featuring  E-40, B-LEGIT, and MASTER P. Also includes &quot;AIN'T NO LIMIT&quot;  featuring SILKK THE SHOCKER and MASTER P and SNOOP DOGG's first appearence  on the label, &quot;GANGSTAS&quot; also featuring MASTER P."
1,"SEVENTH SOJOURN is yet another classic album by the Moody Blues. On this one, the band seem to be questioning their status as professional musicians and wondering if they'll lose touch with reality, even as they turn in the beautiful love songs ""New Horizons"" and ""For My Lady."" This album is relevant to a lot of ordinary people whose reality focus has been affected by the Internet and fantasy TV, and is a must-own for anyone interested in progressive rock."
1,"Ok i`m writing this review from the perspective of it original release . Yes its the working mans best of KANSAS, It features some outstanding tracks Like Carry on wayward son , Dust in the Wind, Hold on, A song for America and of course one of the best KANSAS songs ever, The wall. I`m not a big fan of play the game tonight and fight fire with fire, but over all I think this is a great CD and for the new KANSAS fan and for the casual KANSAS fan its a must. Its the kind of KANSAS CD you can just peg back and let it flow, its not a true representation of the great band KANSAS is, as we all know it would have included Magnum opus, and also Cheyenne anthem plus lots of other great songs, but i think if it gets down to just one disc this was a pleasing result. One thing, what gives with that rather ordinary Perfect lover ? I definatly don`t think it should be on a Best of KANSAS CD, its an average song that would be better placed on an 80`s Judas priest record. The original release of this CD had dodgy remixes of Carry on wayward son and The wall (they were muddy and they echoed) and it didn`t contain The pinnacle or the live version of Closet chronicles. This was my review of the old original release of this cd. with the changes that have been made to the new remarsterd version I`m going to have to say its fantastic value and perfect for new KANSAS fans."
1,"Those are the only 2 words that best describe the rush of sounds, voices and ideas collected on P. E.'s third studio LP. While &quot;Nation Of Millions...&quot; was a stunning release that completely re-wrote the rulebook in hip-hop, this 1990 followup is easily the most artisitc record in thier canon. &quot;Fear...&quot; works more as a sound collage and sonic painting than merely a collection of hits and filler, as most rap albums still are today. &quot;Brothers Gonna Work It Out&quot; samples Prince's shrieking guitar solo from &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot; over a whomping rhythm section and enough background noises to drive less adventurous listeners crazy. &quot;911 is A Joke&quot; is also another great tune that, deliberately or not, proves that Flavor Flav really can't rap at all. My personal favorite on this LP is the interracial dating diatribe &quot;Pollywannacraka&quot; with Chuck D.'s raspy, deep, drawling delivery coming as a real jolt and his views on dating outside your race may surprise some. Overall, &quot;Fear...&quot; is a lot less accessible than it's predecessor and that's a good thing, this LP makes you think and work a little for the big payoff. This is Public Enemy's real masterpiece, a sprawling, eclectic record that knows no boundaries. Essential Listening."
1,"There are so many Diana Ross Anthologies out there, that one could get very confused about what to buy.  Also, many of them seem to repackage the same songs over and over again. This is, apprently, one of the earlier ones and though I am sure the sound quality isn't that good like the one reviewer said (I'm not much of an audiophile), it is still worth it to pick up for some hard to find songs.  I found my copy for $12 & considered that a bargain.First of all, I am a fairweather Ross fan.  Loved her Supremes stuff, but have found her 35 year long solo career to be very patchy.  Of course, some of my favorites are on this CD like her great, slow remake of ""Reach Out I'll Be There"" along with ""Surrender"" and ""Remember Me"".I was never a fan of ""Last Time I Saw Him"" or ""Theme from Mahagony"" (don't get me started on the movie which I hated! sorry sports fans!)  I thought that Motown tried too hard to make Ross into a black Helen Reddy rather than tap into her Pop/Soul/Jazz stylings.My main reason for picking this collection up was for the generous portion of tracks from her hard to find ""Baby It's Me"" album which I have on tape & vinyl.  Especially nice is her remake of Stevie Wonder's ""Too Shy To Say"".  Also, another favorite is the jazzy, uptempo ""Getting Ready for Love"".  Also, the song ""Top Of the World"" (not that awful Carpenters' song!) is one of her best performances of all time in my opinion.I wish they had put a few more selections from her ""The Boss"" album on this collection like maybe some of the ballads, but it is nice to hear the title track again, along with ""It's My House"".  I hated ""Love Hangover"" when it came out but the song has slowly grown on me.  Also, I like her version of ""What You Gave Me"" along with ""Lovin, Livin, Givin"".So, though I do skip around certain tracks on this collection, I'm glad I own it."
1,"""Hand me my nose ring! Can we be haaappy? Show me the mosh pit. Can we be haaappy? WE CAN BE HAPPY UNDERGROUND!""By far the greatest album released by Ben Folds Five. It is great from start to finish. It's so melodic and harmonious that it blows my mind. You won't be disapointed! A couple of my favs are: ""Philosophy"" & ""Underground"".Enjoy!!!"
1,"When this album came out in 1980, Barry Gibb was the 800-pound gorilla of pop producers--everything he touched turned to gold records and top ten hits, basically because every album he produced for another artist sounded  like a Bee Gees record with someone else singing.  &quot;Guilty&quot; is no  exception.  Barbra Streisand knew a hitmaker when she heard one, and the  result is the best modern pop album she's ever done.  Barry Gibb's wavering  voice takes a lot of getting used to if you're not a Bee Gees fan, but  &quot;Guilty&quot; and &quot;What Kind Of Fool&quot;, the two duets between  Barry and Barbra, are pure pop paradise.  &quot;Woman In Love&quot; still  blows me away after twenty years--it's the perfect match between singer and  song (and I'm praying that some overblown diva doesn't decide to do a  remake and ruin it forever).  The beautifully arranged &quot;Run Wild&quot;  will put a lump in the throat of a dead man, while &quot;Promises&quot; is  a fun, danceable singalong.  There are some down moments, like the oversung  &quot;Life Story&quot;, but overall &quot;Guilty&quot; has weathered the  years well.  And what's this about another pairing between Barbra and  Barry?  &quot;Guilty II&quot;, perhaps . . . ?"
1,"The Moody Blues were a big part of my musical life back in the first half of the 1970s. I had several of their albums, and I saw them in concert a couple times. As I drifted more into jazz, the Moodies sank slowly into my listening past. Then, in the 1980s, I found a cassette set entitled This Is The Moody Blues and have regarded that ever since as an excellent overview of their first seven albums. And, after hearing a couple of their CDs from the period covered by that compilation, I remain of the opinion that it is one of the most aptly compiled ""best of"" albums I've heard.Recently, my interest in progressive/symphonic rock music revived and I tried to find the aforementioned compilation here on amazon. As it seems to be either out of print or just plain unavailable, I instead settled on picking up on CD the Moody Blues early releases I did not already own on vinyl. A Question of Balance was the first as it contained some songs I remembered from back in the day.Well, after listening several times, it came to me that most of the songs and the instrumentation sound quite dated. In the remastering, the tambourine is far too prominent. There are some excellent songs on AQoB, but its clear that the greatness of the Moody Blues lies not in the great quality of any particular album, but in the fact that they were able to mine the same musical vein for so long and come up with a remarkable number of great songs scattered amongst the dross spanning the period from Days of Future Past to Seventh Sojourn.Question is without question the ""hit"" that powered this album. I like the song just fine despite that radio wore it out, but I think the best songs on this album are And the Tide Rushes In, which highlights a new sensitivity in male/female relationships, and the introspective masterpiece, Melancholy Man. I also enjoy Tortoise and the Hare as well as Its Up To You.Though this is not a CD I will have in frequent rotation, its a great one to have at the ready for a ""Big Chill"" type party for folks of a certain age. Give it 3 stars plus."
1,"During the 1970s and early 80s, the Swedish band ABBA created irresistable pop songs and dominated sales and airplay charts around the world.  Their success in the USA, while large, gives no indication of the incredible phenomena they were across the globe.With GOLD, listeners can remember why ABBA was so huge.  Granted, it's all amazingly sugary, but behind those crystalline harmonies, bouncy rhythms, lush arrangements, and gorgeous melodies, there is a measurable sense of melancholy that pervades many of the lyrics.  This blending of joy and pathos proved unstoppable for the group, and though ABBA eventually disbanded, their songs keep rolling along.GOLD is jam-packed with one killer tune after another.  ""Dancing Queen"" with its huge piano runs gets the steamroller off to a roaring start, all happiness and light.  But the sadness creeps in with ""Knowing Me, Knowing You,"" belied by the breathy ""a-haaas"" that punctuate the tale of inevitable breakup.  The delightful vocal arrangement of ""Take a Chance on Me"" may have been the best of their career.  ""Mama Mia"" nearly overdoses on sweetness, which is followed by the entrancing ""Lay All Your Love on Me.""Once ""Super Trouper"" gets in your head, it will NEVER leave.  Days later, you will be bouncing around singing, ""Soo-pah-pah, troo-pah-pah,"" and you won't care.  The lyrics are a bit overwrought on ""I Have a Dream,"" but its sung so convincingly and affectingly...and there go those gorgeous melodies again...that it works somehow.  ""The Winner Takes it All"" is genuinely devastating; an incredibly beautiful and heartbreaking slice of Europop.""Money Money Money"" and ""S.O.S."" are patented ABBA repeating phrase songs...they will have you chanting along if you're not careful.  The rollicking piano-based ""Chiquitita"" plays like a classic folk song, with its soaring, memorable chorus.  ABBA continues in the folk vein with the great, lovely story classic, ""Fernando.""Then, they dabble in a heady Eurodisco/rock fusion with ""Voulez-Vous,"" ""Gimme Gimme Gimme,"" and the mildly disturbing ""Does Your Mother Know?""  ABBA returns to classic balladry with ""One of Us"" before delivering the memorable, moody, simmering, and superb ""The Name of the Game.""""Thank You for the Music"" is a bit of a show-tune, but again, so beautiful and sincere that you forgive the cheese quotient.  The CD closes with the rousing, crackling, swinging ""Waterloo,"" which got their career rolling back in 1974.This CD is a roller coaster ride, not in terms of quality, but it terms of mood and theme.  It all holds together, and it delivers one thrill after the next.  Sing along...you know you want to."
1,"It's hard to believe, but sometimes true that what goes around, comes around.  I saw the Beasties on stage in London in September 1986 (with Run DMC and LL Cool J) shortly after this album came out (they were last on the  bill and played only three songs, including &quot;Slow and Low&quot; and  &quot;Fight For Your Right&quot;).  The prevailing opinion at the time was  that &quot;Licensed To Ill&quot; was one of the most obnoxious releases in  the history of music.  But what a party!  The Beastie Boys seemed like a  one-hit wonder when they changed record labels and took three years to  release their follow up (Paul's Boutique), plus the fact these white boys  were being universally panned by most of the rap community.  But the Boys  must be having the last laugh, and listening to this album again, it still  sounds good.  I am amazed at all the kids that weren't even born in '86 are  discovering this record, which attests to the band's endurance, although  the band owes a lot to Rick Rubin, their producer who meshed the Boys'  brashness with great sound samples.  As a parent I can say that, based on  the feedback I've read here, if you are trying to decide on a music  purchase for your teenager, this may do the trick."
1,"This album is actually one of the greatest of all time.  Stevie Wonder created a masterpiece with 'Innervisions'.  This album is one you can listen to all the way through- there are no filler songs on this one.  All of the songs have meaning, rhythm, groove and life.&quot;Too High&quot; tackles the problem of drug use, while &quot;All In Love Is Fair&quot;, deals with the subject of heartbreak, and &quot;He's Misstra Know-It-All&quot;... loud talkers and schemers.  &quot;Jesus Children of America&quot; is a groovy joint, with a beautiful message- Jesus loves you, get to know Him, and be honest with Him.  &quot;Visions&quot; is a beautiful piece, which talks about looking at things beyond what the eye can see, but by the way the mind sees things; a real mind excursion.  Listening to this one makes you wonder if Stevie sees things clearer than we do.My all time favorites on this one are, &quot;Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing&quot; (which has a salsa flare, and a message about people with hang-ups, trying to be things that they're not), and &quot;Golden Lady&quot; (a song which is designed to make any woman feel special, and puts you in a mellow mood).  &quot;Living For The City&quot;, and &quot;Higher Ground&quot; are the most powerful songs on this disk, but &quot;Living For The City&quot; contains that famous line, &quot;Wow...New York City, just the way I pictured it; skyscrapa's and ev'rythang&quot;!  What a classic!This is a music lover's dream.  A disk with melodies, good lyrics, and full of real life.  Stevie Wonder is an inspiration to all those who hear his message, and will continue to be until the end of time."
1,"For Once In My Life is a very good Stevie Wonder from 1968.  As was the theme for Motown albums from the era, it contains a couple of hit singles, covers of non-Motown songs and covers of Motown songs.  &quot;For Once In My Life&quot; shows off Mr. Wonder's beautiful voice.  &quot;Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Da-Day&quot; is fiery number that has a southern soul style and &quot;You Met Your Match&quot; is in the same vein.  Some other good songs include &quot;I Don't Know Why&quot;, &quot;God Bless The Children&quot; &amp; &quot;Do I Love Her&quot;"
1,"I'm very pleased about discovering Europe.This album is pure metal and outstanding, even better than the Final Countdown,their most famous. Energy-full.The typical metal here is more evident. The keyboard usage by Joey Tempest is minimum in comparison to the succeeding blockbuster. His vocals are more disjointed.The drums here are tuned differently too.This cd has the original version of open your heart ( the newer found in out of this world 1988), the guitar solo is different.Actually,I prefer the remake because it's more enriched.Now I can see why Don Dokken chose John Norum to replace George Lyinch  in his group for a while : his guitaring here, which is worth the price of the cd, is magnificent speciallyin tracks 7 ( 2:28 what the heck???? ),4 ( almost entire song,lick abuse , his fingers don't stand still , the atmosphere here has some rage);5 ( instrumental masterpiece, some finger tapping to produce a ""olun-lun-lun-lun""-like sound );10 ( he sounded like the master Van Halen,check in 2:11 or 2:20)and 6.Most catchy songs : 3 , 1 ,8 and 6.Dreamer is the one I like less , but not bad.In scream of anger the guitar, with the help of a pedal, had a different muffle,interesting. The band likes playing it alive.This album isn't very easy to find, but you can try to download if it's impossible. It's worthwhile."
1,"One song...&#34; Legend of a Mind&#34;, commonly referred to as &#34;Timothy Leary&#34;...buy this if for no other reason. But the story of the journey of the mind to a better place using only simple focus...forgetting all that is unimportant and embracing the now/here is the whole point of this album. Pinder yet again is the star of this presentation. The mellotron, used by others including the Beatle's John Lennon (the opening of &#34;Strawberry Fields&#34;) is used so well there are times you just won't pick it up except that in your deep brain, you pick it up and it a a pleasure point...musical endorphin. Lots of great extras on this particular release, obsurities, treasures for Moody Blues fans"
1,"&quot;Runaway,&quot; of course, started it all. The Bon Jovi legacy that has made it over three decades, despite how all of the 80's haters have tried to scar this band with a scarlet letter of its own. Resilience has kept the band out of the grave, which is much more than the once brutal grunge army can say for their beloved Cobain. Despite the fact that there is a large legion of those who use a wave of their hand to dismiss 80's rock as pretensious, Bon Jovi is indeed one of the rare examples of products as commercially in-your-face as the Big Mac who made it to that point by offering us something as creatively/artistically crafted as a gourmet entree at a prestigious New York City dining establishment.I was 4 when this album came out, and didn't start rocking with them till &quot;New Jersey&quot; came out. I can't say for sure if I would have thought Bon Jovi the greatest thing ever to exist, if I was a teenager at the time. Fortunately, I'll never have to answer that. Indeed, Jovi's first 2 albums, while LOVED by a stubborn (in a good way) minority, aren't like the rest. They're less diverse, not as unique, offer less musically, and just about every song is about women and/or some sort of heart-break; which, as I noted on my Farenheit review, is just PERFECT musical therapy for certain times in everyone's life. Otherwise, though, this album isn't very multi-purpose for you the listener. Still, this first album, while not as meaningful as &quot;Slippery...&quot; or &quot;Keep the Faith,&quot; somehow finds a bit of timelessness simply by being the &quot;classic breakthrough that started it all.&quot;Asides from the songs being generally perfect for rocking out every now and then, the debut's longevity hasn't really been owed to the music itself (I'm not referring to &quot;Runaway&quot;, which was recorded with a different set of musicians before the final group was in place). JBJ himself said he didn't know what he should write, for example if the record company wanted 10 more &quot;Runaways&quot;... which is understandable for a band just getting into the biz and wanting to learn the ropes, but also hinting at one of Jon's attitudes that he still unfortunately sort of holds, that being, always think about what commercially will sell... Take those words carefully, I am not suggesting the band has ever &quot;sold out&quot;, and indeed, this mentality has helped them get as big as they did, I am just saying that when it comes down to it, their first release doesn't have too much artistic integrity (though it made up for it with ambition), and thus it pales in comparison to most of their other recordings. Even a &quot;bad&quot; Jovi record, which this is NOT, can never be any less than good, however, so I'm throwing three stars its way just because even in their early 20's, there's an embryonic emotional spirit that is possessed in these 5 souls, necessary for eventually helping lots and lots of people through music. A talent given by God, and given to few.The songs themselves - the music is much better than the lyrics, previously referred to as being largely &quot;heartbreak lyrics.&quot; As far as 80's metal (though not heavy like Iron Maiden), it is nothing short of awe inspiring to hear David (who would have gone off to Juliard if not for the band) tinkering with ways to put keyboard effects and enhancements to music the way only prog-rockers had previously done. As a pianist myself, every note David has ever played has heavily influenced my take on how to craft music. As for Richie, this is wayyy before he gets self-conscious and starts underplaying, so you get some kickass soloing going on, again, especially for a person as young as he was at the time. The only general thing for some of you to look out for is this album has the 80's SOUND, if there ever was such a thing... so if you are one of those people who can't tolerate dated sounds, you might have some problems. For the rest of us, you'll notice I haven't really mentioned song titles - that's because this album really is very similar, it's almost not quite worthy enough of featuring certain songs over others. ALMOST. Here's my favorites (asides from &quot;Runaway&quot;): &quot;She Don't Know Me&quot; (though written by someone else), &quot;Shot Through the Heart&quot; (NOT the mass hit &quot;You Give Love A Bad Name&quot; that far too many people make the mistake about), &quot;Get Ready&quot; (The ONLY song in a major key on the whole record!!!!!). Particular songs aren't worth arguing over, I've saved THAT for my &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; review!!!This album is what it is, and not much needs to be said other than it's nothing special but it rocks, especially when you're pissed off about a relationship situation. I still think everyone should own this, as everyone should own all Bon Jovi albums!!! Just make this and &quot;7800 degrees...&quot; the end of your collection, so you aren't hit with &quot;Roulette&quot; being your first impression. This album plays a very important role in the history of the band, and it just doesn't feel right without it."
1,"Well, I used to think I would NEVER buy this album because I thought it was going to be just as silly and ridiculous as Caribou, probably worse.  Well, honestly, this album kills Caribou (about every other Elton DJM album does), and it was a surprise to me.  I bought it on the strength of &quot;Island Girl&quot; and &quot;Grow Some Funk of Your Own&quot;, which I originally hated, but grew to like more and more until I felt I had to own the album as a hard-core Elton fan.Well, here is what I think of it; albums like Captain Fantastic and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road will always be number one in my Elton Top 10, but this album is just Elton having fun with rock and roll music.  Songs like &quot;Medley (Yell Help, Wednesday Night, Ugly)&quot;, &quot;Dan Dare (Pilot of the Future)&quot;, &quot;Street Kids&quot;, and &quot;Billy Bones and the White Bird&quot; are great rockers in addition to the two tracks I listened to from the album.  Also &quot;I Feel Like a Bullet (in the Gun of Robert Ford&quot; is the slowest song on here, and it is quite good, as well.  All-in-all this album is the rockiest album Elton John ever did, emphasizing guitars and rhythm and not so much the piano.  So, I think Elton fans are in for something quite different.  &quot;Feed Me&quot;  is a song I don't like, though.  The genius of the album is that it doens't say anything, it's just great rock and roll music, or a party album, even.  Tt is not a masterpiece because it's NOTHING new.  But, any Elton fan who wants to hear what it's like when he just has a good time with music, buy this album."
1,"This ""Face The Music"" was one of the albums I was lucky to get in its LP version, as soon as it was issued and sold in record shops.And, no doubt about it, it shows that back in the 70s there were a lot of excellent musicians, singers, composers and producers.Jeff Lynne, E.L.O.'s frontman, got one of his best creatures in this album.Since the very first tune, the almost dramatic instrumental 'Fire On High' with full of classic and operatic chorus works, mixed with acoustic guitar, moog (synthesizer's grandpa) and wild beating drums, this album is A MUST for every serious Rock music collector.Almost every song in this album is a hit, even when some songs weren't  widely aired on radio: 'Waterfall', the superhit 'Evil Woman', the romantic 'Strange Magic'. This album is one of those you can listen from the beginning to the end, without questioning the quality of the performance or the songs themselves. A-1 for sure!!!!!The remastered edition has a very, very good sound quality!"
1,"Following the excellent Warm Leatherette (1980) album, her debut on the Island Records label which saw her rewarded with more commercial acceptance, the outrageous and off-the-wall diva, Grace Jones returned to the recording studios in early 1981 for the unforgetable Nightclubbing project.Grace Jones second album on Island Records is possibly the greatest of her considerably short recording career and captured Jones at her artistic peak. It features a series of remarkable recordings, encapsulating a multitude of styles such as New Wave, Reggae, Funk, Jazz and Soul. She was again aided by the fabulous production skills of those reggae kings, Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare.Nightclubbing (1981)begins with the curiously compelling, Walking In The Rain, which sets a dark, atmospheric tone for the duration of the project. The hypnotic, trancey arrangements are ignited by a compelling performance from Jones who literally inteprets the lyrics into an interesting spoken interlude. This is one of her most bizarre and off the wall recordings, yet there is something fascinating about this recording despite its blatant weirdness.Jones then delivers what's possibly her very, very best recording ever - Pull Up To The Bumper. This funk-driven track, complete with spiralling rythms, is totally infectious. The lyrics are scattered with double entendres . In the U.S, Pull Up To The Bumper catapulted to No.5 on the Black music singles whilst shooting to No.2 on the Club Play listings. In the U.K Pull Up To The Bumper fell just outisde the top 50 charts though on its re-issue in 1986 zoomed in at No.12.Her cover of Bill Withers ,Use Me has a striking musical arrangement and holds a surprisingly strong and assertive vocal performance from Grace. Her unique version of Iggy Pop's Nightclubbing is a total contrast to the original, flowing with strange, synchronized sounds that was way ahead of its time.The New Wave sounds of Art Groupie is another interesting concoction, but the music steadily steers direction, driving into jazz on the eccentric but undeniably brilliant, I've Seen That Face Before in which Grace delivers both English and French spoken passages.The disappointment of the album comes in the lacklustre version of Feel Up - the reason being was that she did a far better version in her A One Man Show (1982).However the album soon gets back on track with the stomping rock track, Demolition Man which is ignited by tough, thrashing musical arrangements and a red blooded, ferocious performance from Jones who conveys a lot of spirit and fire.The album gradually winds down with a surprise in the jazz-soul number I've Done It Again. This number allows you to appreciate the surprisingly soothing qualities of her voice. Never have I heard her sound so effeminate as she does on this track.Nightclubbing is an ESSENTIAL Grace Jones album. It raced to No.9 on the black music album charts, whilst gliding into the U.K and U.S Top 40 album Charts. It was also voted album of the year by New Musical Express magazine.Ian PhillipsJune 2006"
1,"Rage Against the Machine comes out like the explosion on the cover.  They have some pumped up beats and some lyrics that are great.  This CD may be there best to date.  Not the longest in terms of songs, but they deliver one hell of a strong performance.

1,"I need to purge my mind. Purge it from all those images of Stevie Wonder singing with the Jonas Brothers. Please, somebody tell me that didn't even happen. Please tell me it was the sardine and onion sandwich I had before going to bed and it gave me nightmares.But I have a feeling that it was all too real.Good thing I believe in the power of forgiveness and good thing I own a vinyl copy of Innervisions. A record I have had for the past 35 years. I'm a month away from being forty four so I'm going to let you do the math.Oh, you went to public school.I'm sorry.Here, let me help you...I was nine...Here I was just nine years old receiving an album that had nine tracks.Coincidence? I think not.The spiritual meaning of number Nine is the very height of vibrational frequencies in the number sequence. Nine represents fulfillment, attainment of aspirations, divine accomplishment, and our success to achieve a type of influence over our circumstances. The spiritual meaning of number nine deals with creative power and inspiration; the ability to use our mind, heart and soul to  influence situations and things. The number Nine extends to us an opportunity to awaken and stir up the ""inner gifts"" and express these possibilities out into the world to make a positive, influential difference.Either that or I'm just reading too much into things ---- again.But I really do believe that this recording is purely Divine in nature...I mean, all things are at their root, but this particular recording is  Stevie touching the ""hem of the garment"" and receiving a musical healing that I know has probably helped many a broken child to heal and reveal their own wholeness/their own holiness.So we have nine tracks that each touch a particular area of the soul and even though they may only reflect just a tiny aspect of the soul...the identity...the Self behind the self, they influence the Whole which is the power of redemption...the ability to find Holiness, Grace, and Beauty even in the most tragic and dire of circumstances.I love Stevie Wonder and I think the beauty of his earlier recordings is that they had a definite edge to them and they ""cut through"" and ""sliced"" away the tensions, the prejudices, the hatreds, and the guilt we feel from carrying around these unworthy attributes and they allowed us...and still allow us to drop them at the feet of the Master - whomever that may be for you - and knowing that despite all of it, we are accepted, embraced, and invited to experience True Vision...innervision...and see the All behind the All.Reach for Higher Ground and buy this CD.Stevie, I love you, man...I promise that I will have no more sardine and onion sandwiches if you stop singing with the Jonas Brothers.Peace and Blessings, children of ""wonder""john, `the Light Coach"""
1,"Hands down one of my favorite albums of all time, though even I can admit it doesn't stand up to ""Cuban Linx"" and ""36 Chambers"". Nevertheless, GZA is an outstanding lyricist with damn powerful delivery (you've probably seen him perform ""Knock, Knock"" on the first season of Chappelle's Show, and NO other emcee brings that intensity with the exception of Ghostface, ODB and early Onyx). The Genius is right up there with Rakim, Kane, Kool G Rap and Ice Cube as a master of the microphone. He can rhyme and rhyme all day and kill any rapper with his words just as well as he could on ""36 Chambers"" (see ""Clan in da Front""). The only difference between GZA and 90% of other stellar emcees today is that GZA has the RZA at his back with beats that will blow you away. They can be dark and grimy (""Duel of the Iron Mic"") or perfect for bumping in your car (""Living in the World Today""), but they always fit together perfectly with GZA's intense rhymes and powerful delivery.But when you buy this album, you get more than just the Genius spitting over powerful RZA beats. You get all 8 other Wu members plus some Killa Bees too, and none of them disappoint. In fact, Method Man even goes far enough to outshine GZA on ""Shadowboxin'"", which is arguably the best song on the CD and the first single from it as well.After listening to this album and the other 5 albums that were in the first set of Wu solo discs, ""Liquid Swords"" is by far the best, both in lyricism and production. Now, GZA was never able to come up with a classic hip-hop song like ODB's ""Brooklyn Zoo"" or ""Shimmy Shimmy Ya"", Rae's ""Incarcerated Scarfaces"", or Meth's ""Bring da Pain"" (hell, the closest thing to a classic on this CD was the one song where Meth performed better than the Genius), and that's probably why he doesn't get all the respect he deserves. Instead, GZA is cursed with powerful consistency throughout this entire album. The Source slipped up by not giving this album 5 mics, so instead ""Liquid Swords"" will have to remain an underground classic instead of get the mainstream respect it deserves.If you're not into dope beats and tight lyrics this CD might not be for you, but if you like banging kicks and snares and rhymes that'll make you press rewind and say ""DAMN, did he just say that?"" this album is probably for you."
0,"The best album ever, PLEASE, this album is not even close to being good.  Of the 17 songs on here, 2 are good, about 6 are ok, and the rest are just plain bad. My least favorite No Limit cd of the 15 or so I have (clkose with Snoop's ""Da Game Is to Be Sold..."" album).  Not even the No Limit guests (which oddly there aren't nearly as many as any other release) can bring this up to even an ok album.  Yeah Mr. Puzzleface can rap fast but that don't make him good.  His flow is way off beat and he can't rap either, and the sad part is this is his best cd.  Production is decent, but not as good as Beats by the Pound crew usually is (the wack rapper on the mic is probably the main reason).  Craig B does 6 songs, KLC does 5, O'Dell does 2, and Rick Rock, DJ Darryl, Studio Ton, and Legendary Traxster all do 1.  So when he asks -- Did I Do It?  I answer yes, you made a horrible cd.  Unless for some odd reason you're one of the bunch of idiots who like him or comemrcial down south music save you money and ear drums on this one.#1 - 8 (f/ Master P, Silkk the Shocker, Fiend, Mac)#2 - 7 (about his murdered sister)#3 - 6#4 - 6#5 - 7 (f/ Silkk the Shocker)#6 - 5 (f/ master P & Silkk the Shocker)#7 - 4#8 - 5 (f/ E-40, B-Legit, Master P)#9 - 4 (f/ Mia X)#10 - 7.5#11 - 6.5#12 - 8.5 (nice beat)#13 - 6#14 - 4.5 (f/ O'Dell)#15 - 7 (nice beat)#16 - 5.5 (f/ Snoop Dogg & Master P)#17 - 7 (deeper song)Michael Tyler -- New Orleans, LAcheck all my reviews"
1,"Go out and cop this album. you won't be let down, like most modern day releases. 4th chamber, shadowboxin are just a few of the highlights and many more. The lyrical swordplay is awesome and this cd is a true essence of hiphop. A must buy.rating A+"
1,"Sorely overshadowed by it's predecessor ""Vox Humana"" and the epic masterpiece that was ""Leap of Faith"", ""Back TO Avalon"" is among the most overlooked and sadly forgotten albums in Kenny Loggins's catalog. Released in 1988, it features some really wonderful tracks such as ""I'm Gonna Miss You"", ""One Woman"", the atmospheric title track, the Michael McDonald duet ""She's Dangerous"" and the beautiful closer ""Meet Me Half Way"". This album in many respects is a maturing over the commercial-driven pop of ""Vox Humana"" but even then, it shows no example of the epic beauty that was to become ""Leap of Faith"", just three years after this one. Still BTA is a must-have."
1,big black is just one of those bands that is great to have in your collection if ya want something that has no formulas and if you are sick of the same (...). what this album is  the anti music music album.hosted buy steve albini this one is just full of lofi numbers to cause even the strongest of listeners to question weather this band is insane or brillant..i think no reveiw could do this album justice .so ill leave it as if you really are in the mood for something that is really different and kind of on the page of hateing music in general.this one breaths fresh air for music lovers and musicians alike..at least to me its a breath of fresh air..ahhhhhhhhhhh
1,"Even in the 80's and afterDog Eat Dogwent somewhat unrecognized Joni Mitchell still had her creative juices very much flowing at decades end and to her advantage even these times provided her with plenty of inspiration for her musical and lyrical poetry. There are guest vocalists on this album that range from Peter Gabriel (whose participation is pretty appropriate),Tom Petty,Billy Idol and interestingly enough Willy Nelson. The overall sound of this album does'nt differ too much from the previous album in as much as the synthesizer textures and rhythms that never come to a full concluding point still make up the bulk of this album musically. One difference is everything from the songwriting to Joni's vocals sound very distant here. ""My Secret Place"" and ""Number One"",the two songs that start out this album illustrate this sound very well. The whole idea,pretty much as always is focused on the lyrical poetry,which on this album seems to be a dialog on nearly everything on Joni's mind at that time.""Lakota"" on the other hand is pretty clear cut;now the song itself has a Native American flavor and the lyrics are an equally likeminded protest song and very well illustrated. Joni once released a video calledPainting with Words and Musicand that is exactly the feeling you get from this and the other songs from this album. One song that does rise a bit in tempo,probably due in part to the continuing presense of Thomas Dolby is ""Dancin' Clown"",the only song on this album that relies on something like a beat. Willie Nelson's flavor adds an important tone to the impressionist feeling of ""Cool Water"",which actually brings you into the words and music as a very active participant due to the sounds of both singers voices largely. This completes a decade of Joni Mitchell's musical output that over ten years time only produced three albums which,after listening to this one are all of very good quality. As for the synthesizers and drum machines I don't mind them at all,never did with most people anyway. At least,as with most musical ideas that come Joni's way she uses them as if they were colors on a paint pallete rather than merely to sell a record. I would strongly recommend this album to anyone already somewhat familiar with Joni's 70's classics who wish to dig deeper into her second full decade of recording."
1,"Because each of her albums is a distinct departure from its predecessor, no two Cyndi Lauper albums are alike. I like to think of TRUE COLORS as the record Cyn made in the attic, while decked out in her grandmother's  clothes, changing eye shadow with every blink, and wearing more jewelry  than Mr. T. The result isn't simple and quiet, because its creator isn't.  Rather, it is Cyn at her lovable best: fun-loving and fearless. While each  track is a wild new get-up, &quot;True Colors&quot; is the moment the  masquerade is over. Her performance of this poetic classic is so  unforgettable, you are likely to have a story about the first time you  heard it. I do.As the dead-on editorial has noted, the songs aren't  very revealing, but it is great fun to hear just how unique and endearing  Cyn can be with her work. &quot;Boy Blue&quot; is one of the most unusual  songs you will ever hear. Childlike but elegant, carefree but urgent, it is  one of her most fascinating pieces. It isn't very catchy, but you'll always  remember it. I guess with all of these contradictions, it's no wonder it  failed to chart higher than No.71. No matter. Cyn has every reason to be  proud of TRUE COLORS. Who else would follow &quot;What's Going On&quot;  with &quot;Iko Iko?&quot;"
1,"When a Rock superstar launches a Mega-hit album like ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" (as a double LP, in addition) what to do next?... Quite difficult!  With ""Caribou"", EJ tried to keep his lucky star in the heights of success. However, the album falls short to be the logical sequel to his previous masterpiece. Anyway, it is an album worth to give a try. ""The Bitch Is Back"", ""Pinky"" and ""Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me"" are genuine EJ superhits. But ""Solar Prestige A Gammon"", as well as ""You're So Static"" and even ""Stinker"", are an exercise on a different EJ. Strange songs, but hey, if you expect to listen the same tam-tam-tam and tah-dah/tah-dah/tah-dah on every record you get from your favorite artist..."
1,"If there were ever any doubt about Bob Dylan's brilliance as a songwriter/musician, one listen to Blood on the Tracks would very quickly convince anyone otherwise. Great lyrics, great music, great emotion. My  personal favorite: Buckets of Rain."
1,"This is jus a good r and b album that still sounds good on 9/11/09.  I already heard Foolin Around, Stroke U Up, Keep it Right There, and now I am finally listening to more from Changing Faces.  All of the songs are so consistant and flow 2gether in that loving, good vibe way.  The sounds of the early 90's are precious.  I luv the song ""Am I Wasting My Time"".  I only wish I could find the remix for ""Feeling All This Luv"".  I bought the cd for that song but it's jus the album cut.  I had it on the cassette single for Foolin Around.  Every song on here is gr8, no skip-overs, get this baby.  I got this!"
1,"Elton John's second album (released in 1970) finally established him in  the pantheon of up-and-comers to watch. With Gus Dudgeon's gorgeous  production and Paul Buckmaster's string arrangements, EJ now had a team  worthy of his music. &quot;Your Song&quot; remains the haunting love song  of the ages. &quot;Border Song&quot; is a lush string-and-piano paean to  tolerance. &quot;Sixty Years On&quot; is a stirring narrative with  frightening, sometimes unfathomable lyrics by Bernie Taupin. &quot;First  Episode on Hienton&quot; is the only track that harkens back to EJ's first  album, &quot;Empty Sky.&quot; It is noteworthy for the eerie mellotron  playing, and contains some of Bernie's most ambitious lyrics up to that  time. Elton pulls some new tricks out of his hat with &quot;No Shoe Strings  on Louise&quot;, surprising listeners with an attempt at honky-tonk that  only partially gels. &quot;The King Must Die&quot; is a comment on a  monarch who is slowly but surely losing control of his reign, and  frantically looks for a way to save his skin from those who are about to  overthrow him. &quot;Take Me to the Pilot&quot; and &quot;The Cage&quot;  are decent songs left very much to interpretation; however, they sound  rather dated, particularly the latter track. Still, it is a very enjoyable  listen; the re-released CD sounds much better than the original MCA  releases, which were sonically inferior by a heck of a lot. Finally, the  music sounds the way it was supposed to: The sonics are full and  Buckmaster's strings never sounded better. Full liner notes and lyrics from  the original LP are available in this package, making this a must-have for  any Elton fan."
1,"Note: Janov's work was called &quot;Primal Therapy,&quot; not &quot;primal scream therapy.&quot; THE PRIMAL SCREAM was just the name of his first book! This group formed to save money to go to The Primal Institute, so the rumor has it -- but they became so successful they never made it. But they garnered much insight and probably would up processing a lot of memories/feelings themselves. This is actually quite a bit more musically progressive-sounding than their follow-up album. Love it -- one of the best, most cohering records of all time."
1,"Celebration: The Best of Kool & the Gang is the best songs from a great band.In fact, I NEVER met anyone who did not love Kool & the Gang."
1,"The music magazine Q recently compiled a list of the 100 best debut albums ever.  The Car's debut was NOT on that list.  It was, however, on the Top 10 Debuts We Love To Hate list.  From my standpoint, they were in good company among artist such as Queen, Dire Straits and Boston.  Being a British magazine, Q may have simply missed the influence this album generated since it wasn't that big in the UK (#29).  My Best Friend's Girl (#3) became a major hit but in great part due to the single being among the first singles (if not the very first) released as a picture disc (shaped like a car).  Just What I Needed (#17) barely crawled into the top 20 and that was practically it for the Cars until they stroke gold internationally with songs from their Heartbeat City album.In the States this album would hardly be treated similar compilations.  My Best Friend's Girl (#27), Just What I Needed (#35) & Good Times Roll (#41) became radio staples and really much more popular than their Billboard top 100 rankings indicate.  During its release it was still common on late night radio shows to play whole sides.  The three songs already being hits on side A, side B became a popular choice for such occasions.  The album didn't set the charts on fire, barely sneaking in the top 20 (#18).  With continuous airplay of many of the album's tracks sales were consistent, which in the States matters much more than in most other territories.  It wound up being among the top 30 sellers of the decade, selling 6 million copies, an incredible achievement for an album not even close to cracking the top 10.  The Cars, both band and album, thus became huge in the States.There are a few things special about this album.  At the time of its release, 1978, its producer, Roy Thomas Baker, was in huge demand, mainly due to his work with Queen.  With Queen, the production was full of sound effects and bombastic vocalizations (Bohemian Rhapsody is a prime example).  The production on The Cars is, however, sparse on most of the album (the intros of My Best Friend's Girl and Just What I Needed are especially good examples).  This made the use of synthesiser more prominent in a sense.  The texts were filled with Ric Ocasek's irony which he delivered in a dead panned way; along with the late Benjamin Orr's more emotional approach in singing.  In between this sparse production came forceful harmonies, e.g. on You're All I've Got Tonight and Good Times Roll.  Combined, this gave the Cars a punkish feel, what today would be labelled as post-punk rock.  This sounded very fresh from the typical rock sound which at that point dominated the airwaves as some kind of alternative to balance the popularity of disco.Actually, it is remarkable how fresh the music still sounds today, more than 25 years after its release.  Many groups today are basically doing similar things but now it is viewed as being retro.  There is, however, one major drawback on buying this CD (meaning 4 instead of 5 stars).  The sound quality is below par, which becomes more evident listening to their Just What I Needed Anthology.  Despite being 10 years old, the re-mastering job on that release draws forth the sloppy transfer to CD.  The sound is very low although not being muddled as many other badly transferred records.  This album really could use some re-mastering (there is one available, a deluxe version from 1990 with an extra demo disc; there have, however, been many albums re-mastered originally released later with clearly audible results so that version does not cut it in my books).  Given the sonic achievements that have been done with old Queen releases (the recent 30th anniversary edition of A Night at the Opera could have been recorded yesterday), this album should have tremendous potential in being a major re-release.  Not only would a re-mastering job be welcome but a hybrid SACD version would have the potential of making these classics fresher than ever.Ric, are you reading this?!"
1,"I was shopping at my local record store the other day and fell upon this beauty for literally pennies, so I just had to pick it up right then and there, even though I'm not a huge James Brown fan (this is my 1st James Brown CD in my 2,000 or so CD collection).""Live At the Apollo"" (12 tracks; 41 min.) brings the entire James Brown show from the Apollo back in 1962, yes almost 50 years ago, if you can believe it. After a short introduction, James Brown and his backing band bring a bunch of most short R&B; songs, one greater than the other. Track 7 is a long medley of songs (mostly snippets), most of which immediatley get a huge crowd response. The original 8 track album is completed by 4 single mixes, all of which are already covered in the original album, but ok.In all, I bought this mostly to have a piece of musical history. What a fantastic time capsule this is! The album comes with plenty of great liner notes, which is an extra bonus. And of course the music is stellar from start to finish. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
1,"I have some firmly ingrained memories of Cyndi Lauper and her music from the past. One was crowding around the television with my friends, marveling at early '80's cable TV. It actually had a station called MTV, that played music clips all day! (Does MTV even do that anymore?) We were all mesmerized by this one especially colorful and bouncey video called &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot;. It featured a high spirited, unusual looking singer, who definitely danced to her own drummer! Not to long after that I saw Cyndi in concert. The show started with a swooosssshh!! Cyndi entered the venue flying over our heads in a garbage can connected to a cable, that went down to the stage. I don't think I'll ever forget that entrance! Luckily, Cyndi had the musical chops to back up her theatrics. &quot;She's so Unusual&quot; is one of the cornerstone albums of 1980's pop music. With her Betty Boop-like voice, catchy tunes, and a multitude of 'New Wave' synthesisers, Cyndi created a classic album that is still loads of fun.Its hard to keep straight how many hit songs came out of this musical confection. From the Prince penned &quot;When You Were Mine&quot; to the monster hit &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; to that ode to self-gratification known as &quot;She Bop&quot;, they all are just so good! One song that is particularly special to my wife and I is the beautiful ballad &quot;Time after Time&quot;. This was the first song we danced too (by request) at our wedding. For the past decade we have always considered it 'Our Song'. Yes, this album really does brings back some wonderful memories. These days I still often pop &quot;She's So Unusual&quot; into the CD player. The music is as fresh and lively, as when I first heard it over twenty years ago!"
1,"There are good reasons why this album went all the way to #1 on the Billboard album chart in 1972...The reissue of ""Night In White Satin"" as a hit single at the same time Seventh Sojourn was zipping up the charts, two strong singles from this album both penned by bassist John Lodge (""Isn't Life Strange"" and ""I'm Just a Singer""), one of flautist Ray Thomas' best songs written for the Moodies in ""For My Lady"", lead guitarist Justin Hayward's bittersweet ""New Horizons"", plus his incredible talents abounding on all tracks.The last of the classic ""Core 7"" albums from one of the most admired bands of all time, Seventh Sojourn was the final touch on an incredible 5 year run for the Moodies.  Their overall sound since this era has never been duplicated without Mike Pinder's unique mellotron embellishing their music. This album is a wonderful testament to the Moody Blues, and the glorious sound and power of their music during this time.  It still sounds like music that could have been recorded yesterday, and Seventh Sojourn will go down in Moodies history as ONE OF THEIR BEST...EVER.Now how about nominating The Moody Blues for induction into The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame???  LONG OVERDUE!!!"
1,This cd is like putting two Illmatics together and making the beats better.  This has to be the best rap cd ever.  And that is a understatement folks!This album is so good that I don't see why a person wouldn't have this in there collection at all.  I just can't believe Tupac made this cd in such a short time.  If Tupac actually sat down and planned everything out for this album.......This would be the Ultimate album.But cuz of short time......ah what can ya do?  This is a good album by far though.  The only problem I have with it is that........there is no problem and that makes me really mad.  Peace!!!
1,"I bought this album the day it came out, waiting in a huge line to lay my greedy hands on it. This record was the first album in history to go to number one *prior* to its actual release, so there was a frenzy when it  went on sale. It's difficult to desribe how huge Elton was in the mid-70's,  but he was a God.Initially I was disappointed and thought &quot;Captain  Fanastic&quot; couldn't compare to Elton's more stately and ambitious  'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.&quot; But a quarter of a century later, this  record has held up marvelously and contains a number of little-known gems.  &quot;Better Off Dead&quot; and &quot;I Gotta Get a Meal Ticket&quot; are  exceptional.Another element of this album which resonates after all  these years is the lyrical content. Of course this is an autobiographical  album, and Bernie's poignant, magical lyrics retain the brilliance of that  summer of '75.If you are a long-time Elton fan, then you know and  probably love this album. If you're just discovering him and want ot sample  the best of his glory years, this album is a must have addition to your  collection. Enjoy!"
1,"This cd was great.  It is nothing like Astrolounge, which I bought in June or July of last year.  Most of the songs are great and easy to listen to.  My favorites are Beer Goggles, Walkin' On The Sun, The Fonz, Pet Names,  Nervous In The Alley, and Why Can't We Be Friends.  The rest are OK or  better than OK.  I would recomend buying this.  It is a punk cd, though,  not a pop cd."
1,"This CD was released when hip hop really mattered, and is one of the most vital releases of the genre.  Chuck D's flow is bursting with urgency, and the beats are slammin'.  ""My Uzi Weighs a Ton,"" ""You're Gonna get Yours,"" and ""Time Bomb"" are off the chain!  PE would release 2 more classics before they faded out of the spotlight, but their influence on hip hop is incalculable.  Maybe if some of these modern artists stopped talking about gettin' paid and follow PE's example, the state of modern hip hop wouldn't be in the sorry state it's in."
1,"Carole King is simply an amazing songwriter and singer that pours her emotion and being in each song. You can hear her hurt, her pain, and her hope.This isn't a helpless, ""please come and rescue me"" princess. She's going to stand on her own two feet and try to get through life as best as she can. On ""it's too late"" she says right out, ""one of us has changed, or maybe we've just stopped trying"".I really connect with ""So Far Away"", the angst of being apart from those you love. Sometimes it's distance that separates you - but sometimes it's time.""You've Got a Friend"" of course is another true classic. We've all been there, sad and depressed. We've all wanted someone to just come and hold us, and tell us it's going to be better soon. She has that voice of someone you can trust, someone you can turn to.While Natural Woman is a nice power song that speaks to every woman out there, I still have to vote for Tapestry as being my favorite on this set. The words paint a vivid painting of what is going on in the story, it really is like a musical tapestry that envelopes you.Highly recommended!"
1,"Everyone had a &quot;Tapestry&quot; album in the early 70's.Almost all the songs were played on the radio.If it wasen't Carole singing one of them ,it was  James Taylor or  Aretha Franklin,who had huge hits.I love Carole's  voice,its so layed back and natural.I remember hearing&quot;Its Too  Late,&quot; played over and over again on the radio when I was in school.I  fell in love with it.When you think about it,there's not much production on  this record.Its just piano,bass,and drums.The main thing is the words and  music from one of the greatest songwriters ever.&quot;So Far Away&quot;is  another favorite.Carole goes from Ballads,to rock and roll with &quot;I  fill the Earth Move.&quot; I bought alot of Carole King  records after  &quot;Tapestry.&quot; I've enjoyed all of them,but this one will be played  forever in everyone's CD players."
1,"Move to This by Cathy Dennis was the best pop album of the '90s. How can you not love All Night Long (Touch Me). Such an infectious dance/house track - I still dance like crazy to that song. I really enjoy every song on here, Cathy Dennis only released 3 albums but they have stood the test of time. Dennis went on to be a huge songwriter for other artists but I think Cathy the musician is where she really shined, you go girl!"
1,"The man who taught me my way around a mixing board used Barry White's  ""Let the music Play"" for his theme song. On the wonderfully inventive comedy Ally McBeal, Barry White music was a central theme. In one of the offices I work in regularly this album is in heavy rotation for mellow background music.But let's face it, music that can make a man the size of the late Mr. White into a sex symbol, is the kind of music that can get your sweetheart in the mood for love. This album has most of the hits by Mr. White that you might hope for as well as a wonderful cover of Billy Joel's ""Just the Way You Are""So here's the deal, if you are in the market for some ""mood"" music, you can't go wrong with this CD!"
1,Michael Jackson is a legend but his solo journey had to take off one day. Off The Wall is classic music from a man that has kept us on a roller-coaster for over 20 years...have you ever heard a perfect album....here's on for the ages...
1,"I get something different out of this CD every time I hear it -- for me, the mark of an outstanding record.When something new STILL pops out of the speakers after three years of listening.....well, I know I'm hearing one of the all-time greats.I get the most out of PET SOUNDS on headphones.  Take a walk on the beach at dusk with this CD at medium volume, so you can hear the music interspersed with the crash of the surf and the cries of seagulls.  The music fits right in.  Brian Wilson absolutely captures the outdoor beauty of Southern California in 13 heavenly songs.I won't get into the SGT. PEPPER - PET SOUNDS debate.  They're both masterpieces.  Let's just say both bands pushed each other to new levels of aural beauty -- a &quot;race&quot; that ultimately drove Wilson into seclusion.  One of pop music's finest."
1,"Born Into The 90s by Public Announcement introduced R Kelly to the world. R Kelly later felt he needed to branch out and do his own solo thing. Smart move because he has been on the rise afterwards. Say what you will about R Kelly but he contributed immensely to R&B; and we have to give credit where it is due. A lot of these groups now are inspired by him(as much as some of them wont admit it).Your Body's Callin and Bump 'N Grind(yeah I said it, the hell with corny a** VH1 and Blender ragazine), Its Seems Like Your Ready, For You, Sex Me(parts 1&2) and the title track are what R Kelly excels at: the slow jams. He does fairly well on fast grooves like Summer Bunnies and Homie Lover Friend. Sadie is the best farewell song to a mother that I've ever heard(his mother had passed on). As much as I like this album I cant give it five stars. I Like The Crotch On You is laughably cheesy. Freak Dat Body has a slammin beat and nothing else and Back To The Hood Of Things should have never been attempted as R Kelly busts cornball verses like /""For real yo, you making me nervous/ and Im about to knock you in your teefes/(!!????!!!!).Regardless of these missteps 12 Play is still a great album by a guy who didnt start making questionable releases until the 2000. R Kelly is one of the artists that defined 90s R&B; so you would do well to have this album.Standouts: YOUR BODY'S CALLIN, BUMP 'N GRIND, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE READY, SUMMER BUNNIES, FOR YOU, SADIE, SEX ME(part 1&2) AND 12 PLAY."
0,"Stevie, Stevie, Stevie!! Where has all the brilliance gone? There are exactly 3, count 'em, 3 good songs on this album and they simply aren't enough to salvage what amounts to a piece of pedestrian product and half-hearted attempts at sounding comtemporary. The opener, &quot;You Will Know&quot; with it's simple message of hope and lilting fairlight melody, &quot;With Each Beat Of My Heart&quot;, his least syrupy ballad in years and the skeletal groove of &quot;Skeletons&quot; and it's indictment of liars, cheaters and cover-ups (Corporate America should really listen to this one nowadays) are the only worthwhile tracks here and it breaks my heart to listen to the rest of the garbage that makes up the remainder of this release. Filler is one thing, but this is ridiculous."
1,"Hyperborea(1983). Tangerine Dream's 18th(?) studio album.After indulging and pioneering the way throughout the 70s as an experimental free-form synth-score instrumental group, Germany's Tangerine Dream decided to start broadening their audience by adding in rhythm sequences and a more set structure to their themes. Force Majeure(1979) was the first real one to do this, but it wasn't until Exit(1981) that they started including more than 3-4 songs per album, sometimes shortening their lengths. During the early 80s synthesizer and keyboard technology were rapidly improving in quality, and oftentimes TD was frantically trying to keep up with the pace by releasing a multitude of albums in a rather short period of time. I've always enjoyed listening to their progress in both the sound and technology over the years, seeing as this electronic/rock group has existed since the late 60s.While Exit and White Eagle(1982) both had a really high-reverb keyboard sound, by Hyperborea the technology had evened out somewhat, enabling a more fully exploitable array of sounds to be produced. Also, Hyperborea stands out a bit from the preceeding few and succeeding albums due to its more calming pace, though dark themes are still as prevalent as they had been at the time. Other sounds with cultural references to Middle-Eastern and West African instruments were starting to be incorporated into the music, so the keyboard themes are given plenty of breathing space for variety in tones. At times, the music can sound dated, but it's a bit less noticeable than some of the other albums. The feel given off by the album is that there is a dreamy and deep (sometimes dark, and other times melancholic) air all around, but when a frantic moment erupts from the calm its presence is felt to be contrasting and more powerful. I know all of this kind of sounds weird, but just listen to the album yourself and you'll also notice that the music here is very picturesque.It begins with 'No Man's Land', the track bearing the most usage of this cultural instrument incorporation. In fact, most of the 9-minute opus is made up of these varying instruments. Other reviews here do a great job explaining which is what, so look there for more information. This is probably my least favorite track on here since it kind of drags toward the end, but that's not saying much because it still rules. Then there's the gloomy 8-minute title track which opens very powerfully with a ethereal keyboard melody and a dominatingly slow pace. Over time, it fades into a beat-driven ending section which to me sounds almost like a minor-take on the end of 'Kiev Mission's' ending section from Exit. 'Cinnamon Road' is Hyperborea's only short-length track, sporting a strong upbeat baseline and a catchy melody. It serves as this album's 'Midnight In Tula', 'Chorozon', or 'Le Parc - LA Streethawk' so to speak. Then we arrive at the final track, the masterpiece 'Sphinx Lightning' which spans about 20 minutes in length. It starts off with various synth flashes, and throughout the next 10 minutes or so it slowly builds up from an airy atmospheric distance into a more pulse-pounding rhythm array and strong keyboard line. It then calms down into a more somber and melodic low key, often reminiscent of Pink Floyd. Other instruments pop in at times, and then the song closes with a more optimistic finish, contrasting the dark passages of the beginning.Replayability: Lower than some of the other albums, though it fits PERFECTLY if you're in the right mood for it.Though Hyperborea may not be the best place for new TD fans to start, it's definitely well worth your time to look into once you've gotten your feet wet. Actually, if you prefer the more eerie and experimentally freeform styles of 70s TD, then Hyperborea may actually be a good place to transition the two eras due to the album's dreamy nature. It gets 4.5 stars easily, being that the album manages to last over 45 minutes even though there are technically only four tracks. It's not for everybody though, and some people may be put off by the sound, as indicated in some of the negative reviews, but Hyperborea is a somewhat forgotten and underrated gem in the vast TD back-catalogue. It was the final Virgin Years album after 10 years of collaboration, and so the Blue Years period would begin soon after (from Poland(1984) all the way up to Tyger(1987)). Find them cheap online somewhere due to the fact that the old and remastered cd editions seem to be out of print in most stores. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO TD FANS.Other atmospheric TD albums:-Phaedra(1974), Rubycon(1975), Stratosphere(1976), Force Majeure(1979), and Tangram(1980)If you prefer 80s-styled TD, then get:-Exit(1981), Thief(1981), White Eagle(1982), Logos(1982), Poland(1984), Le Parc(1985), Underwater Sunlight(1986), and Tyger(1987)"
1,"The first time I ever heard of Helmet was when I heard their song &quot;Unsung&quot; on the radio years back. I finally picked up this album, and quite frankly, I was a bit surprised. I was expecting more songs that featured guitarist/vocalist Page Hamilton singing with his unique voice. This didn't really happen, because for the majority of this album, he's screaming his brains out. When I realized this, I thought I was listening to something from Biohazard (he sounds a bit like Biohazard's bassist/co-vocalist Evan Seinfeld.) Because of this, I wasn't too pleased with the album. But, after the second listen, I quickly warmed up to the record and accepted what I heard. Needless to say, it wasn't too much of a stretch.Most importantly, the album is a spellbinding smorgasbord of aggressive, sludgy metal, addictive beats and some pretty odd and unpredictable tempo shifts. The production is somewhat hollow, which gives the album a raw, intense and 'in your face' aura. The lyrics are violent, angry and thought-provoking. But, here's the interesting catch -- no matter how loud, bludgeoning, enraged, explosive and intense it gets, the band manages to pull all of this off - without using a single word of profanity (I'm not kidding.) All of the above things are so impressive, this should make many alternative and metal acts very ashamed of themselves.&quot;In The Meantime&quot; begins with some distortion before kicking into a mid-tempo slice of vitriol. &quot;Ironhead&quot; features a steady, funky rhythm, fronted by some stop/start guitar crunch, and later some raw, rampaged soloing. The main groove is voraciously addictive. &quot;Give It&quot; features some polyrhythms in the very beginning, before giving way to a slow, steady Sabbath-esque guitar dirge. &quot;Unsung&quot; was probably the track that turned some into Helmet fans. Page Hamilton sings (as opposed to screaming) on this one, as well as a few more tracks on here. &quot;Turned Out&quot; features a tricky rhythm which can confuse some listeners on first try. Other than that, the track is one you'll love to bang your head to.I realized I covered only half the album, but, the aforementioned descriptions pretty much describe the atmosphere of the whole album. At just under 37 minutes, there's more than enough aggression, rage, volatility and groove to keep headbangers satisfied. If you like bands like Biohazard, Tool and/or Rage Against The Machine - without all the profanity, but just as much intensity, check this album out. Witness one of the underground bands who influenced much of the alternative/metal scene from 1992 and on."
1,"Sonny Rollins is one of the elite, towering figures of jazz history. He is also one of the best and most important saxophone players of all time, along with John Coltrane and Charlie Parker. Anyone who has played saxophone has been somehow influenced by Sonny Rollins. The title of this landmark album, Saxophone Colossus, is a very suitable title. Rollins doesn't always get the credit he deserves, due to the fact that Coltrane came around soon after Rollins' success. Sonny Rollins, however, was and still is an incredibly important figure in jazz.Saxophone Colossus is the album that catapulted Sonny Rollins to this level. This was his first success and was a huge success. Saxophone Colossus remains one of the greatest and most important albums in jazz history. It is essential to every and any jazz fan. The music on this album is way ahead of its time. Recorded only in 1956, this album sounds like it was recorded in the mid sixties. It is incredible that Rollins made this album before hearing some of John Coltrane's and Miles Davis' albums of the early and mid sixties.One of the reasons why this album came out so well is due to the great band. This incredible quartet had Sonny Rollins on tenor sax, Doug Watkins on bass, Tommy Flanagan on piano, and legendary drummer Max Roach. In fact, Rollins sax is the only brass instrument on the album. With the other three musicians working as an incredible rhythm section complimenting Rollins playing, you have nothing else to do but to sit in marvel at his playing.Besides having a great band, the five songs on this album are all incredible. St. Thomas is the obvious highlight, and has know ecome a jazz standard. You Don't Know Waht Love Is serves as the ballad of the album, and an incredible one at that. Strode Rode is another brilliant song, as is Moritat, which later served as the basis for Mack The Knife. The final song, Blue 7, is amzing, easily one of the best on the album.Not only is this an essential album to listen to, but I guarantee that you will listen to it over and over again."
1,Including the hit song 'Around The World' This album came out for my graduation from Art and Design school in 1996.
1,"Your enjoyment of 'Hydra' depends greatly on which version of Toto you prefer.Are you more of a fan of the psychedelic,fusion-inflected prog rock side of Toto or the soulful,poppy and at times even funky stylings heard on tunes like ""Georgy Porgy"" and ""Africa""?Personally I fit into the latter type of listener. As one reviewer point out this is a darker,surreal ""concept"" album with a lot more spikey rock influences then on the debut. As for my favorite music style of Toto that can be found in ""99""-now it's in keeping with the darker Pink Floyd-esque concept but the style is more fusion then prog rock so it definately has more a musical appeal for my ears. My favorite tune on the album has to be ""Mama"",which not only emphasizes Toto's jazz backround but it sure would sound great right alongside Steely Dan's ""Babylon Sisters"" from about the same time. So why are those the only tunes I mentioned? Well the others while well performed have this feeling of fitting into any prog rock album by an ELP or Styx album of the same period. Luckily one thing that all the progressive rockers had in common (especially Toto and Rush) were that the musicians within the band were all extrodinarily talented,even if they all too often felt the need to show those talents off-one of the main complaints detractors of prog rock will tend to have. But at the very least Toto weren't afraid to mix it up a bit,"
1,"Don Henley is truly a great singer, and this album does not dissappoint.He definitely has his own style. This has some absolute gems on it."" The Boys of Summer"" is a classic all time song. The perfect hit song that is timeless."" Sunset Grill"" is also great and "" Driving with your eyes closed""This is a mainstream album, and many music fans would enjoy Henleys workTop music!"
1,"The 2nd album from Elton John is the one where he first made an impact on the music world. There are two standards on this album 'Your Song' and 'Border Song'. Both are great songs. Sadly Your Song has been overplayed a bit over the years, but listening to the original version of Border Song again recently I was struck by the simple production, and its great gospel feel.'Sixty Years On' and 'Take Me To The Pilot' remain two of the songs that Elton still plays in concert to this day and any fan will know these. A couple of the remaining tracks are perhaps are not up to quite the same standard, but I like them all. The string arrangements by Paul Buckmaster set Elton's early albums apart from his more comercially successful albums and give this album a unique feel.The 3 bonus tracks are well worth having. My favourite of these is 'Rock 'n' Roll Madonna'. A rare straight rock n roll track from Elton with an artificial live feel and Jerry Lee Lewis/Leon Russell influenced Piano solo. The remastered sound is good and the new sleeve notes give quite a lot of useful background information. This is well worth getting."
1,"I must warn all r and b fans who haven't listened to this album in full: THE MAJORITY OF THE SONGS ARE QUITE SLOW!!That's really no exaggeration. Apart from &quot;Come On Over here&quot; and &quot;You're Makin Me High&quot;, every song's a ballad.Luckily that doesn't bother me in the slightest but I know some people dislike slow songs.The reason the album sounds so smooth and soulful is because it's produced by legendary Babyface. And obviously Toni's not a bad singer!&quot;There's No Me Without You&quot; and &quot;How Could An Angel Break My Heart&quot; are the stand out tracks but I really dislike &quot;Talking In His Sleep&quot;, it's just so plain and boring!Everyone knows &quot;Un-break my heart&quot;, a stunning ballad penned by none other than Diane Warren and most people know &quot;I Don't Want To&quot;, an R Kelly written delight.&quot;Let It Flow&quot; is probably my personal favourite because it's so beautiful!Babyface and Kenny G (on track 6) really boost the album's quality and I think Toni can sing a ballad just as good as Mariah or Whitney."

1,"I can't say enough good things about this album. Preliminary warning: if you're not tuned into Donovan's world, philosophy, and mindset, this album will probably seem uninteresting, unexciting, and childish. But if you're in the mood and you *are* tuned into Donovan's cozy world of nature, friends, gypsies, hoboes, babies, love, and in general an appreciation for the small things in life, it's absolutely outstanding. The way I got tuned into this music was from a songbook of Donovan songs: after reading the lyrics and actually playing the songs myself, I developed a profound appreciation of every single song on this album. In my days of hitchhiking and riding busses into natural coastal areas, these songs would run around my head and in time I learned to play every single song here on guitar. Every single song here has some subtle but very appealing hook if you listen carefully: a cool jazzy bass intro, a beautiful acoustic guitar riff, lyrics from Shakespeare, poetic imagery of the underworld, contrary motion in the lines of a piano riff, a call to environmentalism, analogy of children with flowers, the charm of old friends far away, human qualities in starfish, rock 'n' roll chords played quietly on organ in contrary motion to a melody, an interesting flute embellishment, the contrast between the world of children and adults, several poems with beautiful beach imagery, poems of married love and the eccentric husband, the pain of faithfulness, glimpses into life on the lam, psychedelic contemplation of colors, images inside a forest, ad infinitum. Absolutely charming.  Many of these songs have strong imagery of places in Europe. For example, while staying at an inn in Germany, the innkeeper told my sister that Donovan's lyrics about the &quot;flower pot on a window sill&quot; (in &quot;Skip-A-Long Sam&quot;) were written about their inn. Similar imagery arises from lyrics about sheep, English &amp; Flemish geographical names, magpies, etc. The only song I know that got radio play was &quot;Wear Your Love Like Heaven.&quot; The rest reside in their own special world."
0,"....George's Sound is Okay, but he's essentially a one hit wonder. For true fans only."
1,"The reason this album gets 5 stars, is because most of the people that have reviewed it know their 'Hard Rock' history, and what else was coming out of the Eighties, especially during the time of this album. In 1982, you had Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath (w/Dio), Van Halen, Rainbow, Motorhead, The Scorpions, a whole ton of Metal, and Psuedo-Metal bands proliferating the airwaves. This was before of course, the Poison's, Warrant's, Motley Crue's, Skid Row's, Bon Jovi's, Ratt's, Slaughter's, Cinderella's and such. There's a gap between these two styles of Jeans and No Shower Metal, and Hairspray and Glitter Metal.And in-between these two you had this album.This album is literally one of a kind for its time, and quite literally bridges that 'unknown' gap between fringe-metal, enjoyed by guys with no girlfriends but a keg of beer at the ready, and pop-metal, where all those guys could go and check out the girls who thought the lead singer had better hair than any other girl they knew. This is why this album is important, one of a kind, and so celebrated. It is quite frankly, the Holy Grail of Hard Rock albums.And it possessed two very talented people, for one time only, captured on wax/plastic. To have Pat Thrall, who is a very diverse and skilled guitarist, who's tenure with Automatic Man and the Pat Travers Band got him nominated Best Guitarist of 1980, would be enough for something. But to have Glenn Hughes is another matter altogether. In Glenn Hughes, you have one of the best vocalists to come out of Britain. A man who could sound as 'Negro' as Stevie Wonder, but satisfy every 'Caucasian' requirement to 'Rock'. His voice is quite literally, a reason to purchase this album and give it half a chance.When I say this album is one of a kind, I mean that it sounds nothing like any other album in the genre. It is unto itself, and that is why it takes some patience, an open mind, and understanding that not all music is going to hit you straight away. Especially when Hughes and Thrall were creating something people weren't quite ready for yet, that gap between what is Motorhead, and what is Def Leppard circa 1987. There is nothing as completely heavy as Motorhead on this album, nor is there anything completely Pop as Def Leppard at their height. But you do find something in-between these two on this album, which is why it may only have a few reviews, but it receives 5 stars almost every time.The people that vote for this album, know how important this one is, and that nothing sounds quite like it in all of that genre. And that is why it's still celebrated as much as it is. I have friends who react to me owning Hughes/Thrall like it's a great missing piece to a puzzle, because for a long time it was a very hard album to find. You actually had to travel to get it in some circumstances. Like I said, it is almost like the Holy Grail of Metal albums.If you already a fan of Glenn Hughes, then this album shouldn't be too hard to digest, because this is one of his best vocal albums, no matter his state of affairs at the time. Every track is Hughes singing his *** off, especially First Step Of Love, and Muscle & Blood. But what's behind all of these songs is music that is never quite metal, but never quite commercial or formulaic pop. It has touches of both, but never enough to be one or the other, nor is each song 'targeted' for somewhere or someone. It sounds more like Hughes and Thrall were just writing to see what came out, and that sound came across so strongly on this album, that that shines through more than whether one can ask 'Is This Metal, or Is this Pop?'It wasn't market research or an image that made this album, it was two people working together with others, and making something that, as I'll restate again, is one of a kind in Music / Rock History. It's the benchmark of a hundred albums that came after it, one just has to be familiar with how much in it's sound did it pre-date all of those Pop Metal bands that were effectively put to rest by Alternative and Rap/Hip Hop.I recommend this album simply because of this one of a kind status it has. I can think of a number of one of a kind albums that I own, that can be counted on one hand. There's Talk Talk's ''Laughing Stock'', Kate Bush's ''The Dreaming'', and the Hughes/Thrall album. Strange company to put it in, but I've owned this album for years and years, and I still haven't heard anything like it yet. It's either one or the other, someone does what you expect, and if it sells, they keep doing it. But not quite like this."
1,"It seems as if the debut No Doubt record was not a big seller.  How I will never know as the high energy rhythms combined with creative horn and keyboard arrangements make it a very enjoyable listen.  The tunes are extremely ear friendly.  Trapped In The Box is probably the most familiar tune as I just love Gwen Stefani's power and range.Many other highlights exist as well.  Sad For Me actually has some unusual klezmer influences with the quirky organ/accordion mixed in with the brass. The brass is very prominent on Doormat.  The gutiar stylings and drumming mix very well on that track as well as several others. Paulina is another noteworthy track.  Love the vocal harmonies and arrangment here.I could go on and on about the different songs but the overall sound is so refreshing.  Mix in some new wave drive, some delightful ska styled horns, some catchy melodies with some varying special effects and you have a delightful CD."
1,"Dropped in late 1982 nobody would have expected the boy wonder from the Jackson 5 to blow up and become the most famous man in the world i sure didn't this album won 8 grammys in 1984 and MJ had the whole world in a daze, fans from all ages and races waiting to see this man perform, so when he did perform it was one to remember which he did most famously at Motown 25 in 1983 to introduce is trademark move called The ""Moonwalk"" from there he soared higher than any black artist before him his videos where always shown on BET, MTV, VH1 etc... You name it he was on there, 7 singles were released with ""Billie Jean"" being the most famous and signature song of his career ""Beat It"" changed music forever ""Thriller"" a 13 minute short film was released and the rest is history ""Human Nature"" always a fan favorite and always played on radio ""P.Y.T."" another top 10 hit for mr. Jackson ""Wanna Be Startin Somethin"" 6 min of pure funk should have made a video for this song ""The Girl Is Mine"" i never liked this song shouldn't have made the album imo those where the 7 singles released out of 9 songs ""Baby Be Mine"" track #2 from the album i like this song alot ""The Lady In My Life"" closes the album well and has been sampled many times you'll know why when you listen MJ tears this song up. Thriller remains the biggest selling album of all time for good reason and will remain so until the end of time."
1,"There are a handful of artists who are true geniuses and transcend the ordinary performer.  Teena Marie is one of those whose talent far outclasses most of her time and beyond.  When this &quot;sister&quot; first  exploded on the scene two decades ago, she was welcomed as a pioneer, an  innovator, a revolutionary, and just one good singer.  Time has not  lessened her place in musical history.  &quot;Irons in the Fire,&quot; with  its opening track &quot;I Need Your Lovin'&quot; still packs a soulful  punch!  The girl, who plays various instruments, does her own backgrounds,  writes her own words and music, also possesses one powerful vocal  instrument. She ranks up there with Aretha and Patti as one who can send  chills up one's spine!"
1,"When this cd came out in 1991, the public (I admit, me too) was givin' Michael a really hard time because of his very dramatic skin lighting (started between the Victory Tour and Bad Album), wierd choice of wardrobe (unlike the simple sequin jacket and white glove, he switches to ace bandages, boot buckles, and 99 cent store tattered wife-beaters - lol), wacky hairstyle (thats why the jherri curl was a disaster), his strong desire for lil' boys (why he bulit the Neverland Ranch of which got him into tons of trouble), and might I add the ""Black and White"" video that was chopped off in half after several complaints about him masterbating and breakin' windows and stuff on the street scene.  Because of that, America did not give the Dangerous album a chance.  Although I consider this album to be mediocre, but I admit, I love most of his fast-paced Teddy Riley penned cuts (""Jam"", ""In The Closet"", ""She Drives Me Wild"", ""Remember The Time"", and ""Can't Let Her Get Away"").  The only number one pop song off the album, ""Black and White"" was good, but I admit that the video really sucked.  The other tracks were either mediocre or sucked big time.  The main flaw about this album is that its too filling.  Its stuffed with many crappy cuts such as ""Give In To Me"" and the boring ""Will You Be There.""  Off The Wall, Thriller, and Bad were only less than 50 minutes each.  Dangerous exceeds the limit to about nearly 75 minutes long and the fillers prove the mediocricy.  Not bad album, but this album and his future releases are too filling.  Appearance does'nt make the music.  Michael does and this showed a good effort, despite what was going on with him around 1991-93."
1,"As a hard core Bee Gees fan, I would think this item was excellent anyway.  I have the original release and I was very surprised to hear this re-issue.  It has the original album in both mono and stereo which makes for good listening.  Although a very early Bee Gees release, this sounds just as fresh today as it did back then.  I really loved the 2nd disc in this item.  It has some alternate mixes and some unreleased tracks.  Apparently the Bee Gees did a couple of Coke commercials which are included on the 2nd disc.  If you're as big a Bee Gees fan as I am, then you will want to have this reissue."
1,"This is actually one of the most relaxing albums I've ever heard. &quot;Pink Moon&quot; is ideal for 3am listenings, when the world is quiet and still and you want to be alone with your thoughts. The gorgeous title track, &quot;Place To Be&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Horn&quot; are my current favorites, but everthing here is so beautifully sung and simply played, singling out any favorites is kind of beside the point. One can actually hear Drake slowly coming unraveled emotionally as he sings (and sometimes mutters) his disquieting and somewhat caustic lyrics. The fact that he died not long after this was released adds a certain poignance to these proceedings, but one leaves away from &quot;Pink Moon&quot; feeling refreshed and invigorated, sort of like having a new lease on life. Just dim some lights, lie down on a big fluffy pillow and let Nick take you by the hand and lead you into the ether.....you'll never be the same again.Bonus; the guitar playing here is a marvel of simplicity!R.I.P. NICK DRAKE, you were a visionary."
1,"I guess that by now saying that you love music and not be fond of ""Pet Sounds"" is almost a paradox since Brian Wilson's skywritten testament embodies everything that's good about pop music:excellent tunes,lyrics,vocal harmonies and even some flourishes to add a wonderful,dreamy and lush feel to it all.""You still believe in me"",""God only knows"" and ""I know there's an answer"" are certainly among my favorite songs and added proof that good music towers through the decades without losing a trace of its greatness-""Forever Changes"",""Odessey and Oracle"" and ""Pet Sounds""will always be great,come what may."
1,"This cd sure doesn't need any introduction. However, of the 5 full length studio albums by Michael, Thriller is the one to start with. Why? For starters, Off The Wall sounds terribly dated now and doesn't have a solid  compilation of songs. Bad was quite good, but you could get that after you  get Thriller. Dangerous was only okay--at 14 tracks there were some very  repetitive sounds and the disc was very long--overly long. What about  HIStory? The hits disc was missing key tracks and the new disc was, again,  way too long at 15 tracks, and not all of the tracks were superior. So, it  is Thriller you should buy first. Not only is it the biggest selling album  in history, 7 of the 9 tracks were hits. Remember the days when an artist  would have at least 5 songs of one album--not like many of today's  one-hit-wonderfuls. I don't even need to defend this cd, everyone knows  it's great. Does is sound dated? Well, yes, it's 18 years old now and  Michael set a trend in music back then that is no longer  &quot;happening&quot; with today's music, though you can hear echoes of it.  This cd is a must for any serious music fan."
1,"This release reflects the creative minded artist roster that STAX created during it's heyday. The concept was right and the music is quite inspiring on this collection,theirs not much that can be said that has'nt already about this 1970 classic,however I would like to add that although Booker T Jones was and still is one of the grooviest Hammond B-3 players around he is also a very underrated Blues Pianist as he has displayed throught his career. Anyone interested in more STAX should check out oneline(or visit as I have) the STAX museum in Memphis,check out their website."
1,"I've been a fan of Diana Ross pretty much all my life, from her days in The Supremes to her very successful solo career. So imagine my surprise and delight when I found that the 1993 boxed set ""Forever Diana: Musical Memoirs"" was still in print. When I saw it, I knew I had to buy it. Four discs of pure Diana spanning 30 years of music.Disc 1 is from her early days in The Supremes. This disc has pretty much every big hit they ever had, including ""Where Did Our Love Go"", ""Baby Love"", ""Stop! In The Name Of Love"", "" I Hear A Symphony"", ""You Can't Hurry Love"" and ""Someday We'll Be Together"" as well as lesser known tracks like ""In And Out Of Love"", ""Nothing But Heartaches"", ""Forever Came Today"" and ""I'm Livin' In Shame"". Also included is a rare cover of Sam Cooke's ""You Send Me"" featuring Ross's breathtaking vocal work.Disc 2 is my least favorite. The best reason to listen to this disc is for the great hit singles like ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" and ""Love Hangover"", to name a few. Other than that, a pretty weak disc.Disc 3 starts off with a personal favorite, 1979's ""The Boss"". This song has everything you could possibly want in a great dance song: swirling violins, a pumping bass, a great beat and Ross's beautiful vocals. I would've personally liked if they had included the seven - minute version, but it's still a great song. The work from 1980's ""diana"" is the strongest on this disc from any album of this period (1979 - 86). ""Upside Down"" and ""I'm Coming Out"" remain great anthems to this day at any party. ""It's My Turn"" is one of my all time favorites, with Diana giving one of her strongest performances ever. ""Endless Love"" may be schmalty to some, but to me it's an endearing and enduring love song that has certainly stood the test of times. I'm glad that the producers included my favorite Diana song of all time, her 1982 cover of ""Why Do Fools Fall In Love"". The rest of this disc isn't as great as the first half, but they are still very good songs (esp. ""Muscles"" and ""Missing You"").Disc 4 starts off with five throwaway live tracks, so I'll start off with track six. ""Workin' Overtime"" is a great hip hop number that shows even a veteran like Diana can go up against the likes of Run DMC and M.C. Hammer. ""This House"" is a nice ballad and in my opinion could be a big hit today. Then comes four tracks from my favorite recent Diana album, 1991's ""Force Behind The Power"". First comes the Stevie Wonder - penned title track, which is another great hip hop number. Then comes the lush ""When You Tell Me That You Love Me"". With an impassioned vocal by Diana and a killer guitar solo, this is one of my favorites. Next, I am glad I can say that my favorite song from the 1990s' by Diana is on this collection. ""One Shining Moment"" is a somber, soothing love song with sparse instrumentation and a beautiful Diana vocal. ""Waiting In The Wings"" is a jazzy hip hop number with a strong beat. ""Where Did We Go Wrong"" is a 1930s' - style number strongly influenced by Billy Holiday.When this collection was released in 1993, Diana recorded five new songs for this disc. The first song is ""Back To The Future"", a strong fusion of hip hop and rock that I truly think could've been a huge hit. ""Let's Make Every Moment Count"" is a mellow love song. I like it. The next song is ""Your Love"". This is one the warmest, most tender songs I've ever heard. It's gorgeous and is my favorite of the new tracks. ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is an upbeat and bouncy number whose only annoying part are the vocals on the intro. Closing out the set is ""The Best Years Of My Life"". A fitting closer.This is a great collection of Diana's best. Every fan should have this set."

1,"Many children that grew up in the 80s will say that they grew up listening to Madonna. I grew up listening to No Doubt-I remember this cd well, Don't Speak, SUnday Morning, You Can Do It, and End it on this were my favorites! Still are actually. This album is a classic."
0,"Other than Layla, there isn't much of interest here, just more British white boy blues, I'd stick to the comps."
1,"This record simply gets more distinct as the years pass: a beautifully eccentric and frankly odd setting of impressions and ideas that remain unpredictable and absolutely filled with the sheerness of innocence, light and conviction, gratefully absent of commercialism, malice, posing or calculation. By all means, sit yourself down between the speakers and listen at different times of day, in different frames of mind with attention fixed or wandering. And offer the air around you some measure of appreciation that you lived to hear it.As for this particular incarnation: the stereo is masterful but, when it comes to what we really want, there is a profound and odd modulation issue with the mono version. Something's just not right with that mono disc. ( I'm listening on a Meridian reference transport, with upsampling and internal D/A conversion through a pair of monoblock Red Rose Tube Amps -- Black Sable and NOS valves -- and hybrid dynamic / ribbon towers.) If you doubt it, A/B it with the profoundly perfect remaster of Donovan Live and a few others of his, of the past few years, that capture the splendid bounce and holographic imaging reproduced by the best microphones of this period and you'll hear what I mean.Gear and technology aside -- as always and who really cares? -- be sure to Never Let This Music Die!"
1,"IMO, this is the best album from the so called King of Pop. Jam, In the Closet, Black or White and Heal the World are all classic tracks. The music is credible for Jackson, but his once publicized off camera incidents can't make people think he's a bigger freak than Marilyn Manson. Overall, a good album."
1,"I remember hearing ""Woman to Woman"" when it hit the Top 40 back in 1975. Good song, but it didn't particularly rock my world. And I think that was the last time I heard much from Shirley Brown. But she kept recording music, most of it very good by all accounts, and when I saw this album pop up in a local shop recently, memories of 1975 came bursting back and I thought: why not buy it? Well, I did and I'm very, very happy that I finally listened to more than one song by Shirley Brown. Wow, what a voice! Why wasn't she up there with Aretha, knocking down the soul barricades during the rest of the 1970s? Some really great songs on here, many with much more sass and oomph than ""Woman to Woman."" Soul fans, check this one out. Very impressive album."
1,"Slint are the forefathers of Math-Rock, or whatever you want to call the Shellac-Fugazi-Jesus Lizard-Clutch sound.  If you are a fan of these bands, get all three of Slint's releases.  Trust me--after one listen, you'll wonder why you waited so long!  Everything the other reviewers say is true, including Steve Albini himself.  This CD is, in a word, perfect.I will say this:  Spiderland affected producer Steve Albini so deeply, he formed another one of his ""crazy, self-indulgent"" bands and based it primarily on the foundation of Slint's sound.  He called this new band SHELLAC.  Shellac's first CD, ""At Action Park,"" almost sounds like Spiderland part II, (""Bosche's dick"" is a song about Slint's sound guy; they also had help from Slint techy Jennifer Hartman) as Steve and his band mates recreate and nearly pick-up where Slint left off after their 1992 break up.Shellac (and other bands like it) are influenced so deeply by Slint, their recordings almost sounds like an homage.  But don't call Shellac posers or copy-cats; the members of Slint were playing hard core and punk in the mid-80's, as was Steve Albini and his bands Big Black and Rapeman (which coincidentally included Jesus Lizard's bass player in its line-up). In fact, these artists are so closely and simultaneously linked, where else will you find a label claiming analog recordings rule?  Only on a Slint or Big Black recording, my friend."
1,"Live albums are rarely the top choices in a legendary artist's catalogue. They are usually left on the shelves for diehard fans. For every Allman Brothers at Fillmore East or Band of Gypsys, there are about five live CDs disregarded for better studio albums and one that has never even been issued on CD (and about thirty live offerings from the Grateful Dead) and it is often with good reason. Live albums often feature drippy jam sessions, have poor sound quality and reveal nothing new about the artist. But there are exceptions to the unimportance of live material; times when the band hits some inexplicable groove that just does not come about, isolated in a studio, staring at a soundboard. One is this 1975 LP from reggae legends, Bob Marley and the Wailers. Marley's socially conscious pleas fervently ride an intoxicating wave of crunchy beats and gorgeous back-up vocals. One can almost see the beads of sweat flying off Marley's face when he sings his finest mantra, ""Get Up, Stand Up."" Other selections such as ""Lively Up Yourself"" and ""Trenchtown Rock"" equal its heights of passion, while ""Burnin' and Lootin,"" and ""Them Belly Full (But We Hungry)"" sink into a hypnotizing, mellow wave. Unlike many other live performances, all songs are captured in clear, crisp almost studio quality sound and never outstay their welcome. Marley neophytes traditionally choose the greatest hits collection, Legend, as a starting point. It is a fine disc, but if you truly desire Bob Marley and the Wailers captured at their best, Live! is a must buy."
1,"My first exposure to Cal Tjader's music left me wanting more, and I've been a huge Stan Getz fan since first hearing Getz Au Go-Go. I've collected albums (and open-reel tapes) from both Stan Getz and Cal Tjader so this CD was a natural buy for me. It hasn't disappointed."
1,A true masterpiece of the greatest raper/actor of all times. Inmy opinion only his Makaveli: the 7 day theorie-CD is slightlybetter.
1,"AIC debuted nicely with ""Facelift"" giving them a name and a little bit of fame. But it's easy to say they're not even close to what the follow-up ""Dirt"" offered. Facelift is entertaining indeed, but perhaps what makes it less great (in lack of better terms) is that it isn't too original or fresh, I would still categorize this into the same type of rock GNR or Motley Crue does/did (I know, very bad comparisons) but I mean, the songs are more of this ""stadion-type-sing-alongs"" if not counting ""Bleed The Freak"" or ""Real Thing"", these are songs only giving a hint of what was coming later. This is a good album, and there's no denying the power of ""Man In The Box"", the hit, it's great, but I'm just saying that everyone should agree this is more ""schlock rock"" and has nothing to do with the revolutionary break of grunge/alternative, which they later joined with ""Dirt"" and defined themselves greatly. So, the thing is that ""Facelift"" was nothing innovative or fresh, but yet great at what it was, typical 80's style hard rock, with only a few more ""grunge"" songs, you know? If AIC wouldn't have created the masterpiece ""Dirt"" they wouldn't have become anything, just saying that Staley and Cantrell, are heroes now, true talents they were, but it would be weird saying that on basis of ""Facelift"". Definitely worth to listen to though, but it does give me that feeling of already old and dusty rock, the thing with their later albums is that they're kinda timeless and they still sound fresh...GIVE IT A TRY"
1,"This album was huge (#1 in UK & USA in 1982) & finally gave Wetton a balance of musical & commercial success.  It's an interesting line-up of musicians including Steve Howe - Guitars/vocals (Yes), John Wetton - Bass/lead vocals (UK & King Crimson), Jeff Downes - keyboards/piano/vocals (Buggles), & of course Carl Palmer - Drums/percussion.  These four guys made a very powerful album from start to finish & you can hear pieces of Yes & ELP here especially in Cutting it Fine.  I especially like here comes the feeling, only time will tell, without you, & wildest dreams.  I think the bass lines could've been more technical as wetton is very capable but he gets the job done.  Steve howe is impressive as usual & the production & acoustics of the sound bring out his ability.  Downes is good but it would've been good to hear more of the cp-70 yamaha piano.  Palmer is OK but not his best work.  There are times he could have done more drum fills & less of the subtle/mystical stuff he was known for in ELP.  Otherwise this is a great album & for the time a very powerful musical expression as the teenage synth crap was really taking over the charts.  It just goes to show that when the great prog rockers like these guys or genesis or rush do something no one can compete.  This is because this type of music appeals to everyone - teens to old folks. This album has stood the test of time commercially & muscially as it has a taste of progressive & pop."
1,"KRS-One's first ""solo"" album is 1993's ""Return of the Boom Bap."" After the original six Boogie Down Productions albums, KRS dropped the BDP moniker and dropped this gem. Kris enlisted the production of legend DJ Premier, who only recently had begun to receive recognition for his musical genius as a member of Gang Starr. The beats, however, while excellent, are quite simple, allowing KRS-One and his awesome character to take center stage. He drops some of the political and social stances of the last two BDP albums,EdutainmentandSex and Violence, in favor of a more entertaining and overall simpler approach. That's not to say that the verses aren't relevant. His classic tales of police brutality, urban injustice, and hip hop loyalty are all here. He just delivers them in a way that puts the music and the performance to the forefront. This is a totally classic album. Every song is totally memorable, because KRS puts such a great performance on every track. Whether he's screaming, singing, or toasting like a dancehall reggae performer, he entertains first and foremost. No track is even average or any worse than the others, this is pretty close to a perfect hip hop album. I couldn't find you any flaws, it's arguably hip hop's greatest MC teamed with arguably hip hop's greatest producer. A must have for the rap fan.The album begins with an awesome intro, ""KRS-One Attacks,"" where Premo laces a totally dope beat and covers it with some old BDP samples, to make a perfect start. ""Outta Here"" uses simple drum-and-bass to allow KRS to address the current state of hip hop, chronicling his life as a rapper and talking about the tendency of rappers to ""fall off."" Perhaps his best known song, ""Black Cop"" follows. Here, he is an entertainer first and an MC second, yelling and screaming, completely going wild on the mic. Anyone who hasn't sang along to the yelps of ""Black coooop...black COP black COP black COP"" shouldn't consider themself a hip hop fan. ""Mortal Thought"" is relevant, with a great chorus. I love the conceptually genius ""I Can't Wake Up,"" where KRS raps from the perspective of a blunt. He namedrops most of the big names of '93 rap, as the MCs pass the blunt from rapper to rapper. Again, he yells and sings a great chorus, this song's another classic. The nice ""Slap Them Up"" precedes the infamous ""Sound of da Police."" The look at police brutalities is simply rap at its finest. My favorite part is where he draws a connection between the similar-sounding words ""overseer"" and ""officer"" in the second verse, as they both oppressed the urban black community. The chorus is just classic, nobody else could ever pull this off like KRS-One. ""Mad Crew"" has a heavily sampled beat, and ""Uh Oh"" uses a human beatbox in favor of a drum machine. ""Brown Skin Woman"" delivers musically and lyrically, and the following title track is just awesome. ""'P' Is Still Free"" is once again classic material, I remember first hearing this song on theMenace II Society: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrackcompilation. The album ends perfectly with ""Stop Frontin'"" and ""Higher Level,"" a provocative challenge to American religion with a heavy horn-laden beat.I feel like this album gets overlooked in comparison to the BDP albums, but I think this is as entertaining and enjoyable as anything KRS-One has ever done. A classic album in every sense of the word, perfect hip hop from the best year for the genre, 1993. If you haven't already, do yourself a favor and pick it up."
1,"cheap trick,s dream police is my favorite cheap trick album!!!dream police was released in 1979.i think dream police is one of cheap tricks best albums ever!!for me the great cuts are;dream police,the house is rocking[with domestic problems]this particular song reminds me of something that might have been influenced by the beatles;abbey road album from 1969.also great from this album is;way of the world,gonna raise hell!!, which i think is the best tune on the album,need your love,i,ll be with you tonight and i know what i want!!i like some of the live bonus cuts too!!also the album cover is great too.check out rick nielson,s racing flag colored gibson explorer!!!this is a great cd.grab it!!"
1,"I used to have the optimistic point of view that, in the digital age, old music could be infinitely improved if it was properly remixed and remastered.  Time has shown that the best of the digital ""redos"" can only be as good as the original source tape, whether the original stereo master or the original multitracks.It's obvious now, after at least six attempts at digital remastering (the original CD reissue, the boxed set in '90, the Mobile Fidelity release in '93, the '96 remaster and now the SACD edition), that the original tapes are not that well recorded.  We've heard excuses for this, that everything was recorded live (and LOUD) and there was a lot of bleed between mics, that it was the beginning of multitrack technology and therefore noisy, that everyone, including the engineers, was stoned, etc., etc.None of the excuses, except for the drugs, really holds up.  They were working in a fine studio with state of the art equipment, a place where other artists made fine sounding records at that time.  Also, I don't think they were playing all that loud, as Clapton was using a Pignose (small amp) for much of the session.  But even if they were playing loud, I doubt that they could top the volume level of Who's Next, for instance, and that's a fine sounding LP.Anyway, it is what it is.  It's obvious now that there will be no significant improvement on the way this LP sounds.  It will always sound claustrophobic, muddy and midrange heavy.  You know they've gone back to the multitracks at least twice (20th Anniversery was remixed and they had to use the multitracks for the 5.1 on the SACD) with no significant improvement.So I guess we just have to appreciate the subtle improvements, and, to disagree with several other reviews, I think they are here.  I own all the other remasters, and I've felt like the best were the Mobile Fidelity and the '96 remaster.  Tough to declare a winner there; each has their pros and cons, and the difference is definitely subtle.  Last night, I did an A-B comparision of each of those with this SACD, and the SACD is a marked improvement on the bottom end.  The drums also have more detail.  When the tape becomes more saturated (i.e., when all those guitar overdubs kick in) like on Anyday, it still becomes a quagmire.  But on sparser songs, like Have You Ever Loved A Woman, the improvement is considerable.Our ears (and minds) are tricky animals.  When looking for improvement in a recording such as this, it is not fair to compare to another recording.  Layla will never sound like Who's Next or Abbey Road.  Different musicians, different studio, different conditions.  And Layla will never be a CD to demo speakers with.  But when comparing apples to apples, I guarantee this SACD is the best sounding Layla yet."
1,"I remember hearing this from a relative back in 85 and completely flipped  out when she played the song &quot;Superstar - Til You Come Back To Me  (That's What I'm Gonna Do)&quot;. One of the worlds most sweetest love  songs ever written an performed by man. Once I picked up the CD, I was  amazed how the rest of the album was just as good if not better. This is  definately a CD to played to your loved one or some secret admirer. Other  tunes to check out: &quot;Make Me A Believer&quot;, &quot;Busy Body&quot;,  &quot;I Wanted Your Love&quot;.  Sdeez"
0,"This album was supposed to be called ""Don't be a Faggot"" originally.  Does this say something about the mentality of the Beastie Boys at the time?  Not that we should blame them.  They've apologized, and they've gone on to create way more positive music and contributed to causes that more than makes up for this one album they made as young guys in the 80's.The question is this;  Why should we keep listening to a piece of music that is dated and offers no redeeming value whatsoever?  Why does this album continue to be a staple of parties and the soundtrack for every jock and frat boy in middle America?  I'm not uptight and I'm not a prude, but somewhere we have to take responsibility and stop filling our heads with ideas that oppress others.The one good thing about this album is that it brought rap to new popularity, and songs like Slow and Low or No Sleep Till Brooklyn certainly do bring back an era of 808 drum machines and goofy guitar samples.  But honestly, the Beastie Boys created much better music than this after the fact.  Paul's Boutique was more artistic, even though it still retained some of the sexism.  Check Your Head and Ill Communication were masterful blendings of urban style, culminating in a sound that cannot be duplicated and will never be topped.  Hello Nasty is a brilliant piece of pure hip hop, which totally destroys everything on this album.Check Your Head.  Enjoy the music, but think about what you're listening to."
1,"All Eyez On Me is certainly worth of all the praise and record sales it has amassed(well over 10 million, thank you very much), but to say this is his best album is blasphemous; that honor belongs to Me Against The World. Though his signing to the hip hop dynasty Deathrow records was a stroke of briliance of the part of Suge Knight, it ultimately corrupted him from his natrual self; on Me Against The World, he was a troubled and eloquent street scholar trying to make it another day, but now the accesses of life have truly consumed him. Nevertheless, this a truly memorable album; Deathrow's current stars(Dr. Dre, That Dogg Pound, Nate Dogg, Danny Boy) make his step his game up and the results are eartshattering. How many classics are on this album? California Love(which samples EPMD's ""Knick Knack Patty Wack"" and Zapp's ""Computer Love"")? How Do U Want It(with K-Ci and Jo-Jo of Jodeci)? 2 Of Amerika's Most Wanted(featuring Snoop Doggy Dogg).? Even the lesser songs are hot; All About You, Rather Be Ya Nigga, Go My Mind Made Up(HOT posse joint featuring Tha Dogg Pound, Method Man and Redman). This is one albunm for the books; go get it if you alredy don't. R.I.P, Mr. Shakur."
1,"Originally released in 1975, this looks to be his third solo effort - didn't know (until now) that Vangelis was a member of the Greek progressive band, Aphrodite's Child. Hadn't heard this CD in ages, as I've never really kept up with his work that much. Liked this ageless neo-classical / New Age title more so than I remember. Both tracks here - ""Heaven And Hell, Part 1"" and ""Heaven And Hell, Part 2"" - clocking in at over twenty minutes each. Jon Anderson (Yes) provides the vocals on ""So Long Ago, So Clear"" - a portion of the Part 1 cut, I'm sure I used to hear that song on late night FM radio many moons ago. Thoroughly enjoyed this CD reissue's beautiful symphonic passages that manage to take the listener(s) by surprize. Should appeal to fans of Patrick Moraz, Yanni, Tangerine Dream and Mike Oldfield."
1,"RATM,pioneers of the rap-rock combo, make an excellent debut with this album.zack's lyrics are thought provoking and influential not to mention smart.tom morello's claim of 6 hours of guitar practice after school sure paid off.one of the best hard-rock albums ever released. all those so called rap-metal bands today cant hold a candle to RATM,the only rap-metal band you need to listen to."
1,"You'll find few albums of more importance for the entry of electronic/trip hop music into the mainstream than Becoming X, but you'll also find few albums less heralded for it.  It's no mistake that nearly ten years after its release, its biggest hit ""6 Underground"" is still on the radio - the song's ""I'm open to falling from grace"" come-on truly connected in relaying the message of the genre and the age, and so the record succeeds in being a perfect, seductive 11 song recapitulation of the type of desire that ropes you in even as you know it'll harm you.  Its opening, the aptly titled ""Low Place Like Home"" is as sneering as any punk song, but with Kelli Dayton's voice guiding it, it's emphasis is far sexier - much more lipstick than spit.  As the record proceeds, it becomes full of moments that scratch and pant their way into a devastating s/m trip - the cry of ""Spin Spin Sugar"" that segues into eroticized laughter, the ecstatic moan that climaxes the title track, the strange command to start ""breathing through your elbows"" in ""Roll On.""  As the album closes on the moving ""How Do,"" you get the sense of the techno party finally going to sleep at dawn, and in that, Becoming X remains a fitting 11 song capsule of the entire techno breakthrough - a collision of technology and sensuality that is as evocative a story of its era and its listeners as any document at the time or since."
1,"Back before there was East Coast and West Coast, Public Enemy were THE important artists in rap and this was their best CD. &quot;Welcome to the Terrordome&quot; is a classic in any genre, and &quot;911 Is a Joke&quot; is another gem. The whole CD holds together as one programmed piece of eloquent socio-politics and sonic art. One CD that every rock (let alone rap or hip-hop) fan should own."
1,"Made in USA in 1999, Serial# ZK-65690, Playing Time 65:31This is an affordable collection of various tracks that covers 8 of the band's first 10 albums; and shows their diversity and their quite original writing style. It has some classics, but also less-known material that's well worth a listen. If you like many of the metal-progressive bands of the 90's (e.g. Dream Theater, Symphony X) you'll see where some of them got some of their writing ideas.For those like me who wanted a REMASTERED version of this 1984 offering, all I can say is DON'T RETIRE YOUR OLD CD!On this latest version, 6 changes were made: 1) &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot; is the original version, not the remix that was done by Livgren himself and his cohorts specifically for the original release; 2) the track &quot;Perfect Lover&quot; has been discarded; it is now only available on the limited edition 2-disc version of &quot;Definitive Collection&quot;, not on the regular 1-disc version; 3) &quot;The Wall&quot; has received the same treatment as described in note 1; 4) &quot;The Pinnacle&quot; has been added; 5) &quot;The Devil Game&quot; has been added; 6) &quot;Closet Chronicles&quot; from &quot;Two For The Show&quot; has been added.I'm surprised that, considering the extra room left on the disc, the version of &quot;Song For America&quot; is still edited.All in all, if you're fairly new to the first half of their career, this gives you a good overview; if you're a collector, you can pass up on this and keep the original version."
1,"&quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot; is exactly what Dylan is about.  This is a story song where the listener is left to fill in the cracks.  Dylan has found a wonderful melody and hook and just tells us the story of someones life on top of it.  It is a marvelous song that would rate the album 3 stars evenif the rest of the CD were chain saw fights.  &quot;Simple Twist of Fate&quot; is a beautiful number in which Dylan lets the song do the work.  What Dylan did here was to write 10 great songs and perform them simply.  If the material is this awesome why blow it with overblown production?  You're a big girl now, is a beautiful song reflecting sentiments all men have had at one time or another.  &quot;Idiot Wind&quot; is a tour de force that should be on any radio station's play list.  &quot;Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts&quot; is nine minutes of folk perfection.  &quot;If You See Her, Say Hello&quot;, &quot;Shelter from the Storm&quot; and &quot;Buckets of Rain&quot; are three beautiful songs to finish out the album.  There's not a mistake on this record. Only the Beatles and the Stones have ever made records that rise to the level of this one."
1,"As I'm one of the few who still listen to cd's, I'm thrilled to find them in good, used condition.  This one plays just like new, so I'm a happy listener."
1,"Several of these songs got a lot of airplay in 1970: &quot;Your Song&quot; (the big hit from this album), &quot;Take Me To The Pilot,&quot; &quot;Sixty Years On&quot; (very pretty nylon string guitar with strings intro), &quot;Border Song&quot; (typical Elton John piano intro). This early version of &quot;Grey Seal&quot; lacks the dazzling piano arpeggios that made it sound so great on the &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; album, it's a tiny bit slower, and the ending chords aren't as rockish as that later version, but it still sounds good, especially with the strings. All the songs sound decent on this album, though it's too much on the soft side for my personal taste, and none of the songs really grabbed me--&quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; &amp; &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot; &amp; his other 1971-1974 era albums are much better in songwriting, playing, instrumentation, and lyrics, in my opinion."
1,"to the good ole days of bands.  Mint Condition is in the mold of: Lakeside, EWF, Cameo, etc.  This is a very good cd.."
1,"Go For Your Guns is probably the best album the Isleys ever put out (I can't decide between it and Harvest For The World). It opens with the funkdafied &quot;The Pride&quot;. When they say they gon break it on down, they break it down! &quot;Footsteps in the Dark&quot; is a mellow funk number and will have you groovin'. &quot;Tell Me When You Need It Again&quot; is one hell of a groove and is my favorite song to listen to while I drive. &quot;Climbin' Up The Ladder&quot; is my least fav but it's still great and let's Ernie tear it up on guitar. &quot;Voyage To Atlantis&quot; was the first song I heard from the Isleys that was a slow jam. Before that I knew of &quot;It's Your Thing&quot;, &quot;That Lady&quot; and &quot;Fight The Power&quot; but &quot;Atlantis&quot; served notice, at least to me, that they could slow it down. &quot;Livin' In The Life&quot; and it's extension &quot;Go For Your Guns&quot; are some bad ass funk jams that let ya know no one has an easy life no matter how it may seem. I was born 10 years after this album was made and I absolutely love it. GO OUT AND GET IT!"

1,"When this album first came out in 1974, it was treatedas a joke among critics and music industry people,simply because Barbra's current amour Jon Peters wasgiven the producer credit.  Up till that moment he wasknown as a successful hairdresser and businessman, withapparently no musical talent or experience.  Who knowshow much control or input he really had on the project?Tom Scott, coming right off a very successful run withJoni Mitchell on her &quot;Court &amp; Spark&quot; album, was enlistedas musical coordinator.  I think it's safe to say thatTom was Barbra's main musical collaborator on this project.And in retrospect, this album is very underrated.  Yes,at times Barbra tries too hard to &quot;rock out&quot;, particularlyon David Bowie's &quot;Life On Mars&quot;, but she does a good jobnonetheless.  A few of the tracks are absolutely first-rate, particularly &quot;Love In the Afternoon&quot;, &quot;Simple Man&quot;,&quot;I Won't Last a Day Without You&quot; (which is the closest toBarbra's classic 70's fare) and &quot;Let The Good Times Roll&quot;.And some of the less successful tracks like her attempt atsoul on Bill Withers' classic &quot;Grandma's Hands&quot; are, seenmany years later, interesting attempts at growth on Barbra'spart.  This album is much more interesting and enjoyable thanseveral of Babs' later &quot;Adult Contemporary&quot; snoozers like&quot;Songbird&quot;, &quot;Wet&quot; and especially &quot;Emotion&quot;, the absolutebottom of the barrel.  Those albums have very few decentsongs on them.  &quot;Butterfly&quot;, on the other hand, is fun fromstart to finish.  If you're a fan, you'll probably enjoy it!"
1,I enjoy his music for a long time and this one is a great one to get if you are fan of his music.
0,"I can't understand why this album get such high ratings. To me, the only really good song is the opening ""I got your number"", but that one is very good. The rest is a strange blend of pop and rock that doesn't work at all. The material is also very time typical. I would not advise you to buy this album if you're looking for steamy rock tunes in the Deep Purple manner."
1,"Triumph is where The Jacksons peak as a group in terms of writing& producing.The need to compete with Off The Wall was an inspiration to Michael's other brothers.Randy & Jackie shine brightly as they compose with their superstar brother.Where Lovely One sound like an extention of Shake Your Body & Don't Stop...,Heartbreak Hotel(This Place Hotel on later pressings,probably at the request of Michael's future father in law's camp)sounds like a blueprint for Billie Jean.Time Waits For No One is over-due for a hit remake.If Michael's solo career pushed The Jacksons music up ,it also drove a wedge through the group.Michael seemed to be holding back on Triumph,saving his best stuff for his solo work."
1,"While many critics and fans cite Elton's 1973 album ""Don't Shoot Me I'm Only The Piano Player"" as the emergence of the ""new and glitzy pop Elton"", This 1972 release, while far more tame and less extravagant, was the first release of Elton's to show the turning of the tide. Up until this point, Elton's albums were darker, more somber, more serious. Elton's live shows in the U.S. were anything but. On stage he was a madman at the piano. Thumping away with great gusto and flair. His first 4 albums showed Elton as entirely different. It was decided that the powers that be wanted the Elton that was on stage, the 'live' Elton, to be translated to the records themselves. Make Elton, who already had a few hits under his belt at the time, more accessible. And ""Honky Chateau"" was the brilliant result. Released in 1972, the shift in tone was evident off the bat. The album was written in five days(!), and it was recorded within the walls of Chateau d'Hierouville(hope I spelled that right!). The resulting album had a more unified band feel to it, and the music was fantastic. You knew things were different with the first track, ""Honky Cat"". A funky pop tune that is far more complex and structured than just a fun, fly away pop tune. Something Elton is always good at. A jaunty little pop tune with a dark edge was ""I Think I'm Going To Kill Myself"", a track that cleverly goes against it's title and lyrics by having a jaunty pop tune to it. ""Mellow"" may not of broken the mold or set Elton's career on fire, but it is a pleasing and soothing little ballad. Sweet and nothing more. One track I really have no feeling for is the ballad, ""Salvation"", a tune that really has nothing to it and goes nowhere. ""Susie(Dramas)"" is a funky little up tempo number, that may not stand out so much, but sounds good as you are listening to it. The very slow ballad ""Slave"" is given two different interpretations here. I already mentioned the slow as molasses one, and the other version is a revved up rock version. The song does have a great piano part in the rock version, and a pretty good catch too, so it makes it the more essential version. ""Amy"" is pretty much a flat out rocker. One of Elton's hardest rockers at that point. It sounds good and fills out the album, but will mostly be forgotten afterwards. Same with the album closer, ""Hercules"". Two of the stand outs here are the big ballads. ""Rocket Man"" is here. Although Elton had only a scant few hits at this point(Your Song, Friends, and Levon), this track was his first real smash hit, although ""Your Song"" in 1970 was a top ten hit as well. It's a great example of Elton's way with a simple pop ballad that can be turned into something more. The other is a song that's a classic to me and others, but wasn't released as a single. That song is ""Mona Lisa's And Mad Hatters"". The song has gained a lot of following and a definite place in Elton's canon in the last several years because of Elton incorporating it more and more into his shows and other performances. It is a stark and rich ballad, with wonderful lyrics by Taupin. A sequel(of sorts) was released 16 years later, to a much lesser degree, on 1988's ""Reg Strikes Back"". There was an obvious change to Elton's delivery as well. More fresh, spirited, and pop/rocky. The lyrics by Taupin were fresher and more accesible, and allowed more from Elton. HC is looked upon as one of Elton's finer moments. At the time, it was. It won't be put up on the pedestal with ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"", ""Captain Fantastic"" and others, but it is a fine, fine piece of work. It is one of the better Elton efforts, and at the time of it's release, was his best effort. It would be in the top five. Honky Chateau is classic, warm, and inviting. It's time to visit it again."
1,"John David Souther is most well known for his association with The Eagles.  He appeared on the back cover of the band's Desperado album, has toured and sang backup with them and most notably has co-written many of their most well known songs including the number one hits &quot;Best Of My Love&quot; and &quot;New Kid In Town&quot;.  In fact, Mr. Souther's greatest triumphs have come as a songwriter.  But he has released some fine solo albums, with the biggest being You're Only Lonely.  Mr. Souther has a smooth and easy voice that floats effortless through his songs.  The title track is far and away his biggest solo hit, peaking at number seven, and deservedly so.  It is a gorgeous song with an easy rhythm and beautiful harmonies.  Other strong tracks include &quot;The Moon Just Turned Blue&quot;, &quot;Til' The Bars Burn Down&quot; and &quot;Trouble In Paradise&quot;."
1,"I finally got around to getting this one, It is a great record, one of those releases that I never got around to in the day but heard all those years ago. Released after the Moody Blues ""7th Sojourn"" album it was nice to hear something from just Justin & John considering the band was having issues at the time. I've read a few reviews as well and I pretty much agree with them. The bonus addition of ""Blue Guitar"" is nice & believe the track would have fit real good between the A & B sides of the album. If you enjoy The Moody Blues, then by all means check this album out. It is a real treat, buy it, you'll be very happy you did! Check out my website sometime ""JudeMac Forever"" & say ""Hi"""
1,"I know some of you are going to say it's just plain sacrilegious but hey, just because everybody jumps into the lake....  ""Thriller"" is a great album with great tracks and because of a variety of fortunate reasons e.g. timeliness, MTV etc, has become the biggest selling album of all-time but that doesn't mean that everything else that MJ comes up with later that doesn't sell as much is crap.In fact, this is the album when MJ's weirdness first became pretty obvious.  ""Hey! Is that really Michael on the cover?"" was my reaction as well but I chose to look beyond the looks and not to judge the book by the cover and just listened to the tunes.  Some of my favourite MJ songs ever are on this disc.""The Way You Make Me Feel"" is an MJ classic and clearly among his top 5 ever songs.  ""Smooth Criminal"" was always a great track even before Alien Ant Farm showed us why, ""Liberian Girl"" and ""Man in the Mirror"" are also great tracks and the rest of the tracks cannot be called album filler by any stretch of the imagination.The sound quality of this special edition has also been remastered to near perfection and the bonus interviews and tracks are a real bonus to fans.  This album grows on you over time and for me has aged a lot better than ""Thriller"" has.  Maybe I've heard ""Thriller"" too many times but give me a choice between the two if I had to put one of them on the cd player, I'd choose ""Bad"" any time and if not ""Off the Wall"" before I'd reach for ""Thriller.""Get over the Wacko Jacko hangup and just judge the cd for the tracks if you can and then you'll see just how great this album really is.  This very well remastered and special edition is very highly recommended."
1,"On public enemy's highly anticipated debut album of 1987 on first listen it is Funky, Avant-garde, and all sorts of things combined into a one of a kind masterpiece of a album. From political songs to more Sample heavy songs like ""You're Gonna Get Yours"", ""MegaBlast"", and ""Public Enemy No. 1"". In In my opinion i think that P.E really did out do themselves this time."
1,"REO SPEEDWAGON is known for some of rocks best hit songs, such as RIDIN' THE STORM OUT, TIME FOR ME TO FLY and KEEP ON LOVIN' YOU. However, throughout their run of 1970's and 1980's hits they never put out an album that kept my attention all of the way through. To my ears (and I am admittedly not a tremendous fan REO SPEEDWAGON fan), even HI INFIDELITY had some glaring holes within its cuts. WHEELS ARE TURNIN' might have a song that is less than stellar, and certainly the band's growing penchant for pop songs flourished throughout, this album still had some remarkable songs such as THROUGH THE WINDOW, ROCK AND ROLL STAR, LIVE EVERY MOMENT and I DON'T WANNA KNOW... but to me... the true gem of this album (and one of the all time best SPEEDWAGON songs is... (Alan Gratzer drum roll please...) the title track WHEELS ARE TURNIN'!!! This song ranks right up there with my all time favorite RIDIN' THE STORM OUT (live version from A DECADE OF ROCK AND ROLL). I wish a 20th Anniversary re-release of this album would have followed those of YOU CAN TUNE A PIANO... and HI INFIDELITY. More so, I wish the band would have performed the incredible track during any one of the four REO SPEEDWAGON concerts that I have attended.Please release a remastered version of this incredibly successful album... PLEASE."
1,"Curiously dressed in white lace and foil with her eyes glazed or shut and sporting  that trademark weave; appearing as though she were angel while walking on air through a back-ally ghetto she may have even once dwelled  in, Ms. Diana's surreal snapshots for her '95 release were very ponderous,  and on some level, were a pictorial of where she thought her career- and  life might have been headed. Where Diana was once a symbol of the courage  and hope of her people, she wandered a commercially aimless path, and her  career all but washed away in the US, the image of her angelic self walking  on air through a ghetto metaphorically represented the the icon she is and  always be-even if her career and life pass. Her beautiful figure perched on  the ledge on the front cover signified a bird preparing to spread and its  wings and fly: if it only from Motown, we hoped. By '95, who would have  thought Diana would have found any incentive to record again, given the  poor reception to her previous albums-and the irresponsible way Motown  handled the promotion thereof. Though all her '90s  releases are shaky at  best, there are some gems that cannot be ignored, and &quot;Take Me  Higher&quot; was no exception.So, on &quot;Take Me Higher&quot;, the  opening number-and incidentally the only track to even approach the US Hot  100 within the last 10+ years-Diana found some transcedence. This should  have been the anthem that even her detractors should have embraced; it was  one of her best and exciting songs in the last 10 years. R and B radio  should not have passed on this either; if they found her work too schlocky  or white, this was the perfect middle ground for a woman of her age. Cher  even had a little dance hit in her later years, remember?  &quot;If  You're Not Gonna Love Me Right&quot; was a slice of electro-funk that  critics said was outdated production wise, but it was so smooth and  understated and bouncy it should have caught on for a heritage artist who  pioneered so many of the trends,not to mention the as understatedly elegant  and equally prophetic &quot;Gone&quot; that was the tearjerker of the year  worked as a double-entendre that implored her lost audience not to forget  about the loyalty she has had to them and they once had to her-before she  was gone. From this delcaration, to the  &quot;Voice of the Heart&quot;,  penned by Monica Lewinksy's guy-pre Tom Green boy-toy Bruce Roberts of  &quot;No More Tears&quot; fame was AC ready and even made  it-surprisingly-to the US AC charts. &quot;I Will Surive&quot; found Gloria  Gaynor attacking Diana for her delivery, but ushered the arrival of  producer Louis Biancaniello would later collaborate with Jessica Simpson."
1,"1966, in many respects was to rock 'n roll what 1984 was to punk, with now seminal releases such as the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, The Beatles' Revolver and Bob Dylan's double Blonde On Blonde notable in an era when groundbreaking work was emerging almost monthly. No other album however, possessed the sheer sophistication of Simon & Garfunkel's third recording.In an unlikely connection, Parsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme has ties with Tool's sophomore release, nima (1996) in that both were heavily influenced by - and in both cases, dedicated to - renegade comedians Lenny Bruce (1925-1966) and Bill Hicks (1961-1994) respectively.Through Art Garfunkel's ethereal vocals and Paul Simon's elegiac lyricism and acoustic guitar, Parsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme is a contemplative interrogation of both high and popular culture, age and adolescence, individual and collective identity.The album opens with 'Scarborough Fair/Canticle' a traditional English folk song and an anti-war Simon original intertwined to majestic effect, and continues with the furtive 'Patterns' and enigmatic 'A Poem on the Underground Wall' sitting comfortably alongside literary ballads ('The Dangling Conversation' and 'Cloudy') and scathing indictment of consumer culture ('The Big Bright Green Pleasure Machine'). In 'A Simple Desultory Philippic (Or How I Was Robert McNamara'd Into Submission)' Simon snips away at various public figures, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Norman Mailer, Ayn Rand, Phil Spector and Andy Warhol. There are songs, 'hits' even, to have become ubiquitous in popular music, notably 'Homeward Bound,' 'The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)' and the celestial ballad 'For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her.'Having abandoned sporadic attempts to sound like the Everly Brothers singing Bob Dylan on their 1964 debut Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., and The Beatles on Sounds of Silence (1966), Parsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme represents Simon & Garfunkel establishing a sound uniquely their own, their own vision.The album closes with '7 O'Clock News/Silent Night,' with the duo's rendition of the Christmas carol hauntingly interspersed with an evening news bulletin from August 3rd 1966, documenting plans for Martin Luther King's controversial open housing march into the Chicago suburbs of Cicero; Richard Nixon's desire to increase the war effort in Vietnam; the trial of proto-typical mass murderer Richard Speck; and the death of Lenny Bruce. The fact that these individuals, intrinsic to the ethos of the album, having been so influential (for good or bad) in the manner in which the world has since evolved, remain figuratively pertinent in contemporary society, render the album so timeless, quite possibly more so than any other album."
1,"It is 1980 the 70's is finally over but as we enter a new Decade An Icon by the name of Stevie Wonder Drops his Last Great album in his Legendary Career and what a great Album this is Riding off all the Benefits from his previous Album (Songs In The Key Of Life) this may not be on the same level as Songs... But what a Valiant Effort he put forth here is some of my Favorite Tracks ""Master Blaster Jammin"" ""Lately"" ""All I Do"" Rocket Love"" ""Happy Birthday"" Etc... Those are some of the favorites of mine off the album but the only song I didn't like was the terrible ""I Ain't Gonna Stand For It"" but other than that this is his best album in the 80's phase of his Legacy."
0,The song No Way is extremely well done. Other than that it's off to the used CD store with this one.
1,"Elton was just a singles machine, when this album came out. But he used all those singles to guarantee an audience for this brilliant, very uncommercial masterpiece. The album debuted at number one, but people expecting more ""Daniel"" or ""The Bitch Is Back"" were undoubtedly shocked, but hopefully not disppointed. This album has it all. It rewards the true Elton John fans who waited through numerous commercial hits for an album worthy of his earlier work. As if inspired by the story line, his early career with Bernie Taupin, Elton and Bernie seemingly go back in time and come up with just an incredible album as good as anything he had ever done to that point, and miles better than anything he would ever do again.The bonus tracks include two number one monster singles. Not bad for bonus tracks."
1,"What's Going On catapulted Marvin Gaye into superstardom. Three number one singles were pulled from the album: the title song, ""Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology),"" and ""Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)."" This was the first album where Marvin overdubbed his voice multiple times, creating a one-man vocal group. The result was a level of timbral integration in the harmonies that became a Gaye trademark."
1,"This is the Scorpions' Off the Wall. When Michael Jackson hit his peak with Thriller, it was interesting to go back and hear the previous album. When the Scorpions hit their peak with Love at First Sting, you could go back and hear this, the album in which they were clearly trying to figure out how to reach the largest possible audience.On Blackout, even the missteps are pretty good. You Give Me All I Need and No One Like You are prototype power ballads with a little too much power. That makes them more interesting than anything on Love at First Sting. And songs like Blackout and Now! are a lot of fun --- garage versions of Rock You Like a Hurricane.It helps that this album sounds so good remastered. It's really tight, but too old to be as slick as anything produced today. And they didn't throw in any extra tracks; I just want the original album, sounding good but without weak bonus tracks."
1,"I must confess... I was not an Outkast fan since the beginning.  I was one of the many people who jumped on the Outkast bandwagon in 2000 with Stankonia.  After B.O.B, Ms. Jackon, and So Fresh, So Clean, I completely forgot about Outkast until 2003 (shame on me) when Speakerboxx/The Love Below came out.  I bought this album in haste when it came out and instantly loved it.  After hearing all the songs on Speakerboxx/The Love Below about 100,000 times each,  I decided to buy ATLiens, with a bit of skepticism.And guess what?  I have no regrets whatsoever.  But enough about me.  This album, to put it simply, is off the chain.  Unlike mainstream rap today, where the same stuff is rapped about over and over (at least some of the songs sound good), this album thinks outside the box.  It starts out with &quot;Two Dope Boyz&quot;, a great way to kick off the album.  This track, though short at only 2:46, lives up to its name; it's DOPE.  Next is the eerie, out of this world &quot;ATLiens&quot;, with its funky laid-back alien beat and the crazy wordplay by Big Boi in the 1st verse.  Then comes the best song on the album in my opinion, &quot;Wheelz of Steel&quot;.  This one definately should of been released as a single, its got a really catchy hook, mad scratching and sweet beat.  Tracks 5 &amp; 6, &quot;Jazzy Belle&quot; &amp; &quot;Elevators&quot; are both excellent slow tracks with the same crazy lyrics and beats you'd expect from Outkast.  Other standouts on this CD include &quot;Mainstream&quot;, &quot;E.T. (Extraterrestrial)&quot;, &amp; &quot;13th Floor/Growing Old&quot;, a piano-based with a touching melody.  The rest isn't quite as good, but it's nothing worth hitting the fast-forward button on.If you want to see where the Album of the Year Speakerboxx/The Love Below came from, pick up this album.  Definately a CD to add to one's collection.P.S. Pick up Speakerboxx/The Love Below if you haven't already!"
1,"A little of Artie goes along way. I'd like to hear what he sounds like in one of his frequent holding tank visits after being busted for possession. How's about a little rendition of Whole Lotta Love while ripped?After four or five cuts of this vapid pap, I want to go out and put my head on the railroad tracks just to experience some kind of rush.Can I have another Cafe Francais, s'il vous plait?"
1,"Average album, some good songs, two or three not-so-good songs. Their singing is unremarkable but did get better on their subsequent albums. Overall this album hasn't aged well and sounds very 1993, but I still  listen to it once in awhile."
1,"ABBA was one of the groups that shaped my youth in the 70s. I bought this CD a few years ago, and it's one of my favorites. I don't think ABBA gets enough credit for the influence they've had on pop music -- we would never have seen groups like Ace of Base or Roxette do well in North America had ABBA not been a precursor to them -- the group was actually quite groundbreaking in many ways.The music is deceptively simple. Alot of it is great dance music, but there are also some terrific ballads on the album, from Fernando, to Knowing Me, Knowing You, to Chiquitita. Some of the lyrics are actually quite good and catchy, and the tunes themselves are totally hummable and fun to sing along with.There are a few minor flaws with the disc -- there's no lyrics included, which I found really frustrating because there are a couple songs I couldn't quite figure out all the words to. Not sure if that's because ABBA tended to overproduce there songs, or if it's the quality of the remastering of the tape into CD form, or a combination of both. Regardless, the overall quality of the songs is so high, and the lyrics are so readily available on various internet sites (just do a search, they're easy to find) that this one small detail isn't important enough to take off a star.In short, ABBA is the best -- skip all the ABBA wannabe groups and go for the original."
1,"Already two albums into his career by the time this came out Lenny Kravitz showed no signs of slowing down one bit on this third album album. He was not only still a big hit but all the same he was showing signs of excellent career momentum by not taking half a decade to release albums. I have kind of avoided this album because for a long time I've heard it promoted as Kravitz's ""rock"" album (as if all his albums aren't rock albums in a way) and that it's also his most imitative. Neither conception of the album is all that accurate. Considering the success baught to him by the excellentMama Saidthis album shares a lot in common with that one in terms of it's musical breadth and ideas. The main difference is,whatever style Lenny is involving himself in at any moment is married to very strong hooks and carefully crafted songs. The title song is actually the first Lenny Kravitz song I remember hearing. It's an okay song,very Hendrix influenced despite the fact Jimi didn't record a WHOLE lot of songs this fast (he had a good many though actually) but even so this song is not my favorite Lenny Kravitz song,or even a favorite on this album even though it was a big hit for him. Overall this album tends to be dominated by somewhat slower,psychedelic soul/rock tunes in the place of ""Believe"",""Come On And Love Me"",""Sister"" and ""Is There Any Love In Your Heart"". Whatever else is said about Lenny Kravitz and how he handles his flower power era influences these tunes all exhibit a certain kind of reserved positivity about life in general that not only has him sounding pretty grounded personally but does show him beginning to put everything that's inspired him musically into a style very much his. He does repeat a couple of tricks here from the previous album and does that pretty well here with the John Lennon send up of ""Just Be A Woman"",a veryDouble Fantasy-type tune with some likeminded and great use of vocal reverb as well as on ""Sugar"" another and somewhat broader toned (musically anyway) string filled northern/Chicago soul song not too far removed from  the sound ofIt Ain't Over Til It's Over. ""Heaven Help"" actually finds him cleverly appropriate a folk/blues/funk acoustic guitar type groove with something of a 3+3 Isley Brothers influence but here you find some of Lenny's own influence too which makes it one of his more individual and soulful tunes. This album flows very well from one song to the other even though it encompasses a lot of styles and it did do Lenny a lot of good careerwise. Even though it's not his first album this is not too bad a place in fact to begin getting into Lenny Kravitz's music."
1,"This is possibly one of the best albums every made period.  Leonard Cohen's best work.  This album has everything, amazing lyrics, great guitar pieces, great vocals and everyting just goes together perfectly.  Truly amazing for our time and all times."
1,"Maybe I just want some of it too, but one of the greatest glories is to know that you have encouraged someone else to enjoy something life-enhancing. That is the honour bestowed on one of my best friends, who  introduced me to Nick Drake by telling me to shut up, stop criticising the  cover, and listen to the bloody music (his words, not mine).Five Leaves  Left is a different, more depressing, more restrained, kettle of fish from  this...and this, well, it is one of the greatest solo albums made...ever?  Yes, ever. It is a subjective statement - whereas I often try to wonder  what others might think of an album, I have no means of conceiving a  critical report of this one. Perhaps some of the music might not hit home  with you, perhaps Drake's voice will prove dull or frustratingly  depressing.I can't tell - all I can say is, this is truly beautiful.  Songs like Hazy Jane (pick which ever one you want), or One of These Things  First, or Northern Sky, go beyond pop or folk or normal mortal range. Drake  entered the legion of immortal musicians among his fans not just because he  died so young - Lennon's death did not influence my preference for  McCartney - but because he reached so many. And still does.His are not  just words for youths, either - my father bought this on the basis of the  Introduction, and loves the rest too. It's awe-inspiring acoustic guitar.  Astoundingly mature use of strings. A beautiful (annoying to use this word  so much - but there is no other to express the sentiment) voice. Clever,  haunting, moving lyrics. An album that works.And now I understand the  cover - we cannot empathise with the genius who feels isolated from his own  world. But perhaps, by seeing his humility, hearing his message, we can  touch something of...well - that too is subjective, and for you to work out  alone."
1,I can see why everyone says this is Simon and Garfunkel's best work yet. It really is. There is not a bad song on the album. Highly recommend it. Best song on there is  &#34;El Condor Pasa&#34;. Its too bad they didn't make anymore albums after this. Would have loved to see the direction the would have gone in musically.
0,"Just so you know where I'm coming from, I think that what the Moody Blues produced from 1967-1970 is one of the great legacies of the rock era. I am less familiar with their post-1981 output, but much of what I've heard is likeable.  I'm glad you are interested in the Moodies and encourage you to explore their first five albums.  With that said, I cannot recommend Seventh Sojourn (1972).  Every song is either plodding and dull or sticky sweet. The worst offenders are John Lodge's two offerings on Sojourn. ""Isn't Life Strange?"" is like gooey treacle.  Compare it to the unsentimental beauty of John's ""Eyes of a Child"" on ""Children's Children"".  ""I'm Just a Singer in a Rock 'n Roll Band"", with its forced energy and ""is it over yet?"" conclusion gives rock 'n roll a bad name.  Compare it to the natural-sounding energy of John's ""Ride My See Saw"", on ""Lost Chord"" or ""To Share Our Love"" on ""Threshold"".  Even ace songwriter Justin Hayward flops here, with little cream-puff ditties and inane lyrics: ""All we are trying to say is we are all we've got"".  Compare them to the passion of his ""Gypsy"" on ""Children"", The Actor on ""Lost Chord"", or the perfect rock 'n roll gem ""It's Up to You"", on ""Question of Balance"".  Mike Pinder seems to be the only one of the bunch who's really putting effort into his songs, but the results are ponderous and do not wear well.  Do I blame the Moodies for running out of ideas or cashing in on this album's enormous sales? Of course not. Obviously they pleased many people and they deserved the recognition. But because there is not one song in this collection that I enjoy, one star is all they're getting from this loyal fan."
1,"OK, it ain't 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road' or 'Capt. Fantastic', but when I need some EJ, I always reach for this one. It's loose and relaxed, probably to contrast with 'C.F.'s bombast from 6 months earlier.Side one (ok, it's a cd, work with me I had the LP, I'm old!) is flawless. Still don't know what the first track means, but it's enjoyable. After the comic strip tribute ""Dan Dare"" we get the one-two punch of ""Island Girl"" and ""Grow Some Funk of Your Own"" (Elton's asides in the latter are hilarious), which, as we know, were big hits. ""...Robert Ford"" has to be one of THE saddest breakup songs ever.As for ""side two"", it's... OK. The songs aren't as memorable, but they do have catchy parts (betcha start yelling ""Check it out"" when ""Billy Bones..."" comes on). ""Feed Me"" is still scary after all these years.The extra tracks are... serviceable...As for the sound...! I used to have the Polydor version, but the Rocket remaster is a revelation. I heard stuff I didn't even know existed on this album. Excellent job.As for the ""Island Girl"" glitch mentioned in one of the reviews, I've never noticed it, and god knows I've listened to this cd a LOT."
1,"After ""Days of Future Passed,"" with its fusion of progressive rock and the London Festival Orchestra the Moody Blues provided more of the same, only different (i.e., a Mellotron instead of the full symphonic orchestra since Decca did not want to pay for another one despite the success of the aforementioned previous album). On their 1968 release ""In Search of the Lost Chord,"" the songs are shorter and manage to involve both pop and Eastern influences. ""Ride My See-Saw"" could be one of the best Hollies song never done by the Hollies. However, the exception that proves the rule here would be ""Legend of a Mind,"" the song that causal listeners think is called ""Timothy Leary"" or ""Timothy Leary's dead,"" or something along those lines:Timothy Leary's dead.No, no, no, no,He's outside looking inNow that Timothy Leary is not only dead but really, most sincerely dead listening to ""Legend of a Mind"" from is a different experience. Leary died in 1996 and his remains were cremated and lauched into the final frontier along with those of ""Star Trek"" creator Gene Roddenberry. The song is associated with the psychadelic period of the Sixties, although it is hard to imagine why given that the lyrics are full of unqualified praise for Timothy Leary and his astral plane:He'll take you up, he'll bring you down,He'll plant your feet back firmly on the ground.He flies so high, he swoops so low,He knows exactly which way he's gonna go.Ray Thomas wrote ""Legend of a Mind"" and also ""Dr. Livingston I Presume,"" the other song on the album that makes acid trips sound like a good idea, in that delightfully eccentric way that make the British so endearing. You keep wanting to suspect that there is something tongue-in-cheek going on here, but, no the group seems to be earnest in its adoration as the CD's new notes by the band members. No wonder the Moody Blues were so popular with the counter-culture. Add to this the Eastern influences that pop up at the end of the album in ""Visions of Paradise"" and ""Om."" Things get a little self-indulgent on this album, but the experimentation pays off big time with their next effort, ""On the Threshold of a Dream.""In 1968 the Moody Blues, which is a much better name than El Riot & the Rebels, consisted of Justin Hayward (vocals, acoustic & electric guitars, 12-string guitar, sitar, harpsichord, piano, Mellotron, bass, percussion, tablas); Mike Pinder (acoustic guitar, cello, autoharp, harpsichord, Mellotron, piano, bass); John Lodge (acoustic guitar, cello, bass, tambourine, snare drum, background vocals); Ray Thomas (C flute, alto flute, soprano saxophone, background vocals); and Graeme Edge (piano, drums, timpani, tambourine, tablas). The point of detailing all this instrumentation is to evidence that the level of experimentation here was at least the equal of what the Beatles were doing during their legendary ""Sgt. Pepper"" period (and Jethro Tull only had one flute). The result was that ""In Search of the Lost Chord"" made it to #23 on the Billboard chart. There were two singles released, ""Ride My See-Saw"" made it to #61 and ""Never Comes the Day"" only got to #91 (A pair of Justin Hawyard songs, ""Voices in the Sky"" and ""The Actor,"" were both released in the U.K. as singles), and to make sure everything is dotted and crossed, the cover art was by Phil Travers."
1,"Joni Mitchell's work is a stream of loving art, art that actually loves. 'Night Ride Home' is an imcomparable CD, easily on a par with 'Dog Eat Dog', 'Turbulent Indigo', and 'Blue'.  Mitchell's musicianship is like a night watchman, faithful and rare and so adeptly attuned.  Everything she touches, when she really touches it, becomes the gold of our lifetimes.  On this disc all the tracks are little wonders; title track, 'Come In From the Cold', 'Passion Play', and 'Only Joy In Town' are as fine as anything Mitchell's written.  Her musical art is so subtle, it gets overlooked, but so what!  Musicians know who and what she is, and what is genius.  That's too hearty a word for her layers of gifts, too rough a praise, but you get the picture... I was listening to the string ideas in the back of 'Two Grey Rooms' driving down the hill tonight-- what an almost Bert Kaempfert feel.  I thought who IS this woman, really? and how is it that her art is so fulsome, and plain wonderful?  Check out this CD and get some light for the night."
1,"Twenty-one-year-old Michael Jackson had just become a major star as a solo performer with his 1979 multi-platinum album OFF THE WALL. He continued to work with his brothers Jackie,Marlon,Tito and Jermaine,despite his newly-gained notoriety. After releasing this album in the spring of 1980,the Jacksons recorded a live album,THE JACKSONS LIVE. On that album,they even performed OFF THE WALL tracks such as the title track. CAN YOU FEEL IT,from this album,kicks butt! The song was later used for JANE FONDA'S WORKOUT RECORD,with Fonda giving aerobics instructions. THIS PLACE HOTEL,written by Michael sounds cool. All the other songs are great although this album didn't win Grammys like OFF THE WALL. At the time of this album's release,OFF THE WALL and ROCK WITH YOU(also from OTW) were in the Top 40. I must admit,this album is triumphant! Also in spring 1980,Jermaine was a solo artist himself. He recorded LET'S GET SERIOUS on the Arista label(he always recorded solo on Arista). Michael,since he and his brothers were dropped from Motown in the 70's,has always recorded on Epic,with and without the other Jacksons."
1,"As with all these ramastered &quot;The Classic Years&quot; albums, it comes with a nice 20 page booklet with all lyrics and photos of EJ and band. Also a 3 1/2 page essay about the album by John Tobler. Also included on the album are 4 bonus tracks. So, even though this wasn't one of Elton John's finest albums, the little extra's make it a must for true Elton fans. The original album only spawned 2 hit songs, but the rest of the album isn't without merits. Among them, &quot;Pinky&quot; is a nice romantic ballad. The album also has some filler though, such as &quot;Grimsby&quot;. But all in all, I'm sure most fans would still like to have it in their collection."
1,"2006's ""on an island"" was a immediate classic in my world, so i had to go back and reinvestigate mr gilmour's back catalouge of solo work, which is only two other albums, sadly. this, his first solo outting, from 1978, is a fine album that i had overlooked all these years. closer in tone to ""dark side of the moon,"" than to ""the wall,"" which his 1984 release ""about face,"" more resembles, this recording is a strong effort, with mr gilmour's relaxed voice and lyrical guitar work shining on nine excellent songs. for me, the real standout on this record is the gorgeous instrumental ""raise my rent,"" which contains heartfelt guitar wizardry that is as fine as any playing to be found by mr gilmour anywhere. all in all, an outstanding rock album. i'm glad i finally got around to it."
1,"It is obvious from opening strains of ""If I Had No Loot"" (Cut # 1) that this is going to be a trip down familiar R &amp; B territory.  Wonderful tracks like the eerily Gaye-esque ""What Goes Around Comes Around"", the Sly Stone-influenced ""My Ex-Girlfriend"", ""Leavin'"", ""Slow Wine"", ""(Lay Your Head on My) Pillow"", ""Fun"" and the monster smash ""Anniversary"" pay homage to the solo artists and groups of the 60's, 70's and 80's that preceded TTT.Raphael's distinctive lead vocals, effective backup vocals and superlative instrumental support make for a dazzling musical excursion.Current ""trendsetters"" like Musiq and India Arie can actually look back at this release as the precursor in the neo-soul movement."
1,"Loved this CD, when I was 12. When it 1st came out. I've been a huge bsb fan. Every sense. The CD was like new, great quality.  No scratches nothing. Now that I have it, it's scratched lol. Played to much! :)"
1,"This is my favorite ABC disk and in my opinion their best. I remember when I bought the album many years ago I was prepared that I might only enjoy the hits I had previously heard and that I would likely dismiss the rest of the album.  Wow, was I wrong!  This album could almost be considered a greatest hits by itself because how good every song is.Now we have a CD version that includes a few remixes.  But the remixes don't stand the test of time as well as the originals.  To me ABC are the culmination of a sound started by Heaven 17 and furthered by Information Society after ABC.  I would love to see someone do new remixes of all the great ABC songs, maybe some sort of tribute remix CD."
1,"Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce aren't to bad either. This is the probably the best of Cream's 4 albums. The classic Sunshine Of Your Love is the best song on the album. It was just one of those songs that totally changed music. Cream was the first real hard rock band. SWLABR(She Walks Like A Bearded Rainbow) has nonsense lyrics but what a great riff. Strange Brew and Tales Of Brave Ulysses are also great classics with a psychedelic twist. The blues of Take It Back, Blue Condition, and Mother's Lament reflect Cream's really soulful side. None of the extended jams like on their first album and really no weak or tiring songs. This is one of the classic albums of 1967. A definite winner."
1,"After scoring an international success with their ""Backstabbers"" album. The O'Jays returned with ""Ship Ahoy""--a masterpiece which included the ageless ""For The Love Of Money and the glorious ballad ""Now That We Found Love"". This album not only helped further cement The O'Jays' status as the premier R&B group of the 1970s it also left no doubt as to Philadelphia International's being the most important and innovative R&B label of the decade.In short, ""Ship Ahoy"" is just as essential as its predecessor."
1,"In 1966, when it was released, this album didn't sell as well as previous Beach Boys albums.  I don't know why.  I thought it was fantastic.  Now it's regarded as a critical success!  Well, I guess better late than never.  The subject matter is mostly boy-girl relationships - ""Sloop John B"" is a notable exception - with a little venturing into the territory of introspection.  But the music!  The melodies and instrumentation rival the music of The Beatles' ""Rubber Soul"" in variety and inventiveness; and like those songs, these manage to display that genius in the standard (then) 3-minute track.  ""God Only Knows"" is one of the most beautiful ballads I have ever heard, and I'm not saying that because of the religious reference, because I am an agnostic.  ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" sounds like a more typical Beach Boys record, but the lyrical content was daring enough to get it banned on some radio stations.  ""Caroline No"" is gorgeous, the lyrics and the music.  This CD gives it all to you in both mono and stereo.  Mono may be OK for sentimental reasons, but I recommend the stereo (Tracks 15-27) for sheer pleasure.  Too bad that Brian Wilson suffered a mental decline after this album.  Who knows what he might have produced?"
1,This is one of my favorite Mary Chapin Carpenter CDs. It deserves to be 5 Stars Plus. He Thinks He'll Keep Her is about a woman and a man being married through the years and one day their love for each other is gone. I Feel Lucky is a song about Her winning the lottery and she tells how she feels lucky about it. My favorite line in the song is hey Dwight hey Lyle boys you don't have to fight doggone I feel lucky tonight. The Bug is about the way life is. You never know if you are the bug or the windshield. My favorite song on this CD is Passionate Kisses. She wants everything a woman should have and passionate kisses also. Not Too Much Too Ask is a wonderful duet with Joe Diffie. I Take My Chances and The Hard Way are also good songs on this CD. She had 7 singles on this CD. The whole CD is very good and if you are a MCC fan then this should be in your collection.
1,"ARS had a run of about 5 recordings in the mid '70's that were some of the most exciting stuff being done this side of the Allman Brothers.  This record was released with great expectations and it probably did more business than any of the others, yet it was a step back as a consistent product.  The peaks-Large Time, Not Gonna Let It Bother Me and the title tune were among the best recordings the band had done.  Imaginary Lover was a twist on the formula for a hit single they found with So Into You from Rock and Roll Alternative.  I found most of the record to be filler.In a pre-Itunes era I would have recommended buying the album.  Now I'd just suggest downloading the three songs that blister and let the rest go-maybe save $10."
1,"This collection is another gem in the cannon of Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel.  The vocal harmonies are at an all time high.  Everyone loves the title track and the 59th Street Bridge Song but Flowers Never Bend In The Rainfall and Cloudy are hidden gems.  Heck almost every song has a beautiful melody. The Poem On The Underground Wall is a possible exception but the lyrics are somewhat captivating. And the Seven O Clock News/Silent Night rings so true with the violence and controvesy of the sixties.  With some of the recent issues in the Middle East, it echoes to our troubles today.Anyway, this music has heart, soul, and feeling with a gentle acoustic flair.  The second one to get after Bridge Over Troubled Waters."
1,"Another fine consistent recording by the Ohio Players. They got real busy and funky with it in the bi-centennial year of 1976. And once again, another fine looking sista' gracing the album cover. I sho nuff dig it!"

1,"I liked this album from the very first time I heard it.This is by no means quintessential Joni.  Nowhere in this album will you hear the vulnerable optimist who weaves complicated poetry, touching its peak with high notes.  That's the Joni Mitchell of BLUE and LADIES OF THE CANYON.  This is a different Joni on a different quest.  And I make no apologies in being a die-hart Mitchell fan who enjoys this CD every chance she gets.These are pop/soft-rock songs, all sung in Joni's lower register with a focus, as always, on lyrics.  The songs are catchy.  They're exactly the upbeat tempo I like to have in my car on the way to work, and they're smoothed out so nicely with a low-riding instrumentation that you can listen to them at the end of the day as well, kick off your shoes, and get into the mellow aspect of these poppy beats.To me, this album is perfect when I'm in a certain mood.  When I need something upbeat, poppy and with flow ... but I'm not in the mood to listen to bland, commercialized lyrics ... this is the perfect mix.  I get my catchy songs - but with Joni-quality lyrics!This is not an example of the folk-song artwork that made her famous.  It's something completely different.  But I'm not always in the mood for folk music!  Sometimes I want to hear something more lively and groovy.  So I'm glad Joni made an album for THAT too.I have a friend who sings the ""Be Cool"" song on this album every time she gets in a fight with her long-term boyfriend.  She said it keeps her from doing something stupid.  Personally, I prefer the ""Man to man"" song because of the mellow beat and the articular lyrics.You just can't dissuade true Joni Mitchell fans.  We want her in all her forms!"
1,"I've been listening to mellencamp for a while now and this was the first album i have purchased of his. This album helps to provide a strong introduction into mellencamp's 80s work. All of his classic 80s songs are here on the album like paper and fire, jack and diane, and authority song."
1,"Stormwind, Screams of Anger and the title tracks are my favorites tracks on a classic 80s album that still holds up today. Europe's second album."
1,"There is an amazing contradiction to Issac Hayes: He wrote for Rufus Thomas, Carla Thomas, Sam and Dave, basically, anyone on Stax in the 1960s. These singles are the example of stripped, driving, Southern soul. Motown was sugar. Stax was salt.But Hot Buttered Soul is Hayes going in the completely oppisite direction. These four tracks are soul, but if soul could be progressive rock, this album would be such. It is almost as if Hayes set out to do the antithisis of his behind the scenes work at Stax.The reason does not matter. This masterpiece does. These four tracks, ""Walk On By,"" ""Hyberbolc......."" ""One Women"" and ""By The Time I Get To Phenoix"" open soul up in new ways. Taken beyond the three minute soul singles Hayes helped invent, soul could be wide open spaces, filled with endless sounds and textures:Listen to the phased guitar on ""Walk On By,"" the way it bulids--slowly--into an orchestral epic. ""Hyberbolic......."" has a bending guitar riff that makes you question who inventived Hardcore Funk jolies--George Clinton or Hayes. ""By The Time I Get To Pheonix"" is soul as cinima.No one really picked up on the mandate Hayes set on this album. (Ok. Maybe the progressivism of Earth Wind and Fire does) Soul seemed to get softer and funk definately got louder. As art rock, soul possibilites were never really explored.But this album is pure invention, and reminds us all, again, when you think outside musical boxes, virtually anything is possible."
1,"I don't need to say much abut this one, exsept everyone who still hasn't bought it or is new 2 rap this is a important record for your collection. 2 discs of mind blowing beats, flows, lyrics. Is has it all. No songs to skip, of course some songs are better than the other. No weak material here and that's unbelievable for being a double disc. This will go down as one the best records ever. If you want rap lyrics visit : [...]Definitely recommend this for the collection if you don't have it yet. Is has plenty of guest and much stuff you can't bump at a party, in your car, at your system wherever you want. If fits everywhere! Be sure to check out &quot;Ressurection&quot; the soundtrack when it drops.One."
1,"The 1954 album Bags Groove by Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants, who feature Thelonious Monk and Sonny Rollins, among others, is one of the best albums of the Miles Davis' early career. The band is incredible, with some of the top musicians of the time and of all time. The songs Doxy and But Not For Me are the least impressive songs on the album and aren't very strong, which slightly hurts the album, but not too much. The title track is great with some inspired trumpet playing by Miles. The two Sonny Rollins tunes, Airegin and Oleo are the highlights of the album. Both are really great songs that would become standards for both Sonny Rollins and Miles Davis. True, this is not the best album by Miles Davis, and maybee not even one of the best. It is still great, however, and is worth it just to hear Miles and Sonny soloing being backed by Monk."
1,"The Reality of My Surroundings is the best album that Fishbone has ever recorded. This album should have made them superstars. Unfortunately, the album came 5 years before their mix of funk, ska, and punk became popular and by that point their best work was behind them.Nearly every track here is strong and their energy and eclecticism reached its apex on this album. The horns are well up in the mix bringing the best out of each track whether it's the soulful pop of ""Everyday Sunshine"" and ""Naz-Tee May'en"" or the heavy rock of ""Fight The Youth"" and ""Behavior Control Technician."" The slower trance like numbers ""Babyhead"" and ""Those Days Were Gone"" are also strong tracks. There is also some excellent ska here with tracks like ""Housework"" and the hyperactive ""Pressure."" Their humor is still intact and very biting as evidenced on the four-part ""If I Were A...I'd"" and the anti-drug track ""Junkies Prayer"" but is not as raunchy as it would become on later albums. ""Sunless Saturday"" may be the strongest track, beginning with an acoustic guitar before going into its chugging riff which carries the track, then fading out before an emotional trumpet solo ends the album. This is an excellent album. Highly recommended to fans of the soulful hard rock of Living Colour and fans of the energetic ska bands from the '90s. Truth And Soul is also a great album by these guys."
1,"This recording is an essential addition to any serious Jazz collection, capturing as it does five Jazz giants recorded together for the one and only time.Charlie Parker is on Alto Sax, Dizzy Gillespie Trumpet, Bud Powell Piano, Charles Mingus bass and Max Roach on drums. From the first number ""Perdido"" you know this something special. A medium tempo version which never stops swinging. Gillespie in particular is in fiery form on this number. On ""Salt Peanuts"" Bud Powell plays a memorable solo, which precedes a thunderous drum solo from Max Roach.The atmosphere is fantastic with the crowd applauding the musicians solos, and sometimes you can hear the musicians cajoaling each other to better performances. Considering the recordings are over fifty years old the sound is pretty good. The only reason this doesn't get five stars is because there is a newer 'complete' version of this recording.Sadly Max Roach the last surviving member of the this quintet has just died."
1,"True hip hop at its purest form was being born wit krs's return of the boom rap... Diz should already be in true heads collection no weak joints. A classic from a genious. Best tracks ? "" mad crew"" , ""sound of the police"" , and , ""stop frontin"" a true classic."
1,"It's real hard to tell which album was OutKast's best. Personally, I reckon ATLiens is BY FAR their most promising and thoughtful albums. OutKast do the unexpected here where they take us on a trip up to space and explore the wonders of life. I can't stress just how DOPE this album is, it has everything: unstoppable production, untouchable lyrics and an unbelievable album cover with art inside the book. Check out Two Dope Boyz, Jazzy Belle and Wheelz of Steel, OutKast extend their knowledge to the very extent where it can't go no more. Also, their flow is so mind-blowing, it'd even confuse the mind of the brainiest person living on earth. And, uh, excuse Ms. Idon'tcare, but don't worry about the beat on E.T., it fits perfectly and is so dark. However, it you want to visit (or revisit) OutKast at their best on here, view 13th Floor/Growing Old. The name itself makes the song look good and I ESPECIALLY love the intro where the man speaks truthfully and fully.Best moments= Jazzy Belle, E.T. and 13th Floor/Growing Old"
1,"There are so many reviews of the albums of The Moody Blues all over the web, so please forgive me if I repeat what anyone had already said or for not being too original in my review. Here is my experience of this remastered edition of ""The Present""...First off, just like the famous early seven CD re-releases by The Moody Blues, whether they be the 1997 remasters or the 2006/2007 expanded editions, we are once again treated to another topnotch remastering job for the CD reissue of ""The Present"" ... What better candidate to have, when it comes to this task, than Moody Blue band member Justin Hayward?! :) Also, notice how the songs sort of segue together, unlike the original CD release from the 80's, where there would be two or three second gaps between the tracks, so once the last droplet of sound fades from a previous song, the next tune picks up right from that point ... This format takes Moody Blues listeners back to the early albums, when there were no silent gaps between the tracks. I'd also like to add that I am very pleased that, after all of the Moody Blues compilations that came out during the 1990's onward, this release features both ""Blue World"" and ""Sitting At The Wheel"" the way they were originally supposed to be presented, not cross-faded into one another, as was the case on ""Time Traveller,"" ""Anthology,"" and ""Gold."" This is also the only place (Just like the original CD release of this album) where you can find a clean fade-out at the conclusion of ""Blue World,"" the way it was originally recorded, not cut short as presented on 1997's ""Best of..."" and the 2007 import, ""Collected.""After ""Seventh Sojourn,"" the latter Moody Blues albums feature synthesizers replacing the mellotrons, as any Moody fan can tell you of course, plus Justin Hayward sings in a more mellow manner than the way he sang on the late 60's/early 70's albums. John Lodge rocks a bit more, at a few points, compared to on the earlier albums (Ex: ""Sitting At The Wheel""). Also, orchestral arrangements grace certain tracks (""Long Distance Voyager""). Not so much spoken-word poetry, either, until ""Strange Times."" Sound-wise, ""The Present"" is loaded with beautiful heavily-echoed, cooing, and buzzing synthesizer sounds (""Blue World,"" ""Going Nowhere""), layered acoustic guitar (""It's Cold Outside Of Your Heart""/""Running Water""), and scattered haunting effects (Ex: The marching drums that open up and close out Lodge's ""Hole In The World""/""Under My Feet"" and the whispering on the Ray Thomas track, ""I Am""). Justin and John also provide combined vocal harmony really well on many of the latter Moody Blues tracks, such as ""Meet Me Halfway."" I also get psyched by the energetic ending of Ray's ""Sorry,"" courtesy of the intense synthesizer and drums, all the way to the fade-out!For the bonus tracks, I was overjoyed to find that the ultra-rare extended mix of ""Sitting At The Wheel"" had been added ... Until now, ""The Universal Masters Collection: Classic Moody Blues"" was the only other release that included this song on CD. Also, the single edit of ""Blue World"" is interesting, with verses rearranged ... This edit was previously featured on CD courtesy of the Moody Blues double-disc compilation, ""The Singles+.""There's more ... The CD booklet that accompanies this release is loaded with photos, lyrics, and a history of the band, so you get your money's worth on not just the disc, but with the insert, too! What an improvement from the simple ""greeting card"" format of the CD ""booklets"" that were featured within the original 1980's CD releases!*One tidbit of interest is that, when the original CD release of ""The Present"" was released, the stereo ""setup"" had been reversed compared to the stereo format from the vinyl and cassette versions of the album (Left-to-right and right-to-left ... Whatever instrumentation was dominant on one stereo channel got switched to the other stereo channel). This remaster features the original stereo setup, as heard on the vinyl and cassette editions. A lot of the synthesizer effects on this album were featured in stereo, as experienced through headphones, so that is one major element to note, when listening to how the stereo setup got reversed, between the two CD's. :)This is what a remastered, reissued CD release should be all about, and this edition of ""The Present"" really satisfies! Congratulations and job well done to Justin Hayward and everyone who worked on this fantastic CD re-release! Now, let's all hope and pray for some remasters of ""The Other Side Of Life,"" ""Sur La Mer,"" ""Keys Of The Kingdom,"" a return of the ""This Is The Moody Blues"" and ""Legend Of A Band"" compilations, and also a return of the version of ""Strange Times"" that featured the bonus tracks, ""Highway"" and ""This Is The Moment"" ... Then, I'm sure we'll all be joyous and grateful ""Moodies"" fans. :) Thanks for reading and God Bless!~KevyGuy :)* * * * * * *"
1,"I agree with most reviews that this is a good cd.  BUt I think it will please mostly those that are aware of his radio hits.  Not to say that the collection is not good, but with only one cd, you cannot cover the talent of JM appropriately.  I myself rock out to this, especially in the car.  However, it really makes me want to take out the full albums and lisen to them in their entirety."
1,"I enjoy the music on this CD very much.  Many, many other people apparently feel the same way because, in the early 70's, TAPESTRY was on the Billboard Pick 100 for more than 250 weeks -- a record at the time.  Sometimes, when I listen to this music, it strikes me as maudlin and whiney.  Other times, it seems to express exactly what I am feeling.  When I feel lonely, I often hear Carole King sing, &quot;So far away / Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more? &quot;  If you are interested in beautiful music with insightful and sensitive lyrics, or you are interested in folk music of the early seventies, this CD will be interesting to you."
1,Kansas had such Hits a &#34;Dust in the wind&#34; AND &#34;Point of know return&#34;.  I would recommend this album to anyone who is looking for Classic Rock from the 1970s/1980s!!!.
1,"Positives: A really laid back album that'll keep you in a relaxed mood. Both members of Underground Kings have really distinct voices and tight Southern accents. An all around nice album to bump when you just want to sit back and chill.Negatives: Nothing here for those who want inventive or &quot;meaningful&quot; topics in their rap. This isn't exactly Dead Prez or Common. These guys don't have the lyrical skills of someone like Pac, Eminem, or Canibus."
1,"This album will undoubtedly remain one of the best rap albums of all time.  Pac rips it on every track, never falling short of excellent.  &quot;Ambitionz Az A Ridah&quot; is a rap anthem and it's highly unfortunate that Fabolous though that he could do the song any justice.  Eyez proves that it has major staying power it is almost always played at any hood party, with everyone their singing the lyrics to every song.  The title track is amazing, with the haunting beat and Pac's exceptional delivery.  &quot;Life Goes On,&quot; &quot;Only God Can Judge Me,&quot; and &quot;Tradin War Stories&quot; let us take a peek a 2Pac's heart, and we found it's one that we related to.  This is a lyrical masterpiece, to be forever remembered and played."
1,"Clive Gregson started his career by writing great Elvis Costello-influenced pop songs and this disc features quite a few of them. The problem is that Any Trouble was influenced by Elvis Costello in the same way an avalanche is influenced by tumbling rocks. As the old adages go: imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and flattery will get you nowhere."
1,"This CD is most definitely Luther's all-time best and most important work. Timeless ballads like ""Wait For Love"", ""Creepin'"", ""Other Side Of The World"" and (particularly) Luther's stunning remake of Brenda Russell's ""If Only For One Night"" make this CD indispensable for any serious Soul fan. Although Luther went on to record many fine albums throughout the years ""The Night I Fell In Love"" remains an ageless masterpiece yet to be equalled. No serious R&B fan should miss out on this CD."
1,Alison Krauss has one of the most beautiful voice.  Her band is really good too.  Easy listening.  Easy to hum or sing along.
1,Eric Clapton at his best... AND all his friends could play da#n good too.Excellent 2 cd set. The extras are worth the price of admission by themselves. You wont be disappointed..........support your favorite artists.
1,This is the second Album from a great band that can out of Australia I have their first album called Business as Usual this was another wonderful album from the group I have not been disappointed. Another great group from the 80's this is agreat addition from the 80's to anyone's collection
1,"Ok, we all know the deal about half of this not really being recorded live, but SO WHAT?! It's still great JB and the fakery is not very obvious. This is perhaps the best version of &quot;Bewildered&quot; I've ever heard, as is true with other frequently recorded JB standards like &quot;If I Ruled The World,&quot; &quot;Give It Up Turn It Loose,&quot; &quot;Please Please,&quot; etc. Oh yeah, the instrumental &quot;Lowdown Popcorn&quot; is also quite a treat. Enjoy."
1,"Many people under the age of 50 probably have an image of the older Frank Sinatra, belting out &quot;New York, New York,&quot; or clowning with Sammy, Dean, and Joey in some Rat Pack picture.One listen to &quot;Songs for Swingin' Lovers,&quot; however, it quickly becomes obvious that Frank Sinatra was more than just an aging lounge singer, and this album is one of the landmark albums of the 20th century.From the beginning chords of &quot;You Make Me Feel So Young,&quot; which opens the albums, Sinatra and arranger Nelson Riddle are in prime form. The hits keep coming, &quot;It Happened in Monterey,&quot; &quot;You're Getting to Be a Habit With Me,&quot; &quot;Pennies from Heaven,&quot; &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin,&quot; &quot;Makin' Whoopee,&quot; &quot;Anything Goes,&quot; etc. Sinatra's singing is impeccable and the Nelson Riddle Orchestra swings.This album, along with Sinatra's &quot;A Swingin' Affair,&quot; are generally regarded as among his best, and among the top albums of all time. These are the first of the &quot;concept&quot; albums, and, along with &quot;Sings for Only the Lonely,&quot; provide examples of why Sinatra was considered one of our most important artists. If you like music, any kind of music, then you need to have these in your CD library."
1,"A New World Record being ELO's 6th studio album and their 1976 release and is a great mix of rock and art rock. The album did well with the critics and the public at large. It reached top ten both on the Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart. Allmusic and Roliing Stone both gave it favourable reviews. All the lyrics are included and we also get a list of whom plays what and in this list they have listed what brand of instruments they have used during the recording which is quite interesting. We also get a photograph of the band from the time of the release of the album. Tracks that I especially like on this record are ""Telephone Line"", ""So Fine"" and ""Livin' Thing"". 4/5."
1,"This is an essential Elton John recording if you're interested in hearing his finest tunes from what many regard as the finest period in Elton's career, from 1970 to 1976, when he recorded over fifteen albums worth of material; primarily with his original band featuring Davey Johnstone on guitars, Dee Murray on bass, Nigel Olsson on drums and Ray Cooper on percussion. This splendid compilation covers Elton's hit singles from &quot;Elton John&quot;, &quot;Honky Chateau&quot;, &quot;Don't Shoot Me...&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; and &quot;Caribou&quot;. Without question, these are some of the best rock and roll tunes and ballads that the John/Taupin songwriting team crafted; all of these are still legendary parts of the pop music canon."
1,"Living Color weren't a bad band - well, they weren't exactly a good band either, but their real problem was that no band could support the weight of expectation that was dumped on them.  They were supposed to be funky, rocky, metallic, sexy, full of attitude and yet also saying something really intelligent about the condition of being black in America.  Nobody could live up to all that, and sure enough, they didn't.  Unfortunately, less intelligent white bands (such as Guns & Roses, on their first album) made better music, simply because they didn't have to represent as much ephemeral politico-musical hee-haw as Living Color were being asked to.It doesn't help that Vernon Reid is not nearly so exciting or even interesting a guitarist as his many supporters seem to think, and that Corey Glover is a one-dimensional and joyless singer with a boring line in lyric-writing.  Apart from the edgy and genuinely menacing 'Middle Man' this album sounds like Van Halen with the fun taken out, and when you take the fun out of Van Halen there isn't a lot left.They made another album which lacks even more lustre.  It's a mystery to me why Living Color got so much hype based on so little achievement, while the truly great, majestic, inspirational and hellacious black rock band of the 1980s - Bad Brains - was allowed to languish in indie hell for the whole decade."
1,"Recently I've had the misfortune to buy cheap Bob Dylan cds only to go to a different store about a week later and see that there is a remastered version of the album (usually double the price of the older cd I'd bought). This seems to have happened again. I probably don't have the remastered version of ""Blood on the tracks"", but seeing as the older version is discontinued, I might as well post my review for the current edition.I've taken to buying Dylan albums recently as I wanted to properly hear songs that I was unaware of, but sounded interesting on documentaries on the man (great songs like ""Masters of war"" or ""Pawn in their game""). Then I started a poll on the top 3 Bob Dylan cds, which made me want to have a reasonable sample to choose from, to give my top 3. At the moment, I've given 1st place to ""The freewheelin' Bob Dylan"". 2nd place is held by ""The times they are a changin'"". Both of those albums are reviewed at this site by me. Initially, I gave my 3rd pick to ""Blonde on blonde"". Currently, I'm giving that spot to ""Blood on the track"". Reasons? Well, I'm not a huge fan of Dylan and folk...sure, I like some of it. Even consider some songs to be masterpieces (like ""Masters of war"" and ""The times they are a changin'""). So, it's not a simple matter of tallying up all the great and good songs on albums and ranking them, like I can do for pop/rock records. My method has to change. With that in mind, I vote ""Freewheelin'"" as a great, up-beat, accoustic folk album. ""The times they are a changin'"" is a terrific album for more down-beat, accoustic folk. ""Blood on the tracks"" is my third pick because it offers up something different, again...mellow, gentle songs.My picks as the best songs from this album:Tangled up in blue: features delicate sounding accoustic guitars. Has a harmonica outro. Dylan's lyrics are rambling in this song, but not to any great detriment. Compared to his earliest albums, you get a very good stereo sound-stage on this song.Meet me in the morning: steel string guitar features in this song. In fact, the guitar has an interesting sound to it in this song. An electric guitar also features, giving the song a country feel to it. The lyrical style takes a bluesy form to it. Song has bass and drums.If you see her say hello: features delicate sounding steel string accoustic guitars, as well as a weird sounding string instrument (not sure what kind...perhaps of Russian or Greek origin?). Song also features an organ. Nice and mellow feel to this song. My cd seems to have a glitch around the 2:47 mark...a nice melodic progression seems to skip a few steps. Not sure if that is a problem with my cd or the master tape.Shelter from the storm: more delicate, accoustic, steel string guitar. Bass features too. Did find the lyrics work better in this song than Dylan's more rambling songs. He returns to the title often, like a chorus.Buckets of rain: although this song has delicate, accoustic guitar, steel string guitar, the strings seem high tensile, giving the guitar an interesting sound in this song. This song does seem to have some distortion in it, which I'm guessing is unintentional.This album does have, for the most part, a uniformity of sound (delicate, accoustic guitar), which makes it mellow and easy-listening. The lyrics tend to the ""slice of life"" range, and focus on themes such as relationships.Lyrically, the songs are more narrative in style. This can veer to being more a shaggy dog story than a narrative, as for songs like ""Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts"". Whereas the other songs on this album don't really go for verse,chorus,verse structure of modern pop, they can wash over you pleasantly nonetheless. However, songs like ""Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts"" and ""Idiot wind"" are more demanding to listen to. For that reason, I'd say that those two songs are really out of step with the rest of the album. In fact, I'd call them 'expendable'. Both of these songs are epic (""Idiot wind"" runs at 7:45 and ""Lily..."" runs at just under 9 minutes). They give the album its longish running time (at just over 50 minutes). Two shorter songs to replace them, in keeping with the tone of the rest of the album would have been preferable. However, if you like Dylan's more demanding to listen to songs (especially the pinnacle of that oevre, in ""Hurricane""), you may get more out of those two songs than I did.The attraction of this album is that it offers up something different from Dylan-apart from his upbeat, or downbeat albums. It's gentle and relaxing...accoustic guitars, delicate drumming, organ (Hammond?)."
1,"It's nothing short of awesome to hear these three guitar greats come together. Albert Collins was one of the BEST blues guitarists in the world. Any recording which features him is going to be worthwhile. Robert Cray is  very good too and has a wonderful voice. Johnny Copeland contributes some  nice vocals and guitar licks, but I'm not as familiar with him as I am  Albert and Robert. There are only two downsides to this wonderful CD.  First, the sound quality isn't as good as it could be. It definitely sounds  its age. I know that Alligator is not a huge record label, but it would be  nice if they could remaster and rerelease some of their titles such as this  one. Second drawback is that the album is too short! It's so good that you  don't want it to end. It's not much longer than half an hour. But it is  good stuff. If you like guitar-based blues, BUY this CD!"
1,"&quot;Everything's Different Now,&quot; the third and final album from the 'Til Tuesday stage of Aimee Mann's career, constitutes more reliance on production aspects than the group's earlier work. You will also notice more reliance on vocal harmonies on many of the tracks as the group continued to move away musically from its more minimalist beginnings. There is a sense in which this constitutes more a sense towards the popular (nee commercial) spectrum of the industry. Certainly the title song, &quot;Rip in Heaven&quot; and &quot;(Believed You Were) Lucky&quot; are more upbeat than the more somber tunes that populated earlier albums. In that regard &quot;The Other End (of the Telescope&quot; and &quot;Crash and Burn&quot; are the most conventional 'Til Tuesday song on the album. Consequently, the music gets a bit more in the way of Aimee Mann's lyrics than before, but by now we all recognize that she is a poet, whose lyrics are clearly above and beyond the vast majority of other songwriters. This is one of those albums where you open up the little booklet and look at the words."
1,"I have bought this album twice as an LP, and 4 times as a CD.  It is sort of a hobby, the Recordings of Derek and the Dominos.  I have a lot of the bootlegs as well, most barely listenable.Anyway, the different versions of LAOALS all had one thing in common...when the song playing had a lot of tracks going, they became muddied.  Also, treble and midrange seemed muted.The SACD version, when played on my high end multichannel system, is a revelation.  Folks, it sounds unlike any other version.  Vocals come through the center speaker with all the nuances of the tone and breath control. You can make out the words in every song.  For example, ""Tell the Truth"" and its previously slurred vocal by Whitlock and Clapton is now crystal clear.  So THAT is what they were saying!  'Where You're going or been'....ah ha!Rhythm and second guitars are clear in the rear channels, piano AND organ on most tracks, by golly, lots of unheard percussion tracks now stand out, things that were overwhelmed before you now hear.  The mix puts different emphasis on some of the guitar parts that you had to really strain to hear before, changing how the song sounds.  If you have ""The Layla Sessions"" track charts, you can now hear all the things claimed to have been laid down, but were just not discernible before.I don't know if this is good or bad, but it does allow you to hear everything.  How this jives with the original intent of the band, engineer or mixer's intents, I have no idea.  Perhaps we got the mixes we did due to technological limitations from 38 years ago.It is STILL Layla, there is STILL the awesome guitar interplay between the two all world guitarists.  But, this version you get to hear it all, all the rest of the song.  I simply view it as the version where you get to hear everything that was recorded.The one complaint I have with this SACD multichannel version is that Carl Radle's bass is undermixed.  I'd say 80% of the multichannel classic rock mixes I have the bass is undermixed as well, but the only ones fainter than this SACD are the quad mixes you get with the Moody Blues offerings.  It is almost impossible to adjust the bass enough, to coax it out of those mixes.  It is just buried.  Conversely, the bass is overmixed in one just one SACD I have, ""Cheap Thrills"".  You actually have to turn it down.  Anyway, to get the subwoofer on Layla to play loud enough you have to adjust the other 5 channels down and the SW up.  A lot.  And, as most of you know if you have read this far, that usually puts the bass drumm pedals played by the drummer too loud and punchy.  And, no one ever accused Jim Gordon of being shy on the bass pedals.I bought the 40th anniversary super duper deluxe version, the one that Amazon doesn't offer anymore.  It features a 5.1 DVD-A disc, a different mix than the SACD.The DVD-A mix puts Carl's bass right up front where it belongs, fat and loud enough to not need adjusting.  To my ears the DVD-A is a bit clearer, and the keyboards can be heard a bit better.  There is piano and organ on at least half of the songs, and it is hard to hear both, even with the SACD.  You can pick both out easier on the DVD-A.Like the SACD, a song with Duane on it (all but the first three of course, we all know that)will have his guitar on the left, Eric on the right.  Overdubs tend to be in the middle, and Duane usually only has one track per song featuring him.  On the DVD-A the two guitarists seem to be just a bit more separated than on the SACD.  Not good or bad, just a bit different.  Jim's drums, which were recorded on two tracks, thank goodness, are spread a bit wider on the front listening spectrum.All of this is to my ear, of course.  The DVD-A is just a tiny bit better, mostly because of the bass being mixed right.  Worth 100 dollars give or take?  Who knows.  You can't go wrong with either multi channel version."
1,"Absolutely essential.  Jim Capaldi, Steve WInwood, and Dave Mason are at their creative peaks.  Had I known how exceptional this album was, I would have picked it up sooner.  Songs like &quot;You Can All Join In,&quot; &quot;Pearly Queen,&quot; &quot;Forty Thousand Headmen,&quot; and all the other tracks on this album epitomize the special qualities attributed to 1960s classic rock.  I especially dig Winwood's vocals with the flute din backdrop...real cool!"
1,"Not too many good tunes on this one...probably his weakest pre-1980 cd. There was a reason back then when I finally tuned Elton out of my vinyl collection . The succession of Caribou, Rock of the Westies, and Captain Fantastic all fell off sharply from Honky Chateau, Yellow Brick Road, and Don't Shoot Me......This one appears to be a throw in and more of a hodge podge of songs as opposed to the mood/theme albums he is noted for.IMO;  part of a decline in the mid 70's and continuing on until his very good cd ""Sleeping with the Past"" (1989)...and don't miss ""The One"" which was complied around 1992 in Germany and later introduced as an import to the US in 1998. These latter two cd's have great musical arrangement and excellent tonal qualities. Quite nice if you like music that is clean, deep and uncluttered.(imports are generally noted for better sound quality)"
1,"The world of Charity of Night seems one of fear and blindness, of mob hits (""Charity of Night"") and prison, whether of the heart (""Pacing the Cage"") or of metal (""Night Train"", ""Birmingham Shadows""), of police states and dissidents.  But the lyrics and the music itself points to a hope beyond the darkness, although certainly one of Cockburn's intentions is, Brecht-like, to create enough angst in us to not forget that there is a world rife with....well, what shall we call it? Terror?  Sin?  Bad Guys?  beyond our speakers. Bruce is a superb musician and his voice is haunting.  A jewel among the Cockburn collection."
1,"This is by far the weakest of the Moodies' 1st 7 albums. &quot;Departure,&quot; &quot;Ride My See-Saw,&quot; &quot;Legend of a Mind,&quot; &quot;Voices in the Sky,&quot; &quot;The Actor&quot; &amp; &quot;The Word&quot; R all classics -- they've all got that great &quot;moody&quot; atmosphere, &amp; the vocals &amp; keyboards R gorgeous. But the rest is WILDLY uneven, &amp; &quot;Om&quot; is the stupidest thing the Moodies ever did.The rest is no bargain: &quot;Dr. Livingstone I Presume&quot; is silly; &quot;House of Four Doors&quot; is pointless &amp; endless; &quot;Best Way to Travel&quot; is a weak Mike Pinder tune; &quot;Visions of Paradise&quot; is a not-quite-good Justin Hayward number. None of these tracks will change yr life.A bonus track would've helped: On the 2-album THIS IS THE MOODY BLUES best-of you'll find &quot;Simple Game,&quot; the original B-side 2 the &quot;Ride My See-Saw&quot; single -- I think it's Mike Pinder's best song EVER (those &quot;doo-doo-doo&quot; choruses'll get U every time!), &amp; they shoulda included it here. Woulda raised my rating 2 3-1/2 stars at least!Overall: This is the most dated &amp; uneven Moodies LP. I'd save buying it til U have the rest of the 1st 7, LONG DISTANCE VOYAGER, Hayward &amp; Lodge's BLUE JAYS, &amp; THE PRESENT. This sure ain't no 4got10 classic."
1,"Horizontal is the Bee Gee second English released album. It also has the coolest looking cover in my opinion.  In this 1967 release the brothers are breaking away from their prior Beatle-esque sound and going for a more psychedelic British Invasionpop.The album begins strongly with World. It's somewhat depressing lyrics are repeated and crescendo as the song closes. World is a great opener, combining the old with this new touch of psychedelic.And The Sun Will Shine, however, is the complete opposite of World. Today, nearly 40 years after its release, this is still one of the most often quoted songs by the Robin faithful.  My niece is almost seven and she loves this song! It's ironic, since most of the lyrics make no sense, as manyof the early Robin songs don't. His quavering delivery is impeccable.  The one line that makes any sense, 'Love to me is life, and I live you', may be the definitive if one had to summarize the late sixties Robin. (Fans of this version should also hear the live rendition on One Night Only. Perhaps tops the original!  )Lemons Never Forget is the album's first true psychedelic outing. I got into some trouble in my household for going around singing the opening lyric, `Incidently there should be some changes made.'  Barry is very strong here. His voice is somehow harder or more edgy then the soft Beatle-esque sound or the breathy sound that would follow. Combined with the heavy music, the style is surprising and effective.Really and Sincerely is the second sorrowful Robin outing. Those who do not like his early sound (My mother!) may not like this album.  However in my opinion, one can never get bored with this album do to the constant vocal rotation betweenthe brothers. The placement of the track list is well done. Really and Sincerely's one fault is that its two songs after And The Sun Will Shine. It has a very `old world' and operatic feel. Very beautiful to fall asleep to!Birdie Told Me sounds more like the songs on First. It's got a sweet and simple sixties melody combined with a very easy listening Barry. The harmonies are also top notch. Some say its too simple, and it is a bit short, but when listening you can follow the story from the breakup to the moving on. A surprisingly happy sounding song, given its subject matter.With The Sun In My Eyes is the return to mellow. Again a very beautiful song, except we've already hear two similar songs. It's almost as if Horizontal is two different albums, one mellow, one psychedelic.  Some may like that, others may not. You listen and decide!Next are the two more upbeat songs on Horizontal. Massachusetts is such a great song, The Bee Gees first Number One.  It's a great against type song, talking about staying home instead of going to San Francisco. You can't help but get into thissong. This is my father's favorite. When my sister saw One Night Only for the first time, she was surprised at 'the other two brothers' singing.  My Dad exclaimed, 'You mean you've never heard Massachusetts?!'Fast in pace is the next song, Harry Braff. This to me is the `fun' song on this album. At first listen I thought they were saying `Chicken' instead of `Checkered'.  It's up and down beat will either tap your foot or drive you insane. It almost sounds like the racing cars the song describes. Very 60s and very British.Daytime Girl is the Maurice outing of the album. His voice is soft and has just the right amount of spacey edge for the lyrics. I'm not sure exactly what he is talking about, but this tune reminds me of Lesbian Seagull in Beavis and Butthead! Worth the listen though, if only to hear Mo. Unfortunately, Maurice's early leads tend to show him as weak lyrically. On the next two albums, Suddenly and My Thing also don't do Mo justice.  I'm not sure any song does. Maurice is at his best harmonizing and arranging and strengthening Barry and Robin. His accent sounds cool in this one though.Where Daytime Girl was the sort of slow psychedelic. There is no mistaking the last three tracks. The Earnest Of Being George is the tenth track, but I swear I never hear the title uttered in the song. This is another one that seems to make no sense, but its irregular stops and starts are an unexpected bonus, in addition to the uniquely placed harmonies. The Change is Made is probably the best psychadelic on the album. The lyrics are almost understandable and the sound is excellent. Barry is on form. If I had to pick one word to describe this song its 'fresh'.The album concludes with the title song. Horizontal is both psychedelic and mellow. Again the Bee Gees start and finish strong with this song, similar to World. The odd harmonies and irregular holds on notes are almost over the top, but it works. Several B sides and singles from this album, found on The Tales From The Brothers Gibb Cd, further show the branching out The brothers were experimenting with. Sir Geoffrey Saved The World, Barker of The UFO, and Sinking Ships are quirks, but the hit Words would go on to exemplify the broken hearted sound.The album Horizontal is a pivotal step in The Bee Gees transition from Beatle imitators to the broken hearted song maestros we know today. Each 60s album, in my opinion tops the previous album. Without Horizontal, The Bee Gees would not have had the early and subsequent success that they did.  I Love My 60s Bee Gees!"
1,"This was my favorite of all the Dylan albums that came after his first wave.  I think it's one of his best 2 or 3 of all time.  Hootie and the Blowfish loved Tangled Up In Blue so much that they imitated it and lifted  some of the lyrics.  Joan Baez covered Simple Twist of Fate, even mimicking  Dylan's voice on one verse.  Lily Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts is a  great cowboy story, believe it or not, and a masterpiece.  One of my all  time favorite Dylan lyrics is Idiot Wind.  You're an eeeyidiot babe!  It's  a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  Reminds me of my old boss.  Nobody can put so much feeling into the word idiot as Dylan."
1,"After the brilliant,yet bewildered &quot;Journey Through The Secret Life Of Plants&quot;,Stevie rushed out(by his standards) with Hotter Than July,the true follow-up to Songs In The Key Of Life.The fact that it isn't up to the standards of the Talking Book or Innervisions is already a constant,but it brings a closure to a winning streak of albums that began with 1972's Music Of My Mind(or 71's Where I'm Coming From according to true Stevie fans).Every cut is a stand-out especially Master Blaster,All I Do,I Ain't Gonna Stand For It(a country tinged tune worthy of a Garth Brooks cover),and the much interpretated classic Lately.The final cut,the MLK-tribute Happy Birthday brings the album to a glorious open-ended finish as well as beautifully closes the book on this Wonder-ful chapter of his career."
1,"An enduring classic indeed.  These songs are all gems.  The title track stands out not only because of its poignant lyrics but mainly due to the beautiful arrangement and instrumentation.  Art Garfunkel's crowning moment as a singer.And oh what other great tunes.  The Only Living Boy In New York is an underatted gem. Just love the tone between the vocals and the instrumental support.  Cecilia, Baby Driver, Bye Bye Love, and meandering ballad The Boxer are all great songs to sing  along to.  Song For The Asking is pretty way to close this chock full of classics recording.One of the few times, an recording group concluded with their best original work.  Paul Simon wnet on to record some excellent solo material but truthfully this recording may be his best one of them all."
1,"After releasing two unsuccesful solo CD's, Johnny Gill came into promise when he joined New Edition for their 1988 4x plantium CD Heartbreak. Johnny Gill re-established himself as a solo artist in 1990, and he did so in tremendous fashion, recording an astonishing self-titled debut for Motown that brought together the hitmaking duos Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis and L.A. & Babyface to produce an album chock-full of hits. The combination of these two duos was unprecedented. Along with Teddy Riley, they had dominated late-'80s urban radio, utterly and absolutely, churning out hit after hit after hit and co-defining the burgeoning new jack swing movement in the process. Gill likewise had recently experienced enormous success during the late '80s when, following two flat solo albums for Atlantic, he joined New Edition for its Heart Break album and its long run of hits, including ""Can You Stand the Rain,"" a number one hit that featured him prominently. Thus it was only fitting that Motown's visionary teaming of these artists at their respective primes culminated in a set of wonderful songs, chief among them ""Rub You the Right Way"" (a Jam & Lewis production) and ""My, My, My"" (L.A. & Babyface). The former was a high-energy, pleading chart-stormer that infiltrated urban radio with brute force and sent Gill straight up the charts in the process; the song furthermore became a coast-to-coast club favorite - and remained so for years upon years afterward, standing tall as one of the definitive new jack swing anthems of the era. The latter was the yin to ""Rub You the Right Way""'s yang; it became a quiet storm favorite and even crossed over to the pop and smooth jazz markets, reprising many of the same qualities that had made Babyface's own ""Whip Appeal"" single such an across-the-board chart-topper only a year earlier. While nothing else on Johnny Gill quite rivaled ""Rub You the Right Way"" and ""My, My, My,"" the remainder of the album still had more than its fair share of highlights. There was a second round of singles (""Fairweather Friend"" was another new jack stepper, ""Wrap My Body Tight"" another slow jam), as well as a couple of excellent album tracks (""Feels So Much Better"" and ""Giving My All to You"") that could have been hits for anyone else"
1,"After steadily reestablishing his place in the pop world beginning with his country hits in the late 1970s' and his haunting rerecording of ""In Dreams"" from David Lynch's 1986 classic ""Blue Velvet,"" Roy Orbison declared he was back and here to stay with 1988's excellent ""Mystery Girl,"" a stunning testament to the timelessness of his voice and music, launching a remarkably lauded comeback that was unfortunately cut short by his untimely death on December 6th, 1988.Orbison had quite a bit of help from his friends on the record, namely his Traveling Wilburys companions Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and especially Jeff Lynne; indeed, that jangly Wilburys sound is all over the record, yet the record is still distinctly an Orbison record, and most of these songs could have just as easily been recorded at the height of his 1960's heyday. This is especially true of the record's lead track, ""You Got It,"" a perfect pop song that recalls ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" with its pulsating guitar riff and soulful Orbison vocal. This song deservedly became a major hit for Orbison at a time when most of his peers were doing county fairs.The rest of the record keeps at this remarkably high standard; ballads like ""A Love So Beautiful"" and the haunting ""She's a Mystery to Me"" showcase the power Orbison's voice the same way ""Crying"" and ""It's Over"" did 20 years prior, while ""All I Can Do (Is Dream You)"" is another perfect pop song. ""California Blue"" is a shimmering love song that Orbison finds himself at home with, but Elvis Costello's ""The Comedians"" takes the crown as the record's best song, with Orbison tenderly crooning some of the most original and aching lyrics ever in a ballad. The closing, regretful ""Careless Heart"" is also worth noting. ""Windsurfer"" is the weak link on the record, but is still worth noting.""Mystery Girl"" is an absolute masterpiece, showcasing one of the greatest vocalists still at the top of his game. Listening to this record, you can't help but feel anguish at the peaks Orbison still could've hit had he not died. Still, for a final record, you can't get much better than ""Mystery Girl."""
1,"Patty Smyth is one of my favourite female vocalists.  The problem is, there are so many female vocalists nowadays (the lilith genre), that Patty gets lost in tha mix. I always forget about her music.  But then when i  stumble across this album, i say &quot;oh yeah, forgot about this&quot; and  play it. Then i get rocked. I have listened to this album for over 10  years. &quot;The Warrior&quot; was like my theme song when I was 14 years  old.  I enjoy the whole album but &quot;hands tied&quot; and &quot;less  than half&quot; are my faves. I could listen to those songs a million  times.Patty Smyth is an overlooked musical rock goddess. Her voice has  got so much soul and strenth it cuts straight to the heart.  She puts  sirens like Jewel and Faith Hill to shame. I am wondering when she'll  release another album? Rock on, Patty."
1,"Along with 'Kind of Blue' and 'Songs In The Key of Life', this cd, album, whatever...is the absolute embodiment of what music is about.  Marvin was touched by the all-encompassing spirit that moves through and around all of us.  'What's Going On' speaks to a place in us that can only be described as seminal, pure, suigeneris...priceless."
1,"A light strum of an Indian tambura, similar to a sitar but fretless and used primarily as a drone sound, opens the album which is about to transport you In SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD.  An eerie chord starts low and begins to build, a sound you can't quite identify although it is made by a mellotron, it lifts and swells while an easy-at-first, gentle voice of a Mad Hatter recites his poem introduction to the journey, his voice quickly raising to manic and breaking up into hysterical laughter...in search of...[indistinguishable]...the accompanying bass and sitar you barely noticed now disappear into a roar of electric guitar rock and roll and harmonized vocals.  It is a catchy song featuring the standard lead electric guitar, bass, drums, tambourine, and incredibly 5-part harmony vocals with a mellotron drone.  Well this IS rock and roll and Ride My See Saw has a curious distinction of being the first ever 8-track multi-track recorded single in the fast-paced evolution of stereophonic rock being pioneered by The Beatles at the time.  The Moody Blues actually pioneered 8-track stereo with DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED a year before this.  As high-energy rock fades away, the ""search"" is clearly in the hands of some great explorers, Dr David Livingstone, Captain Robert Scott, and even Christopher Columbus.  It is a child-friendly composition, still in keeping with the previous instrumentation, and has a Ringo-leading-Beatles-song sort of styling.  But the trip is about to take a new turn.  These Moody Blues don't do anything easy!  They even play all their own instruments.  Ray Thomas remembers being handed an oboe, the rest of the group leaves to lunch and tells him to learn it by the time they get back.  Oh very funny!  Yes Ray is a flute player, a very good one, but an oboe is a reed instrument and takes care as well as time.  None the less, The Moody Blues return and there with bleeding lips, Mr Thomas is ready to record!  Now that is dedication.  Dr Livingstones explorations of Africa have led you to The House Of Four Doors and creakily we are going to open each and every one of them!  Mind you the fabulous Moodies are going to play: acoustic guitar, bass guitar, cello, mellotron, harpsichord, piano, flute, oboe, and drums, all themselves on just this song.  Each of the four doors, as it opens during the first part of the song, leads to a new discovery symbolized by four distinct periods of western music: 1st door, acoustic guitar (lute style) and flute in a medieval minstrel gait; 2nd door, harpsichord and cello duet done in the baroque style of classic music; 3rd door, mellotron and piano in ""classical"" music flourish; and finally the 4th door opens to the Moody Blues classic Legend Of A Mind, a psychedelic rock piece in part homage to and in part dissociative psychology of  1960's Harvard professor and guru of LSD, Timothy Leary.  Dr Leary advocated the spiritual and mind-opening benefits of hallucinogenic drugs and published his semi-autobiographical and semi-spiritual guide writings in a book The Politics Of Ecstasy.  Ray Thomas' composition uses the flute as lead instrument in a beautiful ""trip"" but the solemn fact of the matter, both in lyrics and in reality, is that the search along these lines is pointless and fruitless.  As the songs closes, a drumming and mellotron reintroduction to the House Of Four Doors lets the listener know that nothing was found here in the search and so we move on.  Side two of the original album opened with the plaintively gorgeous Justin Hayward composition Voices In The Sky, a rather introspective and poetically lyrical piece featuring acoustic guitar and flute as well as the usual mellotron layers, and an Eastern music tinge with tablas accompanying the western drums.  The tabla is a membrane covered drum similar to bongos but much more tympanic giving the sound a devotional effect.  The Hindu influence in music begins to take more hold as Voices segues into The Best Way To Travel, which according to songwriter and vocalist Pinder, is ""thinking""!  Electric guitar and sitar accompany mellotron, acoustic guitar and flute in an unusual composition which explores Pinder's thinking.  There is very wide stereo panning (commonly called ping pong stereo) which was simply captured in the day by pan pots on a 4-track console with 20 microphone inputs.  During the middle ""exploration"" the mellotron was set up with an intensely high-frequency register that took the listener around in a 360 degree turn.  The next song in the search is perhaps the most beautifully expressive, a collaboration between Hayward's gentle vocal prowess and Thomas' gorgeous flute.  Visions Of Paradise brings back the sitar and tambura as well as tabla drums in a melding of eastern and western musical influences.  One of the Moody Blues biggest fan favorites Justin and Ray made several well liked and praised songs together, this being the archetype of their collaborations.  Visions... then segues into The Actor by Justin Hayward.  This is one of his signature love ballads, the type of song he became famous for, ""the curtain rises on a scene"" and a young woman falls in love with the actor.  Of course the actor does not even know she exists so there is no requited love interest and only the fantasy of the young woman.  Ray actually plays the French horn here as well as flute, embellishing the song for a feel of the ""search"" by way of internalized love, but the real hero here is some of Justin's best vocals complete with catchy hooks.  The song was ripe for adult contemporary hit-making but took a while for those of us who were young back then to grow it into our arsenal of pure loving ballads.  The Word brings us back around to the beginning again, with Pinder now reciting Edge's poetry in a continuation from the Departure.  Pinder usually, but not always, read Graeme Edges penned pieces, and here we finally reach the end of the ""search"" with Mike Pinder's soothing deep voice who reveals that the answer is in a Word and the Word is OM!  Om utilizes every eastern musical instrument in the Moody Blues locker room (incidentally there are 33 identified instruments credited to The Moody Blues members in this album alone).  Om is the all-encompassing mystical entity of Hinduism.  It is both a vibration brought by pronunciation of the word ""Aum"" and the symbolized manifestation of God as the first vibration (energy) which presented itself at the creation of all things.  In western thought it would be equivalent to ""I Am"", how interesting that the English words I Am are just a slight variation from the Hindi Aum and in essence, they both mean the same thing, no?  and so... IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD transports us through a search for a chord, a vibration, a manifestation of the spirit that transcends the material world, and just like The Beatles said, it's the word Love!  This album is a beautiful thing, get it."
1,"I've heard, and (here) read, countless bashings on the re-issue of Sinatra cd's.  Many complain of everything from sound quality to packaging.  To be honest, if you're out buying Sinatra on CD, you're already compromising.  A CD is, by definition, a compromised version of the &quot;original,&quot; so get over it...20-bit or no 20-bit.  Get a life, and stop pretending you have such a golden ear.I own countless Sinatra 78's (yes, for a wind up Victrola dating 1906), and numerous original Sinatra LP's.  Likewise, I own dozens upon dozens of Sinatra cd's, both &quot;original&quot; (yeah, right) and &quot;re-issued.&quot;  I own copies of cd's that haven't yet made it to &quot;re-issue.&quot;  In this list are some Frank's best (i.e., &quot;When No One Cares&quot; and &quot;Nice and Easy&quot;...and, maybe, for much later-era Frank &quot;Cycles&quot;).  And to be honest, as cd's go I can't tell much of hell of difference between the old cd's and the &quot;new&quot; cd's outside of packaging.  AND that's being played on a Bang and Olufsen with Bose Acoustimass speakers.  So, as a helpful pointer, disregard all further talk on &quot;sound quality.&quot;Now, on to this release.This one, in short, is amazing.  It captures a jovial Frank, full of spring (and, to be trite, swing).  Yes, the version of &quot;I've got you under my skin&quot; is one of the best I have ever heard. Bar None.  Period.  But, I'm partial to ANYTHING by Cole Porter, so perhaps I'm biased.Definitely, when I'm not focused on the down-and-out Frank (a side I think I like far too much to be healthy), I reach for this one.  Next to this, &quot;Come Fly with Me,&quot; &quot;A Swingin' Affair,  and &quot;Come dance with me&quot; are sure-fire solid-senders.But to be sure, if you have to get only one of the brightly-swingin Sinatra discs, get this one."
1,"Honestly This is one of the most perfect Wu-Tang Solo albums you can get...What more can I say. Gza's flow on this disc is just brilliant and the lyrics are tight as hell. The production by R to tha ZA is just ill from Liquid Swords to Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth this album is possibly one of the most overlooked hip hop albums of our time. It really is a crying shame that the Source did'nt give this 5 Mics because of all hip hop records this deserves it more than any Record. If you don't have this album now...then definetley cop it...it's a must have.1.Liquid Swords-10/10-Tight opening with the Shogun line. Pretty cool kung fu sample. The track itself is pretty tight, Ill beat and tight lyrics. Classic.2.Duel of the Iron Mic-10/10-Like Liquid Swords opens with a tight kung fu sample. Track itself is a Classic. The beat is sick and the lyrics between Gza and Masta Killa are tight.3.Living In The World Today-10/10-One of the hottest tracks on the record. Fly hook, tight lyrics, sick beat, Perfect all around.4.Gold-10/10-One of my favorite songs, The illest beat that I eva heard on a Wu Tang solo album, tight hook, and some crazy lyrics.5.Cold World-10/10-Opens with a Kung Fu sample and leads into a tight hook wich then slams into Gza's rhyming. One of the most haunting songs on the album. Classic.6.Labels-10/10-Begins wif RZA talking about the rap game then leads into a really tight rhyme track by Gza.7.4th Chamber-10/10-Yet again opens with a kung Fu sample. Classic, one of the best on the album.8.Shadowboxin'-10/10-Really ill beat and some crazy rhyming from Jhonny Blaze and GZA. Just great all around, I garentee you'll replay this one like 99 times in a row.9.Hell's Wind Staff/Killah Hills 10304-10/10-I don't like tha opening but tha track itself is hot.Pretty tight beat but Gza's lyrics on this one is just frantic and hot. Cop It.10.Investigative Reports-10/10-Ill, just Ill. Rae tha Chef does some tight verses on this and so duz Gza. Like I said Before...Ill all around.11.Swordsman-10/10-Perfect with the beat, perfect with the rhymes, perfect with the hook. Perfect and Classic.12.I Gotcha Back-10/10-Tight hook, Tight Beat, Tight Track.13.Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth-10/10-My Favorite song on tha album. Just awesome, Killah Preist solo wif no GZA but still Mad Ill.Final Word: COP THIS JOINT!!!!!!!!"
1,Can't believe I found this cassette tape.  She was hot in the 90s but sadly this is her only project.  She later became a radio personality in Dallas and she was well received.  only $4 for this piece of memory.  Thanks!
1,"Forget &quot;Layla.&quot; Turn this baby to track 9, &quot;Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad?&quot;Even if every one of your experiences with love has been happy, you will be crying to the darker side by the time this song has spun its duration into your brain. You will feel uncontrollably driven to partake in typical heartbreak behavior like alcoholism without really knowing why...and you will fleetingly contemplate never loving another again, even after listening to &quot;Love Is A Wonderful Thing&quot; on repeat and watching every notable American romantic comedy available on DVD to dissuade yourself against better judgement.Additionally, even if you're an atheist or agnostic or a godless heathen, you will seriously consider the guitar solos on this song to have been sparked from some otherworldly spiritual force...or perhaps from a sadness that only permeates the darkest depths of human desperation..you decide.And if you have no soul, this is just a good rock n roll album...possibly, a soundtrack for cleaning your bathroom. But you need to ignore the fact that the music and lyrics are stained with heartache and that it might spill over onto your tiles if you make the mistake of letting it creep into your psyche."
1,"WHY did no one make me listen to this album during my pop music college days? It is WONDERFUL! ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" is now one of my top five favorite songs, a ranking that is VERY hard to get with me. I love how it manages to be innocent and sexual at the same time. I love the song ""Sloop John B,"" too. This album is beautifully done both musically and lyrically. Definitely one to buy and listen to many, many times."
1,"It is such a shame that Martin Page (as far as I know) has not released another album. He really is a talented singer/songwriter/musician. And this album just goes to show that. Full of emotionally impacting songs and skillful musicianship in the vein of Sting and Phil Collins, it just leaves you craving for more. &quot;The Door&quot; has to be one of the most moving songs I have ever heard. Who can fail to be touched by it? I really hope that we haven't heard the last of this great artist."
1,"Readers of this space may be aware that over the past year or so I have gone to great lengths to highlight some of the blues greats that I was doggedly devoted to as a kid (and still am) and helped form in me, and others from my generation, the Generation of '68 as well, an important musical component as we fought our political battles for a more just society. The names of Lead Belly, Josh White, Son House, Muddy Waters and the like easily come to mind.And then in a whisper in the back of the brain comes- don't forget Buddy Guy. Well, of course. The Chicago blues branch of the blues tree would not be complete without recognizing what every serious blues artist of the time recognized- here was a master. This CD only goes to prove the point. Electric guitar, acoustic guitar, solo, with Junior Wells, without Junior, as a backup to others Guy did it all. Even with all-star help of Jeff Beck and the like here this is strictly Buddy's gig. That's why there was that little whisper.So what is good here? Well, how about the title track ""Damn Right, I've Got The Blues"", ""Black Night"" and the jump tune"" Where Is The Next One Coming From?"". But, for my money Buddy's rendition of ""Mustang Sally"" is worth the price of admission. Can't you just see Sally riding now? Listen and see if you agree."
1,Yo this was the perfect album for KRS at the time because people wasn't sure if he still had it in him after Boom Bap and KRS-One.To me this was the answer to Boom Bap.I Got Next prooved he can rock a party like know one else.The lyrics are probably his best stylisticly.The beats are tight and the guest appearences were on point too.I know some were upset with the Puffy remix of Step Into A world but I say why not?KRS rhymed with Shabba Ranks back in the day so whats the difference?Meaning at the time Shabba was making it in the mainstream and no one had an issue with that so big deal.It didn't diminish what was acomplished on this album.The only thing that was missing was a DJ Premier track or somethin close to it.
1,"I must say that this is one of my all time favourite albums. I have to say that the best rack is by far the detriot mix of &quot;What's Going On&quot;. At first I thought their was an  error in my speakers (marvin appears to only come from the left), but when the familiar harmony (Father, Father) came in on the right, I was completely blown away. Don't just take my word for it. Buy this album NOW and listen to perhaps the greatest album by one of the 20th Century's most gifted talents."
1,"...although it nonetheless just misses the magnificent synergy the Moodies created at their peak. But hey! It isn't the Moody Blues, after all - although it is something very like. Justin Hayward and John Lodge provided memorable moments aplenty on the Moodies ""classic seven"" LPs, and deliver again here.The album opens in epic style with Justin Hayward's ""This Morning"" - an emotional roller-coaster with Hayward's trademark guitar and typical massed harmonies. There is also some marvellous work from the backing artists on drums and piano.""Remember me My Friend"" is a collaboration between Lodge and Hayward, and, although I find it a little slight and repetitive, it is eminently singable with its refrain ""Walking on this earth, finding you"".""My Brother"" is a Hayward tune with a particularly nice break replete with lush, Beatlesque harmonies.The early peak of the set, to my mind, is the song ""You"". It has a jaunty rhythm and nice melodic string parts and a lovely chorus. I dare you to not sing along with the somehow upbeat lament of the chorus.I must confess, ""Nights Winters Years"" is - without a doubt - my least favourite song here. It doesn't leave me cold, it leaves me a little embarassed - its just too darn sentimental (and is perhaps a little precursor of the later - occasionally banal work of the regathered Moodies). the orchestra is gorgeous but the piece has a kind of overblown opera/melodrama/Eurovision song contest feel about it (Sorry, Justin). And the lyrics are downright corny.""Saved by the Music"" is a solid John Lodge number - reminiscent of ""Isn't Life Strange"" off the Moodies ""Seventh Sojourn"" but without the mannerism and grandiose pretention of that song.Things really take off with the next two tracks, however: Justin Hayward is at his best with ""I Dreamed Last Night"" and ""Who Are You Now?"". The first of these numbers is both wistful and passionate, subtly scored and performed, with ardent, evocative lyrics, powerfully delivered by Hayward (who certainly always delivers as a vocalist). The second track is a delicate, pastoral lament with a gorgeous cello line, sweet lyrics and lovely harmonies.""Maybe"", by John Lodge is another piece in the style of ""Saved by the Music"", and as such is OK but doesn't take us anywhere new (which I think is a pretty accurate description of most of the Moodies' work since 1972).""When You Wake Up"", the original closer on the vinyl release is a great track. Most of the Moodies' elements are here - lyricism, evocative words, beautiful massed harmonies and a symphonic vision. In many ways, this song represents the end of an era - this is, as far as I know, the last time the prog-rock/art-rock sensibilities of classic Moodies appear in all their glory. There's been nothing to really equal this since.In many ways, although I love this album, it can leave one a little melancholy: it is close enough to the classic Moodies to make one truly aware of the absences: Ray Thomas' blend of pragmatism and mysticism (and his superb flutework), Graeme Edge's quirky poetry and thoughtful commentary (and his subtle drumming) and Mike Pinder's earnest spiritual searching (and the glorious tones of his Mellotron and his marvellous piano). But it is well worth listening to in its own right - and the effect described above gives it a piquancy all its own."
1,"I love Rickie Lee Jones and didn't have Flying Cowboys.  It's an awesome CD.  I got it for a good price, and I received it before the given date.  Everything was done very professionally and I love the CD.  Thank you."
1,"3 1/2Relaxed classic known for being the first full-fledged American bossa nova record is not exactly gripping, but still tightly chill enough to constitute compositional significance, with the Getz/Byrd dynamic lending to some interesting synergy. Not quite the landmark of next years Gilberto collaboration, but completely important in its own right."
1,"One of Stevie Wonder's seminal albums, ""Songs in The Key of Life"" receives the audiophile treatment from Audio Fidelity. This new remaster is a marked improvement on the remaster from a decade ago; the album sounds full, warm but without the goosed bass and bright sound of that previous remaster.How does this compare to the original CD issue? Detail and clarity are slightly better but the biggest improvement comes in area of the bass and soundstage the latter particularly has greater depth and dimension to it. Stevie's vocals also sound marvelous here--a marked improvement over some of the previous editions.I've had some issues with some of the Audio Fidelity reissues on CD. For example ""The Pretenders"" and reissue of The Doors' ""The Soft Parade"" both suffered from peak limiting (and in the case of ""The Pretenders"" there was at least one overdub that was missing because it was ""flown in"" later for the original release)and The Cars' ""Heartbeat City"" although a stronger, sharper sounding release didn't have the flow of the original album with its overlapping and quicker fades. I can happily report none of these issues are apparent here.The artwork which also was an issue with some of the early AF releases isn't an issue here either; the full booklet with all the lyrics has been included. Although the type is a bit smaller than I had hoped for the lyrics and credits, the print is clear and the quality of the glossy paper is more so what one would expect from an audiophile release. As with all AF releases (a carry over from the old DCC)we get images of the original vinyl labels included in the booklet which continues to be a nice touch.I do wish that AF would adopt the SACD/CD hybrid format for their releases (although even Mobile Fidelity only uses it on select titles based on their licensing agreement). Although this is marked as an HDCD release that has to do with (if I recall correctly)the use of the HDCD converters during the analog to digital process and the peak extensions characteristic of most HDCDs isn't presented here (which could be good or bad depending on how you listen to your music--on a regular CD player for example HDCD can sound a bit shrill and bright to some folks).For those who do have SACD players the SHM SACD recently reissued from Japan reportedly sounds remarkable and has a slightly better soundstage and detail than this CD remaster. I don't own it but that has been attributed to everything from the fact that it's an SACD (although NOT a hybrid--I only purchase hybrids which is why I don't have this so I can play them anywhere)to the remaster being slightly goosed. I can't comment on the latter but the former makes sense. For a regular CD issue however this is probably the best one out there with an improved soundstage, depth and less ""thin"" sounding compared to the original CD issue and a marked improvement over the goosed remaster from a decade ago.Over all this is an impressive presentation of a classic album and I'm happy that AF has done such a fine job with this release. Kudos to AF and Kevin Gray (who did the remastering here)for doing such a fine job with this seminal release."
1,"Call it 4 and a half out of 5.  This is easily the most underrated album in the catalog, but some of the ""harder rocking"" moments sound a little, well, funny.  I became a fan in 1981, when I was 11, and Hi Infidelity was the first one I got.  I got a bunch of back catalog REO albums within a year, and eventually moved on to other artists, but I've always enjoyed listening to REO from time to time and aside from Hi Infidelity, this is one I keep coming back to.  ""Heavy On Your Love"" sounds like REO's take on Zeppelin's ""Whole Lotta Love"" (one of the unintentionally funny moments before a solo finishes the song).  ""I Need You Tonight"" has CSN harmonies, and ""Take Me"" isn't a cover of the Kiss tune, but could have been a Kiss tune.  It's a catchy song that manages to overshadow Kevin Cronin sounding like a rock star too high on himself. Again, funny. The best song on this album is easily ""Meet Me on the Mountain"", just a great song that sounds like it recalls your first crush from junior high with all the innocense intact.  Great solo at the end of the song, too.  The rest of the songs are pretty damn good, too, and I didn't even mention the two that typically show up on compilations.  Hey, if you liked Hi Infidelity, you'll like this one, too.  And if you enjoyed ""You Can Tune a Piano..."", you'll love this one.  Definitely worth it."
1,"When Elton John released his first greatest hits collection in late 1974, he was the biggest rock act in the world.  He was riding a streak of four straight number one albums and Greatest Hits would be his fifth in a row.  In fact the album spent a career high 10 weeks at the top.  The album is populated with some of the biggest hits of the first half of the 70's including the number one hits like his ode to a glam rocker, the rollicking &quot;Bennie &amp; The Jets&quot; and his ode to the 50's, the fun and punchy &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot;.  Other classics include the orchestral &quot;Goodbye Yellowbrick Road&quot;, the beautiful &quot;Your Song&quot;, the funky &quot;Honky Cat&quot;, the soaring &quot;Rocket Man&quot; and the heartbreaking &quot;Candle In The Wind&quot;."
1,"I'm not going to waste words here, this is classic Wonder, perhaps even his best! I was cruisin', happy to have this remastered gem, when all of a sudden &quot;Golden Lady&quot; came on. Stopped me in my tracks, it sounds  so good, as does the entire cd. I'll let others give you the depths of  what's on offer here. My advice is where I came in, buy it!"
1,"David Gilmour's first solo album was released in May 1978 squeezed in between Pink Floyd's Animals and The Wall. Needless to say, this is not to be compared to the scope of those monumental achievements. Pink Floyd was on a definite high at that point.Truth is David's own lyrics are distinctively different from the ingenious heavy gloom of Roger Waters', something which allows the songs to carry a much lighter feel. Musically though, one can hear similarities throughout the album with that trademark guitar sounding as great as always. What we also get here is mostly the rawer vibe of guitar, bass and drums. David's beautifully inventive melodies are given even more room and jewel the songs!Out of the nine tracks, seven were solely composed by Gilmour - three of them being amazing instrumentals. There's No Way Out Of Here was written by the members of Unicorn, a band David did some production work with, and Short And Sweet is a collaboration with the great Roy Harper. Worthy checking out is Roy's Universal Soldier album which came out two years after for a great version of Short And Sweet with Gilmour on guitar!This remastered reissue is also worth getting for it does improve it sonically, brings a nicer booklet and offers longer codas which - even not being that revealing - are more than welcome.To finish it off I would like to point out that while On An Island might be a more complete, better produced and an equally inspired album, when push comes to shove this is still my favourite - one I keep revisiting on a regular basis for sheer pleasure."
1,"I can definitely agree that this is a high quality recording by Eric Clapton and the rest of the Dominoes.  Eric contributes some of his best songs here such as Bell Bottom Blues, Layla, I Looked Away, and Why Does Love Have To Be So Sad.  The guitar duels between Eric and Duane Allman are indeed legendary and the vocals by Eric and Bobbie Whitlock in support are quite strong as well.What keeps this recording from receiving a five start rating to my ears is the plodding bitter blues tone that exists from track to track.  Variety is somewhat lacking on this collection.  I Am Yours and to some extent Thorn Tree In The Garden are the only variations that exist here.As I stated before, this is a strong collection by Eric Clapton no doubt about it.  However, I prefer Disraeli Gears from Eric's Cream days and Another Ticket, UnPlugged, Behind The Cradle, his debut solo record, and possibly a few other discs because Eric varies his approach just a little bit more."

1,"Not one of LL's better-known recordings, 14 SHOTS TO THE DOME initially sold well, hitting the Top Five on the Hot 200 when it was originally released.  However, the disc became his first album to fail to reach Platinum status in sales, and it is largely remembered as being a disappointment.  This is a shame because 14 SHOTS actually sits among LL's best work, with 60 minutes worth of strong hooks and impassioned raps.  The entire album has a much harder sound than most of his previous recordings, with ""Buckin' Em,"" ""Straight From Queens,"" and ""Ain't No Stoppin' This"" emerging as three of Uncle L's most rapid-fire rhymes yet.LL also sounds incredibly spirited on ""A Little Something,"" as well as the sexy hits ""Back Seat"" (#42 Pop, #24 R&B;, #2 Rap) and ""How I'm Comin'"" (#57 Pop, #28 R&B;, #1 Rap).  Even the lighter numbers (""Stand By Your Man,"" ""Diggy Down"") aren't too sappy, and prove to be highlights rather than liabilities more often than not.  As a matter of fact, the clever love song ""Pink Cookies In A Plastic Bag Getting Crushed By Buildings"" is the album's standout track.  Even though it may not have as many standout moments as incredible as those on RADIO or MAMA, 14 SHOTS TO THE DOME is a solid, consistent work that easily stands as LL's most underrated album."
1,"Well probably this is their most progressive effort so far and I can't remember, apart from some interesting stuff by Djam Karet, anything like this...but there is no vocal part-the album being entirely instrumental - and perhaps the puzzle would be completed better with a vocalist suitable for this modern heavy art rock ensemble. Sometimes there is some fusion excursus, where Damon Che reminds us of the best work by Billy Cobham and Tony Williams with the Mahavishnu Orchestra, but this kind of style is filtered here through the special guitar effects and a certain ""Crimson mood"". Unfortunately They have recently broken  their musical adventure, as for the usual problems with the majority of the mass medias; these latter have been forgetting the alternative musical movements for years, with a certain sense of snob and ""tough"" face as well. I think of Don Cabbalero's effort and - as a logic consequence of their busy work- They couldn't ""survive"" for a long time, because They have never put the mainstream style in their music, at their own risk!!Higly Recommended, also to the purist of classic prog rock (apart from the extremist of classic prog movement)"
1,"The Allman Brothers Band made some of the best music in Rock and Roll History and to this day remains some of the best songs and ballads ever recorded.  This band was started by the legendary brothers of Duane and Greg Allman and rose to legendary status due to the outstanding guitar of Duane Allmanand the keyboards and singing of Greg Allman and Dickey Betts.  This is a ""southern blues"" sound that is easy to listen to and makes you want to listen to the ""album"" over and over again.  From the classic ""Melissa"", ""Ramblin Man"", ""In Memory of Elizabeth Reed"" and others on this Greatest Hits, the band is ""in tune"" with each other.  The songs sound simple to hear but if you listen again you will see how talented each member was and is.  It is tragic that Duane Allman died at a young age in 1971 (he was 24) and just over a year later another member of the band died around the same location (both from Motorcycle Accidents).  Greg Allman has been the leader of this band for over 40 years, and each time they reunite and go on tour or make a new album, it is eagerly anticipated.  With this CD it is easy to see why.  This is the CD that makes you want to obtain other albums by this band and enjoy each one over and over again.  The band is like a ""fine wine"", it gets better to listen to over the years, however, this is the sound that never gets old, it just gets better!  Highly Recommended!"
1,"What y'all know 'bout Brother Ike?  If you know nothin' an' are readin' this on one'a dem &quot;curiosity kicks&quot; then I needa shed some light on 'ya.  I ain't gon' make this a long-winded review that seems 'ta go nowhere, an' I ain't gon' break this down song by song or nothin' like that.  I'm jus' gon' tell you that 'Black Moses' is one'a the greatest epic pieces'a music you will find.  His sangin'a these beautiful songs, an' his urban blunted grease-fire backing instrumentations; 'specially that Fender Rhodes piano are like some great message bein' sent down from the heavens.I love it all, straight-up; from the first note'a disc one to the final fade-out of disc two, is' all so immeasurable.  I love the dour, simple street-corner soul melody on 'Nothing Takes the Place of You' more than anything; there's so much power in his voice alone when he sangs a note, when he brings it up to a soulful cry, or lowers it down to a subtle croon; man, I love this song.  I also love the brazen slowed down funk on the Curtis-penned 'Man's Temptation' an' the kickin' gutter-blues of 'Part-Time Love'.  I'm damned enthralled by 'Ike's Rap II/Help Me Love'; God forbid I take a bottle to the dome befo' I listen to it an' all the memories of what once were come floodin' back to me.  The horns an' arrangements an' passion that fills the once again-Superfly-penned'Need to Belong to Someone' is pure BRILLIANCE.  But the straight-up baddest funkiest, groovin'-est JAM on the whole double-disc set has gotta be 'Good Love'; I listen to that song every single day I go out an' see the sun shinin'.  Nothin' makes me feel better.Well, lemme stop before I do exactly what I had said I WASN'T going to an' break 'em all down one by one.  You can play this album straight through anytime; it works at a get-together wit' your boys, when you jus' wanna play cards, drank a few beers an' smoke some cigars like you some gangstas or sumpin'; but it works jus' as well for a night spent tryin' to get sumpin' started with a woman; candlelight, wine, makin' out, whateva else y'all is old enough to do.  Is' jus' got sumpin' for everything.  Straight-up this is one'a the BADDEST soul albums EVER!  Let Bruh Ike, the soul messiah, the strongest, blackest Moses on the planet show you the way to happiness."
1,"Strange....I keep reading all of these references to Helmet being the originators of nu-metal yet, when this album was released, the concept of nu-metal had not yet even begun to brew inside the mind of some soulless marketing executive, itching to brandish a newer and more simplistic sound to attract the masses with a short attention span. One can certainly make a path from Helmet to the spawn of nu-metal that followed a few years later if they felt so inclined but if you dig a little deeper, nu-metal only shares the most basic traits with this band that offered so much more to anyone who cared to listen.In some ways, it almost seems strange to slap the ""metal"" tag on a band like Helmet. Sure, they wrote this album that is bludgeoningly heavy with songs that would blow your head clean off your body from the outset but beyond that, Helmet shared little with the dyed-in-the-wool metal bands from the early 1990's.I suppose that this is where the whole nu-metal tag comes in, due to the nu-metal kingpins to follow utilizing the stop-start riffing that Helmet mastered out of the gate. However, those comparisons end when you get into these songs.Unlike Korn and Deftones that followed, Helmet combined that riffing style with head-snapping time changes, absolutely monster grooves and a strange combination of vast musical influence filtered through a seemingly minimalist approach, all of this done with no use of samples, rapping or tortured soul gimmicks. Helmet was strictly about the music.Maybe this is why their flirtation with the mainstream didn't last. They had nothing by way of gimmicks to offer the growing number of angst-filled teens that were a year or so away from the transition from grungy teen to Johnathan Davis impersonator. For those (and there are many of them) always on the hunt for the next fad to grasp onto for lack of true identity, Helmet provided those of us looking for music with substance an album that still could blow us away almost 15 years after it appeared on store shelves. ""Meantime"" is precisely that album."
1,"Whenever I pass by the Apollo,my mind goes back and recalls this recording and as the liner notes make clear this CD released in 1963 is a tidal wave of raw emotion that sold millions without a hit single, JB's 1st hit album and was voted internationally by critics as one of the Top 20 albums of all time..with reason.This CD is the meat and potatoes of JB, a representation of his live show that brought him into the spotlight on this cold night with a hot band.All his accolades, The Hardest Working Man In Show Business, Godfather Of Soul,Soul Brother # 1 are all here on this 30 minute live CD.The CD itself was remastered in 1990, prepared from the original,undubbed stereo master tape."
1,Jon Anderson is a superb vocalist.  No one else  sounds like him.  In the City of Angels is a pleasant listening experience.  The production is very clean and spacious.  The musicianship is also very good.  In the City of  Angels is mostly in a pop direction.  My favorite songs are &quot;Hold on  to Love&quot; and &quot;In a Lifetime.&quot;  I still enjoy hearing both of  them--they are very well-written.  The rest of the album is pretty good  also.  Jon Anderson has different musicians playing on various songs.  Members of Toto play on a handful of them.  Toto member (David Paich)  helped write a couple of the tunes.  The songwriting throughout is good and  also experimental in places.  In the City of Angels is worth a listen.
1,"Some people seem to think that &quot;I Got Next&quot; is KRS' best album, but to my ears it pretty damn overrated. This album demonstrates KRS as the great, clever lyricist he is, and he is accompanied by nice production from  one of hip-hop's finest, DJ Premier. He truly is the greatest emcee ever to  touch a microphone. He is the only emcee who's as great today as he was ten  years back."
1,"Let's say a band has written nine songs and decides to make an album.  One is a superb song (probably one of the best the band has ever written), one is near excellent, whereas the other seven range from just O.K. to good.  Now take your superb song and have it lead off the album, and take your near excellent song and make it third in the order.  The problem for a listener of the album is that after the third song, s/he's not going to hear anything approaching what's already been heard, hence there's surely going to be a letdown.  This is indeed the problem with ""Mirror Moves.""""The Ghost in You"" is a great great song, and fans generally agree it's one of the band's best.  ""Heaven"" is near excellent.  The rest range from O.K. to good (""Alice's House"" and ""Highway Days"" are probably the best of the remainder).  Here, Richard Butler has, for the most part, lost his raspy snarl, and sings much more melodically, with more gentle themes (such as love).  I personally think ""Mirror Moves"" is the band's weakest album, but that's what makes the Psychedelic Furs so great, because the album is still pretty good.Footnote:  Notice how the band self-plagiarized the main riff from ""Like a Stranger"" to write the superior ""In My Head"" a few albums later."
1,Isaac Hayes soul music.  Interesting as to what he does with some main line songs.
1,"This is one of the greatest albums of all time,hands down,sounds as good today as when it was released ions ago,a timeless classic!!! A must for any serious music collection!!! A true ""Tapestry"" of songs!!! Recommended! Two thumbs up!!! A+"
1,"This CD is definetely a must own for any Misfits fan/fiend/whatever. Released in 1997, this CD features classics such as ""Dig Up Her Bones"", ""Mars Attacks"", ""Shining"", and ""Black Light"". Okay, so Michale Graves' can't sing as well as Danzig. But, hey. Not many Punk vocalists can sing better than Danzig. Michale's aggressive howls and cries sound well blended in with sharply-tuned guitars and bass. The drums are also decent. Pick this one up along with Famous Monsters."
1,"the cars released this great record back in 1978.shortly after it,s release it was all over the airwaves.this album is in my opinion another one of the finest debut albums in rock ever!!there are so many great songs on this album it may well be the cars quintessential album. ric ocasek ;rythm guitarist and chief song writer for the cars was in top form on this album.for me the best cuts are[and there are many!]you,re all i,ve got tonight,good times roll,bye,bye,love,moving in stereo,just what i needed,my best friend,s girl,all mixed up and don,t cha stop.i realize i have just named most of the tunes on this album but i think this album is a must for any cars fan new or old!i also love the cover that chick with the sexy red lips!!this album and their second album candy o from 1979 are two of the best albums the cars ever did!"
1,"I remember the first time I heard ""Juicy Fruit"" on the radio.  It was so different and fresh; like nothing that was out there at that time.  It's no wonder it rocketed to the top of the R&B; chart in 1983.  It was also very unusual for a Funk band to preview a new album with a ballad back then, but it worked; it had appeal and people both on and off the dancefloor could relate to it.  I saw Mtume live a year later in Boston.  Everyone was waving packs of Juicy Fruit gum at the band from the audience!Other than the first smash single and the song that would feature an opening Hip Hop beat that would be sampled countless times by DROVES of other artists in the R&B;/Hip Hop communities, there's a lot to like here.  Mtume, which is fronted by a soul sista  by the name of Tawatha Agee and by James Mtume himself (the mastermind behind the songs and great production) takes the listener on an audio journey of both uptempo and midtempo Funk songs from the Old School era of Soul music (the 80's.)The best cuts are ""Green Light,"" ""Hips,"" and ""Your Love's Too Good to Spread Around"" as well as the title cut and ""Would You Like to Fool Around.""  The silly/funny, ""Hipdipskippedabeat"" is unforgettable by the fact that it's a Rap song that tells a story about a brotha who's just too hip to be cool.  This album WAS and still IS a classic three decades later!"
1,"Of all the great jazz tenor saxophonists in existence presently and before, Sonny Rollins has always been my favorite.  I guess I really just always digged his rough, deep sound and his endless array of ideas.  Being that he is my favorite tenor player, ""Saxophone Colossus"" has always been one of my favorite albums ever since the first time I heard it.  This group (Sonny, the superb Tommy Flanagan,Doug Watkins on bass, and the incredible Max Roach on drums)  works so well together, I really feel that they should've become a working group or at least have recorded one more time together.  Every single track has a different style but are all equally compelling.  ""St. Thomas"" , without a doubt the famous composition on this album and probably that Sonny ever did, is truly one of the catchiest themes in existence.  Sonny's solo on this cut is truly a classic now and is essential listening for all jazz saxophonists to listen to how to handle a latin tune such as this.  Tommy Flanagan and Max Roach also have extended, very impressive solos which are some of the best I've ever heard them do.  ""You Don't Know What Love Is"" is a beautiful ballad that became much more popular as a result of this recording.  Sonny's solo, although humorous, has a certain sadness to it.  The somewhat gentle mood is continued greatly in Flanagan's solo and the track concludes in a very emotional finale.  ""Strode Rode"" swings extremely hard and shows all present at their very best.  ""Moritat"" (more commonly known as ""Mack the Knife"") is a very popular show tune that you are probably familiar with even if you haven't heard this cd.  Of all the many versions done of this tune, Sonny's is by far the best.  The album then concludes with ""Blue 7"", which is the most influential composition on this cd due to the fact that it single-handedly introduced the concept of thematic improvisation.  All four members of the ensemble provide nice, laid-back, dreamy solos that brings the album to a quiet close.  If you don't already own this cd, you probably feel that this cd could never possibly live up to all the hype.  This is one of the rare cases where every good thing said about this awesome cd is completely justified.  In my opinion, this is definitely in the top five most essential and greatest jazz albums ever, so pick it up now if you consider yourself a fan of any jazz or music in general."
1,"Traffic's self titled album is exceptional. Traffic has such a cool sound that few other bands had. They are hust fun to listen to. This album contains some of their best songs, such as You Can All Join In, Who Knows  What Tomorrow May Bring, Feelin' Alright, and Cyin' To Be Heard. Buy this  album, you won't regret it."
1,"But where in the heck is &quot;Feel So Good&quot;--it's just as pleasurable as this, yet with the cut &quot;Knucklehead&quot; some say it's funkier...."
1,"This is a great lively album with a few slow songs, but mostly it makes you want to get up and dance."
1,"EWF's 70s' LPs were just outstanding, and this may be the best (aside from I Am -- I'm indifferent on the two personally). Leading off with &quot;Serpentine Fire,&quot; the band segues into &quot;Fantasy,&quot; which may be the best ever EWF tune. &quot;Fantasy&quot; is a musical masterpiece, combining harmonious vocals, funk, and horns into one of the most thoroughly enjoyable refrains of all time. After that, it continues to please -- &quot;Jupiter&quot; moves and moves and MOVES, and then evolves into the slower &quot;Love's Holiday&quot; and then to the wonderfully brilliant Philip Bailey vocaled &quot;I'll Write a Song For You.&quot; &quot;Runnin'&quot; is easily one of the best instrumental contributions I've ever heard, with outstanding trumpet and saxophone solos."
1,The Music&amp;Production on this Debut AIn't no Joke.this Disc still sounds Fresh 6 years later.it challenges The Rap Game to this day.These Brothers have solid Vision.this is Probably  the Best Rap Album from start  to finish in the Last 5or6 years to come out if not then definitely in the  top 5.cuz Outkast changed the Game with this one.
1,"Fresh out of the pen and Pac releases a double disc classic this is an absolute must for rap fans and if you like Pac you better have already gotten this albumThe beats are greatLyrics are superb considering he just got out of jail and is able to put together this cd truley proves that he was the greatest of all timeTupac 4 Ever""God Bless The Dead""R.I.P. Tupac Shakur"
1,"The Beastie Boys made their first mark on the world with this album and it was a good one too. Possibly their best album, the Beastie Boys combine rock with rap and do a good job of it. The opening track, ""Rhymin' and Stealin'"" was more of a rap song but later tracks such as ""No Sleep Till Brooklyn"" and ""Fight For Your Right"" had a rock background but the boys were rapping to it, creating an awesome fusion. While some of the songs are short, this is still a classic album that anyone can enjoy. If you haven't bought it yet, you've had 18 years to do so so go out and buy the damn thing!!!"
1,"Though I had grown up listening to the music of Simon and Garfunkel, it is in listening to this CD that I realized how prolific they had been and how beautiful were their harmonies. This is a timeless collection, as it contains all of their major hits. It is a wonderful compiliation of their music which can best be described as sort of a mellow folk rock. It runs the gamut from the upbeat: &quot;The 59th Street Bridge Song&quot;, &quot;Cecilia&quot;, to the poetic: &quot;The Sounds of Silence&quot;. &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;, &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;, to the unusual: &quot;El Condor Pass (If I Could)&quot;.Every cut on this CD is a winner. There is, however, one annoying aspect to it. For whatever reason, some of the tracks have clapping at the conclusion of the song. This is a little jarring to the listener because one does not expect it, as this is not a &quot;live&quot; album. This is why I rated the CD with four stars instead of five. Still, this is definitely a CD no music lover should be without."
1,"I was a latecomer into Nick Drake's music. As many other people, I re-discovered him ""thanks"" to the media hype of recent times. And boy am I happy I did! Nick Drake's music combines the best elements of folk and brit psychodelia.When I listen to Drake, besides entering a peaceful state where I feel in perfect communion with the rest of the universe, I remember music from Jeff Buckley, Elliott Smith (both, no longer among us as well), Rufus Wainwright and even Cat Stevens...Sad thing, how after thirty years of his passing, a commercial may bring his music back to life, some say. Me, I feel it's all just fine: Nick's posthumous album brings 1972 all back, with one mellow tune after another in 2004 or any other year you choose to play it, making it the perfect soundtrack to ride to and back from work, write to or quite simply... sit back and let go."
1,"LONG DISTANCE VOYAGER is another classic Moody Blues album. It's the only one the band got to do at their own custom-designed Threshold Studios, and the results are stunning. The song ""The Voice"", which emphasizes the importance of being true to one's self (and also inspired me to skip food-related reunions at my old school in favor of looking good for my favorite actresses), is the highlight here, but the song ""Gemini Dream"" is just as good, and there is plenty of other great material to be found here. The band seemed to have come through the drug-addled 60s/early 70s and cleared its heads, paving the way to make a grand statement, which it did here."
1,"When Suge signed Pac to Death Row, that was the best signing he made since he signed Dre and Snoop. This is true westcoast hip hop in its entirety. 2 disc of real hip hop from a hip hop legend. When Pac dropped this album, people were running to the stores to get it from all over the world. Too many great songs on this album to choose favorites. I say the whole entire album is my favorite."
1,I finally got around buying CDs for my CD collection to put on my ipod.  I have the album and the cassette tape.  One of the best albums ever made.  The writing is stellar.  I also purchased the Tapestry CD that was done by various artists.  It's okay but doesn't compare to the original.  Buy this CD for your collection.  Enjoy!
1,"Odessa, The Bee Gees' answer to The Beatles' White Album, has some fine tracks to be sure, but overall it's a ponderous, pretentious album that is difficult to listen to from beginning to end. I find myself skipping over tracks to get to the ones I like, such as 'Melody Fair' and 'Lamplight'. 'Marley Purt Drive' I like less now, since it veers off into country-pop, which is not a direction the Bee Gees should have gone into. Again, good tracks here and there but too much orchestration and slightly less appealing tunes that those found on their first 3 albums."
1,"After Jay-Z released one of the best rap CD's of all time in my opinion, ""Reasonable Doubt"", Jay followed up this classic with ""In My Lifetime, Vol. 1"".  People immediately compared it to his 1st album and when they realized that this wasn't as good, they dismissed it as being a poor album.  However, this is a great album.  It's very hard to live up to a classic debut (just ask Nas) but this is a very well made album.  This is still back when Jay-Z was Jay-Z and not Jigga, HOVA, etc.  Back when he was still raw and dark and rapping like it was his second profession behind hustling.  The bottom line is, this is a great album, just not as good as ""Reasonable Doubt"".1. Intro/A Million And One Questions/Rhyme No More - A great 3-part introduction for the album. First is a monologue which is taken from the movie ""Carlito's Way"". Next is a verse from AMAOQ which is just fantastic and it's over a blazing beat. Then comes a verse from RNM which is also very good.2. The City Is Mine - The song in which Jay claims the throne of New York following the death of The Notorious B.I.G. Good lyrics and a mainstream beat. Features Blackstreet. ""What the deal playboy, just rest your soul. I be holding it down yo still love the dough."" 8/103. I Know What Girls Like - My least favorite track. It's supposed to be radio-friendly but Puffy made a pretty weak beat and Lil Kim doesn't do much. 6/104. Imaginary Player - Great song with Jay talking about how nice he is and what a player he is and how other people just try to be like him. Really nice, mellow beat. ""Y'all can't go with me, nope, flow with me."" 10/105. Streets Is Watching - Amazing song. Pretty much a classic but it's edited (probably so people would buy the actual soundtrack). Still, very nice beat and you know Jay's got some great lyrics. ""Can't ignore it, that's the fastest way to get extorted. But my time is money. At twenty-five, I can't afford it."" 10/106. Friend Or Foe '98 - Follow-up to the classic ""Friend Or Foe"" on Jay's debut album about people thinkin' he's soft now that he's rapping and want to take over the streets. This song is just as good. ""Time to pay now, you try to rise, I wave the gun - lay down. This time you're really going to listen to Jay now."" 10/107. Lucky Me - Nice, slow song. It's got a nice chorus, beat, and good lyrics about how life is now for Jay. ""Next time your thinking heist, better be precise. Cause I'm fully prepared. One of us is gon' leave here."" 8/108. (Always Be My) Sunshine - Weak song. Probably just as bad as ""I Know What Girls Like"" if not worse. Bad production and weak lyrics, especially from the guest, Foxy Brown. Skip. 5/109. Who You Wit II - A good song. Basically just about girls. Not really a standout but it has some good rhymes and a decent beat so it's definately worth listening to. ""Dough to get, more shows to rip. I suggest you all roll with the click, who you wit."" 7/1010. Face Off - Features Sauce Money. Another decent song but nothing outstanding. Another song about girls but this one's probably a little more harsh or disrespectful but there's some good lyrics in here. ""Look, I done came up and thought a whole game up. Meet me in the square with one in the chamber."" 7/1011. Real N****z - Really good song. Great hook and beat. Features Too $hort and it's a song about how Jay came up in the world and how real he is. ""If you want it, keep ballin, and if you jealous stop. I want Biggie to rest in peace, as well as 'Pac."" 9/1012. Rap Game/Crack Game - Great song. Produced by Jay's mentor Big Jaz and has a similar sound to Biggie's ""Ten Crack Commandments"". Jay basically compares selling drugs to selling records. ""Ain't tryin to kill em at first, just buildin clientele. So when the album drops the first weeks it's on sale."" 10/1013. Where I'm From - Another great song which I think is one of the best on the album. Jay raps over an excellent beat that's very dark and ominous about how life is where he's from. ""They hop out of vans and spray things. And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eighteen."" 10/1014. You Must Love Me - This is actually my favorite track on this album. It's Jay at his most honest and this is his most personal song. He lays out some great rhymes over a fantastic beat that is just depressing. Jay is basically apologizing to people that he's hurt before and people whose lives he's made worse. Very sad and very good. ""Still haven't apologized so please play this back. While I try to come to terms with such a heinous act."" 10/10"
1,"This is considered the worst album from Elton's classic years but....Actually its an album that frequently rocks in way that most Elton albums don't. You can definitely hear an early 70's Stones influence on some of these tracks. Having said that my favourite tracks are the wonderful ballad ""I Feel Like Bullet (in the gun of Robert Ford)"" and the rocking ""Hard Luck Story"".Eltons regular drummer and bass player (Nigel & Dee) had been dropped for this album and to some extent this accounts for the different feel to the album. I think this is also the first album where Ray Cooper played as regular member of the band. His distinctive touches are felt throughout the album, noteably his Conga and Vibes playing.So perhaps not the best album of Eltons classic era, but its still a fine album."
1,"This is  by far there best work. They were more creative sounding on this album. stand out songs the hurting, change."
1,"This album is a must-have for all those who are really interested to know about the second stage of this legendary guitarist after Cream' s dissolution. After a brief withdrawal when recorded that fabulous album with Blind Faith, Clapton decided to join forces with the Dominos, and the results are shown here spanning from 1969 to 1970. One of the main highlights of this album was the radiant supporting team, conformed by Duane Allman, Carl Radle in bass and percussion and Jim Gordon in the drums.You may appreciate the gradual evolution and the expansiveness of his musical thinking along every track. He knew to blend the best of his feeling, and craft with commercial taste. Bell bottom blues, for instance was a piece that was completely ignored in commercial circuits. Keep on growing is a solid theme. Filled of vigor and full rhythm, please beware about the fabulous rhythmical section. ""Nobody knows you when you're down and out"" is a classical blues composed by Jimmie Cox, played with incisive rapture  ""Tell the truth"" is another formidable classic blues, played with flaming passion and filled of expression.Of course you will listen the evanescent version of Wings and the most commercial success of this ensemble: LaylaBut when you listen Have you ever loved a woman? , you will have come to one the most distinguished and extraordinary blues of anytime. A sidereal blues that still captives and engages every emerging generation of new listeners. This is without discussion, the jewel of the crown.In sum, a wise choice that will help you to know still more the invaluable contribution that Clapton has conferred the rock, country, blues and the music in general."
1,"All eight-minutes-and-four-seconds of ""You And I dominate thestart of this CD even as the live ""Stone City Band,Hi"" intro andthe P-Funkin' ""Sexy Lady"" never leave that perpulsive funk territory.And of course there is the unforgettable ""Mary Jane""but this album sadly succumbs to many a Motown artist's mainpitfull.In 1978 the label was known for offering up hot SINGLESon they're classic 45's then working that hard on albums.As a result 'Come Get It!' is padded down with the unabashedly discoid ""Be My Lady"",the cutesy and oozy balladry of ""Dream Maker"" and he disgustingly epic schmaltz of ""Hollywood"".Thankfully BAD taste (bad meaning FONKY) comes to the rescue by the end with a revisit of the intro.A classic debut overall butI must deduct one star for the horrible filler,however miniscule,there is.Otherwise enjoy!"
1,"I listen to all types of rap music, from old-school eastcoast a la Eric B & Rakim or EPMD to westcoast classics from Dre, Snoop or E-40 to new dirty south bangers from Ludacris, Three 6 Mafia or T.I.I've listened to approximately 300 rap albums. but believe me, this is the best one. lyrics are top-notch, production is out of this worldyou better listen to this album ASAP, you'll love it as much as everyone else does. mind-blowing classic album right there"
1,"South Central Cartel became one of the West Coast's prolific hip hop collectives during the 90s, known for their unapologetic gangsta rap. Anchored by the flawless g-funk production of member Prodeje, their many albums were marked by consistent if predictable lyrics describing all sides of street life, yet at times offering a somber and even philosophical take on the lifestyle. In addition to the collective's catalog and side projects, leaders Havoc and Prodeje (whose names are probably hip hop's greatest coincidence, word to Mobb Deep) maintained a solid output as a duo. 1994's ""Kickin' Game,"" released at the height of S.C.C. and g-funk's popularity, was their second outing as a duo, coming on Quality Records a few months after the successfulN Gatz We Truss.""Kickin' Game"" is business as usual for Hav and Prod, and it's a totally dope album. Prodeje's great beats are simultaneously smooth and furious, incorporating elements of `70s soul and smooth basslines. It still perplexes me why he wasn't a more sought-after producer by other artists. The ever-underrated R&B; singer L.V. deserves a co-credit, appearing frequently and delivering heartfelt performances and hooks on the heavier tracks with his always-lovely half-gospel, half-gangsta delivery. On the mic, Hav and Prod again explore the way of life in L.A.'s gang neighborhoods, and while we've certainly heard it before, it's still intriguing to hear the accounts of young men surviving in such dire circumstances, and this reality rap is undoubtedly part of what made gangsta rap so lucrative in the `90s. Their flows are on-point as always and their songs are consistent as well.The tracklist opens brilliantly with the funky ""Charge It 2 a B,"" with a moody performance from L.V. and rugged lyrics from all of S.C.C., and the similarly great title track, also with L.V. The smooth ""Endo Glide"" and the sad ""G'z on da Move"" are deep track highlights, and the best song is the fascinating ""C U When U Get Out,"" an ode to a friend in jail from a guilty party who feels he deserves to be there too. Prodeje's beat and L.V.'s singing shine here. ""Only Lonely Homie"" and ""Now I Lay Me Down"" are also deep, soulful gems.Flaws are few. You know S.C.C. isn't going to be dropping any crazy conceptual music, and even on a long tracklist the weaker tracks are still solid, just not quite as memorable. I could have done without the skits and the two long tracks at the end with MurderSquad.Looking back at all the hip hop brilliance released in 1994, it's incredible to behold; there was so much great music dropping each month that it would have been impossible for one to appreciate it all then. S.C.C. put out a huge volume of music, and their trademark sound is at its best here. ""Kickin' Game"" is just one of many albums that many probably slept on then but still holds up after nearly fifteen years. A furious, quality g-funk album, I recommend it to all West Coast fans, especially for the summer, and any gangsta rap fans who haven't checked out S.C.C. should definitely check it out."
1,"If &quot;Fresh Cream&quot; introduced the trio as a bristling exercise in yanking the blues to the future, &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; showed what Cream could do in terms of melding their blues sensibilities to some solid pop craftsmanship that made room for experimentation enough. They didn't abandon the blues (and never really would); the stirring &quot;Strange Brew,&quot; the thrusting &quot;Sunshine of Your Love,&quot; the jabbingly liquid cover of Blind Joe Reynolds' &quot;Outside Woman Blues,&quot; and the breezy &quot;Take It Back&quot; made that much clear. But now there's a loping, compact pair of psychedelic mini-masterworks (&quot;World of Pain,&quot; with Eric Clapton's neat dub of tandem guitar lines; and, of course, &quot;Tales of Brave Ulysses,&quot; with that sloping splash of wah-wah guitar and Martin Sharp's suggestive lyric); a chiming &quot;Dance The Night Away,&quot; with its sweet falsetto harmonies, Clapton's pretty Byrds-meet-raga guitar overdubs, and the neatness of Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker in the rhythm section; and, even, a little British music-hall lunacy (the hilarious &quot;Mother's Lament&quot;) to punctuate it.For a band who earned a reputation for excess (a reputation not entirely justified), Cream is almost downright restrained here - even if &quot;SWLABR&quot; is pushing it a little bit (though the rippling between Clapton's quivery guitar and Baker's skins is worth it) and &quot;We're Going Wrong&quot; seems a little too anxious to burst its seams before Bruce and Clapton riff it neatly into the finish. The dynamic tension between that restraint and the natural burstings of the three musicians made &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; an album bound (you were sure of it when you heard it in its time) to outlive its time. And that, it did...plentifully."
1,"One of the best rock albums of its time was Elton John's Honky Chateau album from May 1972. It is a terrific effort and sounds like a real band played on it. Gone is the &quot;wall of violins&quot; effect from earlier Elton records, and in its place we have some rocking and soulful tracks with some lighthearted moments thrown in as well. The Honky Chateau (D'Hierouville) in France was the venue for the recording sessions , and was the first appearance in the Elton John Band of the popular Davey Johnstone on lead guitar and mandolin.Elton became the Rocket Man after his fantastic US #2 hit became one of his most famous songs, and thereafter a concert favourite. This tale of a disillusioned spaceman was timed just right for the tail-end of the space race. The second single was Honky Cat, which was a jaunty, fun-sounding song about the dilemma of whether to stay in the country near your roots or to seek your fortune in the city. Lyricist Bernie Taupin had lived this experience himself in the late 60's before finding fame in tandem with Elton after moving to London. The tune Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters is a splendid song - another of Elton's early classics. It is a sensitive song about people in New York, and has the sweetest melody and delightful piano and mandolin accompaniment. My other favourite song is the stomping Hercules - another rollicking rocker that bears Elton's adopted middle name! Salvation is also a nice one - this has a soulful style to its choruses and great backing vocals (a feature on this album), while Suzie and Amy are rock cuts that benefit from some quality teamwork among the players. Amy has memorable electric violin effects in it.Slave is a mid-paced track that sounds bluesy , while the whimsical I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself mocks its bleak tile with a lighthearted tap routine instrumental beat. Mellow is another song that runs along mid-tempo and is quite good.Honky Chateau reached #1 on the US chart, and was the album that began his run as a dominant commercial force in 70's music.Overall, this is an excellent set, and I rate it 5 stars."
1,"This CD is full of smooth and laid back revivals of some melodies of the last 50 years, delivered in Rickie Lee Jones' unique style. Her delivery can best be described as vulnerable, with her soft voice wavering and floating over the lyrics.Rickie's version of the classic ""Hi-Lili Hi-Lo"" revives this work and she pulls off the line ""A song of love is a sad song, ask me how I know"" to great effect.Her version of ""Second Time Around"" seems real with her phrasing and pauses that seem almost conversational.""I'll Be Seeing You"" is mellow, with a clarinett complimenting every line. She ends with the sad line ""I'll be looking at the moon but I'll be seeing you.""""Bye Bye Blackbird"" comes across fun and jazzy.""I Won't Grow Up"" comes across less Hollywood from the Frank Sanatra version from one of his movies.""Love Junkyard"" is full of odd lyrics, testimony to the creativity and sarcasm of earlier generations.The CD ends with the very spooky and odd ""Comin' Back to Me"" that sneeks up on you because she whispers before she sings. This final song haunts like a ghost as Ricki's voice becomes mournful and almost deranged from loss of her lover as she sings ""I saw you coming back to me"".A wonderfully mellow and even quality CD."
1,"What can I say about this album? It's the one that gained the gappers Mainstream Popularity &amp; Mass Critical Acclaim. Words can't describe how much Musical Ingenuity the Gap Band Mastered. These Guyz were more than just a group;They were the Epitome of Soul &amp; Funk Music. They always carried the Torch for Funk back in the day &amp; kept The Funk Alive when many people thought Funk had fell off &amp; was dead. The Gappers still reign as the Icons of that genre. Anyways about Gap Band IV,I can sum it up in so many words: sensational,superb,stunning....The list goes on &amp; on. But let's get straight to the point,this album contains some of their biggest hits. It includes &quot;Early In The Morning&quot; with its outlandish,Synth basslines,The Exquisite Slow Jam Stunner,&quot;Stay With Me&quot;,The Mesmerizing,Multi-Faceted Musical Masterpiece known as &quot;Outstanding&quot;(a dance groove &amp; a slow jam rolled into one) &amp; of course the boomin' &amp; bombastic Monster Funk of &quot;You Dropped a Bomb On Me&quot;. Also &quot;Season's No Reason To Change&quot; is another great R&amp;B Ballad that emulates nothing but Pure Soul. Charlie Wilson's Voice is Rich,Textured &amp; Emotive throughout the entire disc.  And man What a Gift these Brothers have for melodies &amp; songwriting. They really know how to compose a song that leaves a lasting impression on the listener. Don't sleep on the lesser known tracks on this disc. &quot;Lonely Like Me&quot;,&quot;I Can't Get Over You&quot; &amp; the Almighty Groove of &quot;Talkin' Back&quot; keep the Jamz Commin' and hold their own amongst all the Mega Hits here. Bottom Line: The Gap Band's songs are Soulful &amp; Sharp-Witted and their Musicianship is the Tightest,so pick up this album &amp; all their others too."
1,"this is a very very nice CD, one of Brown's best. I would own it if just for the track LYDIAN. I absolutely love the groove and feel of that track and Brown's playing is right on. The songs are good and the production is superb. If you like smooth jazz with a bit of an R&B; flavor I would recommend this disc. Listen to LYDIAN, crank it up and I dare you not to tap your feet.[...]"
1,"Shania Twain is the latest in a long line of successful cross-over artists, and this excellent CD is testimony to that fact.  It is loaded with top ten hits from the first cut to the last.  From the quirky &quot;Don't Be Stupid&quot; to the signature ballads &quot;From This Moment&quot; and &quot;You're Still the One&quot;, Shania blends an awesome combination of fun and seriousness that leave the listener wanting more.  Other songs such as &quot;Man, I Feel Like a Woman&quot; and &quot;That Don't Impress Me Much&quot; are top notch as well.  Shania also outdid herself with some of the videos for these songs, too.  I've seen Shania in concert performing these songs live, and they sound just as good on stage.  Its no wonder she plays to packed houses wherever she goes.  Songs such as the ones on this CD definitely leave the listener wanting more.  Buy this first rate CD and experience the magic of Shania Twain.  You'll want to listen to it over and over."
1,"Following the very popular &quot;Live At Budakahn,&quot; Cheap Trick unleashed this album on the public. While not bad, it begins to show some that CT was wearing down some. &quot;Dream Police&quot; and &quot;I Know  What I Want&quot; are two very good songs. But, my favorite track is  &quot;Need Your Love.&quot; It first appeared on the Budakahn album and it  sounds just as good in the studio. One song I feel that is overrated is  &quot;Gonna Raise Hell.&quot; The song never really made sense to me."
1,"&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; is a compilation of some of hits from 1970-1974 recorded by the biggest selling artist of the 1970's.  Elton John proves on every track that he is one of the greatest performers ever, therefore, deserving the title as the third biggest selling artists worldwide.  His lyrics give the listener a taste of his life from those days.  His depth forces everyone to feel it deep in their hearts.  These words are accompanied by his genius hard-hitting piano sound.  Such combination gives Elton John a unique sound that few have closely matched.He started trends in the 1970's besides his flamboyant outfits.  &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot; started new dance moves on the dance floor.  Besides trends, &quot;Honky Cat&quot; and &quot;Bennie And the Jets&quot; introduced a new way to keep a concert jumping with only a voice and a piano.  His soulful singing is defined on tracks &quot;Your Song&quot;, &quot;Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me&quot;, and the Marilyn Monroe tribute &quot;Candle In the Wind&quot;.  &quot;Saturday's All Right For Fighting&quot; explores his aggressive side.&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; is a must-have for all Elton John fans.  No one will be disappointed in this compilation of catchy tracks.  Those who want to travel further in his past should also listen to &quot;Greatest Hits Vol. 2&quot;, which explores his hits from 1974-1976."
1,"""Honky Chateau"" is an example of why Greatest Hits albums just do not work for great artists. This early Elton John effort is an example of when John and Taupin had some edge and grit to their songs with some western influence. The whole album seems interconnected with excellent music, vocals and words that bond to one of their greatest collaborations. ""Rocket Man"" was the big hit during the albums original debut but the many of the other songs were virtually bigger in quality and longevity. ""Honky Cat"" starts with a smart jazzy sound with Elton in a cocky voice talking about his ""redneck ways"" that jumps and hops but in the next song he steps down and eases into the song ""Mellow"", which slows up to a laid back story of love behind close doors with a lover that makes him sing in a tired but pleased voice ""You make me mellow, oh you make me mellow"" and the song does make you ease into feeling the mellow he sings about. I like the sound and lyrics of all the songs but the oddly up tempo song about a typical teenager being morose in ""I think I am going to Kill Myself"" is spritely entertaining sound of a youth complaining about small transgressions like not using the car then he downshifts suddenly  down in a lyrical sound into a slowing middle eight of ""Get a little headline news, I'd like to see what the papers say, On the state of teenage blues"", particularly when Elton soulfully extends the word blues into a long bluesy wail that just puts this song in a unique category. Salvation is an almost gospel sounding song that starts off slow with ""I have to say my friends, this road goes a long, long way"" with great guitars and backing harmonies that is virtually uplifting in a sound that is optimistic in spite of the challenges exposed in the lyrics. ""Amy"" is just a fun tune that sounds like a young man teased by a wild and more mature woman and he sings with pain and but with optimism in his voice ""Amy I may not be James Dean, Amy I may not be nineteen, And I may still be in romper boots and jeans, But Amy you're the girl that wrecks my dreams"". One of the ultimate classics is ""Mona Lisa"" an up lifting song about a tough life in NY city that crosses the dimensions of different type of people, the poor and the affluent as Elton mournfully sings ""Until you've seen this trash can dream come true, You stand at the edge while people run you through, And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you, I thank the Lord there's people out there like you"" that in the end is uplifting, that he has found something and someone in a tough time and place. Finishing with a flourish, ""Hercules"" is a rollicking tune about being in love with a woman who is unfortunately in love with a muscleman, a ""cat named Hercules"".  The song has John with an excellent vocal with backing vocals with a touch of beach boys' sound and although the song seems to end in defeat, it sounds like the man will persevere with a touch of humor. ""Rocket Man"" is the classic song that Elton used to sing for 20 minutes in concert and it is a great song about a man being a long way from home in a cold desolate environment but the whole album is full of great songs and perhaps this is the best John/Taupin collaboration. The additional alternate version of the western sounding ""Slave"" is more up tempo than the original and is very good but the core 10 songs are just wonderful and always memorable."
1,"&quot;Goin' Places&quot; was an auspicious title to the Jacksons' second album on Epic.  After their first, self-titled album landed them a platinum-selling hit and another top 40 single, hopes were probably high on this follow-up LP.  However, this did not pan out.  This was released after the Jacksons' relatively short-lived TV variety series was cancelled, and that was a good indication of the success that this album would have.  In fact, the problem with the album as a whole is that it sounds as if it was meant to be a vehicle for the show; the overall sound is very much in the styling of a Broadway or Vegas show.  It did not contain a top 40 single, and the album itself did not stay on the charts long.  It does have some notable music, however.  &quot;Music's Takin' Over&quot; opens strongly, with a danceable, bass-driven groove.  &quot;Different Kind of Lady&quot; and &quot;Do What You Wanna&quot; are the album's two Jackson-penned songs, and are some of the best moments on the record.  The former an energetic romp using some voice modulation, syncopated bass and a blaring horn section; the latter swings happily with plenty of brother harmonies.  The other highlight of the album is the closing track, &quot;Find me a Girl.&quot;  This is a classic Philly Soul ballad and, while not a single, has been included on some best-of Philly CD's.  Other notable tracks are &quot;Jump for Joy&quot; and &quot;Man of War,&quot; a rare political statement on a Jackson album.  There are a few dull tracks, but even those are somewhat redeemed by Michael's singing; there is evidence here of his mastery of soul music."
1,"I'm a big Stevie Wonder fan because he is the master of melody, but I have to admit that &quot;S.I.T.K.O.L.&quot; isn't very enthralling.  Only one or two other reviewers had the same standpoint.  I don't see why everyone keeps giving it 5 stars.  Even though I like when artist put a lot of songs on an album, it's more the quality (as opposed to quantity) that I care about more.  If Stevie would've have taken all the radio hits and a few other note-worthy songs and made them into a single album, that would've been much better.  Instead I feel short-changed, sorting through the &quot;not-so-captivating&quot; songs just to hear the gems &quot;Summer Soft&quot; and &quot;Another Star&quot;.  Even the songs I actually like I skip towards the end because they trail on waaaaay too long (i.e. &quot;Ordinary Pain&quot; with its segueway, &quot;Joy Inside My Tears&quot; with its refrain, and &quot;Black Man&quot; with its Black Panther-esque chants).  And what's up with &quot;Saturn&quot;?  I mean it's a good song, but it's just plain weird.  I'm sorry to say that you're not missing anything by passing this up at the store.  Get either &quot;Innervisions&quot; or some greatest hits compilation if you really have to have some Stevie Wonder in your collection."
1,"its probably what got me into rock,and got me to start my own all black female band (read my profile),and it also proove to people black people can do rock just as good as whites if not better(after all we made the genre).a great group that went against the grain of all the pop rock hairband fluff that was playing in the late 80's.living color camed along and gave us lyrics with real life issues,the singer cory glover was a real singer,i'm talking real singing not chris cornnell type yelling.and vernon reid's guitar playing rivals jimmy page and otherhigh profile white guitarists (yeah i said it).he's also the reason i picked up a guitar and started to rock out.the things he does with a guitar is mind boggeling (listen to his solo cd)one thing i like about black rockers is that they take rock/metal back to its roots,by fusing,it with jazz,reggae,soul,punk,blues,and even adding modern black music like hip-hop.white bands tried to do this,and some even done it well if you believe that.but living color and other black bands mastered it. either way this is a great album,and probabley one of the best rock albums of the 80's if not THE best rock album of the 80's...............no screw that this is/was the best rock album of the 80's,and what a great way to close it out aswell."
1,"Toni Braxton really can sing and she's one of several artists still around whose talent gets ignored because she's not the latest ""flavor of the month.""This debut really was back in the ""good ole days"" as far as her career ... remember that Babyface sound was just coming in with artists like Toni and TLC.She won a couple of Grammys for this album and they were well deserved.This isn't necessarily a happy, uplifting kind of album, but it's a cool, smooth vibed LP that's perfect for every mood of modern day relationships as ""relationship"" type music goes.""Seven Whole Days,"" ""Another Sad Love Song"" and ""Love Shoulda Brought You Home"" are the midtempo, though scorned lover-inspired tunes that made Toni famous (though my dad still laments 10+ years later that Toni's music is ""never happy"").Everybody either remembers or should know that ""Love Shoulda Brought You Home"" was the blockbuster single that emerged from the soundtrack of the 1992 hit movie ""Boomerang"" -- I'll never be able to hear this song without that Halle Berry-coined phrase from the movie going through my head (""Love? Don't talk 2 me about Love!!!! Love, Shoulda Brought'cha ass home last night!!!!"" -- a timeless catchphrase, at least in Black America).Her quote, unquote ""happy"" song on this LP is ""Breathe Again,"" another hit single conjuring images of deep love on another level.Toni's music is less soulful and more distressed than even Mary J. Blige's early stuff, but Toni's always had the better voice.  She's not quite a Whitney or Mariah, but she's definitely above Mary J., Janet Jackson and Aaliyah -- top female R&B; artists who all shined in the '90s.This is, however, another ""must have"" CD for all 1990s R&B; fans.This debut was easily one of the Top 10 albums (in popularity and sales) of the decade.Recommended."
1,"Someone once confessed their envy of Jimmy Page because he'd written *all* the good guitar riffs, leaving nothing for the rest of us.  Well, Rage Against The Machine appears to have stumbled on Jimmy's secret stash of leftovers.  But calling these riffs leftovers is doing them an injustice.  Each is a behemoth of intensity and groove, while being surprisingly simple and eminently catchy.  They form a solid foundation for each song, easily allowing the rest of the band to fall into lock-step formation when needed, but also allowing ample room for variation.  And each song is made up of at least four or five of them, all as strong as the first, to create epic five-minute-plus ""agit-pop"" tunes.When he's not anchoring the band with those regal riffs, Tom Morello is coaxing previously unheard of sounds from his Frankenstein guitar.  ""No samples, keyboards or synthesizers used in the making of this recording,"" claims the liner notes, and it's for Morello's offbeat work that this claim becomes necessary.  Every fill and solo is unique, almost anti-guitar, in their sound.  'Bullet in the Head's solo begins with some echo-filled, mechanical sounding distortion.  The solo on 'Know Your Enemy' could have been produced by a malfunctioning tape machine.  'Wake-Up' features a solo bathed in extreme echo and Frampton-style talk-boxing.  Even his more conventional solos are enormous.  'Settle for Nothing' offers up some some languid jazz lines.  'Freedom' is a fine example of how tasty his playing can be when it's not trying to overwhelm you.  And if you love Public Enemy-style sirens with your hip-hop, check out the variations Morello puts on that convention scattered throughout the album (most notably in his rhythm work on 'Fistful of Steel').Bassist Timmy C gets several moments to shine as well.  He slaps and pops the addictive intro to ""Take the Power Back"".  Then, a lazy, loping 4-note theme serves as the delicate opening to ""Settle for Nothing"", before the heavens cave in (""Death is on my side... Suicide!"").  On ""Bullet in the Head"", he provides a 7-note riff that's funky and confrontational (4-notes... 7-notes... See what I mean about simple and intense?).Drummer Brad Wilk combines the skin-pounding intensity of a Dave Grohl, with the Caucasian funkiness of the Chili Peppers Chad Smith, and the hardcore speed of Faith No More's Mike Bordin.  He is much more versatile than you'd think, sprightly riding the high-hat in one verse, crashing the cymbals in the next, and then shimmering through with a snare roll.  Wilk's work on this album, to this day, is my favourite to air-drum to.Frontman Zack de la Rocha may be focused (obsessed?) with social and racial injustice, so much so that those without his same political bent may feel excluded.  But he's also aware enough of the power of a catchy rhyme to draw in those not in the choir, that he lays them out end to end through out the album (""Another funky radical bombtrack started as a sketch in my notebook / But now dope hooks make punks take another look"" he raps on 'Bombtrack', essentially making this point for me).  Zack raps with such passion and verve, and he has such a talent for succinct sloganeering, that he becomes the perfect frontman for this band of agitproppers.  Witness his lyrics to 'Killing in the Name' (still my favourite track).  The song starts with a distorted, almost Wagnerian, guitar overture.  It settles into a quiet bass-guitar and cowbell section duet.  And then the riff comes in.  Finally, Zack begins to chant.  And chant.  And chant.  He doesn't attempt to tell a story here, but instead just spouts slogan after slogan (""Now you do what they told ya"", ""F--- you I won't do what you tell me"", etc.), repeating each over and over.  It's the perfect song for a rowdy group of teenage boys to scream to.  Which I suppose explains its enduring popularity.I've owned this album since 1992, when I was 17 years old.  That year, I saw the Rage boys live in concert twice, and could have gone back for more.  If a CD could show wear, like an old LP could, then I would have worn this one out by 1993.  It rarely left my stereo that first year.  Now, usually when one's love affair with an album burns so brightly at the outset, it's liable to fade quickly.  That's hasn't happened yet here.  I can still play this one all the way through, two or three times a day, for a solid week.  And it still makes me want to move, and yell, and scream, and think.  Now *that* is staying power."
1,"1975's ""Face The Music"" was ELO's fifth album, and it remains my personal favorite ELO disc to this day. It was the first ELO album I ever bought, and it made me a lifelong fan. I was completely blown away by the album's most famous trio of songs that I kept hearing on the radio: the magnificent orchestral rocker, ""Fire On High,"" and the instant pop classics ""Evil Woman"" & ""Strange Magic."" And I was equally thrilled by the album's other musical gems, such as ""Waterfall,"" ""Nightrider,"" ""Down Home Town,"" and the dreamy album closer, ""One Summer Dream."" I love the band's Beatle-esque flair for melody, their fine musicianship & production, and the excellent singing, songwriting, and guitar work of leader Jeff Lynne. Great stuff all the way.Capturing the group right smack in the middle of the 70's, ""Face The Music"" is the Electric Light Orchestra at their most creative. I enjoy all of the band's albums, including other great works like ""On The Third Day,"" ""Out Of The Blue"" and ""Time,"" but ""Face The Music"" is the one that I have the most fondness for. Now, if only those folks at Sony Music would give this album a long-overdue remaster treatment....one can dream. :-)"
0,"First Band on the Moon by The Cardigans had the potential to be a great pop album but there are only 2 good tracks, Lovefool and Been It. Most of the time I don't care for the songs that were huge hits but the rest of the songs are boring and lifeless. The Cardigans have a great sound but too bad they couldn't churn out timeless songs."

1,"John Barleycorn Must Die is a great album and I have a soft spot for Traffic's debut, but as far as I'm concerned they peaked on their self-titled second album.  It strips away much of the psychedelia of Heaven Is in Your Mind, leaving a tasty mix of blues-rock, R&amp;B, folk, little bits of classical, and even country -- all focused into short, tight songs.  Between five great Dave Mason originals and five classics penned by the rest of the band, there isn't a dud present.  Especially noteworthy are the dreamy &quot;40,000 Headmen&quot; (nice flute playing by Chris Wood), the classic rock staple &quot;Feelin' Alright&quot;, and Dave Mason's cheery &quot;You Can All Join In&quot;, and the meaty blues-rock of &quot;Pearly Queen&quot;.  If you like late 60s British rock, this album is absolutely essential."
1,"With three consecutive smash albums (""The Stranger,"" ""52nd Street,"" and ""Glass Houses,"" Billy Joel had cemented himself as rock superstar. Capitalizing on this success, Billy spent most of 1980 on the road, where he played to packed stadiums and small clubs around the United States. With the tour a success, Billy decided to conjure up a live album from the tour. Howeve,r Billy took a decidedly different approach from the tour.Instead of overloading the album with stuff like ""My Life,"" ""Piano Man,"" and ""It's Still Rock And Roll To Me,"" Billy used this live album as a means of introducing his fans to his lesser known pre-""Stranger"" material from albums such as ""Cold Spring Harbor,"" ""Piano Man,"" ""Streetlife Serenader,"" and ""Turnstiles.""Not one of the songs present here was a Top 40 hit, and most weren't even singles. However, despite their relative unpopularity, they are very much welcomed by the crowds and hold the same energy and excitement as one of the megahits.The overwhelming majorty of the songs here are generally superior to the recorded versions, mainly due to the fact that Billy's band plays with a more intense and energetic fervor than the studio band used on the album. ""Miami 2017,"" ""Los Angelenos,"" and ""Captain Jack"" (the latter a tour de force for drummer Liberty De Vito) all have an extra bite not present on the studio version. Slower numbers like ""Summer, Highland Falls,"" ""She's Got A Way"" and ""I've Lovedd These Days"" are more passionate and introspective, while ""Everybody Loves You Now"" is more vitriolic and in your face.Billy's liner notes are incredible - humerous, honest and sincere. He recounts each song vivdly, and recollects memories of the tour in the same manner. I highly recommend this great album by a truly great artist."
1,this is what a Live album should be about.hearing an artist who is bad enough to take it to the stage in his peak.this is the surpreme Live Album of all live albums.hearing a young James Brown on stage is a must have for  any music lover.the band is smoking as well.the Godfather commands your  attention for a whole show period.this is prime time JB.and the Apollo is  where if you were anyone you had to rock the crowd and James Brown threw  down.

1,"POINT OF ENTRY is to JUDAS PRIEST what CARESS OF STEEL is to RUSH.Overlooked, neglected, and absolutely MAGNIFICENT.GUITAR ROCK AT IT'S FINEST!I first purchased this recording on cassette tape in 1981, I was in my senior year of high school. At the time, I already owned the BRITISH STEEL (1980) and HELL BENT FOR LEATHER (1978) cassettes (purchased in that order). By then, &quot;Living After Midnight&quot;, from BRITISH STEEL, had received SO MUCH airplay that I never wanted to hear it again. Much was the same for the entire BRITISH STEEL cassette. My friends just absolutely played it into the ground. POINT OF ENTRY WAS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR! In fact, I think my friends were asleep when this was released, because I was the only person I knew listening to it. I'll say again, POINT OF ENTRY WAS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR, JUDAS PRIEST STYLE!Positioned between BRITISH STEEL (1980) &amp; SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE (1982), it lacked the commercial airplay appeal of those other releases, and therefore explains much of the neglect that has occurred. By the time SCREAMING... arrived on the scene, everyone was playing it into the ground too! My friends awoke! POINT OF ENTRY just sort of disappeared in the sunset. Such a SHAME! By now, HELL BENT... &amp; POINT OF... were the PRIEST tapes I was listening to regularly. Quite in contrast to my friends.The lack of commercial airplay appeal is the one thing that makes this a better recording than either ...STEEL or SCREAMING...The only track on POINT OF ENTRY that received any airplay at all was &quot;Heading Out To The Highway&quot;, and it holds up much better than &quot;Living After Midnight&quot; when it comes to sounding dated.HEADING OUT TO THE HIGHWAY is to JUDAS PRIEST what RUNNING ON EMPTY (the song) is to JACKSON BROWNE. And yes I know the looks I must be getting, mentioning Jackson Browne in a Judas Priest review. RUSH OK, but Jackson Browne? Just goes to show I like all kinds of music.THE REST OF THE SONGS ARE A GUITAR DRIVEN TOUR DE FORCE. The songs &quot;Don't Go&quot;, &quot;Turning Circles&quot;, &amp; &quot;Desert Plains&quot; are PHENOMENAL.The bonus track of &quot;Desert Plains&quot; (live) showcases the band's ability to get WILD in concert. A tight addition in my book. I saw Judas Priest on the DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH tour in 1984. On stage and in studio are definately two very different things for this band. Play the studio and bonus live tracks back-to-back just for the fun of it.If you are a Judas Priest fan and don't own this CD, you are missing the best part of Judas Priest. It had been a long time since the old cassettes wore out, and I have just today, 7/6/01, purchased the remastered POINT OF ENTRY &amp; SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE CD's. I'm still trying to find the courage to buy BRITISH STEEL again. I can still hear it reverberating in my brain from LIVING AFTER MIDNIGHT abuse. POINT OF ENTRY, I'll say it again, IS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR, AS I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS!Additionally, I did not hear the glitch or skip that the other reviewers spoke of. It seems that my copy is an excellant remaster."
1,"3 1/2Perhaps a little too sleekly funked up for its own good, this exciting debut of deserving dance music was still an inspired platform for the jazzy popsters to enter the arena."
1,"Slint's album from 1991 sounds light years ahead of its time, even now in 2003.  The raw energy and emotion achieved on this record is the pure definition of dynamic quality.  The drummer is simply the most talented percussion artist I've ever heard, and the endlessly evolving guitar riffs are truly awe-inspiring.  This is particularly evident on track #2 - ""Nosferatu Man"" and track #6 - ""Good Morning, Captain"", where the sound environment created is beyond the restraints of our physical reality as we know it.  Head-banging rock music combined with though-provocation.  Thank you gentlemen.  Thank you very much.I am almost tempted to take away a star, and it's for a reason that is all too common in the indie-rock genre.  The lyrics to this album are nearly unintelligible (I had to go to the internet, as usual).  Believe me, you NEED to hear Slint's lyrics, because they truly have a message.  Unfortunately, the message is all but lost to all but the most astute listener.  Please, and this message goes out to all indie-rock bands.  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, TURN UP THE VOLUME LEVEL ON YOUR VOCALS IN THE STUDIO !!!  I can name you at least seven indie-rock bands that could of/can vastly improve on their already impressive overall quality by simply doing this in the studio (i.e. - The Promise Ring, Built to Spill, My Bloody Valentine, Red Stars Theory, Hum, Sunny Day Real Estate, Slint, etc, etc.)I fully understand that the following statement makes me sound like a fool, but I'm going to make it anyway:  ""Spiderland"" is a more emotional, more intense, more talented, overall stronger album than Nirvana's ""Nevermind"".  There, I finally got it off my chest.  Nirvana, leave no doubt, certainly has had more influence on rock music in the last 20 years than any other band.  HOWEVER, Nirvana did not ""save"" rock music with their ""grunge-sound"".  In fact, their influence stemmed from the fact that they prevented the tremendous indie-rock / post-punk evolution of the late 80's - early 90's from gaining the popularity that it might have otherwise received (i.e. - Slint, Pavement, The Pixies, Jawbreaker, Fugazi, Husker Du, Dinosaur Jr., etc.).  In my opinion, this is a GOOD THING !!Long live the ""unknown"" indie-rock band !!!Long live Slint !!!"
1,"""Freewheel Burning"" and ""Some Heads are Gonna Roll"" are both very good songs, but other than that I didn't really like this album. It is still much better than Point of Entry, Rocka Rolla, and Turbo. I suggest you get Sad Wings of Destiny, Painkiller, British Steel, Stained Class, and Hell Bent for Leather before you get this one."
1,"This album JAMS! Plain and simple. &quot;I Wanna be With You&quot; kicks off the party with an infectious bassline, crisp cymbal crashes and sudden pauses. &quot;Winner Takes All&quot; is another jam followed by &quot;Life in the City&quot; (The extended breakdown w/the hand claps and fast guitar riffs is AMAZING!)  and &quot;It's a Disco Night&quot;.  Those are my personal favorites off this album and I'm glad they are back to back. There is so much energy on those tracks and Ernie is ripping it on the guitar too.  Man!The ballads &quot;Youre Beside Me&quot;, &quot;Let's Fall in Love,&quot; &amp; &quot;You're the Key to My Heart&quot; smooth out the intense dance numbers nicely. Who can resist the silky vocals of Ron Isley.You will find yourself singing along with Ron Isley's rich falsetto and grooving with the fast-paced rythym guitar and deep basslines.  Its a shame the Isleys have not been fully recognized for the pure musicianship they contribute to the music industry.  They are legendary and their music is timeless.This is a great and necessary addition to your Isleys collection. Peace. CLB."
1,"For many Cheap Trick fans this marks the end of the ""classic era."" While the follow-up to this one, All Shook Up, is arguably their best work, it also marked their decline in the pop music industry and fall from the top of the charts for a few years until they returned with a couple of power ballads. Anyway, Dream Police is a must have for tricksters and contains some of their best songs. Like the album before it, Heaven Tonight, Dream Police kicks off with a pop rock masterpiece as the opener and doesn't really contain a bad song all the way through.  Some are better than others but there's nothing to skip on this CD. Standout tracks include: Way of the World, Gonna Raise Hell, I'll Be With You Tonight, Need Your Love."
1,"Without a doubt in my mind this is the greatest (hip hop) album of all-time from the greatest MC of all time.  This album has it all intense and meaningful lyrics, heart-pounding beats, catchy-soulful hooks and great collaborations.  Every record on this is either perfect or damn-near perfect, nobody makes music like this anymore.  Listening to this album will depress you knowing that Tupac Shakur is no longer here to follow up this classic album, but he spirit lives on within his last LP released (while he was still alive and had full imput on a project).  Rest In Peace Mr. Shakur we miss you more than you could ever imagine."
1,"This is a classic cd, period.  KRS-1 is a living legend, and this is him at his prime.  Songs like ""My Philosophy,"" ""Illegal Business,"" ""Stop the Violence,"" and ""Still #1"" are some of the most quoted/sampled in the last 20 years of hip hop.  If you think you don't know anything by KRS-1, one listen of this cd would prove you wrong  The list of rappers who have sampled or quoted songs on this cd is inexhaustible.  This was big when it came out in 88, and it sounds just as fresh today.  This is a gem among diamonds, a true hip hop classic. Even in Scott La Rock's absence, the production is stellar.  The lyrics are top-notch.  As close to a perfect hip-hop record as possible."
1,"Rage's debut was probably THE first rap-metal album to actually work, and be influential. With Tom Morello's guitar, and Zach de la Rocha's politcal lyrics about war, greed, capitalism, and the government, Rage's blend of rock and rap was potent for its time and groundbreaking. de la Rocha's lyrics were definitely their most powerful and compelling on this album, and even his most personal lyrics (&quot;Settle for Nothing&quot;) are as effective as his political stance. Definitely one of the most definitive albums of the 1990s, and a paragon on what rap-metal shuld've sounded like before bands like Limp Bizkit turned it into a terrible parody."
1,"This album has always been under appreciated but he goes quite hardcore on this album.He also has some beats by Prince Paul.some pretty dope beats and of course his knowledge still reigns supreme on this album.Freddie Foxxx is even on this album.I would recommend this album,battle rhymes and some fun raps and some hard raps on here.Lyrics 10/10 Production 9/10 X Factor 9/10 Classic 8/10 Replay 9Total-8.5 out of 10 Fingers"
1,"I first heard Above The Law on the ""Pump Up The Volume"" movie soundtrack, and the track ""Freedom Of Speech"" was one of the stand-outs on that disc. This is just one of the great forgotten albums of the early 90's, much like Da Lench Mob's ""Guerillas In Tha Mist"". If you're a fan of N.W.A., checking this out is a must, as Dr. Dre produces and drops a few rhymes of course. The delivery and flow from these guys is excellent. Overall ""Livin' Like Hustlers"" is dope, right down to the ""Last Song""."
1,"In 2004 the Fantasy Group acquired the entire Stax catalogue and its mastertapes - and through their 'Concord Music Group, Inc' Division - this release is the first of 3 inaugural CDs re-launching the famous Soul label. They all feature brand-new 24-bit remasters, bonus tracks, updated booklets and are pitched at mid-price. The other two titles so far are ""Tailored In Silk"" by JOHNNIE TAYLOR (1973) and ""McLemore Avenue"" by BOOKER T. & THE M.G.'s (1970). Each title carries the generic logo ""Stax Remasters"" on their spine to differentiate them from previous issues.Released May 2011, Concord Music Group, Inc 0888072328761 breaks down as follows (49:38 minutes):Tracks 1 to 10 are the album ""Be Altitude: Respect Yourself"" released March 1972 in the USA on Stax STS-3002 and April 1972 in the UK on Stax Super 2325 069Tracks 11 and 12 are ""Walking In Water Over Our Head"" and ""Heavy Makes You Happy (Alternate)"" - both tracks are PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASEDThe new 12-page booklet has very knowledgeable and affectionate liner notes by ROB BOWMAN (author of ""Soulsville U.S.A. - The Story Of Stax Records""). You get the original artwork and production credits also and there's a collage of 3 photos on the inlay beneath the see-through tray and the disc itself pictures the group too. But it's a shame the booklet goes no further - there's no new photos, none of those magical Stax sevens pictured nor any memorabilia. It makes the inlay feel workmanlike at best - even a little dull - when it should have spread its wings a little. But the big news is the SOUND...24-bit remastered from the first generation tapes by JOE TARANTINO at Joe Tarantino Mastering in Berkeley, California - the audio quality is truly GORGEOUS. Having had previous versions of this great Soul album on CD from the mid 1990's - the sound was good rather than great - hissy in places too. That's all gone - and it's not loud for loudness sake either - but clear and warm and full of presence. The bass is beautiful as is the rhythm section - and the powerhouse vocals of Mavis Staples now take centre stage in a way they've never done before. ""Respect Yourself"" and ""I'll Take You There"" are so common to our ears that it comes as a genuine shock to hear them sound this good. The other single off the album ""This World"" is so clear and muscular too (lyrics above). A fantastic job done.The bonus tracks are way better than I had expected - the 'Alternate' version of Jeff Barry and Bobby Bloom's ""Heavy Makes You Happy"" was recorded August 1970 at their first session in the Muscle Shoals Studios and sounds like a live rehearsal - it's excellent. You can clearly hear EDDIE HINTON on Guitar and BARRY BECKETT on Keyboards and the end of the song hears them ad-lib for a full minute longer than the finished single did. But then we get the real deal - an outtake that could easily have been an album track. Recorded in Muscle Shoals in October 1972 and written by PHILLIP MITCHELL, TERRY WOODFORD and OSCAR FRANCK - it features the other in-house band members for the album DAVID HOOD on Bass and ROGER HAWKINS on Drums and it's a winner. ""Walking In Water Over Our Head"" is a fully finished upbeat song that could easily have been recorded yesterday. Genuinely - after all these years - to hear any new material by The Staples Singers from that stunningly creative period is an out-and-out blast.To sum up - as a voracious lover of the label, these reissues are incredibly exciting to me. With this properly realised sound quality - I immediately order the other two. As for The Staple Singers - their uplifting Soul and Funk music combined with their message of love and positive thinking have resonated with generations of listeners for decades now - and at last - both the group and their admirers can get to hear their efforts at Stax really shine...A bit of a forgotten Soul classic frankly and recommended big time.PS: titles in the ""STAX REMASTERS"" series are (all reviewed):1. McLemore Avenue - BOOKER T. & THE M.G.'S (1970)2. Woman To Woman - SHIRLEY BROWN (1974)3. Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get - THE DRAMATICS (1972)4.

1,"Flawless songwriting, technical proficiency, strong melodies and pleasant harmonies - this is what Tears for Fears is all about. They proved this to the world with ""Songs from the big chair"".The music is rich and has an inherent freshness that time could not possibly destroy. It almost appears that the duo has paid excessive attention to every note and detail of their music. The highlights of the album are ""Everybody wants to rule the world"", ""Head over heels"", ""Shout"" and ""Working hour"".For those that crave ""quality"" music, this album is your key to that!!!!"
1,"This album is no question one of 2Pac's best and most complete albums front to back.  Not one song on here is filler.  2Pac in my opinion is the greatest overall rapper of all time.The album starts off with Tupac calling out other rappers (Biggie, Nas, Jay-Z, Mob Deep, etc.) and exposing them as phonies saying that they are fake and should just quit rapping all together.  The next track ""Hailmary"" is one of the best songs on the album.  It features the Outlawz which do a decent job rapping and it has a hot beat.  ""Toss It Up"" has a tight chorus, good lyrics, some singing in it, and he disses Dr. Dre and Puffy.  ""To Live and Die in L.A."" is lyrically the best song on the album and it also has a sweet chorus.  ""Life As An Outlaw"" is a good song but the Outlawz kind of ruin it with stupid and unitelligent lyrics but it has a really good chorus.  The next 2 tracks ""Krazy"" and ""Just Like Daddy"" are songs about getting high and going crazy and doin' girls ""just like daddy.""  ""White Manz World"" is a song about living and growing up black in this white mans world.  ""Me and My Girlfriend"" you'll probably recognize because Jay-Z stole the chorus for his '03 Bonnie Clyde song off of his Blueprint 2 album.  The next track ""Hold Ya Head"" is a slow song saying that no matter what you're going through you got to hold your head up high and keep on going.  The last song ""Against All Odds"" is as he puts it ""the realest s**t he ever wrote.""  He disses a couple of rappers and he has a nice flow.  I think it's a great song to finish the album with, it ends with gunshots.Overall I gave this album a 5/5 because I think album deserves to be up there next to such classics as Nas' Illmatic.  It may only have 12 tracks but they are all almost flawless tracks and the only thing that really holds back the album are the Outlawz.  I would suggest this album to all rap fans, it's definitely worth your money."
1,"I don't understand the beef with In My Lifetime vol 1. This is the last album before Jay blew up and went mainstream. Which means this is arguably his most gutter hood album. With this record you can hear his pain, regrets, paranoia and insight into the mind of a hustler. You can tell that he knew that he was in position to become the man once ""BIG"" was gone. My favorite cuts are Imaginary Player, A Million, Streets is Watching, Who you Wit, Where I'm from, and You must love me. Don't Sleep!!!!"
1,"What an incredible listening experience! Most records out now (or back then for that matter) don't draw from such diverse sources and are still consistently excellent. Everyone knows the greatness of the classics on the  album (&quot;BOTW&quot;, &quot;The Boxer&quot;, &quot;Cecelia&quot; and  &quot;El Condor Pasa&quot;). But, the songs that weren't hits are excellent  and nearly as good as the classics (not to mention better than most groups  entire catalogs). &quot;So long Frank Loyd Wright&quot; is gorgeous.  &quot;Keep the Customer Satisfied&quot; and &quot;Baby Driver&quot; are  great upbeat and swinging rockers. &quot;Song for the asking&quot; is a  fitting epitaph to an incredible duo. The only flaw on the album is a dry  live version of &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; but, the song is not unlistenable.  And after all, what album doesn't have flaws?"
1,"This album is the straight-up hardcore from beginning to end.  People  slept on this album when it came out, but they need to wake up and pick  this up, on the serious tip.The most fiery cuts:  Duck Down, Drug  Dealer, Sex &amp; Violence, Build &amp; Destroy.Most subversive track:  &quot;13 &amp; Good&quot;, a tale of statuatory rape with a twist  ending....Superb production values by KRS-1, Prince Paul, Pal Joey, and  others...This is the LAST album by KRS-1 recorded under the group  moniker BOOGIE DOWN PRODUCTIONS.  Check for his subsequent solo releases:  RETURN OF THE BOOM BAP, KRS-ONE (self-titled), and I GOT NEXT...FRESH  FOR 1992, AND YA KNOW IT!!!"
1,"It would not be at all rash to call this a life-changing collection of songs.  No, not at all.  Come, come, come all you lovers of music who think you've heard everything.  Come, and obtain this gorgeous introduction to the music of Leonard Cohen.Come, and listen.  Listen, and be changed.Every song is amazing.""Suzanne"" is an obvious classic, with lyrics and a structure so unique and listing that sometimes when I'm listening to it, I think it would be an impossible song to ever remember and sing without the music playing.""So Long, Marianne,"" I think, contains the meaning of life disguised as the sounds of fiddle notes sliding sidewise, and a melancholy yet joyous refrain.""Bird On The Wire"" has lyrics that are a classic although bittersweet tribute to individualism.""Famous Blue Raincoat"" tells an unbelievable and unjudgemental story of a man whose marriage was forever altered by his wife having an affair.  Leonard Cohen addresses the song to his wife's former lover, and says:""ThanksFor the trouble you tookFrom her eyes.I thought it was thereFor goodSo I never tried.""Whoa.All the other songs, including ""Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye"" are timeless as well, and make me wonder why Bob Dylan got so much attention when he had another Jewish contemporary who was just as good and even more mature in his songwriting.There are songs of Leonard Cohen's that I wish had made this compilation--including ""Tonight Will Be Fine"" off ""Songs From A Room""--but overall  I'd still say this album is the perfect introduction to a good range of Leonard Cohen's earlier (and best) work for anyone unfamiliar with him, and a good mix off four great albums for any one of his old fans.Sincerely, M. Smith"
0,"This is the worst Primus album, easily.  Herb left the band right after the completion of this atrocity which says a lot about the state of the band. Tales is completely inaccessible(which is good in a way) but only because the music is incomprehensible.  Claypool still manages to cram a nice amount of sick bass riffs in here, but the playing is uneven.  Some of the tracks meander on for upwards of seven minutes and the lyrics are trademark ridiculous as always.  Ler's guitar playing is scattered but brilliant in spots.  This is definitely the low point of the Primus catalog. Thank God for Antipop, this is for hardcore Primus completists only."
1,"Look no further, lads and lassies, this is the album that defined &quot;jungle,&quot; that unsteady skittery mix of breakbeats and deep dubby base; rhythm, but no distinct rules for it.  That's jungle.  No mainstream  artist has ever produced anything like &quot;Timeless.&quot;  The title  (and first) track consists of three parts: &quot;Inner City Life,&quot;  &quot;Jah,&quot; and &quot;Pressure.&quot;  Twenty minutes long, but it's  instantly accessible.  Probably one of the only jungle /drum 'n bass tracks  where the instrumental part is actually more interesting than the vocal  (All of the other tracks follow suit, particularly &quot;A Sense of  Rage&quot;).  No other MAINSTREAM jungle artist can do this!  C'mon, we're  all grown up enough here to admit that the only interesting tracks on Roni  Size's &quot;New Forms&quot; were the ones with vocals!A brief history  on the man himself...Goldie discovered breakbeats at London's Rage  nightclub with his then girlfriend Kemistry and her DJ-ing partner Storm.  Rage utilised reggae soundsystems and DJs like Grooverider to push  breakbeats to new heights.  After exposure to this, Goldie created  &quot;Timeless&quot; in 1995 (if I may correct the previous reviewer), and  formed the Metalheadz label, now one of the premier labels in Jungle and  Drum 'n Bass. Metalheadz is now also a club in London where Goldie is king  and top-notch jungle can be heard every week.  LTJ Bukem, Alex Reece, Roni  Size....nothing these guys have produced can touch  &quot;Timeless&quot;...well, because it truly is."
1,"Snoop's long awaited second album finally dropped 3 years after his classic debut (due to some legal trouble).  This one has no Dre touch to it but Daz Dillinger (produced 3) & DJ Pooh (produced 7) as well as Arkim & Flair, Soopafly & Lt Hutton (all do 2 songs), and Sam Sneed does 1 and they make it a good one production wise and Snoop delivers in his flow.  Probably his second or third best album he ever did.  Has a few classic tracks (3) and 3 near classics but a few sub-par ones that I skip (2 or 3) keep it from being a 5 star classic.  Definitely recommended though.#2 - 7 (f/ Charlie Wilson)#4 - 9 (f/ Kurupt)#5 - 5#7 - 8.5 (f/ Charlie Wilson)#8 - 10 (classic f/ Bad Azz, Techniec, Kurupt)#9 - 7.5#10 - 8.5 (f/ Soopafly & Too $hort)#11 - 9 (talks about the hard days of growing up for Nate Dogg, Warren G, Daz Dillinger & himself)#12 - 10 (Classic f/ Kurupt, Daz Dillinger {Dogg Pound} & his 213 buddies Nate Dogg & Warren G - talks ablout groupies)#13 - 9.5#14 - 5.5#15 - 10 (classic w/ 2 verses from Tray Deee)#16 - 9.5 (f/ Charlie Wilson)#17 - 9 (f/ Bad Azz, Techniec, Daz Dillinger & Kurupt)#19 - 10 (classic)#20 - 8.5 (f/ Daz Dillinger of tha Dogg Pound & Tray Deee)b.

1,"Got the import Music on Vinyl pressing, which i'm very pleased with. Although a bit pricey, it's a fabulous reissue, and it includes two bonus tracks at the end of each side of the record. The first is called ""Out in the Cold"", and is actually really quite good. The other is a live version of ""Smokewater Jack"",which doesn't really improve much on the studio version. Either way, every song here is pretty much a winner, particularly the first three which are now considered legendary. High quality pressing, no unwanted surface noise or any of that. If you're willing to pay the steep price, I'd totally recommend this."
1,"As John Lydon might say "" This is not an album review!"" This is one review of one song and after considerate review Last Christmas is by far one of the finest pop tunes ever written,....Tell me baby do you recognize  me well if ya didn't it doesn't suprise me, with a face of a lover and a smile in his heart a man undercover who tore me apart!"
1,"Alice in Chains crashed onto the &quot;grunge&quot; scene with much help from Nirvana. Seattle was now the meca &amp; birth place for this style of music. Pearl Jam had yet to release their debute - so the market was still  fresh. While Nirvana was in your face; anger &amp; hate, guitars plugged in  as high as you can turn the volume. Alice in Chains also brought anger  &amp; hate to the table, but they also brought better musicianship &amp;  melodies (if you will). The song structure(s) is compelling and complex.  Layne Staley is multi-dimensional in his delivery. Jerry Cantrell is  exciting to listen to on guitar. It's too bad their personal differences  &amp; drugs crippled them from the start. Imagine the music they could've  put out had they been &amp; remained good friends. Thru all the turmoil  tho, AIC did manage to put out a few good albums. Their 2nd effort,  &quot;DIRT&quot;, is the culmination of all their precise efforts (every  AIC fan should start their collection with &quot;DIRT&quot;). However,  AIC's debute is an essential one to own as well - simply because you can  listen to a great band in their infant stages... ready to break out of the  cage."
1,"In May 1964, the Moody Blues formed their group which included Denny Laine (who in the 1970's became a member of Paul McCartney & Wings) and Clint Warwick. Their first album included a big hit with ""Go Now,"" and thereafter every attempt at having a successful followup single fizzled. In frustration, Laine and Warwick eventally left the group.  At that moment, The Moody Blues could have thrown in the towel and permanently called it quits.Nope. Didn't happen.  THANK GOD IT DIDN'T.......  When The Moody Blues in 1966 ""reorganized"" their group in adding lead guitarist/vocalist Justin Hayward and bassist/vocalist John Lodge, the band then ventured out with their debut album with their new lineup.  With the huge success of 1967's ""Days oF Future Passed"" which contained the hits ""Tuesday Afternoon"" and ""Nights in White Satin"", The Moody Blues serious attempt to duplicate that success in their followup album takes a very sharp turn of direction with ""In Search of the Lost Chord.""Unlike ""Days of Future Passed"" which also featured The London Festival Orchestra, The Moodies on the 2nd of their ""Core 7"" albums didn't need an orchestra on this album...THEY LITERALLY BECAME IT, playing something like 33 instruments by themselves.  If there was an instrument they didn't know how to play that they wanted to incorporate into their recording, they would learn how to play it on the spot.  That, my friends is called REAL musical talent.""In Search of the Lost Chord"" is perhaps the Moodies release that stands far apart from all others.  The songs have a lot to do with the social fabric so prevalent for its time in 1968, namely the drug culture (""Ride My See Saw"" and ""Legend Of A Mind""), astral projection (""The Best Way To Travel""), and trancendental meditation (""Om""). In fact, all the tracks on the original album of ""Lost Chord"" have been influenced in one way or another by these attributes.  ""Legend of a Mind"", which eventually became a Moody Blues staple and was performed at every Moodies concert until writer/flautist/vocalist Ray Thomas retired from the group in 2002 actually is poking fun at LSD guru Timothy Leary. ""Ride My See Saw,"" written by John Lodge has been the Moody Blues encore and closer at their concerts for many years.  Both are distinct highlights from this album.All the bonus tracks added onto the CD version of this album are an added plus and will truly be enjoyed by the Moodies fan.  ""Simple Game"", which was originally released as a single many years ago, but never appeared on ANY Moody Blues album until their ""This is The Moody Blues"" Greatest Hits package was released in 1974 pleasantly makes it onto ""Lost Chord"" as a bonus track.  Moodies fans will find lots here to enjoy in this entire set to appreciate while perhaps overlooking all questionable references listed previously. A nostalgic and ""trippy"" Moodies album release indeed, but another true classic from this legendary British band.As an added note, this album turns 45 years old this year.  How time flies when you're having fun!Now how about honoring these guys for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame?"
1,"On their fifth album, Jeff Lynne and company finally put it all together.  Face The Music is the band's first bonafide masterpiece, eight songs without a clunker in the bunch.  ""Evil Woman"" and ""Strange Magic"" are the two big hits from this album, but the instrumental ""Fire On High"" may well be the best known song, having been used for years as the ABC Wide World Of Sports closing theme.  ""Waterfall"", ""Night Rider"" and ""One Summer Dream"", while never huge radio hits, help round out what it the band's first front to back classic.  With the exception of the odd but endearing ""Down Home Town"", Face The Music is a smooth, seamless spin that leaves you wanting more, the perfect setup to A New World Record."
1,this is one of michaels best selling albums.  and i know why because it rocks. this is a great cd. love this album. best songs on this album are all of them
1,"This is a great album. Cream had only three others, but none of them were as complete as this one. Nowadays you could just go with a greatest hits and get the goods from the other three albums but you WILL miss out on goods from this peice, cuz this album is complete. Not as straight up blues as FRESH CREAM, but this was 1967. You weren't allowed to release an album unless it was somewhat psychedelic. Well Cream answered the call mixing their blues with acid rock and a handful of EARLY HEAVY METAL...STRANGE BREW... Is a pretty tripped out song, I think its about dating a witch. Hah, tell me about it.SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE... Is the HIT.WORLD OF PAIN... Very trippy.TALES OF BRAVE... One of the first metal songs ever.It starts slow but these guitars really HEAT up.SWLABR: That actually stands for ""she walks like a bearded rainbow,"" I don't know if the songs supposed to be gay or what but its a very catchy tune. One of my favorites.Those are just my initial picks, the whole thing is good. If you just want SUNSHINE then maybe the greatest hits will be your route; I think you still get STRANGE BREW and BRAVE ULYSSES but you will miss out on other greats in exchange for crap songs like (crap) ANYONE FOR TENNIS."
1,"I first heard COPPERHEAD ROAD when I was in the army when some of my friends decided to turn the barracks into one giant party. Somebody decided to put this on, and I had to stop and listen, it totally had me hooked. The next day I went out and bought it and I still pop it into my CD player 12 years later. I am a rock fan, but  his blend of rock and country is just mind blowing. This album went with me to the Persian Gulf, during my tour of Korea, and now that I live here in CA. The first SEVEN songs are just classic songs that will get you going: COPPERHEAD ROAD, SNAKE OIL, BACK TO THE WALL, DEVILS RIGHT HAND, JOHNNY COME LATELY, EVEN WHEN I'M BLUE, and YOU BELONG TO ME. These songs are reason enough to buy this album. The last 3 songs are good songs, but to me they lack the punch of the first seven. Like I said before, this album had me hooked the first time I heard it, and very few albums have ever done that to me. So I highly recommend this album for addition to your collection."
1,"Just look at the cover photo & the name of the band. One of the best records of all time. Different, inventive, fearless, revolutionary, sincere, solid, art at it's best. This is what rock & roll is supposed to be all about. Tom Morello is the most inventive guitarist since Van Halen. Love this band. Highly recommend all of their stuff."
0,"I thought this cd was so wack, that I had to check the cd package to see if this was really Brian McKnight doing the performing on this cd. First off the rip-off jobs he was doing on songs as title track(sounds like the riff to Outside Your Door by, Me'Shell Ndegeocello) and the track The Only One For Me( stealing the riff to the R Kelly remix of I Can't Sleep Baby, yall know what I'm talking about). You Should Be Mine was another let down. And what's up with Jam Knock ? I wish artist like Brian would stick to what they know instead of listening to their A&amp;R reps. I guess I'll just stick to the first two cd's he released. By the way those uptempo cuts on the first two cd's are way better than the crappy ones he's got on the new one. I just can't recommend this to anyone. As a matter of fact, I'm giving him two stars based on his past performances and hoping for a better outing next cd.Peace  Xes Cainam"
1,"Warren Griffin was one of many rappers coming out from the West Coast with the breezy G Funk Sound in the early 90's. What differs him from others was that he's actually the half brother of master producer Dr. Dre and he's an hell of a producer aswell. This album is his career highlight, unfortunately the only really good album he made. It got great laid back G-Funk sound, good lyrics that differ from the average Gangsta Rap album at the time. And a few standout songs in the hits ""Regulate"" with Nate Dogg which samples a Michel McDonald song, ""This Dj"" and first single ""Do You See"" is also worthwile. However, it's a very short running time (most songs are about 3 minutes) and among the 12 songs, two are actually skits and shouldn't be counted. Just like his bro, he isn't among the best Mc's, rather a great producer!. Thus, you'll find many guest atists included. Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg and female rapper Jah Skills on ""Super Soul Sis"", all others are not known at all. ""Recognize"", ""What's Next"" and especially the brilliant ""And Ya Don't Stop"" are all worthwile non singles. ""Regulate...G Funk Era"" is a great album that was perfect for it's time with great production and some fantastic tracks and one of 1994's greatest Hip Hop albums. Both ""Regulate"" and ""This Dj"" were top 10 hits and the sound of the whole album is above the rest of it's time. It isn't quite a classic though, but more then great album and worth your time."
1,"Aaliyah's debut CD yielded two Top 10 singles - ""Back and Forth"" and ""At Your Best (You Are Love)"" (the later or which was written and originally recorded by the Isley Brothers).  However, the CD is filled with great songs, including a great balance of hip-hip songs (Throw Your Hands Up, Down with the Clique) and ballads (Age Ain't Nothing But a Number).  Almost any of the songs on the CD could have been a hit single.  That said, Aaliyah's voice was not as mature as it would be later, and some of the lyrics are a bit juvenile (if you're not down with my clique/ then you're poop on a stick).The entire CD was produced by R. Kelly (he appears in the shadows on the CD back cover and is name-checked in several songs).  With one producer, the CD sounds very cohesive, but it also is not as varied as her later CDs.  It was rumored that she and R. Kelly were married at the time, even though she was only 15 years old. Her marriage seems to be addressed in the song, ""Age Ain't Nothing But a Number,"" which argues that she is wiser than her years would seem.At times, the album sounds a bit dated (the CD ""One In a Million"" is much better).  One of the lyrics states, ""Aalyiah's got a 90's swing,"" which is pretty accurate - the CD sounds very much like an early 90's hip-hp CD.  Despite this complaint, I still greatly enjoy this CD.  It sounds great and is a lasting tribute to Aaliyah's talent.  We will miss out on hearing future recordings from this superstar, but will continue to enjoy the music she left behind."
1,"I have listened to ""Pink Moon"" again for the first time in a year. In fact, I let it cycle through three times, feeling compelled to try and grasp the fleeting music before it fades away to silence, for this, at times, the music of quiet. Perhaps it is the vocals, often a hoarse whisper that cannot compete even with the solo acoustic guitar, or perhaps the hollow wisdom of youth trying to lament honestly life's shortcomings. There are moments of unfathomable insight and heartbreak encapsulated here.The title track is a delight, but the interplay of piano and guitar makes me yearn for more instead of less, so that after a few songs with just guitar and vocals my attention drifts. Each flows and melds into the next, never quite forging a separate identity, one extended thought shrouded in neither black nor white but a gray, hazy and vague. Still, the effect for me is much like trying to make a meal from a stash of communion wafers. Each song ushers in a promise of something more, something beyond the pall, but few fully satisfy. (I prefer his other work on ""Five Leaves Left"" and ""Bryter Later."")Desolation and isolation may permeate the songs, but Mr. Drake still displayed his mastery of the acoustic guitar with a touch and flair that both keep the whole recording from drowning in melancholy and testify to his considerable talents. Hence, ""Pink Moon"" seems as a fitting requiem for Nick Drake."
1,"*The following comments are in regard to the bonus tracks on this release. To read my opinions on the original content of this album, check out my review under:""A Question of Balance"" by The Moody Blues (Audio CD - 1997) - Original recording remasteredHere is what I enjoyed about each of these outstanding bonus offerings...""Mike's Number One:""An upbeat and beautiful spiritual sounding Mike Pinder tune ... Based on the lyrics, this song could have been titled, ""A Happening,"" ""Do You Know?,"" or ""See The Glory."" The track definitely has that ""A Question Of Balance"" sound to it, but it also would have made a fine addition to Mike's 1976 solo release, ""The Promise,"" or could have made a possible bonus track for that CD release. :)""Question"" (alternate version):This mix is like an extended version of the single mix of the song ... The sound quality is outstanding on this mix, especially on the louder elements of the song. The track also comes to a full ending with somewhat of a Spanish-flavored guitar style, at the very end. :)""Minstrel's Song"" (original mix):This is probably the least interesting of the bonus cuts, because the song fades in, on this occasion, with very faint vocals heard in the intro. The song also fades out in the exact same spot as the album mix, because while the final version fades into ""Dawning Is The Day,"" we can still hear The Moodies chanting ""Around, around,"" one last time, very faintly, at the beginning of ""D.I.T.D."" The only positive side to this mix is that it is not cross-faded with the tracks that surround the song, on the final version.""It's Up To You"" (original mix):Much like the single and ""Best Of"" (Ex: ""The Best Of The Moody Blues,"" ""Gold"") mixes of ""The Story In Your Eyes,"" from ""Every Good Boy Deserves Favour,"" this version of ""It's Up To You"" is similar to the original album version, but the instrumentation near the end of the track is carried on a little bit further, before the fadeout ... It's good ""ear candy"" which listeners haven't heard before. :)""Don't You Feel Small"" (original mix):This version has an extended beginning AND ending to it! The instrumental lead-in, at the beginning, is awesome, and sounds similar to the instrumental fadeout, near the end of the song ... Nice job on the guitars, mellotrons, and percussion, all at the same time! :)""Dawning Is The Day"" (full original mix):Same format as the previous mix (above), and the deleted material sounds just as great! :)In addition, the CD booklet, that accompanies this release, provides readers with the details on the controversial album cover to this LP (rear sleeve) ... Check out this release to get the full story (Page 13). Fans who own both this CD release and the 1997 CD remaster will notice that this version features the artwork that was changed while the 1997 version features the original artwork.Just like the 1997 CD remaster of ""A Question of Balance,"" this Deluxe Edition also featured a topnotch remastering job! I would recommend this release to any Moody Blues fan or collector. Thanks for reading! God Bless... :)"
0,"I love the Beach Boys as much as anyone.  Let me say that again.  I love the BEACH Boys as much as anyone.  By that I mean I love the Beach Boys who actually live up to their name, singing about the beach, girls, surfing, cars, and Rhonda.This is not the Beach Boys.  It can't be.  Why?  No beach songs!  I thought it was some kind of joke.  All &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; offers is the opportunity to hear Brian Wilson whine for forty minutes, backed by elevator music.  There's barely any Mike Love on the album at all.Way overrated."
1,"Cher is always on the cutting edge, but often its do to the fact that the record company is on at the time is really striving for a hit.  In the case  of her self titled 1987 LP, it was David Geffen's brain child to bring back  Cher as a hard rock queen, but with songs that aren't to rough.  Its power  chords meets a light AC feel for the most part on the album  &quot;Cher&quot;.It begins with three big hit pieces.  First is her big  comeback hit in &quot;I Found Someone&quot;.  It's edgy with a lot of  force.  She battles her way to find new love with smoky vocals on top of  guitar rock sounds.  &quot;We All Sleep Alone&quot; is a smart power ballad  with Bon Jovi's style as they craft this work with a combo of rock sounds  and biting lyrics like &quot;You may have lovers wherever you roam, but  sooner or later, we all sleep alone.&quot;  It's meaningful in a world that  has too many people desperate for love.  &quot;Bang Bang&quot; is a semi  interesting rock take on the original, which was kind of an odd folk rock  number.Then the album just goes into another area all together.  You  get Cher combining her voice with the womanly anthem of  &quot;Perfection&quot; with Darlene Love and Bonnie Tyler.  It's pop  perfect indeed with a slight rock edge.  You also get really hard numbers  like &quot;Dangerous Times&quot; and &quot;Give Our Love...&quot; not to  mention pristine ballads like the lovely &quot;Hard Enough Getting Over  You&quot; and the solid lyric work of &quot;Main Man&quot;.  Cher strikes  an even more rebellious song for the working gals with the pop rock  of...well, &quot;Working Girl&quot;.The real winner is a dance track out  of the realms of Madonna's club scene.  &quot;Skin Deep&quot; is an  outrageous blend of bass, drum and keyboard that resembles eighties pop  fever.  It doesn't really fit on this Cher rock album, but its an  unexpected joy and separates from the near sad tones of love, loss and  fighting for independence in the other songs.  It's just kooky dance that  is simpler yet more magical then her sexual disco records.In all, a  great short set of Cher songs, but not her most famous of even the  eighties.  That would be the full on AC rock of &quot;Heart Of Stone&quot;,  but &quot;Cher&quot; with it's new ideals on even old music is trend  setting.  The sad fact is though, many credit Cher's huge name in motion  pictures for making this set a hit, while others just the unbeatable rock  sound of the time.  I would hope that fans will check this one out for  something different and really appreciate the woman for trying new things  and making them work."
1,"Gza is the most lyrically sound emcee in the entire wu tang clan, and im not picking favorites, he is not even my favorite member of the clan. There is almost no doubting his remarkebly easy flow and creavtive metaphors, which can either make you just want to hear more, or rewind it to hear what he just said. While listening to this album, and earing some of his unbelieveably creative rhymes, I wondered how does he come up with these, ""Lyrics are weak, like clock radio speakers"", is just an example of his creatvity. He has the ability to hit you in all types of places which has been a rare quality in an emcee since the beginning of hip-hop and is completely exstinct in today's rap. Aside from the lyrics, Rza, brings in some of his sickest and his most eerie for this album. Using experimentally spooky and out there sounds to create his unbelieveable beats which are always put together perfectly to allow Gza to flow right over them. Some of the best Wu tang beats of all time are on this album, perhaps many are. Gza also often credits Rza for his insane production, ""my sword still remain imperial, Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial"" showing he knows he is not the only reason this album is monumental.As an emcee, Gza seems to make other rappers on his tracks better lyrically. Notably Inspectah Deck and Method Man. On the albums best song ""Cold World"", The inspectah virtually outshines Gza which is a complete shock considering how sick Gza's verse is. The inspectah seems to just be a bit hungrier,""No time to freeze undercovers roll up in grand prix and seize packages and pocket the currency, clicks control strips full clips are sprayed, Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay"". Aside from whose better on the track, the two make the best tag team wu record of all time. However, its not just the lyrics that make this the best song on the album, the beat is also the best on the album, with spooky violins and drums which just flow so sickly. Another great tag team callobo is ""Shadowboxin"" featuring Method man. Gza does not get outshined on this one, though Meth throws in a sick verse. When Gza kicks the second verse though, he's hungry and he actually shows it a bit more then usual, he usually just seems so confident he doesn't have to be aggressive but his slight aggressiveness on this track is outstanding, ""I slayed MC's back in the rec room era, My style broke mother_______ backs like Ken Patera, Most rap ______ came loud but unheard Once I pulled out, round em off to the nearest third"". The beat on this one is also top of line, not as scary, more quietly aggressive, simple but not light. The ""Oh man"" every few seconds that chimes in is a nice touch.One of the most creative rap songs ever written, and Im not exaggerating, is ""Labels"". Gza is able to tell a story while using the name of music labels, and he is not crediting them, more like he's dissing them. Never have I heard an emcee even attempt to create something like this, truly proof that he his the genius. ""Investigative Reports"" is another great track. It opens up with a sick verse from Raekwon. With U-god telling different reports during the chorus with a newscast going on in the backround. The beat is one of those that hit home, they go to your head and you don't hear the different instruments, just the beat as a whole, and it is a great one. ""Swordsman"" has a great beat that is mostly drums with strange sounds in the backround. Lyrically Gza seems to be trying to say something but he adds ""I'm not caught up in politics I'm no black activist"", so I guess it's more about self then political indevers. The final track is not Gza but it furthur prooves that success around ""Liquid Swords"" is contagious, Killah Priests raps the vastly different from the rest of the album ""Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth"". It has more of a funky beat and it's a biblical song, initials are B.I.B.L.E. Priest tells a great story of his childhood and gives out instructions before leaving earth.Every time I listen to this album, it gets better. Everytime I notice something different whether lyrically, or musically. It is easily the best Wu Tang solo album and perhaps riviles ""Enter the Wu Tang"" as best Wu production period, well not quite. Every track on this album is bangin' with some of them just completely off the chains. Could be lyrically the best album I have heard, and it shows how much of an amazing lyracist Gza is. He never changes his tone which is affective because he smooth easy flow is so good he does not need to compromise it at all. Not only Gza made this album the phenomenom it is, much of its success is due to the producer, Rza. ""Liquid Swords has it's place amongst the greatest of all time and easily is one of my personal favorites."
1,"I love the gap band. That's my 70's time.this is a good song while on the elliptical machine at the gym.I love a variety music to listen to on my MP3 player, because of the hours I spend at the gym .Great song. You will like it too.."
0,"Well this is not quite the best Tupac album ever. Im not saying its bad im just saying compared to albums he has put out in the past for example &#65533;All eyez on me&#65533; and &#65533;Me against the world&#65533; this album is not as good.Ru still down features two disks but one must say that if they had just added the best songs onto one disk this album would have been better.For me standout tracks on this album are first off from disk 1, Open fire, the title track R U Still Down (remember me), I wonder if heaven got a ghetto and to be honest I can only pick out one good song from disk 2 which is Do For Love.Its not really a good example of what Tupac was really about. The beats are lame at times and don&#65533;t really appreciate Tupac&#65533;s lyrical capabilities. Saying that this album is way better than some albums other artists have been releasing and one the reasons I am a bit disappointed with this album is because of the quality of past projects. It really does give you the idea that someone has just put these songs together and hope they will please fans because Tupac is singing it.If someone picked up this album and had not heard of Tupac before this moment they wouldn&#65533;t think much of it and it would be left picking up dust.If you really love Tupac you should get this album but personally if I were you I would try to find someone that has it and just borrow it off them for a few days. A bit disappointing."
1,"The kat below me is absolutely right. To say that Pac is a joke is just immature. If Pac is such a joke, than why has he sold 3 times more records than BIG? Biggie has sold 15 million worldwide, and Pac has sold 75 million. That's a 6:1 ratio there, little kid, do the math you freakin 6th grader. Anyways, forgetting about record sales, yeah, biggie didn't write his rhymes down, but he did memorize them just like any other rapper does. That's impressive, but that doesn't make him a better MC. And Biggie made 3 albums in a span of 3 years. 2Pac made 10 albums in a span of 5. Talk about impressive. Beside's, who's going to listen to somebody who writes a 3 sentence review anyways? Especially someone who wrote- BIG is betta....top of dome...yeah...forever... Come on you wimp, step ya game up, buddy. I own all of Biggie's and 2pac's albums, so I know what I'm talking about. No doubt, Biggie is one of the best rappers ever, probably in the top 2. But to say Pac is a joke is in fact a joke. Just check the average stars for this cd, 5. Go spend your time doing something else, cause you're a big joke. Biggie And Tupac Forever...."
1,"A very steady recording indeed by Traffic. On this release, both Steve Windwood and David Mason contribute some excellent songs. Pearly Queen, Don't Be Sad, Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring, Feelin' Allright, Cryin' To Be Heard, and You Can Join In are all catchy focused numbers with some captivating solos which are not overly extended. In addition, the vocals stylings are very expressive in the case of both Windwood and Mason. They both bring out every possible tone in their voices.Overall, the effort is consistent if not quite spectacular as John Barleycorn or Low Spark Of Hi Heeled Boys. Vagabound Virgin does drag after a while and the last two songs(not including the extra tracks) are not as good as the others. None the less, the prime time material on this record makes it a worthy purchase."
1,"While many people often say an album like 'New Jersey' or 'Slippery When Wet' are Bon Jovi's finest album(s), I am pretty different. In my opinion, their 1984 self-titled debut album is their best and my personal favorite.I had the cassette of this, and I have just about worn it out. This album is superb. Jon Bon Jovi and company are at their best here. This album, of course, contains one of their most well-known songs to date, 'Runaway.'Other great songs here are 'She Don't Know Me,' 'Shot Through The Heart,' 'Get Ready,' and another one of my all-time favorite Bon Jovi songs, 'Roulette.'I would say that if you don't own 'Bon Jovi,' than you are really missing out. If you enjoyed 'Slippery When Wet,' than I can almost guarantee you will love this album.Overall, I strongly recommend this album for any Bon Jovi fan. This is the band at their best. It sounds just as good in 2008 as it did in 1984.This is highly recommended for any Bon Jovi fan, whether it be casual, new or die-hard. This is a must own album. An '80s classic.ENJOY!!!"
1,"...pretty good. It wasn't to long ago since us old alternative fans converted to metal. Alternative is still pretty good though. But back when I was into alternative more, I got this album for &quot;Walkin on the Sun&quot; and &quot;Why Can't we be friends.&quot; But I listened to this whole thing and its very crunchy hard punk music that I didn't really like back then. It wasn't the ska formula with &quot;Walkin on the Sun&quot; that their new album &quot;Astro Lounge&quot; brought us that I don't really care for anymore. But latley, I picked up this album from under my bed and started to listen to this. This was pretty good. &quot;Flo&quot;, &quot;Beer Goggles&quot;, and &quot;Lets Rock&quot; are all tyt songs. This CD is nothing like the newly turned pop Smash Mouth. I really do recommend this album. Its the album that has the retro stuff thats way better than the new."
1,"This is an incredible cd I remember when my mom used to listen to it and I enjoyed it then and I still enjoy it now this is a good cd it has some great songs on here: It's over now, the night I fell in love, creepin , and many others . Luther helped Lisa Fischer make her debut she was a back up singer for him  and I really do enjoy Luther's cds I would recommend that you buy al of his classic cds because you will be satisfied the winner of 4 grammys and the legendary award you are the best Luther and you deserve every award that you receive keep bringing us some good music and get well soon!!!!!"
1,"I've always heard an Orbital song here and there on different soundtracks and what not, and then one day it hit me. Maybe I should actually buy an album from the Hartnoll brothers. Let's just say I'm very glad that I did. All of these songs are very peaceful and really pretty songs. They are very good at making songs that aren't too loud and in your face, but at the same time you would never fall asleep listening to their music. It just has a way of keeping you interested. This is my first Orbital album, and I am very happy with it. I definitely plan to buy more CD's from Orbital. Let's talk about the second CD in this set. &quot;Satan&quot; is a great song, especially the live version. I just love the beginning, &quot;By the way son, if you happen to see your mom this weekend, tell her that SATAN, SATAN&quot;. The first time I heard it I really got a kick out of that. One of my favorite parts is in the live version of &quot;Halcyon&quot; where they insert an excerpt of &quot;You Give Love A Bad Name&quot; from one of my favorite bands, Bon Jovi. This CD has someone to offer every techno music fan, old and new alike, you will be happy to have &quot;In-Sides&quot; as a part of your CD collection. Also try &quot;Orbital 2&quot; and &quot;Snivilisation&quot; which I have heard before, they are also very good records. Peace."
1,"For some odd reason, I've been bumping a lot of stuff that came from the Jersey area this week.Lords of the Underground (L.O.T.U.G., DJ Lord Jazz, Doitall, and Mr. Funkee Man) are probably one of the missed groups that came out from Newark, N.J. area. This was their debut album, ""Here Come The Lords"" that dropped back in '93. This album was entirely produced my Marley Marl and K-Def. This album alone has some of the most excellent production I've heard from the East Coast in a minute. Most of the production is unique and garunteed to make your head bob. When I first heard ""Funky Child"", I couldn't stop bobbing my head to the loud horns that K-Def and Marley Marl hooked up for this group. Other awesomly produced songs were the hit song ""Chief Rocka"" (I believe that's their well known song). ""Keep It Underground"" is also another song with great production.As for the trio themselves, they bring many lyrics to the mic on this album, and it seems like they were having a lot of fun doing it. ""Mad Skillz"" shows exactly what the group has. One humorous track would be ""Sleep For Dinner"". The song will make you laugh but at the same time they were being serious. ""Grave Digga"" and ""Psycho"" are also standouts. DJ Lord Jazz even gets some love on the song ""Lord Jazz Hit Me One Time (Make It Funky)"".As for anything bad. There isn't much at all if you ask me. One thing I found a little aggravating was the fact they kept shouting out their name throughout most of the album. Other than that, this is one excellent album from the Brick City. This album is full of East Coast flavor that has some great production. Given this, I will make an effort to check out their sophomore album ""Keepers Of The Funk"". This is one that I highly recommend that you listen to, because you will love it.Lyrics: AProduction: A+Guest Appearances: N/AMusical Vibes: AOverall: AFavorite Tracks: Here Come The Lords, From Da Bricks, Funky Child, Keep It Underground, Check It (Remix), Grave Digga, Flow On, Mad Skillz, Psycho, Chief Rocka, Sleep For Dinner, Lords Of The Underground, Lord Jazz Hit Me One Time (Make It Funky)Peace Everyone."
1,"You'll notice that I said the least interesting, but yet I still gave it five stars.  Why?  Well, it is because the main seven Moody Blues albums are all legendary classics.  The Moody Blues were way ahead of their time, and even though they were playing all the way through the nineties, their main seven are the songs people want to hear when they are in concert.  I have their ""Live at Red Rocks"" DVD and it's probably their best live performance although I wish there were more video material of their progressive rock era.I've listened to this album all my life so it's easy to forget that only one song from this album was actually a charted hit.  The song ""Question"" charted as high as #21 in 1970.  This track was just as odd to hear on pop radio as Led Zeppelin's ""Whole Lotta Love.""  It's amazing how diverse pop radio was back in the early seventies.  The Jackson Five, Neil Diamond, Carpenters, CCR, and then The Moody Blues and others?  Everyone in music was so wonderfully different from each other back then.When I hear the Brothers Four playing ""Greenfields"" from back in 1960, I can't help but to compare it to the Moody Blues' ""And The Tide Rushes In.""  My favorite songs from ""A Question of Balance"" is (well practically every track on side two, but anyway), ""Minstrel's Song"", and ""Melancholy Man."" These few really do stand out as my favorites.From ""Days of Future Passed"" to ""Seventh Sojourn"", the Moody Blues play a very important part of the Progressive Rock era, along side of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd, Strawbs, Aphrodite's Child, Eloy, and Triumvirat and many others."
1,"This is a pretty good album from 'Til Tuesday.  I admit that I've never listened to it as much as Voices Carry and Welcome Home, though.  It's a good release like the previous two albums, but still sounds a bit different  from them.  The album's production and musicianship are quite impressive  and tight.  The songwriting isn't bad, either.  A lot of the material on  Everything's Different Now sounds a bit like folk music, though.  That's  one reason it sounds different from their other material.  The album has  some good stuff on it.  Songs that I like the most are &quot;Crash and  Burn,&quot; &quot;Long Gone (Buddy),&quot; and &quot;Why Must I.&quot;  Aimee Mann does well with the vocals, also.  I've always liked her singing.  Everything's Different Now isn't a personal favorite, but it's still worth  a listen."
1,"OK, I have to say that all other outkast albums are sub-par in my opinion. But this album is different; for one thing, the beats are their best and their lyric's are the deepest on this cd. If you must listen to only a few of the tracks they would be ATLiens, Jazzy Belle, Elevators, Wheels of Steel."
1,"Although aware of Cher as an actress and someone who'd sung with her then-husband Sonny Bono, it wasn't until I was alerted to a new song by Cher.  Upon hearing it, I discovered she'd covered a Laura Branigan song I'd so adored on her Hold Me album.  The song was of course ""I Found Someone,"" which consisted of Michael Bolton's synth-oriented production, the same way he'd do Jennifer Rush on Passion.  Cher's eponymous 1987 album was a vehicle to her second comeback following a string of movie successes, and is a snapshot of the slick synth/pop music of the 80's, when hard rock and pop consisted of layered synths and power ballads, the genre Bon Jovi succumbed to in Slippery When Wet.As a diehard Branigan fan, I prefer the original, but there is a place for this remake, given the wall of synths production, and Toto's Steve Lukather giving help on guitar and on a solo.  Cher's version scratched the Top Ten compared to Branigan's #90.Jon Bon Jovi and his bandmates give Cher lots of help here, whether it be on instruments or backing vocals, or songwriting.  ""We All Sleep Alone,"" the #14 single, was co-written and featured backing vocals by Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, and rock producer Desmond Child.  Another backing vocalist here is legendary songwriter Holly Knight, late of Spider and Device.  There is that sage acceptance that sooner or later, we all sleep alone.  The same team contribute on a souped up version of ""Bang Bang,"" which she had done in the 60's with Sonny.  There is an operatic quality to the backing vocals, which is then given a harder-edged sound thanks to Richie Sambora, and a wall of synth sound by Holly Knight and Chuck Kentis.  I heard this version before the original, and in a rare move, find this to be my version.Desmond Child wrote and sang backups on the ballad ""Main Man,"" something Cher has had difficulty hanging onto ironically enough.  No, really, this is actually a great power ballad.  He and Diane Warren also co-wrote ""Give Our Love A Fighting Chance"" and ""Perfection,"" the first a power song that could fit on a Bon Jovi album, Slippery When Wet-era of course.  On the second song, Bonnie Tyler and Darlene Love sing the first two lines and are the featured vocalists joining Cher.  The song's theme of being at perfection at work AND at love reflects Cher's choice in singing it, given her marital track record with Sonny and later Gregg Allman.""Skin Deep,"" though an upbeat number, managed a #79 showing on the charts.  The Desmond Child-Michael Bolton written ""Working Girl"" is a commentary on the hard work and harassment office women get.  The last track the Bolton-produced and co-written ""Hard Enough Getting Over You"" lists the painful reasons why one is reluctant to allow someone back into their life, be it the hurt from lies and the fear of latent pain becoming manifest.  One of the better non-singles here.Cher's comeback is also a testimony to the 80's synth-oriented music produced by Desmond Child and Michael Bolton-okay, I'll give Bolton credit for his songwriting and production, but not his singing!  Cher would further her comeback on her next album, but alas, how some short some comebacks last."
1,this man  has maintain his position in life.  he has a starr all over the world... Happy Birthday goes a long ways.  Keep up the good work Mr. Wonderful!!
1,"This album is just gorgeous from beginning to end. Jazz/blues/rock/pop/R&B;/soul flows from beginning to end with ease. It has a clean live sound and excellent musicians. Some of the best love songs of all time are on this album. As prolific a songwriter as Carole is, she never made another masterpiece like this. 8 of the album's 12 original tracks were either hits or radio staples and the album tracks compete with the hits like champs.Several of the songs were also recorded and made hits by other artists. Rod Stewart made So Far Away his own and (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman is remembered as an Aretha Franklin song. My personal favorite is It's Too Late. It's probably the best song she ever wrote, with its wonderful jazz bridge and understated jazz leanings.Carole is not the best vocalist in the world but she sings with enough feeling to truly deliver this album's emotional wallop. It was recorded in 1971, but sounds like the whole rest of the 70s due to the influence that it had on that decade. There were many imitators that came later and I can only wish that modern songer/songwriters would look here for a much needed dose of sophistication.Highly recommended."
1,"The Jackson family took an important step forward with this album, which trades on their early 70s style for the emerging disco & funk. Michael's voice has matured more at this point, and on songs which he sings lead, he pretty much sounds like he would a few years later in his brilliant solo career. He really lets it all out on ""Show You The Way To Go"" (arguably one of the best songs of the ""Jacksons"" period), and is also good on the hit ""Enjoy Yourself"". The disco-ish ""Think Happy"" is also good."
1,"I got into rap seriously back in the days of Warren, Dre, Snoop, &amp; Pac. Regulate was really tight. Doggystyle was bumping everywhere you went...But this CD was it for me. This CD took me from uncertainty about rap to being a firm believer that given the right rapper, anybody can love rap. It's been about 4 years now and I still play this CD and absolutely love it. Songs for when you feel good, bad, mad, sad, whatever. 2 discs of tracks you're always willing to hear. This is what all rap should be like. Forget Jay-Z, No Limit, Cash Money. This was the REAL thug. This was the REAL rap. Pac put his heart in it like no other. If you don't get into this album, you don't know what rap actually is."
1,"This is a flawed classic from Eltons golden period when he was selling more records than anybody else on the planet. There are a some all-time classic Elton tracks in the ""The Bitch is Back"" and ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"" as well as ""Pinball Wizard"", which is a extra track on this CD.The main difference with this album over say his other classic albums of the 70's is the addition of the Tower of Power horn section. This adds some umph to the whole proceedings. So very average Elton songs like ""Your so Static"" and ""Stinker"" (both of which I love) become much funkier affairs.Overall then this is an underrated album, that whilst not quite as good as GYBR or Tumbleweed Connection, is far better than its given credit for."
1,"Though to some extent the Fall are a ""single's band"" they still have put out a lot of solid albums. Owning all of them might bankrupt you so besides any of their greatest hits albums (as long as they focus on older material) this is the place to start. This Nation's Saving Grace sounds like a monologue on everything from Margaret Thatcher era England (Spoilt Victorian Child)to the leader of one of the group's greatest influences, Can (I am Damo Suzuki) over angular post punk/funk rhythms.  I prefer it over Gang of Four as This Nation's Saving Grace is not guilty of being didactic but instead is a chunk of bile and vitriol that must have been on Steve Albini's turntable more than once. I don't know whether the current bunch of post punkers from Williamsburg that slavishly imitate this sound are a good or bad thing. However, the Fall, despite line up changes are still a solid band and This Nation's Saving Grace is their most focused musical statement."
1,"This is Cameo as they should be remembered from 1980. Tight horns, vocals, percussion, and ryhthm section. This is the same description I can use for E,W&F, but these brothers also hit you with a massive dose of funk. 'Cameosis' was one of 2 albums released by Cameo during 1980, with the classic 'Feel Me' following later in the year. If you're like me, you'd love to see the record company release a special 2 on 1 disc featuring BOTH of Cameo's landmark albums from 1980, but stop dreaming, you'll have to make it yourself like me!"
1,"Elton John - Elton John I (1970) (*****) 13 tracks (50:53)Elton John's first official US release is one of the only Elton John albums that I can honestly say I really like every single song on it. There just are no weak tracks on it in my opinion. This is the album that really got me interested in exploring more of Elton's early work. After hearing this album enough to really get into it, I realized that there must be much more unknown music of his besides what I had previously only heard on the radio or off his greatest hits album.This version was also the first of the Island records re-masters that I bought. The old original MCA version that I had was known to have excessive tape hiss on it, so I wanted to compare the two. Honestly, it's like night and day, literally. The background of the re-master is completely quiet, a much needed improvement! Now, as the bonus material goes, it is kind of hit and miss. It really doesn't add much to the original album. Bad Side of the Moon is a good song, but the two other tracks, an alternate version of Grey Seal and Rock and Roll Madonna are kind of mediocre. Still, over-all, this is a 5-star album."
1,"This was Roy Orbison's last album, which came out shortly after his death.  It went on to become his best selling album ever.  No doubt the publicity surrounding his death helped sales, but a lot of it had to do with ""You Got It"", which was Roy's last hit single.  ""You Got It"" is a great song, and there are several other fine songs here.  I especially like ""She's a Mystery to Me"" and ""The Comedians"".  This album makes a good final testament to the greatness of Roy Orbison.  Recommended to Roy's fans."
1,"Thug living to the death ""Against All Odds""  has been 2pac's image throughout his career and Makaveli is nothing short of a classic.  Vindictive as most of this album is, 2pac flows with feelings of life or death situations.  He compare all that he's seen in a street life with Bible scriptures that no one man can answer his questions only in an after life.  There is brighter side on this album with ""Hold Ya Head"".  'Pac and Outlawz have a dedication to the ladies on ""Just Like Daddy"".  Even with the explict lyrics you can understand the point and feel that he has a heart hidden in his masculinity.  Titles like ""Krazy"" and ""White Man'z World"" he plants his position on family and being an African American male in America as said ""...you don't have to be in jail to be serving time...""  If you don't listen to the lyics on here from a perspective unbiased you'll miss the message like ""Me And My Girlfriend"" where he's actually speaking about his trust in his guns.  Combat and retaliation is Pac's strength battling other emcees/rappers and calling them out.  To the bloody end I send a 21 gun salute.  R.I.P. 2pac."
1,"The formation of Toto was a logical idea from the beginning.  Founding members David Paich and Jeff Porcaro had both worked as session musicians and played on a number of the same albums--they both played on Seals & Crofts' 1974 album ""Unborn Child"" before they were even 20 years old, a record that also featured original Toto bass guitarist David Hungate.  Paich, Porcaro, and Hungate all played on Boz Scaggs' 1976 album ""Silk Degrees"" which has writing contributions from Paich on a majority of its tracks including the classic ""Lowdown"".  Steve Lukather had begun to make a name for himself as a session guitarist in his own right by 1978, & vocalist Bobby Kimball had done sessions also.  So, the formation of Toto allowed its members to make their own records in addition to contributing to the records of others.  All that said, Toto obviously had no shortage of stellar musicianship, plus they were able to handle a variety of styles with ease.There was another crucial key factor as well.  David Paich was already an accomplished songwriter by the time Toto formed, and he dominated the songwriting on the first couple Toto albums--8 of the 10 tracks here are Paich solo compositions.  That said, it seems clear that Toto was, at the beginning, largely Paich's baby and an outlet for his songwriting.Toto's debut album is ultimately an uneven affair.  There's a frustratingly high amount of pomposity here, as if the group was trying to compensate for a lack of strong material by mixing in exaggerated crescendos all over the place, generally to annoying effect--the relatively short album-opening instrumental ""Child's Anthem"" is a prime example.  ""I'll Supply the Love"" has arena-ready (if overly slick) hooks, but it's underdeveloped and has a tacked on and overblown instrumental coda.  Kimball's ""You Are The Flower"" has him delivering an overwrought vocal and has an annoyingly tuneless melody.  ""Girl Goodbye"" repeats a simple riff excessively to headache-inducing effect and also suffers from its aimlessness.  The main ballad portion of the album closer ""Angela"" is stately but dull.On the more positive side of the coin...  ""Georgy Porgy"" is an infectious R&B-flavored; tune very reminiscent of Boz Scaggs with its flutes & Steve Lukather's vocals seemingly trying to imitate Scaggs somewhat--unfortunately, it's let down a little by the obnoxious Cheryl Lynn vocals toward the end.  ""Manuela Run"" and ""Rockmaker"" are both rocked-up pop tunes with nice hooks, and the big hit ""Hold the Line"" is an undeniably catchy song that neatly mixes doo-wop with hard rock.The best song though is Steve Porcaro's transcendent, wistful ballad ""Takin' It Back"", additionally graced by a really nice (though brief) acoustic guitar solo; again, it is marred a little by the annoying sudden musical ""pows"", but it's a minor complaint in this case.  The reflectiveness and personal nature of ""Takin' It Back"", not to mention its sheer sincerity, is striking in the context of the album--it's perhaps a shame Steve didn't pursue a solo album during this period.Overall, QUITE a mixed bag of an album, but a respectable debut from the guys."
1,"This is the one that put Buddy back on the blues map. With the help of several well-known friends, including Mark Knopfler, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton (who once called him the greatest live blues guitarist), and the great Memphis Horns, Buddy burns on the more uptempo tunes like the soulful groove of &quot;Where Is the Next One Coming From&quot; &amp; a definitive version of the classic &quot;Mustang Sally&quot;. Buddy's gritty, passionate vocals are intense without being totally over-the top, &amp; the background vocals are perfect. The slower tunes are not the old, tired, by-the-book standard slow blues, but are leisurely, rolling blues, focused as much on piano &amp; horns as on Buddy's guitar. He closes things out with &quot;Rememberin' Stevie&quot;, paying tribute to his own biggest fan."
1,"First of all, its an EP but it has LOSER on it which I already have. Then it also has SOUL SUCKIN JERK which I already have. So what am I paying for? Well first off, SOUL SUCKIN JERK is even better than the one you know (and that song was flippin awesome in the first place).Well, consider a few things. How much of a BECK fan are you? Do you like the LOSER song? Are you into BECK because you just heard that E-PRO song on the radio?I like the songs on here a whole lot, personally. I wouldn't have just bought this myself on a whim, I knew ahead of time that I wanted the songs... Like FUME. This is a very raw, old school BECK song, about locking yourself up in a vehicle with your friend and huffing gas to get high. This song has one of the greatest BECK hooks ever....Theres a fume, in the truckand I don't know if I'm deador what the f*ckGreat stuff. Beck doesn't sware like he used to. He used to sware alot. He had a lot more piss and fire in his songs, this stuff may seem very strange to new fish. CORVETTE BURNER is another raw rowdy peice and ALCOHOL is a folksy ONE FOOT IN type of song. If you've never heard the ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE album, this one may seem kind of strange too.Beck has a lot of ultra rare stuff, B-sides, soundtrack cuts, indie records... One of these days it would be nice to see some sort of anthology be released. Theres so much great stuff by this loser.As for this one, try and get it cheap, as it IS only three songs that you wouldn't be able to find else where."
1,"ABBA-GOLD/GREATEST HITS: Modern bubblegum's greatest and most successful practitioners...some claim they're the biggest selling group in the world...get the anthology treatment here, although it would have been a richer strike if it included ALL their cotton candy charters, instead of most of 'em. Their underrated, sweetly rendered second single HONEY HONEY and bigger hit (to say nothing of bigger mouthful) I DO I DO I DO I DO I DO certainly deserve their place alongside the exuberant DONNY OSMOND-like breakthrough WATERLOO, disco era fave DANCING QUEEN, and MONEY, MONEY, MONEY (something ABBA knows well enough to chirp about). Lead songbirds Frida and Agnetha's sensual, pop-perfect pleas and Benny and Bjorn's frothy radio-ready compositions will have all but the most jaded listener humming and tapping along...guilt-free grin and vacant stare optional. ABBA almost singlehandedly invented the need for Karaoke, but don't hate 'em for it...just nod your head and sigh, ""How Swede it is!""RATING: FOUR VOLVOS"
0,"1985's &quot;Dream of a Lifetime&quot; was Columbia's attempt to get some revenue from the then-recently-departed Gaye.  It is obvious to the discerning ear that the &quot;singer&quot; heard is not the great Marvin Gaye.The songs themselves are dull and lifeless.  They may have been written by the genius but the form that appears here seems amateurish, at best.I'd give it &quot;no stars&quot; if not for the fact that it does have a decent pic of the singer on the cover."
1,"Enya is one of of the most mysterious singers in music today. I consider her to be one of the few female singers who in my opinion can still make some great angelic melodies that don't sound banal or cheap even though some of her songs are so short as to be almost like unfinished demo tapes( Will she someday produce and compose a song that is about eight ot nine minutes long). The Memory Of Trees is my second favorite CD of hers behing Watermark which I consider to be her strongest outing to date. I doubt Enya will topple Watermark to tell you the truth.Many people say that this is a sunny album. Well, it is kind of true. The sunniness is evidenced on the title track, Anywhere Is, and the Orinoco Flow-esque On My Way Home. Generally I think of this album as an album for a cloudy, romantic autumn evening with the leaves a bright red, orange and yellow. Several songs are quite dark and cloudy but not stormy like let's say Storms In Africa, Exile, or creepy like Evening Falls. This album is a gorgeous musical journey that trancends boundaries. I find this to be like the darker companion to the sunniness of A Day Without Rain which followed this one five years later.I usually go with the darker material that Enya does but I enjoy the brighter material as well( I love music that is dark and stormy).The title track is a gorgeous instrumental that has Enya returning to the days of the Celts CD. Instead of the usual piano instrumental that introduced us to Watermark, Shephard Moons, and A Day Without Rain we get a song that is more synthesized and with thundering beats to bop your head to combined with Enyas multilayered vocals that starts out as a cloudy minor note and after about 30 seconds it morphs into a major note to give an impression of the sun shining through the clouds on a warm autumn afternoon. This song is more similar to the Celts than the piano instrumentals of most of her albums although this song is much brighter than the Celts title track. Anywhere Is is like the blueprint of Enyas big-selling A Day Without Rain. It's a very bright, sunny song with rhythm that could make you almost bop your head along with. This song is more legato although there are hints of the staccato pizzicato strings that would dominate a lot of Enyas A Day Without Rain. I love the quiet middle part of the song. It kind of reminds me of the quiet bridge of Orinoco Flow a few years before then. After the sunniness we head into darker, mistier territory of Pax Deorum. This song is another dark almost Gothic piece that features Enya singing in Latin with a very misty feel. In the middle of the song the rhythm pauses and the sing becomes a major note for about a minute giving an imression of the sun breaking through the dark clouds. I consider this to be Enyas best 'Gothic' song to this day. It's almost like the darker side of Heaven if you could call it that. The song reverts back into a dark misty minor note song. Athair Ar Neamh is a very sad, cloudy evening song that features Enya singing in Gaelic. This song is a very beautiful, theme for a guy who is having a lonely summer. The song ends in a major note key like the sun breaking out just before it goes down. From Where I am is a beautiful piano instrumental. China Roses is a gorgeous, breathtaking, ambient song that made me get this album. It's one of Enyas most stunning compositions to date in my opinion. China Roses is a very romantic song that brings up images two lovers walking alongside the waterfront with the red leaves falling onto the surface of a pond with a large garden of roses and a huge crystal castle in the background. China Roses is one of Enyas most brilliant songs to this day. This song is the winner on the Memory Of Trees. Hope Has A Place is a another beautiful song that is similar to China Roses although not quite as powerful or mind- stimulating but still great. This song is a song about how hope is still existant even in bleak situations. This song reminds me of How Can I Keep From Singing from Shepard Moons. Tea-House Moon is one of the best Enya instrumentals I have ever listened to. It's a very stunning song with high pitched synths in the background with electronic synths in the foreground. This song is one to enjoy when it's cloudy and the red leaves are falling to the ground. This song is one of my favorites off this CD. Once You Had Gold is one song that you probably shouldn't play if you have not had much sleep because it's one song that will sooth your soul. I fell asleep in class a few times in the past listening to this song *giggles*. This song though is great though. I enjoy it alot on a cloudy evening. La Sonadora is a very haunting song that features Enya singing in Spanish. This song is very dark and spooky although not stormy or scary as let's say Exile, Storms In Africa or the dynamite Na Leatha Geal M'Oige but this song is one of the darker songs off this album. The chants remind me a bit of Smaointe from a decade ago. We brighten up again with the closing track On My Way Home. This song that contains many elements of the 1988 hit Orinoco Flow although not as spooky as that one. This song is much brighter than Orinoco and happier. This song is like the predecessor to the brightness of A Day Without Rain that followed this one five years later...I consider this to be one of Enyas strongest albums to date. Only Watermark surpasses this one and it's not by too much. I strongly recommend that all Enya fans buy this amazing masterpiece. It's gorgeous and an album for the soul..."
1,"This album IS the 1980s. ""Heat of the Moment"" and ""Only Time Will Tell"" are two of the musical highlights of the decade and this album is almost as solid as those two singles. I have read criticisms that the album is too ""cliche'd."" I'm not sure what is meant by that as I thought ""Only Time Will Tell"" had a very unique sound for a single. This is not an ordinary pop album. It has a powerful, progressive sound yet a sound that is also accessible (progressive rock moves into the 1980s). ""Without You,"" for example, starts out as a ballad and then launches into a killer guitar solo with keyboard in tow, then settles down only to explode once more. ""Cutting it Fine"" is a rocker until it reaches a very interesting slow piece at the end. The music takes the listener through different emotions. Although I can't give this classic any less than 5 stars, I think some of the songs are overdone, such as ""Time Again"" and, especially, ""Wildest Dreams."" The POW! POWPOW! part of the latter track seems a bit much to me unless the band was simulating war sounds to keep with the theme of the lyrics. Still, it seems overpowering in this song. On the other end of the review spectrum, perhaps this album is overrated; however, the next two Asia albums (Alpha and Astra) are painfully underrated, so it all evens out."
1,"solid cd, the p-funk crew were experimenting something p-funk always did and the results paid off but george has yet to call the mothership, still every funkateer must have this to their collection, up for the down stroke has bootsy on the bass the chants, and beats is catchy, testify is a remake the cut that put parliament on the map back in 1967, the goose is strange some may not like this song, but the weird effects, guitar, and drum, plus george being himself makes it work-underrated, i just got back is strange it's okay sounds john denver at disneyland, all your goodies are gone has a nice piano vibe thank you bernie, the bassline kicks ass-plus the vocals,and the melodies fit the song- sounds like some ghetto shakespeare stuff a classic, whatever makes baby feel good is a slow blues tune which may bore you-but eddie hazel stops by and makes you bob your head (thank you mr.hazel for that hot solo), the last cut presence of a brain shows you how creative a mad band can get, eddie sings lead here the lyrics are scary and fits the vibe, then at the end gary, and calvin join in saying when god's children going to get together this song is scary but i love it, this cd is the bomb and parliament was just getting started."
1,"I've been buying Monk CD's for a year now, and have half-a-dozen. Of the 100 or more reviews of Monk music I've read here, the majority say &quot;There is no bad Monk album.&quot; So far, I have to agree. &quot;Brilliant&quot; is a 1956 effort with Sonny Rollins on sax and some other fine contributors. In 43 minutes, Thelonious challenges us, pleasures us, intrigues us. The moods and tempos vary among and within the five selections, four of them Monk compositions. In addition to Sonny's tenor sax, there is Ernie Henry on alto and Oscar Pettiford on bass, Max Roach on drums. On one number, Clark Terry's trumpet and the bass work of Paul Chambers are featured. But the star of this release is the pianist himself. One of Monk's endearing habits was his recycling of original tunes from year to year and label to label and ensemble to ensemble. Don't ever worry that the track listing on one Monk CD has some songs in common with another disc...no two versions will ever sound quite the same. On this disc, for instance, &quot;Ba-lue Bolivar Ba-lues-are&quot; lasts more than 13 minutes. Named for a Manhattan hotel, the song shows up again in late 1962 on the equally famous &quot;Monk's Dream&quot; album for Columbia, but at half the length and with only one saxophone. A similar fate occurs with &quot;Bemsha Swing&quot; which is nearly eight minutes on &quot;Brilliant Corners&quot; for Riverside, but eight years later was re-recorded for Columbia at half that length and with quite a different feel and sound (it is included on the &quot;Monk's Greatest Hits&quot; CD.) While he seldom recorded the song &quot;Brilliant Corners&quot; after this album, due to its complexity and perhaps its perfection in this incarnation, the tune &quot;Pannonica&quot; also was redone in later years. Of the six Monk CD's I have, I can't tell you which is &quot;best&quot;. I haven't lived with them long enough and heard each of them enough times. I like them all. Oddly, probably the least interesting is &quot;Best of Thelonious&quot; on Blue Note. Those performances are from 1947-51 and feature the initial recordings of 16 of his originals in brief 78-RPM singles versions. Of the other CD's,  &quot;Monk's Dream&quot; and &quot;Brilliant Corners&quot; are essentials, and &quot;Monk/Rollins&quot; and &quot;Monk/Coltrane&quot; are delights."
1,"Who hasn't heard this album? I'm not for sure but this is one of my all time fave albums one that I own and my dad owns (his is the orginal record, mine's a remastered CD). This is THE album that has withstood the test of time and people just can't get enough of it even though Michael has changed...majorly.All the songs on this album are incredible, a work of art. It's sooo hard to choose which song is your favorite because they are all done so well. I guess if I'm forced I have to say &quot;Billie Jean&quot; but I really groove with &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot; oh and when &quot;Thriller&quot; came on at one of my friend's party the whole room went biserk. &quot;Beat It&quot; is rockin' as well along with &quot;PYT&quot; and I love the lush ballad &quot;Human Nature&quot;. This album is Micheal at the top of his mountain of fame (wish he could return to this but we can't have everything)and it couldn't have been more than a thriller. :)"
1,"WOW, WHAT TO SAY? THIS ALBUM WAS AND STILL IS ONE OF THE DEFINING POINTS OF THIS PERIOD OF ROCK. TESLA ROCKED THE ARENA'S OF THE WORLD AND THIS ALBUM WAS THEIR BREAK OUT. COMPLETELY FULL OF GREAT SONGS. NO NOT ONE BAD ONE TO BE FOUND HERE! IF YOU HAVENT HEARD THIS ONE YOU SERIOUSLY NEED TO. TESLA CONTINUED TO PUT OUT GOOD ALBUMS BUT THIS IS THEIR BABY !ALSO IF YOUR INTO THIS TYPE OF GOOD TALENTED ROCK N ROLL CHECK OUT THE TORA TORA CDS. ABSOLUTELY WAY UP THERE IN MY OPINION. THESE GUYS WERE BEHIND IN THE GAME BLOOMING LATE AND GOT LOST IN THE GRUNGE BUT LORD HAVE MERCY THIS IS SOME OF THE BEST ROCK IVE HEARD AND IVE HEARD IT ALL."
1,"Stoney End is painted on a grittier canvas than earlier albums, as Streisand reaches into the pop/folk bag for a more laidback, contemporary feel. Featuring songs from the pen of Joni Mitchell, Carole King, Gordon  Lightfoot and Randy Newman among others, Streisand instinctively interprets  their deeply felt lyrics, guided beautifully by Richard Perry's deft  production. All tracks are superb, but my favourite is the opener, Joni  Mitchell's &quot;I Don't Know Where I Stand&quot;, with Laura Nyro's  &quot;Time and Love&quot; a close second."
1,I remmber the day clearly when I first heard this record. I was in a  record store( Live music? in Berkely) and they had a listening section. The  cover really fancied me and I decided to give it a listen. I fell in love  with it from the first strings. I listened to the whole album and that day  &quot;Pink Moon&quot; was in my head everywhere I went. I finally bought it  and I still feel the same about this record. It has the imagaination of a  Lewis Carrol work mixed with a haunting depression that Dylan could only  reach a few times. In my life I have only met less than a handful of Nick  Drake fans and one day I was cleaning my room and from the T.V. in the  other room I heard &quot;Pink Moon&quot; and saw it on a car commerical.  Atleast that gives me a feeling some people know Nick Drake. This album  just does something to you inside. You'll just have to buy it and see.
1,"OCTAVE was a reunion album after the Blues finished their seventh sojourn and took time off for personal projects.  OCTAVE is also one of my least favorite Moody offerings.  Other than the elegant ballad DRIFTWOOD, there isn't any real OMG tunes.  The album's only hit STEPPIN IN A SLIDE ZONE is an average up-tempo track that doesn't break any new ground for the MB's.  A required inclusion for Moody fans but not recommended for neophyte listeners.  Go to SEVENTH SOJOURN for a better representation of the band's musical genius."
1,"This is one of the harder rocking Toto CD's and I love it. This cd came out in the fallof 1984.The addition of Mike Porcaro on bass and Fergie Fredricksen(formerly of Leroux) on lead vocals is wonderful. Jeff Porcaro's drums and Steve Lukather's guitar brilliance really stand out on this album. The sound and musicianship is tight on every song. Isolation,Carmen,Angel Don't Cry,How Does It Feel, and the hit single Stranger In Town are my favorites off this album.This one definately should have more hits off of it than it did."
1,"I've tried Five Leaves Left several times: at the office, in the car, on my home stereo, and with headphones; frankly, I don't understand what all the hubbub is about. The album rates near the top on everyone's Top-100 list, and I had hoped that I would be enthralled by the ""unnoticed master."" I have no argument with the fact that his work is melodic (The Thoughts of Mary Jane) and lush (Way of Blue, Day Is Done). I'm simply not enthusiastic concerning his voice and subject matter. Drake reminds me of Britain's answer to Bob Dylan - Donovan. His delivery is effeminate and breathy. Compared to the Zombies' Colin Blunstone, I believe Drake's voice falls short in energy, range and beauty. Lyrically, Five Leaves Left is lonely, disparate, melancholy, and generally depressing. I keep my copy handy for rainy afternoons. In small doses, I find Five Leaves Left beautifully disturbing. Perhaps a greater appreciation of Drake will  take more time."
1,"This came out in the midst of a lot of negativity in hip hop which has since overtaken the genre. KRS-One did a good job here in denouncing racism both inside and outside of the black community, dealing with issues of identity (the homeless and ya strugglin-note the subtle swipe at Michael Jackson in the latter) and an all-star jam with the BDP crew (D-nice, Miss Melody, Sister Harmony, etc). Some excerpts from Stokely Carmichael (yes, THAT Stoke-shortly before his death) are quite enlightening.Sadly, Kris Parker's hold on the youth did not last much longer as gangster (c)rap went on to destroy the music, but that's another story. Get this and see how rap COULD have been."
1,"The Rush, I want the night to stay, and I who have nothing with Martha Wash are the best songs on this CD to me.  This one is very good."
1,"or Best Of or something like that! This album is the result of Baker's first sessions for the independent Riverside label and it's just fabulous. The Chet Baker Quartet is featured includes Kenny Drew (piano), Sam Jones (bass), and Philly Joe Jones (drums)- ex. Miles Davis. Song selection is great and Chet's singing and playing is gorgeous! My favourite Chet album."
1,"This cd is as good as you've been hearing it is. Trust me. This is tha first two-disc cd in rap history. This is Tupac's first cd under tha DeathRow Label. It's pretty damn good. Some people say that tha second disc is crap compared to tha first one, those people havn't given tha second disc a chance. Tha second disc has awesome tracks such as: Run Tha Streets, Heaven Ain't Hard To Find, Rather Be Ya N*gga, Can't See Me, Wonda Why They Call U B*tch, and tha title track, All Eyez On Me. Tha first cd is crazyy too with hott tracks like I Ain't Mad At Cha, Only God Can Judge Me, Ambitionz As A Ridah, All About U, Picture Me Rollin', Life Goes On, No More Pain (sickkkk song), etc. Tha album is crazy, go get it! It also features guest appearances from Tha Outlawz (Group's only female Storm makes her first appearance), Snoop Doggy Dogg, Method Man, Redman, Big Syke, Richie Rich, Devante, etc.  Get this album, you won't be sorry."
1,"Enya is in a class all by herself.  She envokes feelings and images that take you out of reality.  So many others have copied her sound (ala James Horner in TITANIC) that it's easy to see how much of an influence she has been.  &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is a classic album.  From the emotional first track instrumental to the enchanting &quot;On My Way Home&quot;, Enya has created a pallete of wonderful pastimes and tragic metaphores here.  Yes, I would consider this pop/new age music.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  There are a number of people that don't like Enya.  There are jokes on South Park about her.  And that's good.  It shows how much of a musical force she is.  &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is a good collection of material from a very important artist, who I hope will never give up her love of music."
1,"This album is a great collection of all of James Brown's absolute mega-hits. Of course he has written so many great songs that this is simply  a skimming of the absolute best songs. I had no real James Brown albums  before I bought this one, but I had heard enough of his stuff to know I  wanted at least one CD and this is it, this is the best CD there is with  respect to his work, and may well be one of the best Soul CDs of all  time.I love it because the songs just want to make you jump out of your  seat and start boogieing. It really makes you want to dance. It also has  very emotional songs that are filled with energy.There are of course the  songs everyone has heard from &quot;Papa's Got A Brand New Bag&quot; which  is an absolute great song that makes my foot tap involuntarily every time  it comes on, to &quot;Get Up&quot; which has that weird over the top sexual  innuendo that James Brown is so good at, to &quot;Super Bad&quot; which  might very well be the best song on here, &quot;I Got You (I Feel  Good)&quot; which might be the most well known song. But there are also a  lot of songs that are awesome and not heard nearly as much like &quot;Get  On The Good Foot&quot; with those sexual plays again, &quot;It's A Man's  Man's Man's World&quot; which at times seems almost to be ironic, and  &quot;Think&quot; which is an emotional appeal.I highly recommend this  CD to everyone! This is the one James Brown CD you have to own. And if you  really like this though they have a lot more funk going on I recommend  Parliament's &quot;Best of Parliament&quot; as well for some more of this  funk-soul sound."
0,"Sure this CD has some good tracks, however the second CD is just plain wack, the only good song on the second CD is &quot;all eyes on me&quot; the rest is all filler, Me against the world was pac's only good album, the rest of his albums are wack."
1,"P-Funk meets Barry White ? Well, now we know where Rick James, Cameo and Prince tried to get their stuff from... and they went to the right source.  - - Its INCREDIBLE when you listen to these guys in one state and want to  dance (their original keyboardist defected and went over to P-Funk after  they left Westbound, one of the heaviest funk labels of the '70s), and in  another, need the lights turned down low, a member of the opposite sex,  those funny smelling candles, and if not someone to turn the hose on you.  - - Jazzy Soul is now in.  I wouldn't call the Ohio Players CONTEMPORARY  JAZZ, but they did lay down the formula those hot and sticky slow Jams, yet  with a FUNK sensibility.  FOPP, Sweet Sticky Thing, and Love Rollercoaster  (Remember the rumor about the bone chilling scream before the George  Bensonish guitar solo being from someone murdered across the street amidst  the recording session and it getting mixed in ?) are my faves  - - Of all  the Ohio Player albums, this and CONTRADICTIONS are my favorite... but I  have 'em all... Hmmmm... I wonder if Amazon has any Junie stuff  (Junie  Morrison) - - In the mood for that song &quot;Tight Rope Walker&quot;.."
1,"By far the most vocally gifted (if, unfortunately, not most successful) member of New Edition, Johnny Gill, whose voice can either be buttery smooth or deep and growly, keeps his new jack swing to a minimum here and opts for more of a red-hot loverman persona, and it really gives him the best chance he's ever had to make the most of his voice. He really gets sensual here with the beautiful ballads ""Maybe,"" ""Take Me (I'm Yours),"" and ""4 U Alone,"" though every song is a high quality, well-written and produced piece of work."
0,"This one could be a better cd, if the production was better.  Has some really good songs.  Music Man, Golden Country, Let Me Ride, Like You Do, and So the Story Goes.  Kevin's first cd as singer, something the group was in great need of, after their first outing.  Rest of the songs are okay, and the cd would get a better scoure, if the production was better, sounds distant and muffled."
1,"After releasing some lackluster albums in the early 80's (The Real Deal, Inside You and Grand Slam) the Isleys came back with this, their last #1 R&B; Album for 18 years. The best thing about this album is that everyone in the group is front and center. Rudolph's and O'Kelly's backing vocals are the best they've ever been. Too often in the previous albums they would be drowned out by the burning funk cooked up by the younger 3. This is a nice change as the Isleys once again sounded like a vocal group while still being a band. The first side is all love songs. ""Choosey Lover"" and ""I Need Your Body"" are the best of the bunch, the latter just being just short of perfection as Ronald provides stellar lead vocals, Chris goes into Barry White mode as he does a little ""rap"" at the end, Ernie's guitar and the backing vocals convey the urgency of the song and Marvin's bass keeps rumbling along as usual. But the second side is filled with killer funk and protest songs. ""Slow Down Children"" and ""Ballad For The Fallen Soldier"" burn with as much anger as ""Fight The Power"", ""The Pride"" and ""Livin' In The Life"". They cap things off with the rockin' instrumental ""Rock You Good"".This album was the most cohesive the Isleys put out in their 3+3 era. It seemed they had finally recaptured their sound and updated it for the 80's. Too bad this was to be their swan song as the younger 3 bolted to form Isely Jasper Isley. This album only makes you wonder what could have been."
1,"Elton's second masterpiece in as many years is a flawless slice of 70's pop rock and showcases everything there was to like about his music. Not a bad song on this record. Standouts include &quot;Daniel&quot;,  &quot;Elderberry Wine&quot; and &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot;. It's hard to  believe listening to this that his best was yet to come..."
1,"Critics may not hail this album as Outkast's quintessential masterpiece, but it's always been at the top of my list. Dre, Big Boi and the Organized Noize production crew epitomized the sounds of the dirty south rap scene. Laid back thick bass runs, lazy 70s soul hooks, mellow melodies, funked up guitar, thick stylish arrangements, and rhymes that will make your jaw drop. Most of the credit has to go to Dre and Big Boi. There were few emcees that truly invented flows like these cats in 1994 (and nobody sounded like them). They had a knack for lyrical perception unlike any emcee. They had a sense of playfulness on the mic that was truly addictive. Their prolonged flows were like butter. They had impeccable timing. And their unorthodox personalities were something that was rightly desired in hip-hop. Few lyricists have been able to create melodic vocal hooks as instantly memorable as Dre and Big Boi. Although I feel 1988 was the year for hip-hop, I must say that Outkast were true innovators in 1994. This isn't really an homage to old-school rap, it's a reinvention of the classic elements. They were out to revolutionize hip-hop, and that's exactly what they've done, and have kept doing to this day.I was first exposed to many of these tracks from their 2001 best of ""Big Boi and Dre Present"". Most of which, were my favorite tracks, such as ""Ain't No Thang"", ""Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik"", ""Player's Ball"", ""Git Up, Git Out"", and ""Crumblin' Erb"". But the album tracks are another reason why this one's a classic. ""Myintrotoletuknow"" starts it off beautifully with their pro-marijuana message. ""Call of da Wild"" is a smooth as any of the singles. ""Funky Ride"" marks a solid stance in their progression of hip-hop. The lush soulful production mixed with the sweet chilling lead guitar makes for one of the more unique listens on the album.Overall, Outkast shines here nicely. It may not be as critically acclaimed as ""Aquemini"" or ""Stankonia"", but it's certainly a favorite among true and old-school Outkast fans, including this reviewer's. A packed bowl may be necessary for maximum enjoyment."
1,"This collection is great for many reasons. First of all it's 18 tracks, and that's pretty sweet. It also covers more ground than their previous singles album did, including their most popular era. The hits here would be &quot;Kiss Them For Me&quot;, which was probably their biggest one, and also &quot;Peek-A-Boo&quot;, &quot;Cities In Dust&quot;, &quot;The Killing Jar&quot;, and &quot;Fear (of the unknown)&quot;. Plus there's the covers of &quot;The Passenger&quot; (Iggy Pop), and &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; (Beatles), as well as &quot;Face To Face&quot; from the Batman Returns soundtrack, and numerous other great tracks like &quot;Slowdive&quot;, &quot;Swimming Horses&quot;, and &quot;Dazzle&quot;. There's also of course the 10 track &quot;Once Upon A Time&quot; collection, which is the real early, more punk stuff, but this one is &quot;Twice&quot; as nice. They also have a career-spanning 15 track &quot;Best Of&quot;, which misses some songs from this, but includes &quot;Hong Kong Garden&quot; and &quot;Stargazer&quot;, among others."
1,"What a beautiful album!  When Allison Krauss sings with Union Station, her already wonderful sounds are magnified and transform to simply angelic.  We especially enjoy ""Tonight I'll Be Lonely Too"", ""Sleep On"", and my favorite ""When You Say Nothing At All.""  Highly recommended for old-time country sounds!Baby, Now That I've Found You"
1,"I don't think people were really ready for this cd.  One of the reasons this is my favorite Jamiroquai cd is the social commentary (Too Young To  Die, Emergency on Planet Earth).  However, if social commentary is scary  for you the music is slammin.  This was the first time I heard the  Didjeridoo played in modern music.  These cats know music.  A touch of  Maceo Parker &amp; co., Weather Report, and their own jam all fused  together.  Check out Music Of the Mind. The energy of the band is electric.  Listening to this cd, you can't help but move your body...or at least tap  your feet. Even if you like Jamiroquai because of more recent recordings-  elevate to this recording from the past."
1,This has the best of the singles Diana released in the 70's and early 80's.  My favorite tracks are &quot;I'm Coming Out&quot; and &quot;Upside Down&quot;.  They are timeless dance tracks that will always get you  moving.  I think they are the best thing Diana did after leaving the  Supremes.  &quot;Theme From Mahogany&quot; and &quot;Touch Me In The  Morning&quot; haven't stood the test of time as well but are always a joy  to hear and are my favorite ballads on the album.
1,"Ok, so this title will make you scratch your head and say, &quot;Fool, what's your problem?! Michael a bad boy? Ha! This is the man who calls himself Peter Pan!&quot; LOL But lemme explain, before 1987, people didn't know how edgy Michael Jackson could be. On his third album as an adult solo artist, Michael broke more barriers again. This time enlisting a mixture of funk, rock, soul, rhythm-and-blues, gospel, jazz, pop, dance, and hip-hop (circa 1987). He also began his now trademark growls through the song. What a lot of people don't know is that Otis Redding also sung in growls so Michael will tell you why he got to sing like that. You may call it screaming and yelling but dog-gone it, if Michael wanted to show his anger, let him. Funny thing is no one was seeing him as a &quot;thug&quot; or a &quot;lady killer&quot; probably until he did some of the videos for &quot;Bad&quot;. While the videos were great, the music was great too. The music was powerful stuff, man.&quot;Bad&quot;, the single, had SUCH A HUGE impact on today's hip-hop in terms of sampling that it doesn't make sense. Possibly one of the most celebrated songs in the history of music and of course of Michael's career. If Janet's &quot;No my first name ain't Baby, it's Janet, Ms. Jackson, if you're nasty&quot; was the singular catchphrase in &quot;Nasty&quot;, then &quot;Who's Bad?!&quot; was Mike's in &quot;Bad&quot;. &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; is classic pop and R&amp;B basically. &quot;Speed Demon&quot; is basically a militant funk song in the spirit of James Brown, not only that but to this day, you still don't know what the hell Michael was talking about at the time. Maybe it meant he had broken the law (?) Anyway, moving on. Next, we have &quot;Liberian Girl&quot;, which is an incredible song that encorporates a bit of Zulu tongue from a female African artist. &quot;Just Good Friends&quot; is just corny though. This is the only song WORTH skipping, even Stevie Wonder there doesn't help matters. If Mike would've put the songs he did with Roger Troutman and Run DMC, then he would've been able to get his point across with &quot;Bad&quot; IMO. &quot;Another Part of Me&quot; speeds things back up and like SD before it is militant funk with an urban edge. The horns in this baby are wild! &quot;Man In The Mirror&quot; is one of the greatest anthemic songs of inspiration of all time...and I'm not just saying that because Mike's my boy and all either. &quot;I Just Can't Stop Loving You&quot; is a POP CLASSIC! Nuff said about it! &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; sees Michael finding his inner Robert Plant as he sings with the pain and intensity of a heavy metal singer. Much pleasantly, this song is pure ROCK &amp; ROLL! &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; is by far one of the greatest pop, R&amp;B and dance joints of all time! &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; channels Stevie.All in all, this album has really made quite an impact nearly 20 years after it came out. Funny how the media overlooks that nowadays but ANYWAY...Let's see:5 #1 POP and R&amp;B hits2 #1 DANCE hits2 #1 Adult Contemporary hitsMike's first album to DEBUT at #1Had a huge tour with this that ran for almost 2 yearsBrought out one of the greatest performances in Grammy historyMusic was nice...It's a damn good album. Go cop it if you wanna know why Usher and Justin can only rely on his influence to do what they do. He's a king of something, right? Let the man rest in his throne, okay? Dog-gone it! LOL! YOU'RE DOING WRONG!!! Shhhhhhh! Let me stop. Just go get it...NOW!"
1,"i agree with the last reviewer and i'm also originally from buffalo.rick james is very talented and underrated.this debut has all his trademarks of funk&amp;soul.from you&amp;i,mary jane to dream maker.a must have debut."
1,"It has been thirty years since ""Blood on the Tracks"" was released and of all of the albums recorded by Bob Dylan it is the one that has most increased in stature simply because every album produced since then has failed to rise to this level. I think the reason for this is mainly because it was born in a creative burst of pointed lyricisim as his marriage to Sara Lowndes collapsed, with all the songs written in two months in the middle of 1974. I would no more expect any personal turmoil to provide similar inspiration any more than I would have expected any of the songs on this album to rise to the level of social rhetoric found in his greatest songs of the Sixties.In ""Blood on the Tracks"" Dylan also turned his back on his greatest backing band, returning to his artistic routes on an album that is largely acoustic-based. The songs run the emotional gamut from sorrow and regret to bitterness and pain. At the same time, despite the obvious point of origin for most of these songs, this is not an openly confessional album (cf. Courtney Love's ""America's Sweetheart""). After all, we are talking the lyrics of Bob Dylan, which means cryptic riddles and allegories abound all laid out in ten classic tracks:""Tangled Up in Blue"" is the best song on the album and the ambguity about the characters and relationships Dylan sings about has only increased over the years with the shifting lyrics in various performances. The cover version by the Indigo Girls remains my favorite Dylan cover.""Simple Twist of Fate"" is another great four-word phrase in a song that represents the most overtly personal song on the album. The stark instrumentation only serves to highlight the heartbreak of the existentialist lyrics and the mournful sound of the vocals.""You're A Big Girl Now"" is a ballad on the end of a relationship and a sort of benediction in that clearly the woman is right to move on, but Dylan is still haunted by their physical encounters. You would think that this would have been the logical final track for the album, but it is not.""Idiot Wind"" is song on the album that most reminds me of an earlier Dylan composition, namely ""Like a Rolling Stone,"" the pair being a set of put-down songs. The difference is that while both song lash out in lots of directions, this one keeps coming back to a certain ""babe."" This is another song that has changed over the year for various reasons that could well inspire a doctoral dissertation.""You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go"" is a rather upbeat track, despite the descending chord progressions, and is usually considered a song hopeful of reconciliation rather than one eulogizing the breakup.""Meet Me in the Morning"" stands out musically as the most blues oriented track that always struck me as cleansing the palatte for what was coming next on the album.""Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts"" is a 8:50 story song that basically wears down the listener's insistence that this is a biographical album. It also has a line that Dylan seems to sing with nic epitch and without affection, to wit, ""and Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair."" Pay attention next time through to that one phrase.""If You See Her, Say Hello"" probably represents the emotional low point of the album, with lyrics reflecting a singer who is crushed and embittered by the end of the relationship, turning his anger in on himself.""Shelter from the Storm"" is a song of simple beauty, based on three chords and a simple melody, underscoring a profound sense of loss. The song provides an avalanche of symbols and metaphors, but actually seems to end on an optimstic note.""Buckets of Rain"" provides a fitting finale, suitably depressing lyrics against a rather upbeat melody as irony once again abounds. After this song there is no where left to go.""Blood on the Tracks"" is listed by ""Rolling Stone"" magazine as the #16 record on the list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, between #15 ""Are You Experienced?"" by the Jimi Hendrix Experience and #17 ""Nevermind"" by Nirvana. It is one of ten Dylan albums on the list, behind #4 ""Highway 61 Revisited"" and #9 ""Blonde on Blonde."" This For pretty much the complete story on the making of this classic album, check out ""A Simple Twist of Fate: Bob Dylan and the Making of Blood on the Tracks"" by music journalist Andy Gill and guitarist Kevin Odegard, who played on the five tracks recorded in Minneapolis. You can also listen to ""The Bootleg Series, Vol. 1-3"" to hear the original version of ""Tangled Up in Blue,"" ""Idiot Wind,"" and ""If You See Her, Say Hello"" recorded in New York City in September to compare with the Twin Cities versions from December of 1974."
1,"Without a doubt, Off the Wall is probably THE best album by Jackson.  Michael is on top of his game on every cut and the average tracks are still tight.  Stand-out tracks are &quot;Don't Stop Till You Get Enough&quot;, &quot;Rock With You&quot;, &quot;Off the Wall&quot;, &quot;I Can't Help It, and more.  If you don't own this one buy it now!  I suggest you try to find it on vinyl because it came with one of his best album covers that doesn't come with the CD version.El-715"
1,"wow! i heard about big l for years but i nevergot any of his albums because since 1992 i was west coast obsessed.i out grew west coast mindless g-funk and lost my faith in all hip hop around 1997, 98. recently however i have gotten into hip hop again, and have come to the realisation that the absolute best hip hop is east coast early to mid 90s.nas, oc, smif n wessun, black moon, jeru the damaja, gza, wu tang, b.i.g. etc. now i can add big l to that list as this 1995 album, in 2002, has brought me back to hip hop. or atleast classic albums, im not interested in any of the new stuff.big ls lyrics are incredible. he is probably the greatest mc ive ever heard. his flow is incredible. nas and those other guys just seem dull in comparison. the beats are also top notch and sometimes pretty dark and forboding, in the middle of the album. basically this album is a classic.i dont feel sorry for what happened to him at all, but he made one great album."
1,"Please see producer Mark Linett's review under the deluxe ""fuzzy"" version of this new CD/DVD. The mono version of the album has been remastered from a superior source to that used in 2000, and a more complete version of ""Hang On To Your Ego"" has been used."
1,"GZA's debut solo album ""Liquid Swords"" is an undeniable classic. The album is of the first wave of Wu-Tang solos from 1994-1996 following the legendary group album ""Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers."" On that album, GZA was shown to maybe the group's best lyricist, a metaphorical master who lived up to his nickname of ""the genius."" This album boasts multiple classic tracks, and it's got such a great feeling. The dark, gritty production gives it a cinematic feel, which is heightened by the dramatic kung-fu movie samples throughout the album. RZA handles the productive and it is awesome, completely fitting of GZA's amazing lyrics. The production is very similar to ""36 Chambers,"" RZA showing his signature style on the mixing boards. This album is only 13 tracks, but the tracks are all complete and it's a perfect length, not at all overblown like some later Wu releases would be. Almost the entire Wu-Tang Clan makes a guest appearance at some point on the album, so it's a group effort in some respects, but GZA always shines. Lyrically he is a beast, and this album may be his shining triumph. He uses battle-type rhymes often, full of great punchlines and also uses a lot of metaphors. He stays very true to the original Wu-Tang style though, often referencing kung-fu and chess in his rhymes. ""Liquid Swords"" is in my opinion the best Wu-Tang solo and a classic album, necessary for any fan of 90s hip hop or Wu.The album begins with the title track, which has a great organ-laced beat and GZA displays his addictive flow and nasal voice, shooting lyrical bullets. ""Duel of the Iron Mic"" is hard-hitting and well-produced by RZA. ""Living in the World Today"" is musically simple and lyrically complex, GZA boasts of Wu-Tang's prominence and is full of punchlines. ""Gold"" is an almost mafioso look at his lifestyle. ""Cold World"" has an awesome, almost disturbing chorus and GZA takes the opportunity for great storytelling. ""Labels"" is very clever, he uses all the record label names he can think of to almost make fun of them, I like this song a lot. ""4th Chamber"" is one of my favorites on the disc, it has an awesome beat and great verses from the Genius and Ghostface Killah, this is a Wu-Tang classic like the other ""Chamber"" cuts of old. ""Shadowboxin'"" is another classic, a collaboration with Method Man where the duo slays MCs with their Shaolin styles. ""Killah Hills 10304"" is another simply awesome song preluded by a funny interlude. ""Investigative Reports"" is so cool to listen to, GZA tells a paranoid view of the world and crime life. ""Swordsman"" is a metaphor-heavy representative track of his character, and ""I Gotcha Back"" is another of my favorites, GZA telling an eerie philosophy (""I gotcha back, but you'd best a-watch your front / `cause it's them n....s in front, they be pullin' stunts""). The last song is my absolute favorite, ""Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth."" This track is completely unlike any other on the album, so it's good that it was last on the album. It's a very conscious and relevant song by Killah Priest that tackles racial and religious disunity, looking to the children of the world and trying to find peace. The beat has an awesome, relaxing sample and a great vocal sample. I love the hook, this song just ends the album perfectly.""Liquid Swords"" is a complete, well-rounded, and diverse masterpiece, unique and basically unlike any other album I have heard. Even among the Wu-Tang classics it shines as a legendary work, one that would never again be matched by GZA. This is one of those albums that I find something new I like about it every time, and I really don't find that in many albums that are released today. I strongly recommend the purchase of ""Liquid Swords"" to all passing hip hop fans, this is even one of those albums that could sell rap to a non fan. This is one of the essential albums that built the legend of the Wu-Tang Clan."
1,"I will not have time to categorize the Sneaker Pimps, but one thing I can tell you is that lead vocalist Kelly Dayton was a great vocalist and Splenter is a completely different CD. If you were expecting the same because you heard Splinter, you might be dissapointed. This includes Ambient, Trip-Hop, and Techno without sounding too much like Tricky. The result? Not nearly what I expected.&quot;Spin Spin Sugar&quot; I thought, was a club song. But when I listened to the CD version I found out I was fooled. But &quot;6 Underground&quot; is still excellent with electronic guitar. I still think the title track, &quot;Becoming X&quot; was a lot more clubby than the rest of the album. However the sound still coporates through the album. Im too lazy to make a description so either a- just buy it and if you have to look at a review to buy it you must not be interested, or b- agree that this review is a waste of time."
1,"I love the music of James Brown.  His music just makes me happy.  The slow soulful track It's a Man's Man's World is my favorite.  Night Train is my second favorite track.  This is a very upbeat track with excellent saxophone playing.  I love his signature tunes  like I Feel Good and Get Up.  I Got The Feelin and Papa's Got A New Bag are two good songs to dance to.  Give It Up Turn It Loose and Super Bad are two very groovy songs.  James Brown may be gone, but his music will live on forever."
1,"Many have heard of the passing of DJ Scott La Rock but somehow, his sidekick KRS-One manage to still hold it down and still bring out another classic album under the name of BDP. Following Criminal Minded with 10 tracks of highly concentrated molecules in the form of By All Means Necessary, KRS still kept his rhymes as fresh as they could get. From My Philosophy to Necessary, the record introduced KRS-One as the peaceful Teacher and foreshadowing his gift for contradiction. The album cover may be very familiar to the famous shoot of Malcolm-X with a gun in his hand but songs like Illegal Business, Jimmy and Stop the Violence dropped science on drugs, sex and violence. With such a powerful voice and untouchable lyrics, KRS-One made us all believe his boasts that BDP would be here forever.Best moments= My Philosophy, Ya Slippin' and Jimmy"
1,"Heavy Metal music doesn't get any heavier than this, or better. I have been a fan of this album ever since it's release back in 1984 and it is without a doubt my top favorite Judas Priest album of all time. Upon my first listen to it I was amazed and enthralled by it's high octane and infectious energy. I had never heard anything more powerful come through my speakers at the time, and even upon listening to it today, it is still just as powerful and exciting as it ever was. I am such a huge fan of this album that I even have the poster of the image of the Metallion from the album's front cover hanging on a wall at home. I've read some other reviewers complaints concerning the cheesy lyrics on some of the songs and all I can say about that is, well, that's all part of the fun of it all.Judas Priest's prior album to this one, Screaming for Vengeance, is a definite masterpiece recording, and Defenders of the Faith continues in that tradition and then some by delivering even more addictive power metal songs and anthems than seems humanly possible. Just sit back and pop this disk in your player and feel the music pummel you into a pulsating pulp with awesome tracks like Freewheel Burning, Jawbreaker, The Sentinel, Some Heads Are Gonna Roll, and Heavy Duty.By this time in their careers, the mighty team of Glen Tipton, K.K. Downing, Ian Hill, Dave Holland, and Rob Halford, were like a well-oiled precision Metallion music machine and were really at a creative high point during the mid Eighties, and it definitely shows on this album. But to be honest, Judas Priest have hit many high points throughout their career and continue to do some very excellent and amazing music to this very day. In fact, I consider their reunion album Angel of Retribution to be just as good as anything else that they have ever done, but, I digress and shall save that review for another day.Defenders of the Faith is a definite must-have album in any Hard Rock/Heavy Metal fan's collection and will go down in history as one of the best, if not THE best Heavy Metal album ever recorded, cheesy lyrics and all. ""We'll rise inside ya til' the power splits your head. We're gonna Rock you til' your metal hunger's fed. We're Heavy Duty!""Standout Tracks are: ALL OF THEM."
1,"Sadly,Roy Orbison did not live to experience the success of this,his last,album. A heart attack claimed this talented musician's life in December 1988. He did live to experience the success of THE TRAVELING WILBURYS,VOL. 1,released two months earlier. The conception of the cover is weird. The title appears upside down and so is a copy of a photo of Orbison at the lower right. This album spawned two hits. YOU GOT IT,which was later covered by Bonnie Raitt for the 1994 movie &quot;Boys On The Side&quot;, and SHE'S A MYSTERY TO ME. A LOVE SO BEAUTIFUL,written by Orbison and his fellow Traveling Wilbury Jeff Lynne,was covered by Michael Bolton which was a hit for Bolton in 1995. All the other songs are pretty cool. I dedicate this album to the memory of Orbison."
1,"To tell you the truth, I only recently rebought this CD because of the untimely death of Michael Jackson.. I have a large CD collection and I figured this CD should be a part of it.I had purchased it when it first came out...the follow up to the monster smash, ""Thriller"".  It got lost during one of my moves.I received it and I listened to it again and I was still impressed by ""The Way You Make Me Feel"", and ""Smooth Criminal.""  The title cut never did that much for me when I discovered that originally it was to include Prince. He later turned down the offer.  Prince apparently didn't think the tune was ""bad"" enough. (ahem).It still rates 4 stars, however."
1,"TUPAC'S ALBUM ALL EYEZ ON ME IS A VERY HOT CD, I GOT MY MONEY'S WORTH . THERE IS LIKE THREE SONGS I  DON'T FEEL, BUT OTHER THAN THAT THE ALBUM IS HOT."
1,"The relaxed, easy-going sound to album opener ""Mihalis"" sets the tone for the rest of David Gilmour's first solo album. Despite being away from Pink Floyd -- or perhaps because of his work with Pink Floyd -- there's  a familiarity to these nine songs that prove Gilmour's immense worth to  that band. From the grainy, almost boring cover shot of the album to the  overall mellow sound, Gilmour seemed to be looking to counter his main band's bloatedness. The lack of hype makes this album all the more attractive. There's no spiraling, out-of-control madness or references to World War II; it's just straightforward, cozy guitar instrumentals and good songs. On ""No Way"" -- the album's best song -- Gilmour's lyrics demonstrate his headstrong manner of never giving up, both within and outside of Pink Floyd. Other great riffers include ""Cry from the Streets"" and ""It's Deafinitely,"" a more up-tempo instrumental with lightly warped guitars at the beginning. ""I Can't Breathe Anymore"" reveals a trapped and claustrophobic musician, a guy who had to do his own thing for at least one album. There's no doubt this is a highly personal album, both  musically and lyrically. Gilmour's voice is as smooth as ever and his signature style on guitar carries the album much further than any of Roger Water's solo efforts have ever done for him. All in all, a solid effort from a legendary musician."
1,"First song, 20 minutes &quot;Crises&quot; is as good as &quot;Tubular bells&quot;.  The first 2 minutes are maybe a bit too new age but the rest is really uncredible especially the Watcher and the tower part.  The great Admam Ant is playing guitar on this song.Song &quot;In high places&quot; is sang by Jon Anderson (I just can't resist him).  I did not know it was Oldfield who did &quot;Shadow on the wall&quot;, a song that I liked a lot back in early 80's.  Well, it is on this album.  &quot;Taurus&quot; is a excellent  accoustic guitar piece.The 2 others songs are okay but I am not attracted to women's voice."
1,"After overlooked and underrated self-titled debut, the band released their second longplay, Get Your Wings, which is a big improvement to their style. Steven Tyler has developed his true voice at last, Joe Perry gave us his great solo guitar, and the sound of this album is more mellow and inspired than their previous effort. Aerosmith sounds here more like they would do in the future; though they still would have to wait a year before they got their deserved attention and fame.Same Old Song And Dance - Is a killer blues rocker, with incredible Joe Perry's riff. Biggest hit off the album, and goddamn great song! 10/10.Lord Of The Thighs - A dark and psyched rocker with a misterious aura around it. Solid, original song. 9/10.Spaced - Actually I don't like this song and I think it's one of Aerosmith worst songs. The song gets better in its last minutes, but it's basically pretty weird, with a lame riff. 5/10.Woman Of The World - Oh yeah, that is the song! Highlight of the album. Nice guitar work, and an awesome mysterios bluesy rocker. 9,5/10.S.O.S. (Too Bad) - Fast paced, intense number. A bit annoying for Me, but it's okay. 7/10.Train Kept A Rollin' - Stomping Rock N'Roll at its best. This is Yardbirds' cover, but done much more better than the original version. This used to be Aerosmith's concert favourite and a show closer for a long time. 10/10.Seasons Of Whither - One of their darkest, deepest ballads. Hugely underrated early Aerosmith gem. 10/10.Pandora's Box - Another awesome bluesy rocker with good riff from Joey Kramer. Good closing to the album, leaving You wanting more. 9/10.A great, overlooked album, that is one of their best. A must have for a Rock N'Roll fan!"
1,"After over 10 years of struggling to hit it big, Billy Joel suddenly became an overnight sensation with his 1977 release ""The Stranger,"" a timeless pop masterpiece that sold over seven million copies and generated four Top 40 hits as well as won Joel a few Grammys for his mantle. With his star suddenly burning, Joel was quick to come up with a followup to match the unprecedented success of his breakthrough album. The result was ""52nd Street,"" which managed to match its predecessor in terms of sales as well as quality.The album begins with its three big hit singles. First up is the crunchy in-your-face rocker ""Big Shot,"" a stinging damnation of fame and the arrogance that comes with its first taste. With its bombastic riff and biting Billy vocal, ""Big Shot"" is an absolutely Joel classic, and remains a thrill in concert.Next up is the Sinatra-esque ballad ""Honesty,"" in which Billy openly and sincerely expresses his most important value in a relationship. With its passionate vocal and thoughtful lyrics, ""Honesty"" will get under your skin with its haunting beauty.Next up is the album's biggest hit of the three, ""My Life,"" a chugging declaration of youthful independence with some of Joel's most intricate keyboard fills and a punchy in your face rhythm underscored by its obnoxious (in a good way) chorus. Another Joel classic that remains a concert highlight.With the hits out of the way, we dig into the lesser known album cuts, which begin with the zesty jazz opus ""Zanzibar."" A classic Joel portrayal of New York nightlife, many label this track is overindulgent and pretentious, but I'm of the opposite opinion. While it doesn't match the previous album's epic number (""Scenes From An Italian Restaurant""), ""Zanzibar"" carries a zest and flavor all its own that makes a landmark Joel track. The horn solo that closes out the track is incredible.Next comes my favorite non-album track. ""Stiletto"" starts of with a dark, ominous sax solo before a few finger snaps underscored by a thumping bass line lead into Joel's hellraising piano stacattos, rivaling ""Angry Young Man"" and ""Root Beer Rag"" as the prime example of Joel's unbeatable keyboard prowess.The mood changes once more with the mellow, Latin tanged ""Rosalinda's Eyes,"" a tender love song reminscent of Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer."" It's a great song and one I wish Billy would dust off in concert.Next comes another New York centered rocker, the thrilling ""Half A Mile Away."" With is opening horn roars and Billy's gritty vocals, this is one of the album's highlights and one of his best songs.""Until The Night"" is an epic ballad, and one of his all time bests. A big fave among die hard fans, it's a little lengthy, but Billy keeps it fresh and honest, and the result is an honest, passionate love song.The album's brief title track closes thigns off. It's nice, but easily the most disposable track on the album. Fortunately, with  the  advent of cd burners and stop buttons, you can easily end the album with ""Until The Night"" and let it go out on a high note.""52nd Street"" is another pop masteriece by one of the genre's most talented and influential individuals. Buy it immediately if not already owned."
1,"Pretty much one of THE seminal sixties psychedelic LPs, Cream's `Strange Brew' set a standard for the band and has remained their most popular and beloved sample from their brief but legendary catalog.  Classic hits include ""Sunshine of Your Love"" which earned Clapton even more worshippers if that was even possible and ""Tales of Brave Ulysses"" with its haunting lyrics and wah-wah guitar effects. ""Strange Brew"", ""SWLABR"" and ""Outside Woman Blues"" round out my personal favorites from this record but all of the cuts are worthy of mention and study by curious rock and blues aficionados.  `Disraeli Gears' set up Cream with the perfect answer to `Are You Experienced' as the band's (and Clapton's) only serious rival in the power trio game was the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Both records are must haves for the true rock fan and anyone interested in the origins of hard rock/heavy metal needs to have this record.  It's probably only fitting that talent such as Clapton, Bruce and Baker could only remain together for so long and about a year after the release of this classic album, the band would be no more."
1,"Michael Jackson is one of the most successful, famous and influential music artists in history. His music is among some of the best ever recorded and his debut album represents a large part of this. ""Off The Wall"" was Michael's debut album and was released in 1979. He was already a huge star as the lead singer of the Jacksons, but this debut album introduced the world to the adult Michael. He was willing to leave the band that made him famous behind and pursue a solo career. This is where it began.Off The Wall begins with the classic ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough."" Released in September 1979, the song was a massive US No.1 and peaked at No.3 in the UK. The beat is strong, and Michael's vocals are very high-pitched in their iconic style. The song has many instrumental styles, but the focus is on the incredible vocal arrangement. At just over six minutes long, the song is a classic in every sense of the word. ""Rock With You"" was released in February 1980 and was another US No.1. The beat on this song is great and Michael's vocals are very strong. The trumpet that signals after Michael sings ""I wanna rock with you"" is deeply classy and the eerie instrumental is pure disco fun. ""Workin' Day And Night"" is perhaps the most uptempo song on this album, and it works very well. The beat is rather muddled, even a little tribal. The verses are speedy, as is the chorus, and Michael has many of his famous noises going on, such as the ""Ow!""""Get On The Floor"" is my favourite unreleased song from this album. This song is pure pop disco fun. The beat is brash and loud, along with an echoing feel to it, which makes Michael's vocals stand out a lot more. Michael adds lots of chanting after three minutes which adds to the crazy feel to the song. The album's title track, ""Off The Wall"" is the worst song on the album, yet it's still a great song. Released in November 1979, the song has a very strange beginning before breaking out with a funky beat and clap. Michael's vocals are excellent and not only showcase his talent, but cement the fact that his vocal range can vary dramatically throughout a song. The verses showcase his deep manly vocals while the choruses show his high-pitched voice. ""Girlfriend"" is the brilliant song written by Paul McCartney. The song is very sweet and innocent. Michael takes time between his singing in the verses and one begins to wonder just where he's taking it. ""Girlfriend...I'm gonna tell your boyfriend...Tell him...Exactly what we're doin'...Tell him what you do to me...Late at night when the wind is free...Girlfriend...I'm gonna show your boyfriend...Show him...The letters I've been saving."" Get the picture?""She's Out Of My Life"" is one of the highlights on this album. While a short song at just over three and a half minutes, this deeply emotional ballad makes a big impact. Released in May 1980, the song peaked at No.3 in the UK. Michael's vocals are the strongest on the album on this particular song. Michael fills the lyrics with rich emotion. This is only enhanced when he sings the tear-jerking last word of the song; ""life."" ""I Can't Help It"" is a pure funky pop song with soulful tones that make it an ultimate album highlight. The song has some excellent beats and the chorus is particularly memorable. The song is perfect for chilling to or dancing to slowly. ""It's The Falling In Love"" is a great mid-tempo ballad with great vocals and a brilliant chorus that captures everything that this album is about; funky beats, innocent lyrics and strong vocals. The song also features guest vocals from Patti Austin. ""Burn This Disco Out"" is an excellent song to finish this classic album. The song begins with a stylish introduction on the trumpet, as Michael begins his singing. The vocals are strong, and the lyrics represent good times and are very trouble-free.OVERALL GRADE: 10/10This special re-marstered edition of Off The Wall contains some excellent bonus features. Included are interviews with producer Quincy Jones, and songwriter Rod Temperton. These are particularly insightful, and we also get the bonus original demo versions of Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough and Workin' Day And Night on which Michael's younger sister Janet plays instruments. These bonus features are excellent and add to the album's quality. In conclusion, Off The Wall may not be Michael Jackson's best album, but it is definitely the one which brings back the fondest memories. This album is literally off the wall."
1,"This was one of the first albums I'd every purchased. From here I went on to collect most of Donovan's songs, and then later do it again. This is a fitting title, for it is a gift, still. Donovan, despite losing favor among modern poet-songwriters, is under-appreciated, in my opinion. The 22 songs on this album are among the best composed and released by Donovan. At the time this was originally released, in 1967, I found the popular Kahlil Gibran to be exceedingly compatible with thoughts and sentiments expressed by Donovan in song. Those who enjoy one should also enjoy the other."
1,"This was her coming out album, hence the title. Don't let that overshadow the album though, you'd be doing it a great injustice. Besides all the hoopla that went on around this album regarding her coming out, there is some fine music to be discovered here (if you haven't already). The album rocks plain and simple, full of memorable anthems. Finally in her own skin, she seemed to have purpose and an identity, and that shows on this album. Of course the big hits are great, such as &quot;I'm The Only One&quot;, &quot;All American Girl&quot;, &quot;Come To My Window&quot;, &quot;If I Wanted To&quot;. However, quieter moments are also revealing and rewarding, such as the title track, &quot;Talking To My Angel&quot;, and &quot;I Will Never Be The Same&quot;. Overall a great album!"
1,"I have been listening to Simon and Garfunkel for 35 years.  Since I was a child, I have respected their melodies and the gentleness and humanity that flows through their songs.&quot;Homeward Bound&quot; and &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; are truly originals.I know I will have a life long love for these very special artists!"
1,"I always liked the Eagles, but I love Don Henley.  He has the smoothest of voices and his songs are fantastic.  This cd comprises some great hits that we all know and love.  The one song I'd like to see here (which obviously couldn't be on it because it was written and released after this was made) is Taking You Home.  That's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.  Other than that, there is Dirty Laundry, End Of The Innocence and New York Minute for us to enjoy.  I love this cd and I love Don Henly.  This is a must for any fan of his."
1,Foxy Brown has been affiliated with Jay-z and Nas most of her career. Her style is a reflection of what these two great mc's influenced. Ill Na Na is a well produced album with a nice flow. Foxy became a star with this project and maybe in the future she can take it back to this real hip hop displayed on her debut...
1,"I am a big fan of the first 4 albums and it's because of this album.  So many classics on this one from one of the most original sounding hip hop groups of the 90s.  Sen Dog and B Real are never duplicated.  While Black Sunday is my favorite Cypress album...Temples of Boom, 4 and this one are neck and neck with it."
1,"This album is sort of the ""missing link"" between the classic seven albums of the late 60s and early 70s, and the significantly lesser quality of the Moody Blues albums starting with ""Octave.""  The vinyl album did not include Hayward's ""Blue Guitar,"" which closes the cd, and is, in my opinion, the strongest track, with superb vocal and electric guitar work from Justin Hayward.The rest of the album is somewhat uneven with some of the hackneyed lyrics and forced, over-orchestrated, melodies that would come to define the band's later albums.  I do like the opening ""This Morning"" and ""I Dreamed Last Night.""  ""You"" and ""Remember Me My Friend"" work okay as more hit oriented songs, but I don't think either has the lasting power of their earlier songs.  Some of the soundtrack sounds downright warped, but not to the advantage of the songs, as was the mellotron in the able hands of Mike Pinder.Fans generally agree that Hayward is the best songwriter in the Moody Blues, and Lodge is probably second, which is why this album is an historic curiosity.  However, half of the songs really have little substance, and foretell some of the bad habits that the band would get into in later years."
1,"I don't smoke weed, but if I did this would be the perfect soundtrack to kick back and smoke a fat joint to, it is just so laid back.  Warren G's debut album includes the classic track Regulate, easily one of the best songs of all time, but that is by no means the only great track on the album.  Other notable tracks are Do You See, with it's whiny g-funk sound, This D.J, Whats Next, And Ya Don't Stop and Runnin Wit No Breaks.This album just captures all that was great about the g-funk era, as the title suggests, and deserves to go down in hip-hip history with the likes of The Chronic and Doggystyle.  So with all this praise, why not 5 stars?  It is short at only 10 tracks, plus 2 unnecessary skits, that is no problem but a few of the other tracks are only o.k, there certainly aren't any bad tracks here though.  Also would have liked to see some Snoop and Dre here, some of the featured rappers are a bit average.  A more accurate rating would be 4.5 stars, you should buy this album anyway for the classic tracks listed earlier, top stuff!!"
1,I LOVE NO DOUBT AND THE CRANBERRIES!GWEN RULES!I NEVER REALLY LIKED THIS KIND OF MUSIC UNTIL THEM!THEY ARE DOPE!!!!!!!5 STAR STUFF~! *****
1,"Whaaa!!! Yeah!!!Homework is all good. Homework is mostly Techno, but even those who hate Techno will like Homework because it is catchy and revolutionary as other reviewers have already reported. Homework actually made Techno mainstream for awhile and the beats will have you up and dancing around in no time.To be honest I flung their other album Discovery out the window. I was totally disappointed that they had gone for 70s retro music instead of sticking to what they do best - catchy techno tunes that evolve the industry, however people might like that other one but I certainly did not.Homework is probably one of the all time great Techno albums if not the greatest techno album of all time. It can easily sit beside Paul Oakenfold's Traceport as the best electronica/trance/techno/dance album out there but Oakenfold would probably be second best because he was just a DJ and these boys cooked up their own tracks.In fact Homework stands out in a world of its own. It is almost like a compilation of all the best techno tunes but is in fact all original tunes from a very original duo.This is a must for any collection. Even classical music listeners will throw this one on for the sheer originality of it all. Yes, Beethoven and Mozart would be proud!"
1,"Ok, I have bought this CD 3 times. The wear &amp; tear of being played in the car, at home, wherever I go demanded it.At first my husband thought I was switching gears so to speak. Until he went with me to one of her  concerts. He was swept away by the driving beats, the lyrical mesh of  genders &amp; he went crazy when she turned her guitar over &amp; did a  drum solo on the wood! He finally understood her talent without being jaded  by her sexualism.On &quot;Yes I Am&quot;, there is an equisite mix of  tracks. From the title song to &quot;Come To My Window&quot;, to my  absolute favorite; &quot;I Will Never Be The Same&quot;, and the thrusting  get yourself up and pumping, &quot;All American Girl&quot;.Too bad most  men cannot accept Melissa for who she is. If you are secure with yourself,  you do not have to be gay to say, &quot;Yes, I Am&quot;.Thanks--CDS"
1,"Carole King / Writer:  While there are some great songs on here, there are some forgettable ones as well.  After the cold reception her group album ""The City"" received, she returned with this solo album as a working experiment in style.  She had already proven herself to be a great songwriter and we knew she could sing as well (though some critics never agreed) and so her search was focused on finding her own `sound'.  This album gave her the key, and that key would produce a series of brilliant albums, but this remains what it always was, an experiment."
1,"I bought this album in February 2002, when I was kind of going through a rough time. My girlfriend and I were on the verge of breaking up, which was pretty difficult for me. And these songs all spoke to me. Tom Waits has a way of saying things so simple yet very profound, and his voice is very eloquent, although it's very throaty. His use of unusual instruments such as the marimba, and the jarring percussion, and the dissonant guitar tones reflected the paranoia and anguish I seemed to be going through at the time, and I can't think of an album I've listened to more than Rain Dogs.The title even speaks of loneliness. A ""rain dog,"" is supposedly an abandoned dog that has been left out side to fend for himself, or to die. At that time, I felt pretty inferior as I was being thrown out of another one's life, which I have since recovered from, and I learned to live with myself. Before then, I never really knew what the possibilities in music were, and this and other Waits albums, completely opened the floodgates to what was possible out there, and a lot of my writing is influenced by Waits, but I don't really mimic his style.I'm sure everyone who has bought this album looked at music at a newer perspective, because it certainly did for me, and my friends who have heard this album. It's full of emotion and idealism that you can't help but feel like this record at times. In my Top 10 of Favorite Albums of all time, and certainly my favorite by a solo artist (with Nick Drake's bleak Pink Moon coming in a close second, following any Peter Gabriel album)."
1,"Without exception, this is as good as anything ever released by anyone. I'd rank this one with Who's Next, Aerosmith's Toys, and Floyd's Dark Side. It's that good."
1,"Bad oversaw the prominence of Michael Jackson into the 1990s, with its innovative, and catchy beats that define much of the musical aspect of this album. Bad is also one of the more approachable album to a general audience with versatile vocal by MJ and rich electronic beats."
1,"This album brings back cool memories of the 70's & 80s. The guy who wrote the songs, I think his name is Rod Temperton, also wrote some of Michael Jackson's hits. It is a great blend of disco, funk & jazz. ""Always & Forever"" is a great favorite of mine. Brings back memories of the 80's when I was working in a hospital kitchen & they had a radio & songs like this would come on & one of the cooks used to sing along as he worked. I miss those days when people were happy! I've always liked the front cover since I saw it in the 70's. It shows the LP melting with the Epic label design they used in the mid 70's. Like the liner notes say, it melts on your turntable (or in your CD player) & not in your hands."
1,"&quot;Unpredictable&quot; is maybe the best thing No Limit has ever released. Mystikal shows why he is the most talented soldier on this well crafted sophmore album (his first was released on Jive/Big Boy). There are  MANY standout trax, one of which is the title track, on which Mystikal  spits that rapid fire stutter-stop flow he's mastered. &quot;Here We  Go&quot; is a nice collabo wit B-Legit &amp; E-40, while  &quot;Gangstas&quot; features Snoop on one of his first No Limit  appearances. &quot;Still Smokin&quot; is his ode to those sticky-green  leaves, while &quot;Dick On The Track&quot; features some clever word play.  But the two STAND-OUT trax on here have to be &quot;The Man Right  Chea&quot; and &quot;Shine.&quot; &quot;The Man Right Chea&quot; features  an UNBELIEVABLE beat combined wit Mystikal's signature flow, while  &quot;Shine&quot; is a touching tribute to his sister, who was murdered  while he was working on his first album. &quot;Born 2 Be a Soldier&quot; is  yet another in what was the long running &quot;Soldier&quot; series of No  Limit trax. Not much to this one, basically fast-forward material. But all  in all, the high points on this album FAR outweigh the lows. In my opinion,  this album is DEFINITELY a worthy buy."
1,"Coming hot on the heels of their certified metal classic, ""Screaming For Vengeance,"" it would be easy to slag odd ""Defenders Of The Faith"" as sub-par. That would be a fool's errand, because while ""Defenders"" doesn't have the song for song knockout blows of ""Screaming,"" it still delivers a mighty powerful blow. The twin guitars of Glenn Tipton and KK Downing rip from the opening ""Freewheel Burning,"" while adding sting to a couple of new Priest Classics, ""Love Bites"" and ""Heads Are Gonna Roll.""This was the period in which Judas Priest were at their most aggressive, sometimes outlandishly so. The ode to rough sex, ""Eat Me Alive,"" got the band in hot water with Tipper Gore and her Parents Musical Research Center (remember the PMRC and their obsession with dirty music overall and Prince in particular?) for its particularly graphic narrative. ""I'm going to force you at gunpoint to eat me alive"" can still rankle those of a sensitive nature, but this came from a band who titled one of their UK albums ""Killing Machine."" Between the snarling guitars, the double kick drums and Rob Halford's leather skybound howl, subtlety was not their watchword.""Defenders Of The Faith"" also marked the end of a creative run for Priest. After this, they got the jitters from the emerging new wave of metal and - oddly enough - hair bands, too. It lead to the underrated synth heavy ""Turbo,"" an album that took the band several more albums afterwards to recover from. But when you look at the line-up of ""Hell Bent For Leather,"" ""British Steel,"" ""Screaming For Vengeance"" and then ""Defenders of The Faith,"" it's a creative metal run matched only by the first four Black Sabbath albums."
1,"For the Na NaNa Na Na Na Na  poster:  SWLABR = She Walks Like a Bearded Rainbow.  The title was probably chosen by long-time Jack Bruce collaborator Peter ""Rope Ladder to the Moon"" Brown,  who wrote much of the lyric for Cream.  Exotic chemical substances were all the rage back in 1968 and it definitely shows here. It's all good, including Mother's Lament and Blue Condition.  This is a great CD, buy it.  'Nuff said."
1,"When a band loses their original producer and one of their founding songwriting members, it usually is a half-hearted sellout.  For one album, the Moodies looked set to dominate the 80s, with their very convincingly updated sound.  This album is EXCELLENT!  Half of the best of the synth-dominated era had to offer is on this album (the other half is on 'Time' by ELO).  The songs are well-written and arranged, the keyboard textures while heavy are tastefully chosen and are never overdone or trite.  Sounding a bit like an Alan Parsons production, the songs come off as energetic, honest, and (of course) sonically thick fog.  The fadeout of 'In My World' contains beautiful soaring guitar solos, the prog-rock solos in 'Gemini Dream' don't fall into the usual trap of overplaying, the Ray Thomas monologues at the end are somewhat strange but have their place in the album.  Talking Out Of Turn is as good a song as John Lodge ever wrote, with mesmerising, shimmering production.  The Voice has a great melody, great bassline, great lyrics.  This is the sound of a GROUP enthusiastically playing, their subsequent albums sounded more slick and less human.  To me, the people who down this album because it contains synthesisers are like the professors at the college I went to who thought all rock music was 'in bad taste' because it didn't sound like Mozart or Stravinsky (both of whom I think wrote amazing music, for the record)."
1,"this was a first for me, liking a band with a ska sound, but I do not regret it. I still rock  the album today. Have fun hearing Gwens thoughts on being young, a woman, in a relationship and a breakup."
1,"AEROSMITH-AEROSMITH: AEROSMITH freaks who know the band only through their streamlined late 80s renaissance might be taken aback by this wonderfully rough-hewn, auspicious debut disc, best known for spawning the passion-soaked, definitive early power ballad DREAM ON. But hold onto yer hats friends and neighbors, 'cuz the rest of this gritty platter, to quote another legendary Boston band, ain't nothin' but a house party. Hard rockin' pot-shot MAMA KIN, loose-as-a-goose seven minute jam ONE WAY STREET, and a swaggering cover of RUFUS THOMAS' crusty STAX classic WALKIN' THE DOG showcase a primitive soundscape that's sleazy, greasy, and never too easy. STEVEN TYLER's cocky, strangled caterwauling and smutty harp work is matched note for note by the interlocking rock bottom axe work of JOE PERRY and BRAD WHITFORD; the 'SMITH wouldn't grind out a groove this slinky till 30 years later on their (admittedly slicker) RNB covers disc HONKIN' ON BOBO. This is the blooziest, ballsiest, and bitchin'-est that Boston's bad boys ever sounded...so low down 'n dirty, you'll probably wanna shower afterwards.RATING: FOUR WAILS"
1,"This has to be one of the best cypress hill albums.First of all it is very rare type of music if you see what i mean,there are'nt that many gangsta rap groups out ther that have music like cypress hill.Cypress hill are really different,including there lyrics.This has to be an all time hip hop classic record there probably is'nt one the same.The first song on there is i wanna get high,which has a really good tune and something to sit back to.Then there is we aint going out like that which is allwright.But the best song is insane in the brain which is an all time classic,then there is clock the hammer which is just dope and crazy song u will like it.Hits from the bong is another good song,and 3 lil putos.I can name you more but those are the good ones."
1,"I am spending time filling in the gaps that I missed out on during the 60s and 70s. I grew up with the better known 'John Barleycorn..' and 'Low Spark..', but recently (thanks to the classic 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide)acquired 'Mr Fantasy' and their 2nd album 'Traffic'. Both knock the spots off the later Traffic, and while the critics gave 'Mr Fantasy' only 4 stars I rate it one of the best albums ever. Two songs on this album, namely 'No name, no face, not number' and 'Mr Fantasy' must be amongst the best rock songs ever, ever written (to say nothing of Steve Winwood's ethereal singing!). Regarding the issue about the US versus UK versions, I was fortunate to but a recently re-mastered CD that has both on it! Get that one, then sit back like a happy cat and lick the cream..."
1,"When looking at Olivia Newton-John's career, one must look at it from the perspective of her as a vocalist.  You aren't going to find a lot of songs where Olivia is going to be the songwriter - and you aren't going to find her playing a lot of instruments.  Olivia does what she does best - provide some outstanding vocals.  Therefore, Olivia is going to have a strong reliance on good songwriting and good supporting musicians.  What a lot of people probably don't remember is that when Olivia started out as a vocalist in the 1970s, she came up through the Country and Folk Music ranks.  Olivia's crossover into a mainstream/pop artist would coincide with her film debut in the movie-version of ""Grease"".  That film would establish her as a Superstar.  However as fast as Olivia's Star rose, she would fall into oblivion by the end of the 1980s.  However, Olivia's successful career has resulted in some nice collections of her vocal work.  One such collection is ""Olivia Newton-John: Back to Basics - The Essential Collection 1971-1992"".  It serves as a reverse chronology of Olivia's work starting with 1992 and going back to her early days as a Country artist.There are two things that set ""Back to Basics"" apart from many of the other Olivia Newton-John compilations that are available today.  For starters, it contains four new recordings that are unavailable on any of the other greatest hits sets.  The other thing is that this compilation goes in reverse chronological order.  Normally I prefer my Greatest Hits collections to have the tracks arranged in chronological order. This allows me to see how the artist has progressed and evolved over time. ""Back to Basics"" does the reverse.  While I still would have liked to have seen this in regular chronological order, I found the reverse order to be an interesting twist.  It fits very nicely with the title ""Back to Basics"".""Back to Basics"" isn't the most complete collection out there.  While it does contain some nice songs, there are some very good Olivia songs that are missing.  The songs I would have liked to have seen included are: ""Don't Stop Believin"",  ""Let it Shine"", ""He Ain't Heavy He's My Brother"", ""Come on Over"",  ""Take Me Home Country Roads"", ""Me and Bobby McGee"", ""Don't Cry for me Argentina"", ""Heart Attack"", and ""Make a Move on Me""As mentioned, there are several other Compilations out there.  The following lists some of the more popular compilations.  Here are some important notes when looking at these compilations:""Greatest Hits"": This collection contains 12 songs covering all of the albums before ""Grease"".  The songs on ""Back to Basics"" that precede the ""Grease"" songs are all included on this collection""""Greatest Hits 2"": This collection contains 10 songs from ""Grease"" to ""Physical"".  While ""Back to Basics"" contains 7 songs from this period, ""Greatest Hits 2"" doesn't contain ""Deeper Than the Night"" or the duets with John Travolta - ""You're the One that I Want"" and ""Summer Nights"".""Magic - The Best of Olivia Newton-John"":  This is a 21-song set that covers Olivia's career through 1983's ""Twist of Fate"" (the point where Olivia's career went into decline).  All of the songs on ""Back to Basics"" (with the exception of the four new tracks) are contained on this collection.  In addition, this collection contains the ""Grease Mega Mix"" that gained popularity a few years ago.""The Best of Olivia Newton-John"": This is a 18-song collection that goes deeper with Olivia's early work (i.e. early to mid 1970s songs).As mentioned while this is not the most complete collection, it does contain four new songs by Olivia.  I wouldn't do ""handstands"" for these new Olivia songs, but they aren't bad.  Olivia gets some help from some industry ""names"" for these songs:""Deeper than a River"": This song was written and produced by Diane Warren.  You can hear the maturity in Olivia's voice on this light pop-ballad song.""Not Gonna Be the One"":  This is another light pop-ballad song.  It almost has a 1990s Bee Gees feel to it.""I Want to Be Wanted"":  This song is kind of a throwback song to Olivia's Country Music days.  This song features a Pedal Steel Guitar giving a real nice country feel to the song.  Robbie Buchanan, a well-known studio musician keyboardist is on this track as well.""I Need Love"": While not a total ""Dance Song"", this song has a definite R&B;/Dance feel to it.  To some extent - there even is a bit of Funk to it.  Much of this is due to the fact that Giorgio Moroder is the producer of this song.  Surprisingly, I found this to be the strongest of the four tracks.  Olivia pulls this off well.I was glad this song contained ""Twist of Fate"".  While this song did mark the beginning of Olivia's decline, it is a Synth-Pop song and showed how Olivia came full-circle from her Country/Folk days of the early 1970s.The liner notes are in the fold out fashion.  One side opens up with a big picture of a 40something year old Olivia.  The other side contains pictures of the albums from which each of the songs came from.  Each of the song contains some brief credits.  The four new songs contain the songwriting and production credits.  While I did like the reverse chronology that is done on this collection, I felt ""Back to Basics"" was incomplete compared to what I could get on the ""Magic"" collection - in spite of the fact that this collection contains four new songs.  Overall, if you are looking to get started with an Olivia Newton-John compilation, I'd recommend going with the ""Magic"" collection.  I'd look at the other three collections if you are looking to go deeper with some of Olivia's greatest hits.  I'd only look at this collection if you want to check out the new songs - or if you can get it a value price."
1,One of my favorite college albums!What a blend!
1,"love this whole cd, glen goins singing swing down did it for me, that was a event the mothership, how come no one discussed the mothership being one of the most popular events in rock n roll, no one else ever did what parliament-funkadelic did before, and after the mothership, the mothership then parliament singing and dancing, summoning dr. funkenstein should be legendary but it was,nt hell george lucas created star wars after hearing about this concert. i love dr. funkenstein it is about 12 minutes, good solo's by maceo, fred, michael hampton, and bernie worrell does his wizardry at the end. a good place to hear p-funk live the horny horns were givenm more duties here then on the studio recordins."
1,"The Electric Light Orchestra continue to make world-class symphonic pop-rock with their 1976 release, ""A New World Record."" Jeff Lynne & company deliver another great disc that's rich in melodies & musicianship, with excellent orchestral flourishes throughout. Several ELO classics come from this record, such as ""Telephone Line,"" ""Rockaria,"" ""Livin' Thing,"" and ""Do Ya,"" as well as the very inventive ""Mission (A World Record),"" and the beautiful album-closer, ""Shangri-La."" ELO were totally at their creative peak during the mid-to-late 70's, and ""A New World Record"" is another fine standout for this classic rock group."
1,"When a friend of mine asked me to make a &quot;Best of Leonard Cohen&quot; CD for her, I had to fight the urge to simply copy this album for her and tack a few later gems like &quot;Everybody Knows&quot;, &quot;Chelsea Hotel #2&quot;, and &quot;Waiting for the Miracle&quot; onto the end.  As an English scholar, I firmly believe that this man is the most evocative lyricist modern music has yet produced.  This album is not marred by the lackluster filler songs (think of &quot;Jazz Police&quot;) that his later albums contain.  For whatever reason, he has hit the mark with every song here, and when Leonard Cohen hits the mark it reminds me of why I believe humans create art in the first place.  My memories of this album are chiefly associated with hearing it while driving through Indiana in the middle of the night, with flatness all around me, smoking a whole pack of cigarettes in two hours and being unable to find a motel with any vacancy.  This album made me think, &quot;Someone else out there knows what I'm feeling and expressing it even better than I could.&quot;  And I felt more alive and human knowing that there was someone who I could make that emotional connection with.  And that is why I think humans create art.Cohen's most sincere poetry is here, in songs like &quot;Suzanne&quot;, &quot;So Long, Marianne&quot;, and &quot;Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye&quot;.  Somehow, while giving these women names and very specific personalities, Cohen paradoxically makes you feel that he is singing about the woman who just left you, or whom you just left.  This is not an album to listen to lightly or at parties, unless they're two-person wine-and-weep parties with your closest friend in the world.  It demands your attention in the same way that a whisper in a loud room can make everyone shut up and listen to who's whispering.I suppose this record is not for everyone, though I've never met anyone in that group.  Cynics, fans of simplistic pop lyrics, and those who dissect songs as if they were algorithms may want to look elsewhere.  But for anyone who's ever just felt alone, or who has realized too late that all love ends, or anyone young who thinks that no one understands their desire to run off into a field at midnight and just scream because there's so much pain in the world, this is a record to own.  Trust me, Leonard feels the same way.  And that, somehow, makes it just a little bit easier to take."
1,"Stevie Wonder's meditations on inner city life and the African-American push towards middle-class stability in the wake of the '60s civil rights movement made for some pretty great music... This disc had its share of radio hits and anthemic ballads, such as &quot;Living For The City,&quot; &quot;Golden Lady,&quot; and &quot;Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing,&quot; but it also has some curious sleeper tunes as well, such as &quot;Misstra Know It All,&quot; which is one of my favorite Stevie Wonder songs.  Oh, yeah, &quot;Higher Ground&quot; is also an amazing funk classic... As is this whole album!"
1,"This is probably 2pac's most popular cd. Every girl I ever dated had this record, I mean its unbelievable. A little story, when this came out my boy drove me up to the store on a snowy day to get this, and on the way home his car almost slid off the bridge. But when I got home and put this in and heard the words I wont deny it im a straight rida you don't wanna f*** wit me got the police bustin at me, but they cant do nothin to a G and then the beat came on and I forgot all about the accident. This is the best double cd in rap ever. Probably his best cd, I mean look at the hits. How Do You Want It, I Aint Mad At Cha(his best video), 2 Of Amerika's Most with Snoop rappin his a** off, Of course California Love (probably his 2nd most played radio song today), All About U. Then U got the underground classics, Ambitionz Az A Ridda, Thug Passion, No More Pain, Picture Me Rollin, and Heartz of Men. What people have to remember when they rate this is that Pac and Dre put this album together in like a week. This album is more about Tupac having fun and its more thuggish then any of his others. It's somethin for everybody on this album, from Wonda Why They Call U b**** to Life Goes On to Run Tha Streetz to We Aint Hard To Find. And one of my personal favorites Heaven Aint Hard To Find. There's also some more of Pac predicting his death on Aint Hard To Find he spits, ""I heard a rumor I died murdered in cold blood dramatized, pictures of me in my final stage you know imma cry, but that was fiction some cowards got the story twisted, like I no longer existed mysteriously missing"". If you dont have this cd get it, This and Me Against The World are the best rap cds ever."
0,"Come On Over by Shania Twain sold millions and millions of albums but I despise this cd with a passion. Shania is one of the worst singer-songwriters I have ever heard, especially in the genre of country/pop. Her voice is completely unoriginal, there's no fire, range, or accessiblility. I can't believe how truly awful her songwriting is! Terrible cliches, junior high filled lyrics and child-like melodies. Songs like That Don't Impress Me Much, Man I Feel Like a Woman!, Don't Be Stupid, and You're Still the One just gives me the willies. The only two tracks that have any emotion in them are From This Moment On and You've Got a Way. Come on Over is a horrible and silliest record of the '90s. Stay clear from this over-rated mess!"
0,"Oh, no... What a terrible album from Jackson! He put 11 fillers beside Black or White, Give In 2 Me and Heal the World, the only 3 real songs on this album. Remember the Time was a bit worse but listenable, but all the other songs R on this album R even worse than the opening track, Jam.... Get a Jackson Best Of instead, containing those three hits, that R really good. Give in 2 Me is the song that just doesn't fit into this album's weakness, it should be appeared on a better one in the future."
1,"For a lot of reasons this album is pretty much what made James Brown not just an icon of his day.. but for many days to come... and these reasons have to do with politics, as well as music so I'll stay away from them,.. however James Brown is certainly a name that willl never be forgotten at Harlems Apollo Theater.This album was recorded live in 1962, when James Brown was still exclusively The Soul Brother no.1. He hadn't started developing his funk yet, however had already been tearing up the charts for sometime (mid fifties?) and was rapidly building a reputation as an amazing live performer. In order to prove that it wasn't just hype, Brown recorded this show at The Apollo (an excellent way to nationalize their name in the process, I'd have to say) and released it about a year later.It's true that James Brown had a solid run of hit singles on the radio for over ten years.. but to hear that stuff in comparison to his live recordings always pales. No matter what era of James Brown you listen to.. the hit singles just ain't half as exciting as a complete live show.. and this proves it. I'LL GO CRAZY is amazing, one of the all time best performances of a song, ever.. and from here we go into a non stop frenzy, which, if you are seasoned to James Brown, may sound a little out dated, but no doubt as wild as his squeeeezieest funk juices. In typical James Brown fashion the songs just keep coming,..no breaks, constant motion. The crowd gets involved too, screaming and clawin'.... songs meld into other songs, then back into the original songs, and then into medleys, that meld with other medleys.. and then finally it all finishes back at the start with I'll GO CRAZY, as if you never left it to begin with. The way James Brown put on a show in 1962 would eventually become the influence for not only any good soul show, but rock, jazz, funk, dance, etc....  they all wanted his chops... and that is mainly because of what is contained on this record....  Enter the Hardest working man in showbiz...."
1,"If you were searching desperately for any good music during the 90's like me, you found Becoming X a refreshing bit of creativity. It has a very melodic sound without being too cheesy. Just cool enough to be alternative. Fortunately, Chris Corner had sense enough to see a much more serious future for the band."
0,just some more white boys who can't rap any plenty of white fansto buy there albums
1,I wish I were alive when Elton John first became popular just to hear his music for the first time.  This is a great cd.  Does it really need much discussion?
1,"Cypress Hill came with a good laid back album upon the release of Black Sunday. Although their subject matter is limited (marijuana), their lyrics are often funny and some of the beats are pretty tight. The track &quot;Insane In The Brain&quot; is an all time classic and along with a few other good tracks, is worth the price of the album. Although B-Real's voice can get annoying after repeated listens, you should do fine if you limit your listening of this album (that shouldn't be hard, it's not THAT great). Overall this album is a nice change from the typical hip hop that was being released at the time and I can't really think of any other rap act that sounds quite like these guys."
1,"Michael Jackson had the insurmountable task of following up what was not only the biggest selling album of time, but a real cultural phenomenon.  Thriller was released in late 1982 and due to its success it took Mr. Jackson five years to release its follow-up.  While Bad obviously was not half as big as Thriller in terms of sales, it is still a great record.  The title track finds Mr. Jackson taking a defiant stance and instead of running away from trouble as he did in &quot;Beat It&quot;, he stakes it head-on.  &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; is a bright and sunny song that has an incredibly infectious groove.  &quot;Just Good Friends&quot; is a real treat as he duets with Stevie Wonder and you get to hear two masters at work.  &quot;Man In the Mirror&quot; is a spiritual song that begs one to look at themselves and see that we can all make a difference.  &quot;I Just Can't Stop Loving You&quot; is a good ballad that is a duet with Siediah Garrett, the songs writer.  It was original written to be sung with Whitney Houston, but when she was unavailable, Ms. Garrett stepped in and does a nice good.  &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; is a blazing rocker and &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; is angry tirade against the circus atmosphere that his life had become due to the media.  &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; is a pumping track that has vicious beat and tremendous vocal.  Bad does hold one record over Thriller, it became the first album to produce five number one singles (&quot;I Just Can't Stop Loving You&quot;, &quot;Bad&quot;, &quot;Dirty Diana&quot;, &quot;Man In the Mirror&quot; &amp; &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;)."
1,"This was the first Elton John album I owned (on vinyl), and there was no doubt about upgrading to CD/digital.  A very solid offering from what I consider his peak period.  From Madman, to Honky Chateau, into Don't Shoot Me, culminating with Goodbye Yellow Brick.  All excellent, all worth having.  Looking back over 35+ years, I'd rate this as the least excellent of that quartet, but all are worthy.  But Madman (which peaked at only #8) laid the groundwork for the subsequent string of #1 albums.Levon was the hit, peaking at #24, and Tiny Dancer just missed the Top 40 (peaked at #41).  Both were mainstays of AOR radio, as was the title track.  All are classic songs.The rest of the album is not quite as as memorable. Holiday Inn & Rotten Peaches are certainly solid.  But Indian Sunset always seemed a little overblown, and I never quite got the whole think about an Englishman singing (fisrt person) about the plight of the Native Americans...  All The Nasties and Goodbbye are pretty much forgettable.  Not bad, but certainly not essential."
1,one of their best albums. is great and rocks brilliantly with out stop or even slowing down once or twice.
1,This a great album if you're a hard rock fan. I had to buy this just so I could here Back On The Road Again and Only The Strong Survive which are 2 of REO's best songs ever. Gary Richrath really plays a smokin' guitar on  this album.
1,"This album originally came out in 1984, and was the FIRST Kansas compilation album. Pretty hot, it contained the best from the glory days of Kansas - Carry On My Wayward Son, Point Of Know Return, Dust In The Wind, and so forth. It's a great album, one that is sure to please any Kansas fan!Now, don't confuse this album with the 1999 updated and remastered Best Of Kansas. The price is about the same, but Perfect Lover was dropped off, and replaced with three later tracks. It's a tough call, so choose wisely, my son!"
1,"This music will take you back and, wont let you go!  Fantastic!  &#34;Please, please, please&#34;, was an icon of thought's and, words!"
1,"man, this is cd is FIRE, man fo reel. this is his best work in my opinion. u can pop this in and play it thru, E-Fo Day drops heat on this one. id give it 10 stars if i could. go buy this NOW, goddammit. the best songs are: ALL OF 'EM"
1,"Marvin Gaye broke out of the mold of Motown crooner on this album and came into his own. This is one of the best albums ever, and an incredibly woven concept album also. Marvin Gaye was able to articulate the turmoil in America at the time so well, and his singing as well as the music are AMAZING. This album contains one of my favorite songs of all time too, ""Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)"". He was even able to tie in the melody  from ""What's Goin' On"" at the end of the song, which is one of the many touches that give this album its cohesiveness. I would recommend ""What's Goin' On"" to any music fan. It is a timeless classic and should be considered an essential for any collection."
1,"Toni,was NOT,ashamed,to show,that,it is not a crime,for a woman to show hurt,for being betrayed,by a lover...Most women today,think that it's the mark of a ""weak""woman,to,admit to being hurt,by this heartless,act!!Everyone knows'that women,are creatures'of sheer emotion...Yet,the prevailent thought,among,""tough""women,is that NO man,could cause them emotional distress,under ANY circumstances!!With songs'such as ""7 Whole Days""and ""Love Shoulda Brought You Home""Toni basically says'""Hogwash""to that(silly)train of thought!!

1,"This is definitely one of the best pop albums every done; and Regina Belle is one of the best singers of the current generation (although you wouldn't know this given the attention given to half-talented artists of the day).  Belle creates many different moods in this album.  While the commercially  successful tunes &quot;Make It Like It Was&quot; and &quot;Baby Come to  Me&quot; are great, my favorite is &quot;Someday We Will All Be Free&quot;;  this song is quite moving -- she has a gospel/jazz sound.  Check out this  rare talent of the 90s."
0,"I seem to be in the minority here, but this album did very little for me.  There are a few good songs, but overall I think it is weaker than both ""Constrictor"" and ""Raise Your Fist And Yell""."
1,"It would be fitting to descirbe individual track from&quot;Central Heating&quot; but I can't-it simply must be heard frombeginning to end.Beyond strong musicianship,top-flight songwriting,clever lyrical wordplay and BEYOND INCREDIBLE groovepower are only a few of this albums highlites.I know this albumbackwards and forwards-having heard the worn-out 8-track since Iwas a little boy.Having it on CD does nothing to detract fromit's overall funky intensity.From &quot;Put The Word Out&quot; to it'sfinale &quot;Leaving For A Dream&quot; it's a nonstop good time with alittle partying,a little wry social commentary and some plainold fashioned romance thrown in for good measure.Unbelievable!"
1,a landmark work of rock and roll that sets the standard for everyone.Filled with the majesty and power of music performed by enduring musicians who proved much more than visionaries. They raised the bar and demonstrated that rock can say something important while transforming us deeply.Richard Butler is the real deal.
1,"While this CD was recorded over 14 years ago the music resonates as powerfully today, perhaps even more than when it was released as it was a bit ahead of its time.  In fact, the songs here seem to fit as easily into the 60's/70's rock and roll era of Pink Floyd, the Beatles and Led Zeppelin as they would into the 80's pop scene or the darker moods of the 90's era. This re-released version has four extra tracks that are worth the effort.Truly representing a wide range of styles starting with the smooth ballad ""Woman in Chains"" featuring the soulful voice of Oleta Adams.  The highlights are the following two tracks:  ""Badman's Song"", a bluesy jazz number and ""Sowing the Seeds of Love"" the hit single inspired by the Beatles better work.  The track ""Year of the Knife"" is a powerful rock and roll song.  ""Famous Last Words"" and ""Advice for the Young At Heart"" round out the single releases. Both are great songs.The extra tracks include a jazz instrumental, and a couple of unique blends of late 80's pop, including a rap version with the ""Sowing the Seeds"" lyrics called ""Johnny Panic"".I have to say this is among my favorite recordings ever.  From the deep lyrics to the wide range of musical styles, the CD has no weak spots for me.  If all you know of Tears for Fears are top 40 pop hits, then try this one out.  One of the best CDs from any era."
1,"Truly great live albums are as rare as hen's teeth when scrutinised closely, but this 1981 live recording from Billy Joel could very well be the greatest of them all.Why? Well, the hardest task in producing a live album is to give it a character of it's own, unique from the albums from which it's songs are derived. It's a great challenge for a live album to hold it's own in the face of better production in the studio, and to give it 'authenticity' when so many of the live elements are doctored with later production. 'Songs in the Attic' packs a punch that it's studio sources cannot match. The reasons for this are owing to four elements:i) Joel and Producer Phil Ramone went for Joel's 'undiscovered' tracks - the songs that predated BJ's ascendency to fame with the massive success of  'The Stranger' in 1977. By eschewing the last 5 years of hits, the 'Songs in the Attic' album captured fresh and definitive versions of reasonably unheard tracks. Most importantly, these were genuinely great compositions that deserved to be reassessed in the wake of Joel's newfound fame.ii) These were the first versions of these songs to feature Joel's live band. Ramone knew that Joel's band had the character and passion to belt out better versions of these tracks than the more insipid original studio recordings. It's a rare claim, but I can say without any concessions that these are perfect live performances from the musicians; particularly by De Vito's pounding, atmospheric drumming and Richie Cannata's brilliant multi-instrumental work. There are no better versions of any of these songs on any other live or studio album. 'Captain Jack', 'Miami 2017' and 'I've loved these days' send chills up your spine, and there is NO filler on this record.iii) So often futzed on live albums, Ramone's production work and mixing here is astonishingly perfect. He wouldn't have done better in a studio. In fact, Ramone's taste for an overly-clean studio sound was nicely tempered by the grit of the live environment. Unwittingly, it might have actually added a dimension to his production style. The decision to capture some tracks in a stadium setting and others in an intimate club works superbly as a production motif.iv) Billy Joel is caught here at the absolute peak of his powers, both as a singer and instrumentalist. He's completely 'in touch' with the meaning of these songs and the passion is so overt, it can't help but grab you. Anyone intrigued by what has driven Joel's illustrious career should start with this album. It's where he tells all of his old secrets.This album is so utterly unique it almost deserves to be compared more with his studio output than his other live albums. There are no hits here (excepting perhaps 'Say Goodbye to Hollywood') but every track is magnificent. If you want a live version of his hits, go for the fantastic new release '12 Gardens' (2006). Whilst being a terrific showcase for Joel's hits, it's not quite the equal of the transcendent, perfect live experience of 1981's 'Songs in the Attic' which is unlikely to be equalled by any artist soon."
1,"Sophie B Hawkins offers up a timeless CD. The songs are original and show her range as a singer/songwriter. Sometimes with an 80s feel, sometimes with a mellow soft quality, the CD offers plenty of variety. &quot;Right Beside You&quot; is one of my favorites, along with the hit &quot;As I Lay Me Down&quot;. Her vocals are sweet and lush, and the music behind them compliments them perfectly. This is a female singer/songwriter who is multi-talented."
1,"""Dream police"" (1979) is a very good album from the guys who seem to not think that rock `n' roll is a dead serious business. The title track is very melodic and captivating, and the ""House is rocking"" is a steamy rocker. ""I'll be with you tonight"" and ""Writing on the wall"" show this band's talent for writing memorable tunes, and the ballad ""Voices"" is just beautiful. ""Gonna raise hell"" is a groovy number but it is far too long, and you actual get a bit bored at the end. The rest of the material is alright and ""Dream police"" is an album of rather high standard. The proper rating should be somewhere between 3 strong and 4 weaker stars. I believe this album together with ""All shook up"" is the best ever from Cheap Trick, and I advise you to get them both - you'll never know how long they will be available, since this most likely isn't considered to be cool among kids of today."
1,"It is obvious that ""Bad"" was not on the same level as ""OTW"" or ""Thriller"". And it's also obvious that ""Bad"" would not surpass ""Thriller"" in records or sales. The music here was just too different--still superior--just too different. This one actually had ""filler"" per se (Speed Demon, Liberian Girl, Just Good Friends), though it did have 5 #1 hits (thought their chart longetivity was not as long as ""Thriller""'s cuts). It all appears that Jackson tried too hard to beat ""Thriller"" (hence the 5 year waiting period for ""Bad"") and it shows in the result. Regardless of how funny some of ""Bad""'s music may seem (this IS the late 1980s, so I'm not picking on just Mike), particularly the title song, it is still fresh and enjoyable today. Standout tracks include: ""The Way You Make Me Feel"", ""I Just Can't Stop Lovin' You"", ""Man in the Mirror"", ""Smooth Criminal"", and the lashing-out-at-the-media ""Leave Me Alone"" (which would become all too serious in later years). Overall, this is still quality music."
1,"I was very uncertain what to expect from this band and after I had borrowed it from the library it lay on my desk for quite some time and then I was like, it can't hurt to listen to it, so I did. It is good, but not as good as I had expected. The females vocals are a bit weak and the lyrics are not their strong point. Then why do I give it four stars. Well, the sound, and vibe are great and one starts to think back on 60's pop and it is a blend of 60's pop and modern rock. The book-let is shoddy with terrible photographs that seem to have been shot by a 7 year old kid and what is up with that hair. It is called using a comb...? Even so, this is a good debut album that has some issues..."
1,"Those of you who don't appreciate the Wu's latest efforts, and there is alot of talk of a lack of hunger, fresh concepts, and RZA beats should check this classic out. GZA layers his verses with several meanings and the beats are razor-sharp. Rae and Ghost do one of their best efforts on  Investigative. The title song and Shadowboxing are also super highlights. This is hiphop for the intelligent brother."
1,"Yesterday was a sad day for rap/hip-hop, as officials found Chad ""Pimp C"" Butler, 1/2 of the group U.G.K., dead in his hotel room in Los Angeles. It's a shame that such a talented artist who helped elevate southern rap died at a young age (he was 33). In memory of him, I decided to spin their third album on Jive Records ""Ridin' Dirty"". An album full of funky, laid back production and some great wordplay by both Bun B and Pimp C, just how I like it. Hearing this album, there are songs on here that reflect on life such as ""One Day"" (hearing the hook on that song is so depressing), as well as ""Hi-Life"", a song about the duo getting their life straight. The former song features Rap-A-Lot member Tre-Deuce (Mr. 3-2), and he also appears on ""Touched"". Another standout would be ""Diamonds & Wood"" has an excellent chopped & screwed sample for a hook that makes the song impressive. Other great songs on here are ""F My Car"" as well as the mello funky bass track ""Ridin' Dirty"". I would say that the latter is my favorite song on this LP because the song is so laid back. The album ends with the outro, as Pimp C giving shoutouts.Overall, this album is a southern classic. This is a huge improvement over their previous albumSuper Tight.... I'm glad I picked this up a while ago, because this album dropped in 1996, and it still sounds fresh today. The production on here is excellent, comming close to such funky albums asGet in Where You Fit Inor along those lines. Most of the songs on here clock in at over five minutes, so there is plenty of funk for a listener to digest. To tell you the truth, I also believe this album was slept on, and should have made UGK a household name. This is one I recommend everyone, especially fans of southern rap, to check this out. This album is not too expensive as of now, so that gives you a reason to give it a listen. It's one of those albums you can just pop in, roll one up (if you smoke), and just ride to. Trust me, you're going to feel this one, if you know how southern rap is supposed to sound like. It's sad now that the Pimp is gone, because southern rap will never be the same. Rest In Peace Pimp C.Peace & Much LoveLyrics: AProduction: A+Guest Appearances: AMusical Vibes: A+Top 5 Tracks:1. Ridin Dirty2. Diamonds & Wood3. One Day (featuring Tre-Deuce)4. Good Stuff5.

1,"This is an excellent CD by the Electric Light Orchestra. It has great music, great instruments, and great melodies. I highly recommend for old and new fans alike!"
1,"Remember all throughout school we had to stand up and recite the Pledge of Allegiance?  Wouldn't it have been better to sing along to THIS album instead?  Yes, that wouldn't have been so boring, and we certainly wouldn't have been falling asleep as we barely had the energy to stand up and look at a flag first thing in the morning, especially after a rough teenage night.But all joking aside (rather terrible joking- sorry I'm not too talented in the joke department) the United States of America (yes I KNOW what you were thinking the first time you read that... hold on a second... my favorite part of a Locanda delle Fate song is about to play*20 seconds later*Alright where were we?  Oh yes, I KNOW the first thing you were thinking when you found out there was a band called the United States of America is WHAT the heck were they smoking to come up with such a horrible band name?  I don't know what they were smoking, but give me none of that, because it's not the stuff.Let's just get right to the point- what makes this album interesting is that these extremely melodic vocal melodies are playing, and behind the melodies are some really strange, noisy and just messed up experiments going on.  I can't even explain all the things in the background of the opening song for instance- I just remember that one super awesome vocal melody that keeps repeating for several moments.Then the band turns around and does something like ""Cloud Song"" which makes you think about heaven and the Moody Blues and you're like ""WHAT???  Am I listening to the same band???""WAIT!! I know how to describe the opening song.  Imagine grabbing a microphone and standing in the busy streets of New York City.  Alright maybe not the streets... how about a construction zone or something?  Anywhere where you can hear a variety of different sounds that border on annoying, but not annoying enough to distract you.  Then, with the mic, block out all the sounds around you and sing a passionate vocal melody.  That's kind of what the opening song is like.  If you don't think so, well, we're just two very different people.Just pick up US of A today."
1,"Now I know that some of you are disappointed that Marv's last hit (at least on the pop charts), ""Sexual Healing"", is not in this fabulous collection of classic hits but let's face it, it chronicles his time as a MOTOWN artist. So of course they weren't going to include an out-of-label hit even if the hit was viable to that star's career. Same thing they did with Diana Ross and Michael Jackson's anthologies.Anyway, this 2-CD (or 2-tape) collection of 67 songs, 40-some known hit singles and some album cuts, b-sides and rarities is the PERFECT album for a true artist like Marvin Gaye was. Many cats can only wish that they can have the hit catalogue that this brotha from the Chocolate City had! I mean, he was not only just a popular singer who recorded some of the 20th century's greatest songs and albums known to mankind, but he was also a great writer, producer, arranger, mixer, musician and instrumentalist not to mention he already had a career as a lead singer of two R&B; groups in the late-'50s before signing with Motown in 1961 to be a jazz singer (his original intention of rebelling against what people were telling him how he should be).And then you can't forget his LEGENDARY and AMAZING duets with classic R&B; female legends like Mary Wells (the first female superstar of Motown), Kimberly Weston, the wonderful and memorable Tammi Terrell and last but not least the Motown Queen, Diana Ross. So not only has his career spread four decades but in the middle of it, he was able to be in a couple of groups, be a legendary duet partner and he even played in a couple of movies or three.But anyway back to the anthology set of Marvin! The man's hit career spreads into three or four or even five different periods at a time:Suave Gentleman (1962-67)Soul Loverman (1967-70)Patriotic Ghetto Warrior (1971-1972)Romantic and Erotic Ladies' Man (1973-1977)Confessional Ghetto Preacher (1978-1981)The first CD (full of 20 solo hits and 7 wonderful duets) may be the most interesting of the anthology set. It shows Marvin at first reaching his inner Sam Cooke in the early portion of his career going from ""Stubborn Kind of Fellow"" to ""Baby Don't U Do It"" and then finding his own voice slowly from ""How Sweet It Is"" and then finally finding his vocal POWER in songs like ""You"" (check out the HIGH note near the middle of the song!) and ""Grapevine"". And then there's the memorable duets with Tammi Terrell that are the essence of true soul. Marvin & Tammi should both be inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame just for the five songs listed on the album.But then again, the second CD of the anthology set can be the most complex! I mean, this is when Marvin Gaye took FULL ARTISTIC CONTROL and gave us the legendary albums WHAT'S GOING ON, TROUBLE MAN, LET'S GET IT ON, MARVIN GAYE LIVE, I WANT YOU, HERE, MY DEAR, and IN OUR LIFETIME (which was Marvin's first entry into the '80s). You would fall in love with the different production of ""What's Going On"", without so much of the people talking and just the music, it also shows more of Marvin's vocal backings in its beautiful pitch. ""God Is Love"", even with its short time, is classic MOTOWN with a gospel-soul feel to it. You had a feeling R. Kelly was listening closely to this album while making Step In The Name of Love. ""Sad Tomorrows"" with its different feel of a bluesy and classical feel and with that soul is different from the album version (Flying High) from What's Going On and it's also breathtaking that you have to play it over and over. ""The World Is Rated X"" and ""You're The Man"" is the brotha's finest work as a political preacher as he sung about the social ills of the world and the political administration. And of course songs from the wonderful ""Let's Get It On"" album is produced brilliantly here. ""Just to Keep U Satisfied"" is classic doo-wop!Then you get into the live recording of ""Distant Lover"" even while edited (for album purposes) and well it's still a masterpiece. ""I Want You"" and ""After the Dance"" are classics and of course ""Got to Give It Up"" is a blue-light in the basement party anthem that is still hot even after all these years. Finally Marvin's later work with ""Here, My Dear"" and ""In Our Lifetime"" are produced and helps brings a climatic ending to the entire 2-CD set.From ""Stubborn Kind of Fellow"" in 1962 where he was in love with a girl but somehow stubborn to his or his woman's feelings to when he was looking for love in 1981's funky ""Heavy Love Affair"", it's particularly the Diary of Marvin Gaye. Nobody in soul music was like this cat and there will be nobody like him again no matter what you say! Marvin Gaye is forever the Original King of R&B;! (TAKE THAT, WHITNEY, HA-HA!)"
1,"Michael can do no wrong.  This album is the pinnacle ,in my opinion, of Michael's recording career thus far.  The songs are perfect.  No other way around it.  They personify perfection.  He's the King for all the right reasons.  He can sing, write, DANCE, and video like NOONE else.  You can't help not aknowledging the artistry of a man who has influenced the fabric of popular music as it is known today.  He's the best, without a doubt.  And he's BAD fuh sho'!"
1,"Nick is a recent discovery for me. Needless to say, it's a much welcome discovery. Drake's vocals are haunting and beautiful; the style is vintage sounding yet distinct. The guitar playing is magnificent. If you are looking for something to fill certain void in your modern folk music files, look no further, Nick Drake fills the gap very nicely."
1,"A good place to start if you are not terribly familiar with Sonny Rollins.  It was nice to see this disc showcased on Ken Burns' &quot;Jazz&quot; special on PBS last year.  Some argue this is not Sonny's best work, but it seems to be one of his best known works.  The opening track has a great ambiance to it and &quot;Strode Rode&quot; is also a great piece of work.  Nothing weak on this album-it's all good.  Recommended."
1,"Robin Yvette Allen (Or The Lady Of Rage) has been in the Music business since Dr. Dre released ""The Chronic"" in 1992. This was her only album. She was one of my favorite female rappers. Where is she now? These days, I only see her on repeats of ""The Steve Harvey Show"" as Coretta (Thankfully, she is in the best of DVD). What happened to her music career? Did she just quit? She really needs to do another album. Rage, Please drop another album or as Snoop Dogg would say ""Rage, would you please drop some Gangsta S***!"""
1,"No superlatives can over-emphasize the impact this band had on me during my formative years! Fantastic music, great remastering, timeless groove...Funk at its best!"
1,"This was part of the first Elton album I ever owned. Back in early 94, I picked up a cassette that had this album on one side, and ""Don't Shoot Me"" on the other. I bought the tape for two ""Don't Shoot Me"" songs, ""Crocodile Rock"" and ""Daniel"". ... I think either ""Honky Chateu"", or ""Don't Shoot Me I'm Only The Piano Player"", are great places to start with Elton, it's too bad the twin pack is not a more common release. ... Anyway, about ""Honky Chateu"", the beginning of Elton's most successful time period. After the brilliant, yet somewhat serious and dramatic ""Madman Across The Water"", I suppose Elton felt it was time to loosen up a bit, and he did! The first track, ""Honky Cat"", has a New Orleans style boogie, and sings of a country boy, blown away by the city life. As for ""Mellow"", just what the title says, the laid back days of two lovers; ""I Think I'm Going To Kill Myself"", one of the first songs on the album to really pull me in, a hilarious, yet somewhat touching song, with a toe-tappin' beat, and even features tap-dancing! ""Suzie(Dramas)"", a catchy song about a small-town boy, at the command of his girlfriend, keeps things moving in the right direction, but then there is ""Rocket Man"". Don't get me wrong, ""Rocket Man"" is one of Elton's finest singles, but to me, it has always seemed slightly out of place on this album of country style rock and boogie. Eventually, ""Slave"" begins to pull things back into the right direction; ""Amy"", while bordering on filler, manages to save itself by being witty; ""Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters"", a song inspired from Bernie Taupin's(Elton's lyricist) witnessing of a shooting outside of his hotel in New York, is one of the best songs on the album. The album closes with ""Hercules"", certainly not the best here, but none the less, catchy and fitting. Like I said, the beginning of the most successful period of Elton's career. If you are just getting into Elton, this is a great starting point, if you are already a big fan, and you don't have this album, it's a necessity!"
1,"This is an excellent compilation of Bobby Goldsboro's hits and important tracks.  Goldsboro is probably one of the more underrated singers from the 60's.  His music was at times sentimental, but his delivery was always heartfelt.  His first hit ""See the Funny Little Clown"" was self-penned and still sounds fresh.  His version of the Burt Bacharach ""Me Japanese Boy, I Love You"" is a lovely ballad that sounds fresh in this digital format.  ""Little Things"" is a pop jewel that Billy Gilman covered several years ago.  With its popping chorus and original bass line, it's a track that holds up well 40 years later.  ""Voodoo Woman"" is another great rocking track with that pounding drumbeat, ""Voodoo woman you break every heart you see; so voodoo woman stay away from me.""  ""If You've Got a Heart"" is a track that I've come to enjoy as a result of this compilation with its pretty upbeat melody and breakup lyric.  The combination of opposites is kind of a musical version of tragicomedy.  ""Broomstick Cowboy"" is one of the more sentimental tracks that Bobby wrote with its midtempo beat and a pretty melody.  My favorite Goldsboro track is ""It's Too Late"" with its pounding rhythms, horns, driving bass line and Goldsboro's expressive delivery, ""I remember when I told you that I'd try in every way to hold you & kiss you & love you & keep you 'til my dying day, you just laughed and said you found somebody new, & you didn't need all the things I could do.""  This is excellent classic rock.  ""Blue Autumn,"" Goldsboro's biggest hit ""Honey,"" and ""Autumn of My Life"" all reflect the more sentimental side of his recordings.  This collection is an excellent compilation of the magic of Bobby Goldsboro.  Enjoy!"

1,"THE CARS (1978) is the The Cars' greatest work ever.  Sure, '80's Top 40 pop enthusiasts would probably say that about HEARTBEAT CITY (which did sell more records upon release), but real rock fans rate their debut at the top. Why? Because, just like most great rock debuts (such as BOSTON and VAN HALEN), it shows The Cars in hungry mode, pulling out all the stops to create a hard, edgy, and energetic record that was different from anything else out at the time. This band combined hard guitar-rock with a spacey keyboard-driven New Wave sound (that only then was beginning to emerge) in equal amounts, with straightforward, simple lyrics--and created a sound that was raw yet sleek, edgy but commercially accessible, and totally fresh at that time. Between Ric Ocasek and Benjamin Orr's similarly cool, unaffected lead vocals, Greg Hawkes' incredibly cool, futuristic keyboards, and Elliot Easton's slicing, awesome guitar-work, this album was truly unique. It influenced countless other New Wave/rock bands afterwards. It has since stood the test of time, and that's what makes it a true classic.When I first heard THE CARS on a cassette tape 22 years ago, I was already quite familiar with &quot;Just What I Needed.&quot; Then, I really got hooked on &quot;Good Times Roll&quot; and &quot;Best Friend's Girl.&quot; It wasn't until 1982 that I really started liking &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye Love.&quot; The following year, I got into &quot;I'm In Touch With Your World.&quot; But it has only been in the past couple of years that I have totally fallen for the medley of &quot;Moving In Stereo/All Mixed Up.&quot; Talk about a true classic; over the years, every now and then, it's given me something new to love about it! MOST RECOMMENDED"
1,A very smooth cd. These girls came with when they came out! I love it...
1,"This classic album was the last the Moody Blues performed together before they temporarily split in 1972.  Later in 1978, Mike Pinder rejoined the group for the uneven album, ""Octave"", before he left forever.  This collection on DTS surpasses all other recordings in sound quality and depth.  Guitars barely heard before stand out and the percussion is spread about with distinct clarity.  Even the vocals are clearly separated but keeping the harmony.  The only other album the Moody Blues put on DTS is, ""Days Of Future Passed"" and they both sound like brand new recordings.  For those who never heard DTS surround sound, it is an event.  These sound systems are fairly low priced now.  I hope it's not too long before the entire Moody Blues series is released on DTS."
1,"Ten songs from Elton John's glory years up to 1974 are compiled on this hugely successful greatest hits disc.  This is one of the most popular greatest hits CDs around, and who would be surprised?  Say what you will about Elton's material of the 1980s or 1990s, the deal is this: he came up with some near-classic stuff in the 1970s.  &quot;Your Song&quot; could very well be the ultimate love ballad: its power lies in its simplicity and the modest lyrics thanks to Bernie Taupin.  &quot;Daniel&quot; and &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot; are also timeless as well.  But as good as this stuff is, I have to dock one star off this baby for having only 10 tracks and excluding the dynamite &quot;Tiny Dancer.&quot;  Still, this is a great beginners guide to Elton and is definitely recommended."
1,"In November of 1991, Michael Joe Jackson was once again going through a new phase as he had done some 12 years ago when he teamed up with Quincy Jones and together, those two created Off The Wall, Thriller and Bad. While their 10-year partnership created three of the greatest albums in music history, Michael Jackson still felt he needed to prove himself. At 33 years old, he was hungry for some blood. He had been introduced to Teddy Riley to help create a new style for him and his music. Many were quick to call him old hat by this point but after this release, things weren't exactly the same again as pop and R&amp;B/soul music goes.A mixture of pop greatness, funk epic, R&amp;B head banger, soul healer, rock &amp; roll idoldom, new jack sensibility, great lyrics and of course the Otis Redding-inspired growls, the smooth tenor and of course that falsetto, mix them all up, put Michael Jackson in it and you have one of the greatest albums that was ever recorded and it isn't because I'm a MJ fan but it's really the truth.This album was just a raw-sounding classic and it definitely was one album that you HAVE to GET UP and DANCE! And dance HARD as hell! Many of the essential jams in this baby definitely stand out from anything Michael had done previously. Songs like &quot;Jam&quot;, &quot;Why U Wanna Trip&quot;, &quot;In The Closet&quot;, &quot;She Drives Me Wild&quot;, &quot;Remember the Time&quot; (EVERYBODY was bumpin' this song back in the day!), and &quot;Can't Let Her Get Away&quot; were essential hip-hop/soul jams that still sounds like it could be released right now (check out Janet's Damita Jo album for example). Songs like &quot;Black or White&quot; and &quot;Give In To Me&quot; are great examples of classic rock and alternative/grunge IMO. &quot;Heal the World&quot;, &quot;Will You Be There&quot;, and &quot;Keep The Faith&quot; are classic gospel. &quot;Gone Too Soon&quot; is poetic-like pop. &quot;Who Is It&quot; is Gospel for the Soul of the Neglected (check &quot;This Place Hotel&quot; and &quot;Billie Jean&quot; for further example) and &quot;Dangerous&quot; is a 6 1/2-minute funk epic!This album definitely proved he can rise without the help of a producer...and at the same time CAN! Three cheers to Michael Jackson for this amazing album! HEE-HEE!"
1,"Paris is one of the many hip-hip artist from the early 1990's that didnt get alot of airplay, and mainly sold records on word of mouth. Let me tell you that even though Paris's other releases aren't as strong as this, ""The Devil Made me Do It"" has flavor that most hip-hop has lost today, and that is dealing with racial tensions, political issues, and Black History (ex..Black Panthers) The beats are also mind blowing, and this album is very Hard for the time that it was released. Even though the album is somewhat dated, it still is a treasure, and I hope people that are infactuated with todays hip-hop could take a few steps back and pick up an album of such importance. This CD belongs in EVERYONES collection. Its that good! (i only gave if 4 stars because even though it is a classic, there are some poor filler tunes here) ENJOY"
1,"Shania Twain is definitely one of the best Country artists out..... Shania has all the right moves and music. It's no wonder why so many people love Shania and her music! Shania's music is a combination of Country, Rock, and Pop, but she's basically Country ... Shania's music is actually cheerful and very lively.Songs like &quot;Man! I Feel Like A Woman!&quot;, &quot;Honey, I'm Home&quot;, and &quot;That Don't Impress Me Much&quot; will have you moving to the beat and jumping up and down all around the place. Songs like &quot;From This Moment On&quot; and &quot;You're Still The One&quot; are much slower ballads, but are very emotional and touching songs. Although COME ON OVER is a 16-track CD, you'll love all the songs and won't have to worry about skipping any. All the songs from COME ON OVER are written by Shania and her husband, Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange. .... If you're a fan of Country, Rock, and Pop music then you definitely have to get Shania Twain's COME ON OVER album and add this one to your collection!"
1,"If Bee Gees' 1st was a paisley-clad peppermint candy, then Horizontal would be a corduroy butterscotch showing an aged maturity and sophistication. Not to mention a little bit of heaviness.Led by their super hit ""Massachusetts"", the album sticks close to the baroque orchestral pop from their first album, but mixes soulful ballads and blues influenced rock into their Gibb Pop Stew.With oddly titled songs such as  the dark ""Lemons Never Forget"", hard rocker ""The Earnest Of Being George"" and the dramatic soul of ""The Change Is Made"", a different, powerful new Bee Gees emerge that show they are getting serious about being around for awhile.By breaking away from their happier, poppier sound, they venture into a territory that is more minor-key and melancholy; positioning themselves along side the Left Banke or Procol Harum which both had sentimental rock hits at the time.For fans of the mellotron you'll be happy to know it is featured prominently on this album along with grand piano and sharp ice pick sparks of fuzzed-out electric guitar that pepper some of the more somber moments of their songs.The album isn't exactly as solid as Bee Gees' 1st, and has some less-focused patches (such as the McCartney-esque""Birdie Told Me""), but the good tunes make up for it all with their emotional poignancy, and in the end Horizontal possibly turns out to be a more grandiose statement from the Gibbs than their first record."
1,You must put in perspective the importance Duane Allman had on this CD.The songs come alive with Duane's input.A very emotional CD and a must get for lovers of good guitar based music.
1,"Who didn't listen to the Beastie Boys back in the '80's? Their crossover appeal to rap and rock fans made the group one of the biggest hits during that era. The album was indicative of their unique style of rap, along with their penchant for including heavy rock sounds/backgrounds into their music. Although some thought that this album was a bit commercialized, it didn't keep it from becoming one of the most popular releases during that time. ""Brass Monkey"" is a memorable track that almost every Beastie fan can sing along to, and ""Fight For Your Right"" almost became an anthem for party-crazed teens in the '80's. ""Time To Get Ill"" was one of my favorite songs on this album, since it displayed skilled Dj'ing and catchy backdrop beats. Lyrics were also easy to memorize, which always helps when you feel like rappin' along with the track being played in your car. ""Hold It Now, Hit It"" is still one of the most sampled tracks in today's rap songs, and its catchy beat and rhythm allows for regular play in many listener's stereos. ""She's Crafty"" and ""The New Style"" were less-known hits, but still allows for fans to enjoy, as beats and sounds are similar to other hits... but, just different enough to keep the album from being boring. With their unique style and memorable lyrics, who wouldn't want to buy this album for the right price?"
1,"Wanted it in my colllection, Love all of his music, I can relate to his songs, sounds like a country boy. Sweet."
1,"DISRAELI GEARS is a great Cream CD, especially in its remastered form. Classics such as ""Sunshine Of Your Love"", ""Strange Brew"", ""SWLABR"", and ""Tales Of Brave Ulysses"" helped to create the style known as heavy metal, but lesser-known cuts that include ""Dance The Night Away"" and ""We're Going Wrong"" are equally impressive and should not be discounted. This CD is a necessity in any complete rock & roll fan's musical library."
1,"It would be easy for me to give any Abba CD less than 5 stars, if you consider their music in comparison to all rock music. However, if you consider their music in comparison to all pop, the rating must be different. Abba didn't create good pop, they created excellent pop. Bennie and Bjorn could churn out one catchy tune after another, and Agnetha and Frida could sing in harmony well enough that those of us that watched them on tv fell in love instantly and became immediate Abba fans.This CD collects the majority of Abba's biggest hits, though they may have been hits in Germany or England or the United States. I know that when I bought this CD (which I purchased after ""More Abba Gold"" - which I'll talk about momentarily) I recognized nearly every song, which says that most of them did get good airplay.Most of these songs are classic 70s pop songs, with very little if any disco influence. And while most of the songs are catchy and do little to press the boundaries of rock music, there are a few songs that transcend the genre. Most particularly ""Lay All Your Love On Me"", ""I Have a Dream"", ""Fernando"", ""One of Us"", and ""Thank You for the Music"", which in hindsight was first a thank you to fans and then became the group's goodbye with its 1983 release as a single after the group broke up.I enjoy Abba's music. It's generally easy on the ears, you can sing or hum it, and pretty darn well written. However, Abba is much more than the music on this CD. If you like this CD you may want to try ""More Abba Gold"", which has miscellaneous hits of somewhat lower stature (less sales) than those on this CD. While the ""More Abba Gold"" CD songs sold less than these, I think the music is more complex in some cases, and often shows that Abba was more than just catchy tunes. One step further would be to buy the albums and catch Abba as they were originally released and appreciated by those of us who bought their albums.Yes, it's a bit of nostalgia from the 70s and early 80s. It's music we heard so often on the radio, and perhaps even more often on our record players (that thing that plays those round black plastic thingies with the grooves on each side). It's takes us back to a fun time when maybe life was just a little less complicated. And yes, it's very listenable and among the best of pop music...go have fun listening..."
1,"I took a shot with Accelerator because a friend of mine really digs their stuff(plus I really like Papua New Guinea). So when I found out that Ambient Works Vol. 1 was too rich for my blood(and Druqgs for better or worse just plain ...), I bought it with a little hesistation. While I can't say that it was completely worth it, a few stand out moments make this debut worth a look.Once again like so many other ambient acts, Accelerator is rooted deeply in old ways of Tangerine Dream, but with more sampling and a lot of dancing grooves(Very similar to Orb in many ways). Complex shifting synths are matched with dub-like drum loops and some great audio production techniques. The result creates intriguing dance grooves but some interesting audioscapes as well. All and all, its quality stuff but...I find myself really digging to figure how this competes with other contemperaries that do the same thing but less panche so to speak. It lacks that certain something that makes groups like Red Snapper, Autechre(whom I really dig), Underworld, or Orbital themselves. It just feels too conventional too really take off.But don't let my skeptism sway you too much. I've been buying way too much music to really give anything a real indepth listen any more. However, the stuff that stands out on top, really stands out. FSOL certainly has some ideas that with a little polish could certainly lead to something great. I'm giving their two disc epic a chance to see if this band has anything more to offer. I'm going to keep trying to see if this CD has a few more suprises but still as it stands, you really could do better than this.(3 1/2).P.S. Although its still better than Drugqs...."
1,"November 6th, 2010.This is one groovy album. It's the first album by Michael that I've listened to entirely and liked most of the songs (my other full listen was to 2001'sInvinciblewhich had a few songs that were noteworthy, but not like this).There are obviously 19 ""tracks"" here but some of them are just commentaries about Michael, a bit on how he was and his approach to his songs and such (which I found interesting and still do when listening) or original demos of songs (of which one I liked and one I disliked).Like I said, it is a very smooth, dance-enabling album full of songs that for the most part have similar tempos but are still almost always well-crafted. I actually felt spoiled listening to the set over and over.The filler tracks are kept to a minimum. ""It's The Falling In Love"" Feat. Patti Austin is pleasant, although not the best track. ""Burn This Disco Out"", the final track on the vinyl version of this album has a nice beat, but also could be stronger. They also put these two tracks right after another which doesn't help. But I don't hate these tracks. I just don't particularly love them and find them filler more than anything. The last of the MOR tracks are ""Workin' Day And Night (The Original demo)"". Thankfully it's not really meant to be an album track but a space filler or an extra.Other than that, this is quite a strong offering from Michael and marked his first effort on the Epic label.4.25 stars or an 8.5/10.DOWNLOAD:""I Can't Help It""""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough""""Rock With You"" & the underrated""Girlfriend"""
1,"In 1977, Heart had began work on their second album, which they had appropriately titled, MAGAZINE. Half-way through the recording sessions for the album, Heart left Mushroom Records, and then signed with Portrait Records. Mushroom was going to release the unfinished album, but a court order was given to both Heart and the label to not release the album until the case was settled in court. However, Heart needed to record an album for Portrait Records and the birth of LITTLE QUEEN came about. LITTLE QUEEN, which was released in May of 1977, stands as Heart's second album, and what an album it turned out to be.BARRACUDAThe first single from the album. This song is still being recognized today by all of the real fans of Heart. Great song.LOVE ALIVEThe fourth & final single from the album. Not bad.SYLVAN SONG (Instrumental)Okay.DREAM OF THE ARCHERGreat.KICK IT OUTThe third single from the album. Great song.LITTLE QUEENThe second single from the album. Great title track.TREAT ME WELLFor this slow and subtle ballad, Nancy Wilson took over on lead vocals. Both Ann and Nancy have amazing voices that are very easy to notice. Ann has the voice, that is amazingly powerful. Nancy has the voice that is not as deep and powerful as Ann's voice. Nancy has the relaxing, soothing tone.SAY HELLOGreat.CRY TO MEGreat.GO ON CRYNot bad.This is one hell of an album, and don't expect Heart to stop here.

1,"The Moodies would find out here if they'd succeed in a major revamping of their sound. Most Moodies fans know that they started out with Denny Laine at the helm, sounding like if the Rolling Stones were less punky and more bluesy (try ""Early Blues""). Then along came ""Days Of Future Passed"", but that was no indicator of what was to come--concept albums using full orchestra seldom mark a major change. The tend to be a ""special treat"". Hell, you take out the orchestral and spoken interludes and you end up with a pretty short album. But now it was back to doing song albums. And this one proved that the Moodies we know today were here to stay--a whole new sound under an existing name. Take a Graeme Edge poem that ramps up in intensity until it ends in hysterical laughter and segue into a driving but melodic ""Ride My See Saw"" and off we go. Next is the elementary school folk sound of ""Dr. Livinstone I Presume"" where Ray Thomas makes like Stephen Foster. I'll reserve comment on the ""House Of Four Doors/ Legend Of a Mind"" medley--it was trendy back in those days to see Timothy Leary as a heroic fugure. Then we open side 2 (vinyl version"" with Justin Hayward's now-famous baritone in ""Voices In the Sky"". Keyboardist Mike Pinder gnext gives us ""The Best Way To Travel"", which has an annoying toot-toot-toot figure in the last verse that makes you think there's a bearing going bad in your player. ""The Actor"" is by far the best song on the album, proving that you can mix an acoustic guitar and flute and still have a good solid beat. No, Jethro Tull did NOT do it first. I suppose ""The Voice/ Om"" can be forgiven--those were days when it was fashionable to think that Western culture was an abomination and Eastern was the way to go. Rather than take the ""raga-rock"" direction, the Moodies did like the Beatles and built this song in that ole Subcontinental style from the ground up. But with the exception of that and the Leary hymn, this was the way they were to go over several albums. And thereby avoiding becoming the ""Also-Rolling Stones"" and carving a niche with an immediately recognizable sound. Maybe they've never been truly rock and roll in the true sense. Graeme Edge didn't trash hotel rooms. John Lodge didn't get say ""I'm sick of being nothing but Hayward's tenor harmony"" and walk out for a solo career--he's still there. Ray Thomas didn't die of an o.d.--he retired like any working man. Which is why I can draw my own pension and still listen to the same act I heard on the radio as a college undergrad. Neil Young once said ""It's better to burn out 'cause rust never sleeps"", but that ideology only impresses the very young and very angry."
1,"There are several Moody Blues classics, and this happens to my favorite. Another CD with bonuses that are worth the extra space."
1,"Five years later he was back with one of the most sonically spotless albums of the decade.  That's not a detriment, but ""Bad"" does sound a lot more mechanical than ""Thriller,"" to some degree because it's so darn consistent.  Yes, consistency is good, especially when you're consistently excellent, but ""Thriller"" wasn't the best-selling album ever because of consistency.  ""Thriller"" had a spookfest, the most paranoid song in pop history, and a rock anthem.  ""Bad"" has a very macho title track, but it never pushes any limits, playing it safe with songs where the message shaves off a lot of the danceability--which is a huge part of the attraction, since this is a pop record if ever there was one.  That isn't to say there isn't some really good stuff here: his duet with Stevie Wonder is terrific, even if it's nothing new and looks remarkably tame in comparison to something like ""Billie Jean.""  ""Another Part of Me"" sounds solid, and it's got a stellar groove; ""Man in the Mirror"" is gentle and straightforward, and all the more powerful for it.  And yeah, ""Smooth Criminal"" is pretty smooth, and ""Liberian Girl"" is a small gem, but the only song that's aggressively bound-pushing enough to live up to Michael's reputation is ""Dirty Diana,"" which is pretty rough and tough.  It definitely isn't bad, it has some thrilling moments, but there's no way it's a ""Thriller."""
1,"This is classic 2pac, his best album in my opinion.  This album is probably his hardest album.  All the songs are solid and there is not one weak song here.  But my favorites are Me And My Girlfriend (instant classic, jay-z tried to do a remake but failed), Life Of An Outlaw (just love this song its great), To Live &amp; Die In LA (we've all heard this classic), and the rest are good too.  To cap off a classic album, this remastered version includes the video of &quot;To Live And Die In LA&quot;, which is a good video too.  If you don't have this album, well you are missing out big.  If you are a 2pac fan, it is mandatory that you have this album because its his best."
1,"yall know how i do, so i aint even gotta set the atmosphere... i like it when grown folks do they thang, sangin from they hearts about love and desire...grown folks act with direction and confidence... we dont rely on bein cute for the cameras, over choreographed dance moves, million dollar special f/x or the producer of the song being a bigger attraction than the artist doin the actual singing...(what is up with music nowadays?)barry white is a grown man: aggressive, passionate and emotional...his songs reflect that and remind us that love, lust and night-music is best left to the responsible!!dont let another good night go to waste!find somebody to enjoy this with before it gets too dark outside!"
1,"GET IT...GOT IT...GOOD!!!!nothin' but soul....nothin' but soul.He always takes other peoples songs and make them his own. ""By the time i get to Phoenix"" is probably his best his best by far.Preach brutha preach!!!!!!"
1,"This 1976 release features ten great tunes which features the hits HARBOR LIGHTS,the disco-flavored LOWDOWN and the love ballad WE'RE ALL ALONE. The following year,the latter track would be a hit for Rita Coolidge from her A&M album ANYTIME ANYWHERE. The aforementioned songs would later appear on 1980's HITS! Great album!"
1,"Like the last record, only even denser, angrier, and possibly better. In the span of just over an hour, they barrage you with swirling samples, funky bass, dance beats, and grade-A turntable work. A lot of the credit goes to the Bomb Squad, whose production makes this thing rock harder than most nominal ""rock"" record. They also make great use of sampling - for instance, check the raging adrenaline rush of the classic ""Welcome to the Terrordome,"" which samples the Temptations' ""Psychedelic Shack,"" ""Pollywanacraka,"" which contains snatches of AWB's hit ""Schoolboy Crush"" and some innovative vocal samples, the funky ""Anti-N***** Machine,"" which begins with a chaotic slew of samples, and the several sound-collage tracks spread across the album, which give this disc a lot of depth and make the whole concoction seem even more frightening and chaotic. But make no mistake - the real star here is Chuck D, who overflows with righteous fury, intelligence, charisma, and even a bit of humor as he protests racism and poverty. His rhymes and delivery make several of these songs, and just about every song is fantastic: the inflammatory classic ""Brothers Gonna Work It Out,"" the invigorating Old-School Rap Who's-Who track ""Burn Hollywood Burn,"" with guest appearances by Ice Cube and Big Daddy Kane, the frenzied, claustrophobic ""Power to the People,"" Flavor's hilarious features ""911 is a Joke"" and ""Can't Do Nuttin' For Ya Man!,"" and ""Who Stole the Soul?,"" with a classic ""hype man"" performance from Flavor. The lyrics are often quite insightful, such as the pro-interracial marriage title track (with munchkin voices!), and Chuck constantly forces us to look at the gritty, ugly truths about life without seeming self-righteous. As if this weren't enough, a lot of these songs also make for socially conscience dance tracks, such as the feminist funk ""Revolutionary Generation."" The record slows down a bit near the end, offering a perhaps overly concentrated dose of pseudo-instrumentals (""Leave This off Your F***in' Charts,"" ""Final Count at the Collision Between Us and the Damned"") that don't have much to offer in comparison to their similar predecessors, and a couple of genuinely mediocre tunes (""Reggie Jax,"" ""B-Side Wins Again,"" where Flavor's ranting gets a bit out-of-hand, ""War at 33',""). But the rest of the record is remarkable, and it closes with yet another justly famous song, ""Fight the Power,"" with Branford Marsalis adding to the cacophonic stew on saxophone. This record rocks hard. It's not nominally a rock album, but it still kicks at least as much [...] as the best of most rock groups. One of the most important, best albums in rap history. Many of these songs have passed into rap legend, namely ""Brothers Gonna Work it Out,"" ""911 is a Joke,"" ""Welcome to the Terrordome,"" ""Burn Hollywood Burn,"" and ""Fight the Power."" If you can find this album - it took me over a year to, and when I finally ran across it, I almost passed it over. My reaction was somewhere along the lines of, ""Oh hey, they have Fear of a Black Planet. Wait a minute... Fear of a Black Planet?!? AWESOME!!!"" Anyway, this record easily lives up to its infallible reputation, and definitely stands as a rap classic.By the way, I'd like to say a few words to those who consider PE ""racist."" In the liner notes, they thank Sinead O'Connor, Jello Biafra, and Rick Rubin. All three of them are white. They also speak in favor of interracial marriages on the title track, and sample Van Halen. They have a lot of hatred for racist whites (and so do I), but not all white people. There's a difference."
1,its a fantasy alrght but not any bad kind and definitely not the kind of fantasies pop singers of today refer to. This album is a fantasy for fans of singer-songwriters and 70s music.
1,"I truly think this is one of the Most Underrated Albums Ever! this Album has so many tight Grooves&Vibes all through it.Michael Jackson truly shines on His ""Heartbreak Hotel"".that song is one of the Baddest Tracks the Brother has ever recorded to me.""Time Waits for no One"",""Lovely One"",""Can You Feel It"" all work.i dig the Writing,Arrangements&Overall Production on this set.this Album along with Destiny,Off The Wall&Thriller had MJ on a Heck of a Run.""give it up"" also is a smooth cut."
1,"This is one of the albums that always got over looked in the Jacksons catalogue, the album had no big hits but did feature those classic Jackson slow jams which are ""Even Though Your Gone"" ""Heaven Knows I Love You"" ""Man Of War"" and the best album closer on any Jackson album ""Find Me A Girl"" the other songs are good too but I'm more of a ballad lover due to Michaels voice."
1,"This album dropped back in 1995, and ten years later, it is still one of my favorite's. The reason being simple; The GZA is a Genius. He is without a doubt one of the sharpest lyricist to ever bless a microphone. I agree with the popular opinion on this website, that this is the best Wu-Tang solo album. The RZA'a production and the GZA's verbal assault are a perfect marriage. Although all of the tracks are hot, ""Living in the World Today"" is the quintessential showcase of the GZA's pure talent. He attacks the track like only he can, twisting an arsenal of jabs and powerhouse rights, with his unique cadence and inflection. Although he is perhaps the most respected clansman among the Wu and fans, he has never attained a strong popular following due to his disinterest in diverting from his roots as a true street MC. Whenever I grow tired of the rappers of today, I feel thankful that I can drop in this CD and get-down to some real hip-hop."
1,"Christmas &amp; The Beads of Sweat, this beautiful album by Laura Nyro, still at the zenith of her creative powers, is not to be missed by the true fan irregardless of the trouble it make take to get a copy - then, and only  then can you consider your collection of her work even partially complete.  The whole album is, pardon me, like an out-of-the-body dream'scape into an  transcendent rich, warm territory that shuts out the profane and envelopes  you in its sublimity of sentiment and outlook.  This is a rare pearl, and  if you own only three Nyro albums, make this one of them along with  Tendaberry, and Eli &amp; The 13th Confession, an essential trilogy.  This  album will always have a very special place in my music collection (and  heart!).  Bother Sony/Columbia if need be like a never-ending swarm of  angry hornets to make this available.  A CD that could otherwise make the  sensitive music fan stand up and take notice  even 1,000 or 2,000 years  from now, it is so unique.  Overshadowed only by a couple of her albums  before, in all of her work, many other works pale in comparison to  &quot;Christmas..&quot;, just as spiritual and and at the same time sensual  as the title invokes."
1,"I was born 10 years after this album came out. My parents were still in high school on its release date. But they knew it was good. It stuck with them. And they raised me on it. Countless trips to Grandma's house, giggling at the rumbling low-end notes of the baritone saxiphones in &quot;Why Don't You Write Me?&quot; Just like a rebellious teen raised in a morally strict family, I tried to run and deny my love for these songs . . . but for many years now I have loudly proclaimed it. &quot;The Only Living Boy In New York&quot; is, to this day, my favorite song of all time. &quot;The Boxer&quot;, &quot;Keep the Customer Satisfied&quot;, and &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; still move me emotionally like few songs can. The only song I don't like is &quot;So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright.&quot; First of all, the purpose of the song doesn't warrant either songwriting or inclusion on an album in my opinion. But when all we had was this album on cassette, that song was the last one on side one, so we could just fast forward to the end. Now with CD's, it's even easier to continue disliking that song by never listening to it. When an album such as this is labelled as a classic, there is a very good reason for it. Those reasons can be seen as just plain ol' good songs, powerful social commentary, Billboard-topping singles . . . but for me, its the fact that I, primarily a fan of punk and independent rock, love this album that proves that it's a timeless classic."
1,"I owe a great debt to Dan Fogelberg; he and specifically his tracks ""Longer"" and ""The Leader of the Band"" are what made me interested in picking up the acoustic guitar years back when I was a tween. It has been a hobby of mine that has made me love all kinds of music and guitar styles and hence opened up a whole new world to me. Because of his first ""Greatest Hits"" album which I had on vinyl, I was influenced to explore the field of acoustic/folk guitar in greater depth which eventually led me to names like the brilliant Jim Croce and James Taylor as well as Clarence White and even Paul Simon which further increased my repertoire.The two tracks that I mentioned at the very top I actually spent hours painstakingly listening to the lp trying to figure out just what he was doing. It wasn't enough to just sound like the lp I wanted to play exactly like the lp and so the transcriptions that were on sale at the time although they helped to guide me a little but at the time none of them were accurate and so were unhelpful. That type of discipline and work ethic that I went through to play those tracks exactly as I heard them held me in good stead later on when it came to learning other tracks on the electric and classical guitar and so I can safely say that Dan Fogelberg is the reason I'm an all-round guitarist today. Thanks Dan!And now to the album itself: not only is the content very good but this version of the album in mini-lp replica sleeve design is very good too. It very faithfully represents the original lp and includes a 12-page booklet with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese. The only gripe I have is that the cardboard is thin and so not as good quality as what I've seen elsewhere but still I guess I've seen worse. Most importantly for me though is the sound quality which has been remastered very well for a much improved sonic experience. If you are an audiophile, this will do justice to your expensive sound system.In terms of a showcase to the best of Dan Fogelberg's unique style, this is album certainly does that and is only surpassed by the magnificant ""Innocent Age"". Like any true classic, all the tracks have a nice flow and seem destined to be played in that order. There are no fillers on this baby and as a classic album should do you can only do true justice to this album by listening to it from start to finish.  Other than ""Longer"", other great tracks are ""Gypsy Wind"", ""Heart Hotels"" and ""Along the Road"".Highly recommended for fans of great music ala the way only Dan Fogelberg can play and definitely worth the ""upgrade""! For me, I'm just waiting with bated breath for a similar release of his first ""Greatest Hits"" album."
1,"'All American Boy' is one of the great lost albums of the 70s... so lost that a German company, Repetoire, had to do the remastering instead of Sony.They did a, well, read the review title. I heard instruments I never knew existed (for about 20 years I've been listening to a tape I made of the record). The sound is evenly balanced; no one decided to bring just the drums or guitars to the front. Overall there's a nice warmth to the sound.There's an informative boolet with a nice essay, lyrics and musician credits. There's also two bonus tracks, single versions of ""Teenage Love Affair"" and ""Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo.""As for the album, well anyone over 30 must at least know ""Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo"", which kicks off this album. Roaring guitar, charging drums, a great way to open any album!All the other songs are just as catchy, even the two instrumentals ""Joy Ride"" and ""Time Warp"".Rick plays the bulk of the instruments. He also gets assists from Edgar Winter, Joe Walsh, and Jean ""Toots"" Thielemans, who chips in some lovely harmonica on the gorgeous ""It's Raining."".His secret weapon though is drummer Bobby Caldwell (the ""What You Won't Do for Love"" guy? Don't know.). He doesn't so much keep the beat as use his kit as the lead instrument, battling Rick's guitars for supremacy.Kinda pricey, though. I was lucky in that someone gave me an amazon. gift certificate, so I blew most of it on this. I'd still have bought it even without the g.c. It's worth it!"
1,"This is the first cd from PE, one of the greatest rap groups of all time. I bought this album excpecting alot more then what i heard but i had heard &quot;nation of millions&quot; before listening to this and that if i hadnt heard that before this, it might have gotten a better rating. If you want to hear PE at there best, go pick up &quot;It takes a nation of millions to hold us back&quot;, on &quot;YO! bum rush the show&quot;, check out &quot;Public Enemy #1&quot;, and &quot;Megablast&quot;."
1,"STOP HATING ON R. KELLY!!! He achieved a lot during his prime for you so-called R. Kelly fans to back stab him like that  just for that sex scandal that probably wasn't true. Stop hating,stop lying, and shut yor f'n mouths for good."
1,"Shania Twain is really up there with the stars. From the first Track You`re Still The One , to Rock This Country  ! this really hit`s a nerve in me. There`s something in Shania Twain`s voice that tingled my feelings. Enough of that. Let`s move on to You`re still the One. This is a fine popsong, with a country feel to. Make hybrid music, make it so. Amen ! This is nearly a ""perfect match"" when it comes to voice/ music together.Track 2 When is a little let down, with not to much variations,but anyway an ok listen. Track 3 From this Moment is a little bit better, but not Shania Twain at her best. It`s veeery slowmoving, and doesn`t kicks your`e soul in gear, sorry to say. Anyway at Track 4 Black Eyes, Blue Tears, we are back in business again, with a more tempo up beat song. Track 5 I wont Leave you Lonley it`s an ok listen, but doesn`t give you a impact. Track 6 I`m holdin on to Love she start`s with the word`s Kick It, and kicks your`e soul in gear at once, with a realy treat when it comes to an earfilling and joyable hardtop fastback country rocker with the right ""yiaahaa"" . Track 7 Come on Over has much of the same quality, but here`s to little variations all trough the song.Track 8 You`ve got a way fittted well into the movie Notting Hill, but when it stand`s by it self is, sorry to say, a boring listning experience.  Track 9 Whatever you Do ! Dont !.Twain is better when she`s turn up the tempo. This one kicks some ass, but isn`t really up there. But at last the waitin` is over. The best of the best. Track 10. Man ! Feel like a woman ! This is Twain at here best. On this one she rules. This isa complete ""hit song""  who make`s woman the surperior race in a way. Anway the musical knock out makes me feel good all over, because every thing fit`s in a way. Man, this song is a really ""turn on"" for female and male, so to say.From here and further on is more or less uphill. Track 11 Love Get`s Me Every Time, has a drag along feel over it and a joyfull song. Track 12 Don`t Be Stupid (You Know I Love you) is cool enough with a fiddle touch fore a change. Track 13 That Don`t Impress Me Much (UK Dance Mix) . Nuff said before.I like the simple version better. Track 14 Honey. I`m home. Ok Track. Rythmic and danceable. Track 15 If you wanna touch Her, Ask ! it`s in the same league. Ok. Track 16. Shania Twain at here best. Rock/Country hybrid with fiddle and the whole rock and roll package. Anyway this is crossover pop/country music which really hits a nerve."
1,I enjoy his old stuff and new. his albums are great to have if you are a fan on his.
1,"this album did it for stevie; after a decade of inspired and inspiring songs, arrangements, melodies and lyrics, he totally sold out and offered a bland, awful, completely uninspiring product, and this continued throughout to this very day.Or did he? Well, this is partially true, except for one thing; Stevie was always about selling albums. Yes, he did it in an amazing, beautiful way, but stevie has always been a commercial artist. This album reflects that; he has become very interested in digital synths with this one. And, unfortunatley, he is not as creative with digital synths as he is with analogue. Not only that, but the album does not feature his great drumming either! It's all drum machines. A disaster?Well, the arrangements are sometimes a mess. Not quite a disaster, but this album doesn't live and breath like classic stevie. In the 70's, stevie would make a song on which he played every instrument live and breath like a real funk jam. Prince was someone who inherited this tendency from Stevie, but Stevie did it better. But on this album, his arrangements are not as ""living"" as before, and it's easily blameable on Stevie fully embracing digital technology. For this reason, this album sounds much more dated than his 70's albums; well, in a way, all albums are dated by their time period. But I could see somebody creating an album like, say, Talking Book today; it's sound is timeless. This album is very 80's.This is why this album loses one star; also, there are more weak songs on this one album (one or two) than all of Stevie's output in the seventies put together (zero). So, I can't help but see this as the beginning of Stevie's ""unimportance"" in music. Stevie has, or never will, have the impact on music he once had.So why four stars?! I spend this whole review bashing this album, but then I give it four stars; well my fellow Stevie fans, I give this album four stars because even if Stevie has lost his edge, importance, and arrangement creativity he still has one very important thing; his pure melodic ability. All of these songs are very very melodic and catchy (part time lover) or beautiful (overjoyed). Only one misstep; Apartheid (It's Wrong) was a stupid, dated mistake. I know Stevie couldn't resist doing his political commentary thing but it just doesn't work here.All in all, this is a very good album. But there is a reason I focused so strongly on the negatives. This is the beginning of the end for Stevie. He still has his wonderful melodic sense; it hadn't failed him at this point. Unfortunatley, however, Stevie's melodic ability begins slipping rapidly after this album, making his music very adult contemporary. Most fans shoudl stop here, proceed with caution after this."
1,"Heres a quick review of the songs:1.Flo: Nice and fast song. (5/5)2.Beer Goggles: I love this song, but later it was watered down and it's title was changed to ""Beer Gargles"" on the E.B.S. CD.

(1,000,000/5)12.Why don't we be friends: Pointless, but somehow entertaining. (2/5)This band rocks. So buy this album now.P.S. Oh-one more thing. And if anyone says that thes guys are ""NOT ska"", Then go see them in concert. I have a couple times, and they play some Kickass stuff."
1,"Jay-Z second album ""In My Lifetime, Vol 1"" (1997) is a solid release. I liked the way Hov used Scarface samples in his intros, he started this joint off on a good note with ""A Million and One Questions/Rhyme No More"", which benefits from some deadly premo production. Jay-Z then delivers a standout cut with ""The City Is Mine"", the Blackstreet hook, and the track beat is ill. The next two tracks fall under skip material for me, and then Hov drops some on point rhymes on ""Streets is Watching""- don't know why this was censored.  Jay-Z shows some heart on the laidback ""Lucky Me"", rhyming well backed by a smooth female chorus. The album then hits a low point for me, not feeling the next three tracks at all, find them to be weak in lyrics and production. Jay-Z picks things up again for two more standouts: ""Real N****z"" feat.  Too $hort and the albums closer ""You Must Love Me"". Its an artist gift and curse to deliver a classic, because later albums often get compared I won't lie though after ""Reasonable Doubt"" this was a disappointment for me, while there a number of standouts, there is also a lot of skip material. What I really missed was the consistency in production found on his first album, I wasn't interested in buying into Jay-Z claim of the throne being his, was bumping Big and Pac (and missing them big time) classics and wondering where Hip-Hop was going. 3.5."
1,"Michael Jackson's incredibly popular ""Thriller"" became to my generation the Beatles' ""Sgt. Pepper,"" just as MJ himself became our Beatles. Reviewing ""Thriller"" is like reviewing Elvis' best-of CD, or a Shakespeare collection. It is not easy, nor as useful, because for those who appreciate this genre, we already know it and love it. This album, if nothing else, is MJ's legacy, and is the starting point for all discussions about 80s pop music, MTV, videos and MJ's unusual career.It has earned the world's best-selling album of all-time not because one hit, or even two, or one blockbuster career-establishing hit. It established a new era of pop rock, pushing arena rock and dance rock into a new stratosphere. For me, six songs are favorites, but the rest are still very above average.Frankly, the interviews were interesting, but not so much that I want to listen to them over and over.Standout Tracks""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"" Driving home the refrain like a machine gun, Jackson starts this album with a statement that something was starting. An affair? A great album? Or, a wave that turned Michael from a pretty good entertainer to the ""King of Pop.""""The Girl Is Mine,"" is like receiving the torch from the previous king of pop, Paul McCartney, Michael sings a playful, flirtatious duet with Paul. The memorable line, ""I'm a lover, not a fighter,"" has since become part of Americana.""Thriller"" Funky. Now, it sounds so familiar that I forget how unusual it was in the day. The first few ominous notes tell the listener this is no ordinary radio song. Vincent Price plays off his creepy reputation as a movie ghoul while parodying bad rap to lift this song to that place beyond.""Beat It"" Two words: music video. Whatever music videos were before, ""Beat It"" took a fantastic dance tune and gave us the definition of videos for years.""Billie Jean"" Like ""Beat It,"" its video is par excellence. While Michael argues whether he is the parent, he cranks out moves that are still imitated, parodied and repeated in every club in the world.""P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)"" The rhythm plays in my head all these years later. It is that infectious.I fully recommend Michael Jackson's ""Thriller.""Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"
1,"Madman Across The Water (1971) is my favorite album of this amazing musician, or should I say...a pair of musicians. The name of Bernie Taupin has to be mentioned because the collaboration between these two stars made their songs so powerful and meaningful. Elton's amazing music was usually proceeded by Bernie's special lyrics at times providing us with a light poetic tone of mellow ballads and at others shining light upon some of our real struggles and worries. Perhaps their most powerful and deepest songs can be found on Elton John's second album from 1970, the one with his face silhouetted over the black cover and simply called Elton John. However, I find that album very uneven. I understand that someone not bothered by average rock'n'roll songs might find that album his best. For me this album Madman Across The Water provides the nicest balance of placing me in the atmosphere of his early songs, which I find much more ambitious and less pop, sustaining the most even feel throughout and distracting me the least by the rock'n'roll hits hard for me to digest. This album has a nice light tone to it. It is almost like some peace was found inside of someone's heart and mind after releasing the tension earlier. So many of his songs of this album and some of his later jewels as well have this airy disposition and when mixed with some of the darker more complex songs I find the combination quite breathtaking. Elton's musical career has delivered over 30 studio albums and close to 20 of various best of and live compilations. However, with a few exceptions, like Song For Guy, which is one of my favorite instrumental melodies of all times, most of my favorite songs of Elton John came from the early 1970s. Some of my favorite songs of Elton John are: Goodbye, First Episode At Hienton, Song For Guy, Seasons Reprise, Sixty Years On, Mood 3, It's Me That You Need, Your Song, I need You To Turn To, Tonight, Funeral For A Friend, The Greatest Discovery, Tiny Dancer, Madman Across The Water, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and Levon."
1,"This was their very first album, which debuted back in 1973 and celebrates it 40th anniversary this year. I found this one at Strawberries in April of 2011, and what a find it was! Steven describes the album as ""bare bones - it's just us and a guy playing sax on Mama Kin and that's it"", but that's all you need - the band and the music. If you're driving down the highway and you've got ""Walkin' The Dog"" CRANKIN', do like Steven Tyler says and ""Roll down the window, and let the world in on your little secret"". This is one album that is a must-have for every every Aero Addict out there. I don't care what people say -AEROSMITH is here to stay!"
1,"Innervisions is truly a project that was groovy. When I think about Innervisions, I think of drugs, life, and the world. When I was 5 years old, I listened to LP and it blew me away. The opening track, Too High was about drugs. The synthesized groove and percussions were just unquestionable great. Visions was about dreaming. I thought it was about living in a different time and place. It dazed me off a little. I remember when I came home from school. It was a rainy day. I listened to Living For The City and I was amazed about what was happening in my city. "" A boy is born in hard time Mississippi, surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty "". Golden Lady was just a lonely song. It's maybe one of my favorites. Higher Ground was just deep and funky. I loved the synthesized sound. Don't You Worry Bout A Thing is the best. It's one of my favorites too. The 3 songs I left out, were not my favorites on this album. This definitive album is Stevie's most mastered work. I'm happy I have it now 26 years later."
1,White Zombie remix.  Great song selection. Bad technically-sounds like it wa recorded in a coke can.  I'd rather listen to my full albums.
1,"one of the first scribblings i ever put out on amazon was a cry for somebody to remaster this great album. the original cd version had about as bad a sound quality to it that you can get. now that egregious error has been corrected. this masterpiece is finally available in a rich wonderful sound. and you even get liner notes and a bonus disc of a live performance done at a classic music festival broadcast on bbc 3 in 1970, the same year this album was recorded. soft machine took their name from a william burroughs novel, and nowhere else in their discography does that seem more appropriate than on this recording. the sounds here (which are an energetic fusion of avante-garde jazz and wildly creative rock) are completely iconoclastic in spirit, just as mr burroughs novels are in the world of literature. there is a pure vibrant joy of self-expression that blasts forth from this music. i can listen to it again and again and it always sounds new and fresh. soft machine made several excellent albums, but this is their best. a true masterpiece of cutting edge art."
1,If you like mellow and smooth up-beat tempo's with sweet hooks...this is it! This is a wonderfull CD. Had the tape now have the CD..if I can buy twice you can buy once. A non-disappointment!!:)
1,"Since her Rounder debut in 1987, Alison Krauss has been praised by critics and country music fans alike. Revitalizing traditional styles of country music including bluegrass, the singer and fiddler is the focus of much public attention. Her unique, yet firmly-rooted approach to country music has won her several Grammys. Her 1995 release, NOW THAT I'VE FOUND YOU, showcases her ability to shine in a variety of settings. The title track and &quot;Broadway&quot; find Krauss in a more pop country environment; however even her pop music is unique in its smart harmonic structure, and her ability to avoid pat or stock poetic devices. On &quot;Tonight I'll Be Lonely Too,&quot; Krauss and Union Station (her almost constant musical companions) switch to a decidedly bluegrass feel, and on &quot;When God Dips His Pen of Love In My Heart,&quot; she plunges into a Southern gospel style with help from the Cox Family. Alison Krauss has the remarkable ability to make these diverse musical directions seem logical and congruent."
1,"It's been a decade since this album was released and we can still hear several songs on the radio such as: ""another sand love song"" which was the first single of the album, was certified Gold in the US, won a Grammy award for ""best female pop vocal performance"" and became a #1 hit. The second single, ""breath again"" was also certified Gold, became also a #1 hit and won a Grammy award for ""best female pop vocal performance"" in 1994, the success of the song was so big that Toni also realesed this song in spanish, the tittle was ""respirar"", the third single ""seven whole days"" was also a hit, the song made it to the Top 10 as the fifth single ""you mean the world to me"", the sixth single which was ""how many ways"" was a Top 40. Thanks to this hit singles and the song that was part of the ""Boomerang"" soundtrack. That was Toni's first single (""love shoulda brought you home"").This album sold 10 million copies world-wide (was a #1 in The Billboard 200 for 2 weeks) and brought Toni the 1993 Grammy ""Best new artist"" and showed the world the new treasure that was in the music market.Actually I didn't buy this album when was realesed, I bought it in 1997 when Toni's album ""secrets"" was on its top and because I liked so much ""secrets"" I decided to buy this one and I know that ""secrets"" is the sequel of this album with very good lyrics.I can also say that this production was produced by hit singer/song writer/producer Babyface (""Waiting to exhale"", ""Boomerang"" between other soundtracks) and Antonio L.A Reid (producer of singers like Pink or Avril Lavigne).You won't be soory if you buy this album and besides, it's a classic.Good work Toni!!!."
1,"After leaving Motown, the former Jackson 5 moved on to Epic records and released several albums with moderate success.  The best of these is &quot;Triumph&quot; which features songs that previewed the rise of Michael  to superstardom.  Michael either wrote or co-wrote nine of the ten cuts  featured with older brother Jackie penning &quot;Your Ways.&quot;  The  songs bear the undeniable signature Michael Jackson-sound of the era.  Great tunes are &quot;Can You Feel It,&quot; &quot;Lovely One,&quot;  &quot;Heartbreak Hotel,&quot; and &quot;Time Waits for No one.A good  collection from a legendary group."
1,"Laura Nyro had three distinct periods in her career as a recording artist.  In the first era, spanning her first five albums, Laura gradually weened herself away from writing Top-40 mega-hits such as 'Wedding Bell Blues' and 'Eli's Comin', and topped the catalog with a cover-album of beloved songs that had influenced her own musical evolution.  In the second era, spanning the years 1976 to 1984, Laura released three studio albums and one live album, and found a diverse musical style  completely divorced from the confines of contemporary fare, although clearly influenced by the jazz interests of Joni Mitchell.  Another long hiatus would separate this era from her two final studio albums (one released poshumously in 2001) and a series of live releases that followed in the wake of her untimely death in 1997.'Smile' introduced us to the resurrected Laura Nyro, fresh from a three year absence from the recording studio.  While one would think Laura would be brimming with an abundance of new, classic material, this was not what Laura brought with her to Columbia Studios in New York.  While the title track and 'Money' perhaps possessed Top-40 potential, nothing from the disc ever emerged on the charts.  In fact, for all her genius as a composer and astounding vocal talent, Nyro never landed a Top-40 number of her own.  Predictably, what Laura did bring to the studio was diverse and difficult to pigeonhole into one or two genre's, and also limited in quantity as the disc only offers eight songs spanning just over 30 minutes.  Four of the songs run in the 5 minute range, and the remainder in the range of 3 minutes each.While there are no 'losers' on 'Smile', few of the songs, aside from 'Money' (which, unfortunatly, doesn't catch fire as the live version on 'Season of Lights' does) possess memorable melodies.  You won't find yourself singing along with much of this in the shower.  Nyro utilizes a different cast of backing musicians on each song, though John Tropea plays guitar on all of the tracks.  She makes extensive use of vibrant horns, alternating between sax, trumpet and flute, giving many of the songs a jazzy tone.  'Sexy Mama', which opens the disc with an energized mix of acoustic guitar and sax wrapped around Nyro's bouyant vocal delivery, is the only number not penned by Laura.  While handwritten lyrics are included in the liner notes, the words to 'Sexy Mama' are not offered (copyright issues no doubt).  Two short poems ('Autumn [Part 3]' and 'Woman In the Window') do appear in the liner notes, but unexplainably.There are 3 piano-based compositions that would qualify as blues-oriented, 'I Am the Blues', 'Stormy Love', and 'Midnight Blue', although each would have to be termed blues-lite.  Contrast them with 'The Cat Song', being every bit as cute and cuddly as you might expect, telling the tale of Eddie who ""sleeps with one eye open"".  Nothing is beyond being politicized, however, and even 'The Cat Song' includes the disclaimer that ""I'm not like you people, you wheel and war, and you whitewash your day away"".  The album also includes unexplained expressions of Oriental influences, such as the second track, 'Children of the Junks' with its Marxist allusions to ""comrads"" and ""red papers"", the koto introduction and coda on the title track, and even the Japanese-style lettering used in the cover art.  Nevertheless, 'Smile' is one of the least controversial of Nyro's releases, excepting her sexualized re-spelling of the word 'country' in the title track.It's hard to call 'Smile' a disappointment as the compositions are complex and challenging, and it's always a pleasure to hear Nyro's vocals rise above the task.  Nyro's previous work, however, had raised the bar above what is offered here, and Laura would have to cut something deeper and more compelling in the years to come.  'Nested' and 'Mother's Spiritual' were resounding answers to that call.  'Smile' was perhaps Laura's way of just letting everyone know that all was well with her, and that her musical career was back on track.  As with all of Nyro's studio work, 'Smile' is essential for down-and-dirty fans, but only a passing fancy for the casual observer."
1,"Listen to the opening lines of ""The Loved Ones"" and you hear Costello at his best. Snappy lines, sung with force and definitely dripping with caustic wit. Then we hit the piano ""noodling"" and the song starts to drift away from me. The CD is filled with moments like this; great lyrics and a solid melody often lost amidst overproduced musical adornments. Stripped down, this is some of Costello's best stuff; songs that walk the fine line between emotion and intellect. But every time I feel like I get close to the heart of the song, I feel lost in the middle of music that serves no purpose. This is definitely worth a listen and I still enjoy popping it in the machine, but I feel some of his other works is more deserving of the high praise given IMPERIAL BEDROOM."
1,"A little too mellow for my taste but listen closely for some great picking between them. There is a very funny duet called ""There'll Be Some Changes Made"" in which Chet wants to be a rock star so he can get money for nothing, etc. There are some great musicians such as Larrie Londin on drums, Steve Wariner on bass, Mark O'Connor on fiddle and mandolin and Vince Gill on vocals. Why is Dire Straits no more? Knopfler get tired of being a rock star? I miss them."
1,"I keep forgetting that this was Carole King's first album, mainly because I am rather enamored with the idea that &quot;Tapestry&quot; was the musical equivalent of Athena come out fully formed from the head of Zeus.  Of course, King had been one of the most successful songwriters in the business for over a decade, in partnership with her eventual husband Gerry Goffin.  Their songs were recorded by everybody from the Beatles, the Shirelles and the Monkees to Aretha Franklin and Little Eva (the couple's babysitter).  In 1970, after her marriage ended, she was encouraged by close friend James Taylor to make another attempt at a solo career with this album, &quot;Writer.&quot;  The result ends up being a false start, with King still searching for the style that would make &quot;Tapestry&quot; one of the most successful albums in the history of the known universe.  &quot;Writer&quot; offers up pop songs (&quot;No Easy Way Down&quot;), rock songs (&quot;I Can't Hear You No More&quot;), country songs (&quot;To Love&quot;), political songs (&quot;Eventually&quot;), and songs that defy categorization (&quot;Raspberry Jam&quot;).  The two stand out tracks on the album are her remake of  &quot;Up on the Roof&quot; and &quot;Goin' Back,&quot; which, not surprisingly, could have been right at home on &quot;Tapestry.&quot;  My hypothesis is that the difference between the two albums was that virtually all of the songs on &quot;Writer&quot; and Goffin-King compositions while &quot;Tapestry&quot; are solo compositions, albeit with a couple of superb covers of Goffin-King songs with &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow?&quot; and &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.&quot;  Ultimately, ""Writer"" ends up being more of historical interest, representing King's evolving effort to find herself as a performer.  Think of this album as the cocoon that held the ""Tapestry"" butterfly."
1,"The music on ""What's Going On"" is masterful and thesongs bleed together superbly.That comes to fruitation on thehit tital song ""Mercy,Mercy Me"" and ""Inner City Blues"".But thelyrics to those and every other song here are so sad,bleak anddepressing as to be mentally draining.Marvin goes into depth about the horrors of war,unemployment,police brutality,pollutionand hoplessness-themes not condusive to partying.""What's Going On"" can be taken two ways;one it's music is flowing,beautiful,imaginative and catchy but the lyrics (unless your born-againenough to appreciate it's message of salvation) seem utterlyhopeless,especially today seeing as many of the ills disgussedhere are all too prevelent today.""What's Going On"" is not apleasant album.I baught the deluxe edition hoping for a masterpiece but upon hearing it wanted to crawl under my bed.It's important to say these things but Marvin's message of hopeshould have been more inclusive for those who arn't harcorechristians.For those looking for a happy and/or sexual Marvin Gaye album this IS NOT the place to come.Be prepared!"

1,"This album is the best I own, and I own a ton!!  Michael is such a crafter of songs, such a magic-maker, and it is never more evident than on this cd.  He literally blows away ANYONE who might try to compete.  This cd is so diverse, without seeming schizophrenic.  He has songs that display a growing ferocity in his music, and then he has songs that just make you want to be his friend more than anything.  He is obviously one of the most influential singers of today.  Ask any male (and many female) singer who his influences are, and he'll be sure to say Michael Jackson.  This is because of such masterfully produced albums as this.  And don't think he's finished yet!  Michael has a new cd slated for release during the summer.  Prepare to be knocked flat on your back one more time..."
1,"...but my favorite of the Ramsey/EWF productions has gotta be the one after this called 'Don't it  Feel Good.' It was heavily Charles Stepney influenced, in fact, it was among the last of his great recordings. Does  anyone know where I can find 'Don't it Feel Good' by Ramsey Lewis?"
1,"i love paula abdul's forever your girl.  my favorite songs are knocked out, it's just the wan that you love me,forever your girl, straight up,cold hearted, and oppisittes attract.the songs are still good today,this album is worth hearing."
1,"There is always a day of reckoning. As the 1980's drew to a close, Don Henley's conscience cracked wide open, leaving no alternative but exorcizing the demons that dominiated from the mid-70's forward. This was the end of the innocence.The title track is an accomplishment in musicianship, but also a fine look at society's descent into shattered myths coupled with dreams destroyed. Great song for lying under a tree on a lazy summer day, wondering where it all went wrong."" I Won't Go Quietly"" is a fabulous duet with none other than Axl Rose. It seriously rocks. "" If Dirt Were Dollars"" is so direct the metaphors get lost. "" The Heart of the Matter"", the closing track, finds Henley melancholy, accepting equal parts sorrow and blame. It's an open invitation to put self aside in order to return some dignity.A little philosphical, a lot melodic, this continues to stay fresh, almost twenty years later."
1,"This was my introduction to Sinatra, thanks to the rave reviews it received from Downbeat critics and readers upon its release in the fifties.  It still holds up as Sinatra's best-balanced, most polished swing album,  the standard by which his later versions of the same songs can be compared.  This is not to say that the interpretations he gives here are the  definitive ones: some listeners may prefer later, looser versions of  &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin&quot; or &quot;Pennies from Heaven.&quot;  But  without this album it's pointless to judge the later versions--by  Sinatra or anyone else.  With this album Sinatra, more than any other male  vocalist, showed what distinguishes a jazz singer from a pop crooner."
1,"Mick Jagger and the boys gave Living Colour great support and had them on a road tour as the ""warm up"" act. Mick produced 'Glamour Boys'and 'Which Way To America?' as a matter of fact. ""Vivid"" is the debut album of this metal, rock, funk, R&B group that delivers a powerful message to be heard loud and clear (in more ways than one). Their best work IMO."
1,"In my opinion, this is Ted Nugent's last great album. ""State of Shock"" (1979) is the one since ""Double Live Gonzo"" I listen to most, but I won't take the time to argue its merits. ""If You Can't Lick 'Em"" (1988) is his only good album of the '80s. There's no excuse for the penny-dreadful songwriting of ""Intensities in Ten Cities"" (1981) or the disastrous ""Little Miss Dangerous"" (1986). He made a great comeback in 1995 with ""Spirit of the Wild,"" but the hooks lack that ear-friendly quality of his heyday. Nugent's two albums since then have been uniformly strong--with the emphasis on ""uniform,"" which doesn't really suit his persona, if you know what I mean.But I'm a fan. Nugent has a spirit, a straightforward sense of craftsmanship, and an energy level that I've always responded to, even if his ego sometimes blocks his vision and his politics tend more toward ignorance than insight.Tearing up the landscape, pumping bullets into earth and stream from a careening jeep (as he did on one of his TV shows), doesn't quite jibe with the message of either 'Great White Buffalo' or 'Fred Bear.' Pointing a gun at the consumer's face (the tray of ""Caveman"") isn't my idea of public relations. As an r&b-and-blues-based; guitarist, he could do with a bit more appreciation for black folk. Last, and least, I'd like to know what he meant when he said he was ""99% celibate"" during a tour while married.Yet he's more responsible with his guitar than with his mouth, and it's rare for a rock star to mention loving the voices of his children (the liner notes to ""Out of Control""). I certainly don't expect him to go gentle into that good, or any other, night. Given the wilderness of human behavior, though, he might surprise us all."
1,"He does it again.  His 5th album is yet another classic to add to his collection of many.  This man shows as he ages he still can rap, and rap good.  It has 3 classics, 1 song I skip, 1 that's ok and the rest are good or great.  Production is great and handled by a lot of people, Paris (4 songs), ant Banks, Ric Rock, and Ali Malek (2 songs each), and Hen gee, Payback, Mike Mosely each do a song and Femi O. co-produces on 2 tracks.  If he had airplay out here on the east coast I'd bet he'd have many multi-platinum plaques on his wall. That's what's wrong with rap, hardly any of the good rappers sell.  All th fake a*s pu*sy's sell the most.  If you wanna hear some real rap from a real cat who's been in the game puttin out albums since '88 check out Spice 1.

1,"This Issac Hayes set seems to flow flawlessly between songs.  Although, in my opinion, not one of his better releases, he still stays true with the funk.  His covers of &quot;Never Can Say Goodbye&quot;, &quot;(They Long To Be) Close to You&quot;, and &quot;Going in Circles&quot; are excellent productions, giving them a much more sophisticated sound.  I would add this CD to your collection."
1,"The Brown Album was a return to form for Primus after their previous uneven album Tales From The Punchbowl. The songs are more immediate here, concentrating more on simpler riffs rather than the complicated bass lines from their previous albums. The songs are also shorter and their pattern of having at least one track over 8 minutes per album is not found here. This is also the first album where they sound like a band rather than a showcase for bassist extraordinare Les Claypool.There are several great tracks here and the ones that work best such as &quot;Shake Hands With Beef&quot;, &quot;Fisticuffs&quot;, &quot;Restin' Bones&quot;, and &quot;Bob's Party Time Lounge&quot; are dominated by simple heavy riffs that are in your face. Whereas on previous albums, Larry Lalonde's guitar work was pretty restrained, he seems to be given free rein on tracks like &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, &quot;Kalamazoo&quot;, and &quot;Coddingtown&quot; which are carried by his aggressive riffing. While Claypool's bass work is kept in check somewhat here, his quirky vocals and unique brand of humor are still present on &quot;The Chastising Of Renegade&quot;, &quot;Puddin' Taine&quot;, and &quot;The Return of Sathington Willoughby.&quot; Other strong tracks include &quot;Over The Falls&quot;, &quot;Hats Off&quot;, and &quot;Arnie.&quot; There are no weak tracks here and &quot;Shake Hands With Beef&quot;, &quot;Fisticuffs&quot;, and &quot;Restin' Bones&quot; are among their best work. A very strong album, albeit not quite on the same level as Sailing The Seas Of Cheese and Pork Soda."
1,"Rage is the loudest, most powerful, and probably the best band from the 90's.  They are known for their extreme left-leaning political views, which means that about half of America will probably hate them.  But for the rest of us, the band backing zack (he's alright, even if he acted like an idiot and broke up the band!) is one of the most tight and strong bands in all of rock.  Just listen to Tom Morello's insane wizardry DJ scratching guitar riffs or Brad Wilks out of it drumming or  (my favorite) Timmy C's beyond funky bass (it really projects more than that of other modern bass players, except maybe Les Claypool).This is all of the protest in rock and roll funneled into one band, and boy does it kick butt.  Every song on this album rocks (except I could do without maynard keenan's vocals on that one song).  It puts the pathetic imitators like Korn and Papa Roach beyond shame.  It makes them seem oblivious.  You absolutely cannot miss out on the most powerful band ever with one of the best guitarists, and this is where you should start.  Get all of their albums, every single one is rokkin.  I think that every listen will prompt you to jump in the air in amazement."
1,"First released in early Summer of 1979, featured more of a disco influence and was the first of the band's albums to be a quartet with no violin or cello players in the band. Jeff had jettisoned Mik, Hugh and Melvyn before the recording sessions although they do appear in the videos.  The strings on here were added with an orchestra conducted by Louis Clark. Incidentally, for anyone else who happens to dig Everybody Loves Raymond, that's Brad Garrett dressed up on the back cover in one of his first jobs.The album opens with the heavy beat of the disco influenced Shine A Little Love complete with some cool guitar fills. Confusion turns down the disco groove with a catchy melody and some cool keyboard work. Need Her Love has always reminded me of The Beatles' Something. The Diary Of Horace Wimp is quite an unusual song. The second half starts off with another heavily disco influenced number called Last Train To London. Midnight Blue is a nice ballad while On The Run really picks up the pace and reminds me of an ELO song from an earlier time. On the other hand, Wishing sounds very 1979 but in a good way. Don't Bring Me Down closed the album in a rocking groove and ended up becoming the biggest hit on the album. The bonus songs are made up of two short fragments of demos and a cool cover of Del Shannon's Little Town Flirt."
1,"The SACD 5.1 mix makes an excellent CD even better. Clarity, seperation and multi-channel defintion are all excellent. I noticed that some of the songs are extended versions of the original releases. Not having listened to this cd for many years in previous forms one other thing struck me. That being the only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star classic is the material on the 2nd side (at least what would be the 2nd side of the original LP) is noticeably weaker than side 1. Never hear anyone mention this, but if you think about it, its hard to argue that point. You could say its partly because of how incredible side 1 is and I would not dispute that point. Just makes me realize why back in the LP days I always found myself listening to side 1 more than side 2. None of this detracts from the overall excellence of this CD and even if it only contained side 1 it would still be a near classic. I'd say a solid 3 songs on this CD belong in the top 10 all time Elton John songs. That in itself is plenty good enough even if the lesser material seems a bit like filler in comparison."
1,Who can not like Kansas. Such a great group. Every song is a winner. Excellent music. Moden music could never compare.
1,"Though it failed to reach the Top Ten on the Hot 200 (it peaked at still respectable #20), MR. SMITH achieved Double-Platinum status in sales and ended up becoming LL Cool J's best-selling album.  Three Top Ten hits were scored from this record alone, the most from any of LL's albums.  The wistful Boyz II Men duet ""Hey Lover"" (#3 Pop, #3 R&B;, #1 Rap), the delightfully raunchy ""Doin' It"" (#9 Pop, #7 R&B;, #2 Rap), and the seductive ""Loungin'"" (#3 Pop, #4 R&B;, #1 Rap) were all over both urban and pop radio all throughout `95 and `96, and they still hold up as three of LL's sensual best.Aside from the hits, MR. SMITH finds LL at his best on the sexy jams ""Make It Hot"" and ""God Bless,"" and the autobiographical cuts ""Hip Hop"" (a nostalgic homage to his craft, mentors, and peers) and ""Hollis To Hollywood"" (a parable detailing his accent to fame).  The album only stumbles during it's midsection, in which LL attempts to be hardcore on ""Life As . . .,"" ""I Shot Ya,"" and the title track, none of which works.  LL may not be a credible gangsta, but as long as he sticks to the sexy hip-pop he does best, MR. SMITH is quite entertaining."
1,"I wish Nick would have a longer career and a longer life.Bryter Layter it`s indeed a fantastic album, you don`t have to skip a single song each one is so emotionally charged and intense, in comparison to pink moon and five leafs left this album features a fantastic band following Nick`s chords at its best It`s hard to tell which song is my favorite in this album cause I Love them all. I own Nicks complete discography but this album to me is something really special. If I would have to recommend an entry to new fans this album will be it.The beauty about Nicks music is that even while he was clearly depressed all songs leave to your own interpretation, it`s like a living soundtrack on your own life, you will find comfort on those velvet chords and acoustic strumming paterns while listening to his beautiful voice.My recommendations:Really get them all!!Bryter LayterFive Leaves LeftPink Moon(this were the only three albums released by Nick, Five leaves left was the first but he was unnoticed at the timem gorgeous album!! he went somehow notticed and gaining a following cult with Bryter Layter and consumed his own with Pink moon. A 4th album appeared later with 4 tracks that were going to be part of his 4th studio album that never happened plus a few other takes on tap, this album is Time of no reply.Worth it!"
1,"If you were in a teenager anywhere from 1977 to 1980 you were probably an ABBA fan.  I listened to their records over and over again and never got tired of them.  And I still enjoy hearing those songs, not only do they  bring back memories, some of them are truly timeless.  S.O.S. has always  been one of my personal favorites and it makes me want to sing every time I  hear it.These songs have been recorded by a slew of artists over the  years, but none of them can hold a candle to the originals.  Their  harmonies were as perfect and as carefully constructed as The Mamas And  Papas back in the 60's.  If you like ABBA, this is the best collection to  have.  It contains the best songs off of their albums."
1,"What can possibly be said about the amazing Michael Jackson album &quot;Off The Wall?&quot;  This album is amazing.  This is the album that kicked off one of the most impressive solo careers ever in history.  On this NEW &quot;Special Edition&quot; CD you will hear songs like &quot;Don't Stop Till You Get Enough&quot; &quot;Rock With You&quot; and &quot;She's Out Of My Life!&quot;  This record is all fun!  The special edition CD includes an interview with Quincy Jones about the recording of this masterpiece, as well as the ORIGINAL DEMO RECORDINGS of &quot;Don't Stop Till You Get Enough&quot; and &quot;Workin Day And Night!&quot;  These demos have NEVER been heard before, and is a must have for any fan of Michael, or pop music in general."
1,"When I first heard ""Rage..."" I had never heard anything quite like it except that it sounded to me like an intelligent mixture of Black Sabbath, Public Enemy and Led Zeppelin but even then, the originality of the pure hate and rageful vocals got me rivetted. These guys sounded like they really gave a hoot about the topics of all their tracks and in that way was reminiscent of Punk's the Sex Pistols and The Clash and yet despite all these comparisons, the band still managed to get their own signature sound. They are also great musicians and to think that all that great sound effects on the cd came just from Morello's guitar! The rhythm section is extremely tight and the vocalist is excellent. This is one great hard rock album and the strongest tracks are ""Killing..."" and my favourite, made famous by the Matrix soundtrack is ""Wake Up"". Another truly amazing thing about this disc is the production. Not only are these guys great songwriters and musicians but they produced this album too!This version of the album is a real treat for fans as the mini-lp replica design a.k.a. mlps format is quite well done.  Even the inner sleeve is a very faithful replica of the original lp and a glossy 8 page booklet with all the English lyrics and another non-glossy 30 page booklet with all the lyrics in Japanese is included together with an essay in that language too.  The sound quality is excellent too. Excellent tracks, great sound quality, highly recommended!"
1,"This is the best Heatwave album !!  The Groove Line is a classic dance tune, which helped start the &quot;chanting&quot; at parties. Star of a Story is one of the hidden gems on any recording. It's use of Johnnie  Wilders vocals with an eerie string section made for a memorable ballad.  The Wilder brothers vocals, combined with Rod Temperton's song-writing  produced one of the most complete CD's."
1,This is some of Michael Jackson's finest music. Some slower and some faster more rhythmic songs. You will enjoy adding this CD to your musical CD collection. I highly recommend this CD!
1,"this is the one everyone will answer when you ask....what is your favorite pac album? soon as the needle hits the vinyl you know why. why is because this one is not only timeless but a seemless/timeless classic. right from the get go you know this aint no made up bull, this is pac thinkin out loud and you all lucky enough to overhear.lots of controversy behind this one but thats all easily undone as soon as the platter starts spinnin. this one has to bought on vinyl the silence is creepily quiet when its supposed to be, you gonna be taken on a vinyl trip you wont forget, you just want to play it again after it's over, the mastering on this vinyl version blows away the cd version. the improved low end of the vinyl process really brings in pacs low voice so smooth and in charge. the high end is where it belongs with perfectly blended mid's, this vinyl is truly unreal, get a copy before it slips out of print."
0,"Seriously, folks...this band SUCKS! Every one of these hits (Dancing Queen, Sugar Sugar, Mamma Mia, Take a Chance on Me) is dated, sugary, and awful as awful gets. How they scored any hits whatsoever is beyond me. KEEP AWAY!!!!!!!!"
1,"When I walked into The Gramophone in San Francisco that February 1976, I was instantly mesmerized by the cover. I couldn't believe it was her. Motown must have kept the art under wraps before astounding the world with its beauty. ""Theme from ""Mahogany"" was in its 5th month on the charts after hitting #1 for two weeks. Motown then released the gorgeous, possibly even stronger ""I Thought it Took a Little Time"" Michael Masser ballad. It began its leaps and bounds up the Hot 100 when Motown got word that the 5th Deminsion was releasing a competing version of the money-cut, ""Love Hangover"". This caused a shift in gears. Motown readied ""Love Hangover"" for it's domestic release. They didn't completely abandon ""I Thought it Took a Little Time"". They guided that beautiful song to the Top 5 Adult Contemporary Billboard charts.""The Black Album"" how it came to be known by Diana fans, was one of the most striking album covers ever released. (It eventually won ""The Most Beautiful Album Cover"" by the Italian fan club ). ""Love Hangover"" captured the essence of Victor Skrebeneski back cover art. Hot! Hot! Hot! But back to the fate of one of my favorite songs. A mere 4 years later, Diana would be one of the first artists since The Beatles to place 2 or 3 singles in the Top 10 at the same time. In fact, ""The Black Album"" would be a landmark by being one of the rare albums to have 4 hit singles. (Diana had achieved that goal as early as ""Where Did Our Love Go"" with The Supremes). Had Motown kept the fate, I still believe that ""I Thought it Took a Little Time"" would have been a bigger pop hit.Diana was also riding high with her critical and commercial smash ""An Evening with Diana Ross"" tour. It gave ""Love Hangover"" a special showcase in the show where Diana would invite the audience on stage to dance invoking a big disco party. The success of the tour dictated that another single be released in the form of a remixed ""One Love in My Lifetime"". While it was another Top 25 hit, I thought her version of ""Smile"" had single potential.The first side of the album was the strongest. Side 2 featured another Diana produced track in her cover of Rufus' ""Ain't Nothing But a Maybe"". Both the charming ""Kiss Me Now"" and ""You're Good My Child"" had that tin pan alley feel to them.....cute and novel. ""The Black Album"" would have been greater had the last 4-5 songs were as daring as the first 4-5 songs like the revolutionary, ""Love Hangover"".  The last half was a little too safe. However, the album still was a multi-million seller and a Grammy nominated affair.To this day, the album art remains iconic, ""Theme from ""Mahogany"" is heard the world over and ""Love Hangover"" raised the bar in the world of grand diva dance records! RATED: 4 stars out of 5.However, this Expanded Edition is a tad disappointing. There are no less than 3 alternate versions of most of the songson the original album.  In my initial listenings, not one of the mixes stood out enough that I did not feel compelled to repeat any of them. Of the new tracks,  her take on Elton John's ""Harmony"" is the most endearing. ""Harmony"" is the final song on Elton's ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" album, an album that became the dividing point in my love of Elton's music. ""Le Lo LI"" is a fun, rhythmic pop track that she sounds delightful in. The Sly Stone produced ""Go Where Your Mind Is"" is different. The music track and chorus are the most memorable. But you would be hard press to identify it as a Sly Stone song upon initial listening. The closing interview is a great time capsule. So this Expanded Edition isn't as rich with unfounded material as the previous releases."
1,"You will either love his voice or hate it. I love it. Very hypnotic. I love Sweet Home Chicago. Many rock groups have covered his songs, Clapton, Led Zeppelin. This is a great collection. The guitar licks are amazing - this guy is another Stevie Ray Vaughn (or maybe it is the other way around...)."
1,"E.L.O.'s 6th studio release &quot;A NEW WORLD RECORD&quot; is one of my top 10 records of all-time, just great classic pop hooks everywhere on this disc. There is not a weak track among the 9 songs. This is Jeff Lynne at  his peak period 1973-1978.  He is still a great producer and performer.  2  things to get off my chest. How can the rock'n'roll hallof fame keep  overlooking this group, and keep pickin' lesser talents every year!  2. Hey  maybe Sony can remaster the ELO catalog some day with extra tracks. By the  way at this price this is a steal."
1,"Goldie's Timeless CD is a CD I was given for my birthday this year. As a fan of Drum &amp; Bass, Jungle, and other forms of Electronica, I wasn't displeased. This is quite the album. It defines the genre of music, literally. Goldie proves there are no boundaries and no rules to follow. It all flows nicely. The 21 minute mini masterpiece &quot;Timeless&quot; which features 3 tracks i. Inner City Life ii. Pressure and iii. Jah is just the beginning of the icing on this cake. The other seven tracks are part of this journey and compliment each other quite well. Each track is distinct, yet not too different. &quot;Saint Angel&quot; &quot;Sensual&quot; &quot;Kemistry&quot; and &quot;Sea of Tears&quot; are other highlights, although I assure you there are no bad tracks on this cd! This is a nice buy, especially for fans of Drum &amp; Bass and Jungle, which he pretty much began with this cd. You'll see why its such a must have once you listen to it!"
1,"Rock Of The Westies was Elton John's second album released in 1975, about six months after his concept album, Captain Fantastic &amp; The Brown Dirt Cowboy.  The album often suffers as it is directly compared to that ambitious release.  While it is not quite on that level, it is still a first rate effort from Mr. John.  The album has a harder edge than most of his other albums and guitarist Davey Johnston lets loose all over the album.  There's a new band line-up for the album as old friend Caleb Quaye rejoins (with others coming aboard as well) and long time members, Dee Murray and Nigel Olssen depart.  &quot;Dan Dare&quot; packs a punch while the number one hit &quot;Island Girl&quot; adds a little tropical flavor. &quot;Grow Some Funk Of Your Own&quot; is one of Mr. John's angriest songs with a Mexican flair.  &quot;I Feel A Bullet (In The Gun of Robert Ford)&quot; slows the pace down and is a pensive, longing and pretty song.  Rock Of The Westies continued his winning streak by becoming his seventh consecutive number one album and his second straight to debut at number one.  But like all good things, his number one album streak ended here.  In fact, Elton John has yet to return to the top of the album charts since."
1,"Michael Jackson has truely always been a joke, when I've been around. Truthfully he's never been popular since was a toddler and now im in college. So im not a huge mega fan like some people.(actually care more for Jermaine and janet they produce really good soul music).As for Bad, it's got great pop beats, everybody heard the songs a million times, and he's got a great message. Dirty Diana definately an intersting song. As for, the way you make me feel. I think he was truely at his peak of normalness, while making this album. How could you not like this music, it's really good."
1,"Review no. 97. This self-titled effort was, of course Asia's classic debut album, hitting the streets in 1982. So nice to hear it on CD reissue. Asia was never one of my favorite bands from the '80's but I could never resist putting on this record {or disc} and listening to it all the way through. I mean, EVEN if you don't personally care for progressive album rock, no one can argue that this work showed just what four already-accomplished musicians were fully capable of. So many great INSTANT recognizable tracks to thoroughly take in here, there's no need to list them all. Would love to catch their reunion tour at some point. If I remember correctly, Asia appealed to most fans of bands like Marillion, Jethro Tull, Utopia, Moody Blues, Alan Parsons, etc. A must-have."
1,"This is a very nice CD.  It has more of a feel of a Miles CD than some of  Cannonball's other work (my favorite CD is &quot;Live in San Fran&quot;.  Like the other reviewers, the CD is worth buying for &quot;Autumn  Leaves&quot; and &quot;Love for Sale&quot;."
1,"Here we have what is probably Sonny Rollins' most popular album, although I do believe he has much better music on other records, such as G-MAN and THE BRIDGE.  However, SAXOPHONE COLOSSUS still measures up to all the hype it receives.  This limited edition remaster sounds great and up-to-date, even though it was recorded in 1956!The group is a quartet made up of Rollins (tenor sax), Tommy Flanagan (piano), Doug Watkins (bass), and the genius that is Max Roach (drums).  Roach is undoubtedly one of, if not the greatest jazz drummer of all time.  Name a musician, and he's probably played with them at some point in time.  The presence of Roach is a defining element that brings the quality of the performance up a few notches.'St. Thomas,' named after the island Rollins is from, is probably the most popular track.  It's a simple song that shapes the whole album with the smooth flowing tenor playing of Mr. Rollins and the syncopated, carribean influenced percussion and drums from Max Roach.  I actually listened to this track when I was visiting St. Thomas last summer, and the mood of the song fits with the beauty of the islandMy favorite track here is 'Strode Rode,' because I'm a sucker for hard swinging be-bop.  It reminds me of the Rollins tune, 'Airegin,' which can be found on COOKIN' WITH THE MILES DAVIS QUINTET and BAGS GROOVE.  This track includes a masterful solo by Flanagan - his shining moment on the record.We also have two standards in 'You Don't Know What Love Is' and 'Moritat,' which is the popular 'Mac The Knife' without the words.  I prefer this much better than 'Mac the Knife' because of the outstanding performance by this quartet.If you are new to the world of jazz, this is a great place to start, and I would recommend it alongside records like KIND OF BLUE and GIANT STEPS."
1,"Elton John and partner Bernie Taupin made a wise move not following up their masterwork ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" with another ambitious double album, since they would have fallen flat on their face, since nothing they did can compare to ""GBYBR"" (with the exception of 1975's ""Captain Fantastic And The Browndirt Cowboy""). Instead, the next album, ""Caribou"", was a return to the simpler, more mainstream ""Caribou"". Despite getting mixed reviews from critics, the album continued Elton's string of number one albums and yielded two top ten hits.While this album has its share of weak tracks (""Stinker""), some of Elton's best stuff is on ""Caribou"". ""Pinky"" is one of Captain Fantastic's finest ballads, with a brilliantly understated vocal and a simple yet spellbinging arrangement. The rollicking ""Grimsby"" is a downhome rocker driven by Davey Johnstone's guitar prowess and the strong rhythm section of Nigel Olsson and Dee Murray. I should probably take the time out to mention that this trio is possibly the best group of backing musicians for any artists, and it's a shame the three never collaborated as their own album, which would gave been awesome. Anyway, back to the album. ""I've Seen The Saucers"" is a song about UFO sightings. The idea of the song is rather stupid, but the sinister arrangement keeps it aloft. ""Solar Prestige A Gammon"" is a good tune but only if you don't take it seriously. ""You're So Static"" is a tongue in cheek  denouncement of NYC that is good but the live version on ""Here And There"" is much better. ""Ticking"" is an absolute masterpiece. I can't really think of any words to describe this song. But when I saw Elton at Madison Square Garden in 1999, he did a haunting version of this song. I was breathless.Then there's the album's two hit singles.""The Bitch Is Back"" is a tongue in cheek rocker that was abnned by many radio stations but still became a massive hit, reaching number four on the Hot 100 and remaining a radio staple. Then, there's ""Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me"". Wow, what to say about this. This may well be the best song Elton ever did, and without a doubt one of the finest pop singles ever released. This is truly a moment of absolute perfection, from its chilling piano intro to its triumphant outtro.The bonus tracks are excellent additions to this already strong album. ""Pinball Wizard"" is indeed a cover of the 1969 classic by The Who, and to be honest, (and I know I will be blasted for this over and over), Elton's version is so much better. It is so energetic and fun. ""Sick City"" is somewhat of a novelty number but is can be taken seriously and is overall a very good track. ""Cold Highway"" is a midtempo tribute to a friend of Elton and Bernie who was killed in a car accident. Closing out this remastered edition of the album is Elton's holiday standard ""Step Into Christmas"". It's a Christmas song, but can be enjoyed all year round.Ovverall, ""Caribou"" is definitely not as strong as ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"", and is definitely worth owning. I say that you shouldn't listen to all the reviews (maybe not even mine) and see for yourself just how good you might find this album."
1,"COPPERHEAD ROAD is the best album ever by Steve Earle, blending influences from such artists as Johnny Cash, the Charlie Daniels Band, Waylon Jennings, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Willie Nelson, the Marshall Tucker Band, Tompall Glaser, the Outlaws, Billy Joe Shaver, Creedence Clearwater Revival, the Band, and the Allman  Brothers Band circa BROTHERS AND SISTERS with a touch of alternative attitude, creating the best country-rock sound this side of the 70s Southern Rock boom. The songs on side one are a loose suite based on the experiences of Vietnam veterans during and after the war, with several lines in the title track being so cautionary about the dangers of going where you shouldn't be that they inspire me to look at pictures of pretty actresses as a deterrent against hanging out on the wrong side of the city where I currently live (Kingston, NY). Earle's belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia on drug-smuggling charges was unjustly convicted makes this an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
1,"Simon and Garfunkel's first ""folk rock"" album from early 1966 is an essential purchase. This does not mean that the duo didn't improve considerably during the rest of the sixties. Still, the moody excitement is here, starting with the classic hit rocked-up version of ""Sounds of Silence"" and the catchy ""I Am a Rock."" Simon's guitar playing is excellent throughout, as are Garfunkel's evocative tenor harmonies. True, some of the lyrics on this album seem immature and self-conscious compared to Simon's later work; often they are depressing and lonely. But darnit, these are some *good songs* - ""Kathy's Song"" and ""April Come She Will"" remain achingly poignant after all these years, and the hurried tempo and bright harpsichord of ""Leaves That Are Green"" drive home its message of youth and loss memorably. ""Blues Run the Game"" is a superb lost classic that had been added as a bonus track. (You will also find this track on the box set ""Old Friends."") The other bonus tracks on this CD version are from a later time (1970), and mostly consist of sloppy run-throughs of folk standards. They are none too memorable, but the album itself is."
1,"The opening cut of this first of several concept albums released by the Moody Blues in rapid fire succession tells it all, a provocative,  thoughtful, and intellectually fascinating exploration of altered states of  consciousness, and a particular focus on the eastern idea of being. This  exploration is a quite self-conscious attempt to use the experimental  fusion between mainstream rock music and eastern forms started by the  Beatles, and no one carried off the exploration with more panache and style  than the Moody Blues, who, to their great distress, quickly became a kind  of cult force in popular culture, making them pop icons overnight.This  is an intriguing album, and a valuable introduction for the uninitiated to  the wild range of talents and interests of the various members of the band,  and is a showcase for their musical virtuosity. From the opening mysterious  number introducing the concept to the quick transition to &quot;Ride My  Seesaw&quot;, this is a fast-paced tour of the wide range of the field of  psychedelic exploration. &quot;&quot;Legend Of A Mind&quot; is an ironic  look at Timothy Leary and his public advocacy of LSD, laughing at the idea  while at the same time exploring it in earnest (He'll take you on a trip  across the bay.... and bring you back the same day...).  ""House of Four  Doors"" is an introduction to ""Zen' proper, and to the uniquely eastern  ideas of altered states of consciousness and being. ""Legend Of A Mind"" is a  further exposition of Leary and the popular search for consciousness.The  rest of the album focuses increasingly on aspects of the eastern way of  perceiving and interpreting reality, and they conduct this exploration  within the margins of popular music quite provocatively and very  entertainingly. This part of the album is my favorite, especially the  evocative ""Voices In The Sky"", although I also really like ""Visions of  Paradise"", ""Om"", and ""The Word"" as well. This is classic Moody Blues  material, and they mine this genre in a way uniquely their own. I would  start with this album, and work my way deliciously through ""On The  Threshold Of A Dream"", ""To Our Childrens' Childrens' Children"", and finally  to ""A Question Of Balance"", which comprises the real close of this phase of  their concept album series. All of them are thoughtful, artistically well  expressed, and a timeless celebration of what it means to be human. I  highly recommend all their albums. Enjoy!"
1,"...the concept album &quot;Fantasy&quot;, where the singer/ composer &quot;steps outside herself&quot; and &quot;becomes someone else&quot;. It grabs you at &quot;You've Been Around Too Long&quot; and by the time it  gets to the jam &quot;That's How Things Go Down&quot;--ie, being pregnant  by a no-goodnik--and the ain't no love in the heart of the city cut,  &quot;Heywood&quot;, you are totally mesmerised by King's vocals, her  storytelling, her piano playing and the orchestrations. In fact, with a  little tweaking here and there, &quot;Welfare Symphony&quot; and  &quot;Believe In Humanity&quot; could have easily fit in Marvin Gaye's  &quot;Inner City Blues&quot; era repertoire..and I know the purists are  gonna grill me for that last statement. King's &quot;Tapestry&quot; is her  magnum opus, but the earth mother always has put out great, great music.  This, I believe, is one of her best..."
1,"After the mega-hit &quot;The Stranger&quot;, which spawned hit after hit, Billy Joel released &quot;52nd Street&quot;.  It's a solid album, and essential for fans of the Piano Man, even if it's not quite up to the standards he raised for himself with &quot;The Stranger&quot;.The album opens with it's top three songs, &quot;Big Shot&quot;, &quot;Honesty&quot;, which is easily one of his most meaningful songs, and &quot;My Life&quot;.  Other standout songs include &quot;Stiletto&quot;, &quot;Rosalinda's Eyes&quot;, and the title track, but to be entirely honest (no pun intended) the album tends to taper off a bit after an incredible start. (hence 4 stars and not 5)Still, a B+ album from Billy Joel is still going to contain some great music, and &quot;52nd Street&quot; is no exception.  There's more here than music for die hard fans, and the Piano Man continues to please."
1,"The Jam's Sound Affects is the band's fifth album as well as their most successful. Quite simply, this is a near perfect release where everything works, flawlessly. The album is also very well produced as Bruce Foxton's bass is provided equal footing with Paul Weller's guitar and Rick Buckler's drums. It is a melting pot of moods and styles as aggression and working class lyrics are on level with great hooks, strong melodies, and a dose of R&B. The opener ""Pretty Green"" is both catchy and aggressive, carried by Foxton's bassline while ""Monday"" is a beautiful melodic love song with great harmonies. ""But I'm Different Now"" is a joyous power pop song that features breaks you don't hear coming while ""Set The House Ablaze"" recalls the band's fiery punk roots. The most popular tracks follow with the Beatles inspired ""Start"" and the excellent acoustic track ""That's Entertainment"", whose lyrics paint a picture of England. The eclecticism continues as ""Boy About Town"" is more great power pop with splashes of horns and ""Dream Time"" starts out psychedelic before becoming a Who-like rocker. ""Music for the Last Couple"" is another great track that would have worked even without its sparse lyrics. Rounding out the album is the sweet melodic ""Man in the Corner Shop"" and the harsh and gripping ""Scrape Away."" All told, there is not even a bad moment on Sound Affects. I would put this on par with the best work of The Beatles, The Who, The Clash, or The Police. It's that good. Highly recommended."
1,"Alice Cooper has been an American icon for decades, and just about everybody knows him by sight! This 1989 album still sounds so excellent after all these years! It has a great mix of tunes, all of which are great to listen to. My favorites are definitely Hell Is Living Without You, Trash and Bed Of Nails, but they are all good. What can I say? It's a great album, and I love it!"
0,"i just can't believe how this band ripped me off. many people and the band themselves claimed to be 'hair metal'. nothing could be further from the truth. it would be impossible to call these guys rock, let alone metal. just because they dressed like motley crue and poison didn't mean they could ever amount to what the previous bands had. these square idiots predented to be heavy metal just to cash in on the late-80's hair metal movement. stay away from this piece of fake rock. a word of warning: THIS IS POP, NOT ROCK."
1,"El Debarge and family laid some of the best smoothed out R & B of all time. Stay with Me, All this Love, I like it, A Dream, Time will Reveal(One their best Songs), Love me in a special way, and pretty much the rest of this greatest hits collection is a must have for any music lover."
1,"WHAT IS THE BEST BOB DYLAN ALBUM? THAT IS AN IMPOSSIBLE QUESTION TO ANSWER, 'CAUSE THE MAN IS A POET AND HE HAS WRITTEN SO MUCH GREAT MUSIC. BUT ""BLOOD ON THE TRACKS"" IS A HEARTFELT EFFORT, TRULY INSPIRED. AFTER KIND OF FALLING OFF THE MAP FOR AWHILE, DYLAN CAME OUT WITH THIS GREAT OFFERING IN THE MID 70'S. HE SEEMS TO HAVE REDISCOVERED HIMSELF ON THIS ALBUM. IT'S GREAT FROM BEGINNING TO END. ESSENTIAL BOB DYLAN RECORDING."
1,"One Of the Best. People knock him for his own vernacular, his style, But he's A Mack, E-40 40 FONZ, ... MY FAVORITE ON THIS CD is Million Dollar Spot with His Cousin B-LEGIT , And Homie 'Pac. My first 40' cd.  I appreciate the songs, especially his heartbreaking some things will never change which sounds just like pacs changes. I also love his Diss against Rasheed Wallace. (who hated on him). Good Music."
1,"Some people will say Nas's ""Illmatic"" is the best hip-hop album, or NWA, or something along that line. Even though those were good albums and raised the game up for its time - Nothing has made a more serious change to the rap game then this album here.But you know why this album is special? Because it can't be copied. No other raper has tried to in ANY way reproduce/copy/expand anthing in this album. Because they can't. Not even Nas, Jay-Z, Eminem.. no rapper can even reach this level that this album stands on.People often refer to this album as ""its own pedistool"" - it's just ranked in its own leauge, and it will always be there.Heres a few reasons why, in my opinion:1. This is the best production I have ever heard in any rap album. Period. Not even Dre could come close to something like this. The beats are raw - not overley done - not overley mastered and loud - and are just... raw. Hard. Eerie. Spooky. (Bomb First, Hail Mary, Life of an Outlaw, Against all Odds)2. The lyrics are just awesome. Imagine ""Illmatic"" but at a whole new different level. The metaphors in this album are just incrediable (Me and my Girlfriend, Blasphemy). There intese, angry, and poetic at the same time. Makaveli in this first track, our-right calls out rappers. Saying they are phoney, and just need to leave the rap game before he puts them out. This man had honestly no fear. He would go at anyone - they were all fake in his eyes.3. Like I said earlier in my review - nothing in this album can be reproduced. I have yet to hear any other rapper try to put out something this deep. Oh sure... there are some pretty intelligent rappers out there - but they are not emotionally deep like Pac was. This album was (and probably still is) WAY beyond its time. It was beyonds it time for 2pac, and beyonds it time for hip-hop in general. It's not a popular album. Its not a commercialised album either - Because this is an album that is way ahead of that. It's a personal album, that you have to listen to."

1,"Don't be fooled by the number of tracks (four) - you definitely get your money's worth on this one.  Isaac Hayes really showcases his ability to rework standards by composers like Burt Bacharach and Jimmy Webb.  You would never believe these weren't written to be mellow grooving soul.  From the cynical, ironic, Gen-X perspective, the intro to &quot;Phoenix&quot; seems a little too long and silly, but by the last few minutes of the song, you finally see where he was going with it."
1,"Gamble and huff at their best!.The ojays really come into their own in this cd.This air i breathe,a song that did not get any air play is another classic alone with for the love of money,people keep telling me,put your hands together,hooks in me all solid songs.This is the ojays at their best enjoy!"
1,"I have always loved Carole King. She has such tremendous talent. This CD , Wrap Around Joy and Tapestry are two of my favorite CD's. I especially like Jazzman on this recording."
1,"I normally don't write negative reviews, and if I hadn't listened to this recently I would have agreed with all the superlative reviews, basically because that's how I remember this record too.But I just finished listening to this and.....(It's not that good.)By that I mean it's about as good as ""Within You Without You"" from Sgt Pepper.  Groundbreaking for its time, genre-shifting, radical, risk-taking, and exotic.But today, in 2007, can you say you really love listening to ""Within You Without You""?  Or would you just rather wait for it to be over so you can hear ""Lovely Rita""?This record has that same kind of feel.  Let's be honest -- the guitarist is mediocre at best, his leads are really just awful, especially when he searches for notes upward.  Although ""Walk On By"" has the reputation for being nasty funk, it's really very mild. The extended jams lack imagination, Isaac's organ keeps hitting the same two chords, the horns are repetitive and unimaginative.I like Isaac's singing, and the back-up singers sound pretty good.  But come on, that extended rap on ""By The Time I Get To Phoenix"" is enjoyable today purely as kitsch, if that.I hate to say this, but this is a time capsule record, in a piece with legendary misfires like Muddy Waters' ""Electric Mud"" or Bo Diddley's ""Black Gladiator.""  Good for a goof but don't expect James Brown or P-Funk grooves or performances here."

1,"The second volume of Elton John's Greatest Hits was a quickie release meant to cash in on his juggernaut of popularity in the late 70's. Taking two early songs that missed the cut for ""Elton John - Greatest Hits"" (""Levon"" and ""Tiny Dancer""), his version of ""Pinball Wizard"" from his movie appearance in ""Tommy,"" singles from albums between ""Caribou"" and ""Blue Moves"" plus the hits that Elton didn't place on any albums, and this amounted to an odds and sods collection. Volume one remains an essential time capsule of the early seventies, but volume two, by nature of its randomly-picked selections, not as much so.Still, Elton and Bernie Taupin were riding such an incredible creative wave that all the songs here have become EJ standards. Both the one-off singles ""Philadelphia Freedom"" and ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"" were separate from proper Elton albums, as he'd become so prolific that even songs as great as these were left-overs. At this stage of the game, though, there are so many updated best ofs that you can safely choose a better representation of Elton's rich career. (Try ""Rocket Man: Number Ones [CD/DVD Package]"" or ""Elton John - Greatest Hits 1970-2002."")  But for someone who owned this on vinyl back in the day, it does evoke a warm nostalgia for the time when a new Elton John song was a musical event."
1,"Others may not think it, but I believe this is the third album in an unofficial trilogy, along with &quot;The Chronic&quot; and &quot;Doggystyle&quot;. It's that good. &quot;Warren G&quot; was friends with &quot;Snoop&quot;, and related to &quot;Dre&quot;, so they all had a similar sense of style. The huge hit &quot;Regulate&quot; is on here, but most of the rest is just as good. Another minor hit, and my favorite, is &quot;This DJ&quot;. Overall, this may not be as essential as the other two albums, but you should still &quot;Recognize&quot; the greatness of &quot;Regulate...G-Funk Era&quot;."
1,"One of the best from Elton John.  Has both of his best hit singles as well: ""Honky Cat"" and ""Rocket Man"""
1,"WITHOUT A DOUBT ....THIS IS ONE OF THE DEAREST,SWEETEST,TRIPPIEST. ROMANTIC SETS OF ALL TIME AND A TRUE CLASSIC. A MONSTER ALBUM IN THE LATE SEVENTIES,IT BECAME A HUGE CULT ICON IN THE EARLY '80'S.I WENT THRU MY THIRD EDITION IN THE LATE NINETIES WHEN IT WAS PAIRED WITH ""HOME FREE"" .

1,"Don't be too mad at me, but I really just discovered 12 Play about a few weeks ago.  I've really been 'into' music the past few years.  I feel its important to go back and listen to the 'real' music.  This cd has always been in my house, but never listened to it.  I mean who doesn't kno Bump and Grind, Your Body's Callin, It Seems Like you ready.  But to me those aren't the only good ones on the cd.  I love the uptempo jams like HOMIE LOVER FRIEND, FREAK DAT BODY, my fave uptempo being SUMMER BUNNIES! It just screams old summer jam!  But besides the obvious the good songs all the releases SEX ME AND 12 PLAY are just so damn good.  There has never been an r&b cd since this and it's a tough act to follow."
1,"Neil Diamond is a performer of extraordinary caliber.  He does not disappoint on this collection, either.  As other reviewers have noted, this  is very spiritually uplifting and it just plain SOUNDS good.  It is  great!&quot;Be Mine Tonight&quot; is a fun, catchy song that is sure to  delight most ears.  &quot;Guitar Heaven&quot; and &quot;Save Me&quot; are  more pieces of evidence that Neil Diamond is a gifted performer who has  genuine respect for his work.  He is not the stereotypical burn out rocker  who becomes a chart statistic.  Neil Diamond, on the other hand, is a very  cerebral, very serious and very dedicated performer and it is just this  purist approach that makes his music so darn good."
1,"Definitely the best rap group in the south (yes I think they're better then the Geto Boyz & Eightball and MJG).  Only 11 songs, but most of the songs are long.  It's from 1992 and I still rock it in 2005.  Guests are on a few songs and each member has a solo or 2.  Most of the lyrics are either dirty or about cocaine.  It has 2 classics, 2 I skip and 2 are ok.  Production is good on most songs and handled by Bernie Bismarck, Pimp C & Bun B on all the tracks.

1,"Stevie Wonder had recorded his previous albumIn Square Circlein 1983 but released it in 1985. Even though its clear based on internet knowledge that Stevie didn't write all of the songs on this particular album at the same time. On the other hand,the production was contemporary to its release. Stevie Wonder's musical success was in a very interesting place in the late 80's. At only a mere 37 years old Stevie,having been a child prodigy, was already a musically iconic figure before 40. Something of a modern day popular equivalent of a George Gershwin and Duke Ellington in terms of his body of musical accomplishment by this time. He had created an entire template for funk composition in the 70's. He was able to show the innovations of funk were not merely instrumentally challenging dance music,but could have its own style of songwriting to accompany it as well. By the 80's,funk was changing into a more electronic style of dance music that didn't (and still doesn't) suit everyone's fancy. The pop audience had also found a new darling in Michael Jackson,an artist Stevie once helped mentor. For his part Stevie seemed to have no trouble dealing with this. The R&B; community still regarded him as their main man,and that hadn't (and still hasn't) changed. So in terms of his commercial output,on this album he went more for quality than quantity.""You Will Know"" is a beautifully dreamy mid tempo slow groove opener,with Stevie's classic multi layered keyboards playing his complex chord structures on a song that pleas for hope among the hopeless. ""Dark 'N' Lovely"" is an intense,uptempo dance/funk piece with some heavy bass clavinet type synthesizer work mixed with spacier electronics that reflected a theme of darker hued African American's as being treated differently in society. ""In Your Corner"" takes this modern electronic funk instrumentation on a song that reflects more the flavor of 60's Motown-with a tale that basically picks up where ""I Wish"" left off:Stevie's possible imagined (or real for all we know) life as a young adult. ""With Each Beat Of My Heart"" is a mostly acapella ballad,built upon some transcendent multi tracked harmonies from Stevie and him breathing in the rhythm of a heart beat itself-providing mainly piano and harmonica as the other instrumentation. ""One Of A Kind"" is a deeply funky dance number,again built on dynamic harmony and Stevie's poetically lovelorn lyrical preoccupation. ""Skeletons"" is a strong funk mashup of themes between ""Superstition"" and ""Part Time Lover""-not too far in flavor from Cameo'sWord Uponly a bit warmer and gentler in instrumental flavor.""Get It"" is a heavy dance/funk number-again duetting with Michael Jackson to return the favor from ""Just Good Friends"" on MJ'sBad-finding the two aggressively trading off lyrics call and response.  The clavinet based funk returns on the wondrously grooving ""My Eyes Don't Cry"" whereas ""Come Let Me Make Your Love Come Down"" marries Stevie's electronic grooves with a heavy blues featuring a guitar solo from B.B.King playing Lucille herself. ""Crying Through The Night"" is one of my own favorites here-a Latin flavored number updated from a song he recorded in the mid 70's. The two most intriguing songs are ""Galaxy Paradise"",which strongly anticipates R&B;/funk's near obsession with Arabic melodies in the 80's funk context and ""Free"",which brings to mind his Bach-styled clavinet ""classical funk"" sound for some dynamic ""people music"". This album is actually one of my very favorites of Wonder's-certainly his finest of the 1980's for me,as well as his last release of the decade. Not only did he dip strongly into his celebration of the innovation of funk,jazz,soul and European classical that defined his blockbuster 70's successes but also had the time to anticipate a few modern day funk/soul musical concepts along the way as well. As controversial as this might sound to some 1980's musical naysayers,this album is easily as innovative and thrilling for its era asSongs in the Key of Lifewas a decade before this."
1,"This is the best CD of all time.  If you are a true Michael Jackson fan, then you must own this one."
1,"The absolute bare-bones essential Elton John - that's what this album is. Containing perhaps his 10 most famous songs - some of the biggest hit singles of the first half of the 1970's - as well as the wonderful album track, Border Song, it is certainly a masterful collection of wonderful songs that will get anyone who hears it hooked on Elton. It contains all of his big hit singles from this period (except for three: [""]Tiny Dancer[""] (now enjoying a resurgence in popularity due to its appearance in the movie Almost Famous), [""]Levon[""], and [""]The Bitch Is Back[""].) Although he has always had many great dedicated album tracks, to most people, Elton John will always be a singles artist. And the singles here are immaculate - wonderful, acutely perfect pop nuggets, from the master. No one other than The Beatles (and even they didn't do it as well) can touch Elton on crafting absolute pop perfection. And these songs are proof. It's a fine place to start if you're looking to dip your toe into the world of Elton John. That said, it by no means gives a full picture of this magnificent and multi-faceted artist. Some of his albums - particularly the sprawling double album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, still one of my favorite records of all time - have a great feel and mood all their own (four tracks here are excerpted from it), and deserve to be heard on their own. Instead, let this be your ticket to experience more Elton John, in all his immaculate pop greatness."
0,"Simon And Garfunkel were an unrivaled pair.  Their divine vocal harmonies and brilliant songwriting have never been surpassed.  This, their debut, is the only weak album they ever made.There are only three good songs on here: &quot;You Can Tell The World&quot; (I usually don't care for country music but this is an awesome song), &quot;Sparrow&quot; (the song that introduces their aforementioned divine vocal harmonies) and the original acoustic version of &quot;The Sound Of Silence&quot;.  The rest of the album is rather boring.Thankfully, though, all their other albums would prove to be sheer masterpieces."
0,"I am trying to appreciate the creativity and imagery of Bob Dylan. Whereas I do admire the atmospherics on such cuts as Your A Big Girl Now and Tangled Up In Blue, too many of these songs are excessively long winded. Heck that Jack of Hearts number must have twelve or thirteen verses all at the same pace with absolutely no change in instrumental definition. This is oh so grating.Also annoying is Bob Dylan's voice on several songs. Some people may find Idiot Wind to be an emotional performance. And the lyrics are indeed quite good in that vein. However, Dylan is so off key in many instances that it is a really pain to listen to especially over the course of seven and a half minutes.In general many of these songs are overlong and way too repetitive. Way too many verses which just don't do anything special for me most of the time. I know Dylan's aim was to return to his acoustic roots. However, the lack of an electric presence on more than the bluesy Meet Me In The Morning just hold this CD back.Tangled Up In Blue is a pretty cool song, Meet In The Morning has some nice guitar, and some of the other tunes have good atmospherics. However, I prefer other recordings by Mr. Zimmerman such as Blond On Blonde, Nashville Skyline, and The Basement Tapes...."
1,"While many have compared Planet P Project to other prog rock bands one thing that still amazes me is how fresh the material still sounds ! Carey was able to produce an album that could convey a space or futuristic rock theme without relying on pure cold synthesized gimmickry that was prevalent in the early 80's. It's awesome 80's early rock;pure and simple. On the whole this is one album that has been a favorite of mine all these years due to it's atmospheric and rich-hook laden lyrics and musicianship. Fans of Pink Floyd, Alan Parsons, and even Enigma may be quite intrigued by this now 20 year old release with one of it's most captivating early MTV videos of Why Me ?..."
1,"The boyz from Port Arthur return after 2 years for their 2nd group album, and their 2nd best album.  Only 11 songs but no weak point, 1 classic, 2 almost classics, 2 are ok, and the rest are good or great songs.  Guests are on 3 of the 11 songs.  As usual for a UGK album, the production is great and handled mostly by Pimp C (9 songs) and DJ DMD does the other 2.  They show why they're the best group to come out of the south on this one and especially with their ""Ridin Dirty"" album.

1,"I enjoy this superb performance very much.  The crowd is receptive and lively.  The band is playing tight but loose raggae in a way that only pioneers of the sound are able.  Bob Marley is in fine form.  He is responsive to the energy of the audience.  I find his ironic music engaging with its bouncy rhythms supporting serious, sometimes disturbing, lyrical content.  If you have an interest in the music of Bob Marley from the early seventies, this CD will be interesting to you"
1,"Judas Priest's 1981 Point of Entry was the follow-up to the classic British Steel.  Speaking in vinyl terms, if Point of Entry consisted of the entire first side and ""Solar Angels"" from side two, it would be 5-star and Priest's most solid album.  Unfortunately, it continues with some of Priest's worst tracks.First, the best stuff:  The first three songs also sport music videos available on the video Fuel for Life.  ""Heading Out to the Highway"" is the best of the bunch, but ""Don't Go"" and ""Hot Rockin'"" are also excellent, catchy tracks.  I really like ""Turning in Circles.""  It is a fun, kick back rocker.  ""Desert Plains"" is excellent.  It is a slower track dominated by some thundering drums by Dave Holland (now serving 8 years for a sexual assault conviction). The song transports its listener across desert plains.  It is very well done.  ""Solar Angels"" doesn't blow one away but is a solid, catchy track.  It is almost of the style of a British Steel song as it is a driving, repetitive song with no chorus (like ""Rapid Fire"" and ""Steeler"").  If it had the grinding guitar sound, it would fit very well on British Steel.Now for the bad stuff:  The rest of the album is terrible.  ""You Say Yes"" is just annoying, especially the chorus.  The quiet bridge is the best part.  Parts of ""All the Way"" sound a little like ""Don't Have to Be Old to Be Wise,"" but it is not in the same league as that excellent British Steel track.  ""Troubleshooter"" is also annoying and ""On the Run"" is a little better, but not by much.  Although this album breaks down at the end, the best tracks are so good that this album is still worthy of 4 stars."
1,"Ok, so this album came out near the tailend of the real big-haired, screaming 80's bands (you know who you are), but this one has really stood the test of time.  I broke the CD out after letting it sit for at least a couple of years and was reminded of how good a drummer Jason Bonham is.  He turns beats inside out, drives forward with a thundering backbeat and uses very tasteful fills throughout.Get this if you want to hear some wonderful rock drumming done with style."
1,"There's been a lot of debate over the years as to whether this is one of Stevie's best albums or one of his worst. I suppose it depends on one's point of view but even I have to admit I was taken slightly aback when I first listened to it.But that was many years ago and it's grown on me, taking its rightful place as one of my favourite albums of all time. Stevie did go against a lot of what he had done before but he was just breaking new ground. I think it was a brave move on his part and personally, I think history has proved him right.It's a solid set of ten songs and Stevie seems to try a different idea, a different approach with each of them. This is what attracted the criticism of the album being all over the place but while it's eclectic all right, the songs all fit together. Stevie ensures they do with the way he times one song to start immediately after the end of the one before it with no break - something he's done on many of his albums.""All I Do"" is notable for having Michael Jackson peforming background vocals, alongside Eddie Levert, Walter Williams, Jamil Raheem and Betty Wright. That might not mean anything now but this was back in 1980 just after Jackson's ""Off The Wall"". (Michaelmania hadn't quite taken off but it was definitely on its launch pad). The only other person who was able to snag Jackson for backing vocal duties back then (apart from Quincy Jones, that is), was Kenny Rogers, for a song on his ""Share My World"" album.""All I Do"" has also been covered by many r&b; singers in the intervening years but not as much as ""Lately"". This is easily one of Stevie's most beautiful songs and it's just him, his piano and bass synthesizer. The line ""Lately I've been staring in the mirror"" didn't really register until years later, when I was like, hang on, this man is blind.Another of my favourites is ""Do Like You"", a funky dance tune featuring the voices of Stevie's (then young) children, Aisha and Keita. I had this album on cassette until recently when I got the CD. The first time I heard the sound of glass breaking at the end of the song, it sounded so real, I actually looked up to see what had broken. Bizarre.The other songs of mention are ""Master Blaster (Jammin')"", which I didn't get then and still don't get now. I can see where Stevie is coming from but I really think reggae is best left to the experts.""Cash In Your Face"" deals with the unpleasant but undenialble issue of racism. The song tells the story of a young black family man looking for an apartment and being stonewalled by the landlord or real estate agent. The prospective tenant's voice is pleading and desperate, while the landlord's is cold and unmoving. I'd been listening to the album for several months before I realised that Stevie was singing both parts - one an octave lower than the other. Brilliant.And then, finally, there's ""Happy Birthday"" and the only use I've found for it over the years is, as a DJ, playing it at birthday parties and getting the guests to dance around the celebrant. It works a treat every time. That said, this song was the vocalisation of the campaign Stevie started to get Martin Luther King, Jr's birthday recognised. Given that it's now a public holiday in the US, I'd say that all on its own makes this entire album pretty iconic. I'm not sure it's his best; ""Songs In The Key Of Life"" wins that honour hands down, but it's definitely (one of) his most culturally influential."
1,"This cd has some great cuts on it, and was definitely worth the bargain, kind of hard to say which song is my favorite because i like all the tracks on here"
1,"&quot;Madman Across The Water&quot; is perhaps Elton John's and Bernie Taupin's most creative musical and lyrical output, when compared with their other stellar early '70's albums for a number of reasons. For instance, &quot;MATW&quot;'s two opening tracks, &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; and &quot;Levon&quot;, both display a vibrant orchestral fluidity (especially the latter selection), as well as a unique, melancholic autobiographical charm (moreso prevalent in &quot;Levon&quot;). &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; was written about Taupin's girlfriend at the time, a dancer named Maxine Feibelman. What makes &quot;Madman...&quot; a musician's clinic, are the percussive guitar and mandolin skills, which are craftfully provided by the likes of drummer Roger Pope and axeman extraordinaire Davey Johnstone - whose talents on the mandolin are quite exceptional on the road-heavy &quot;Holiday Inn&quot;. Johnstone would become a full-fledged member of The Elton John Band by the time EJ's next LP, &quot;Honky Chateau&quot;, was released the following year in 1972. Adding to this standout array of musicianship, is guest Rick Wakeman, whose playing on a majority of &quot;MATW&quot;'s tracks is sometimes barely audible, and on selections such as &quot;Razor Face&quot;, he pulls it off in spades. Wakeman would soon leave the Strawbs and join Yes after working on this album. Also introduced to the band are bassist Dee Murray and drummer Nigel Olsson, both of whom appear on one track, the impeccably overwraught &quot;All The Nasties&quot;. Both Murray and Olsson would become prime-time EJ Band members also by the release of &quot;Honky Chateau&quot;. The CD's title track is sure to give even the most casual Elton John fan &quot;suspensful down your spine chills and thrills&quot;, courtesy of &quot;Madman's...&quot; intense lyrical and orchestral jinegar. EJ and BT both paint a rich, textured Native American cultural landscape and soundscape in &quot;Indian Sunset&quot;, as if they realistically transported themselves back in time and dwelled amongst the natives (not bad for a couple of Brits, wouldn't you say?). The lyrics of &quot;Rotten Peaches&quot; would focus on the sad sack trial and tribulation nature found in a majority of Elton's and Bernie's musical and lyrical compositions in future albums as well. For these two songbirds, that is a very good thing, for fans of these two compositional wonders wouldn't have it any other way, including yours truly. &quot;Goodbye&quot; is a fitting end to the CD's macabre, storybook-like novella. &quot;Madman Across The Water&quot; is an absolute must for all die-hard Eltonians to have in their CD collection(s). Aren't you just &quot;dying&quot; to have this title in your Elton John library right about now?"
1,"If you don't already own this album or if you're considering buying the remaster, don't buy this version.  Buy the DELUXE VERSION, which has an extra live CD with the whole album live from a single concert plus Philadelphia Freedom and Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting live.  The packaging is top rate, too.  The live album isn't just a mindless copying of the studio version.  Elton had a new band, which added a different feel to many of the songs.  It rocked a bit more (no strings, etc, because it was live).  The live album is a must-have, so don't  buy just the remaster!"
1,"Kool & The Gang were really on the roll in terms of funk in the mid 70's. They were'nt alone either. Other bands such as Earth Wind & Fire,Tower Of Power and The Isley Brothers were beginning to enter their peak funk periods during this time as well. Whereas in many cases competition fuels jealousy and other forms of negativity it seemed to bring out the musical best in all these outfits who were then all putting their best foots forward. As far as K&TG; 3 were concerned,followingWild & Peacefultheir sound began to change. Well aware they were now starting to get popular hit songs on the radio,the band began with this album the very very gradual slickening up of their sound that would culminate with huge success by decades end. Here it was a sudtle change. But they were still in high gear in terms of funk.Right off the bat with ""Street Corner Symphony"" the changes are apparent. That loose rhythm is still there,so are the horns. But the drumming is slicker and the presense of synthesizers in the arrangements,which are used to provide a mild electronic seasoning more than anything. ""Fruitman"" has a bit more of a soul jazz-funk flavor to it,with a health conscious lyric very apropot considering the commonly stated poor dietary habits of many black Americans. On the title track and ""Higher Plane"" that jazz-funk sound,with a lot of sleeker vocal harmonies are applied to songs that tend to go deeper into the band members burgeoning sense of spirituality. Much as with EWF,they are perfectly willing to share their message of the unity of differences with the listener. There are two wonderful instrumentals here too in the rhythmically boistorous ""Whiting H&G;"" and of course the slower jam ""Summer Madness"" with it's crawling,melodic synthesizer line.One thing about this album is that their production was sharpening up significantly. They were really starting to establish how their type of funk would function as a studio entity as well as a live one. Where every single one of these songs could of course be easily reproduced on stage,they are very much more clean sounding and studiocentric productions than anything the band had recorded previous to this. This quality of blending the hardest edged Kool & The Gang funk with a heavier studio sound actually represented the peak of the bands sound in a similar manner to the Charles Stepney produced Earth Wind & Fire productions of the same era. A year later they would expand on this sound even further with what I consider to be their signiture mid 70's opusSpirit of the Boogie. But the sound that would come to the surface so heavy on that album really begins here."
1,"Unbeknowst to me at the time of the album's release, it came with a choice of two covers: a dark sable fur picture or a lighter-colored one (I got the former).  In addition to the respective covers, the ""locket"" on the cover was removable, allowing the purchaser to insert a photo of himself/herself or his/her beloved.Oh, the 70's was so thematic!!!That said, the music is typical White: luscious strings, catchy ""bedroom"" lyrics, and Barry's unmistakable and alluring bass, perfectly suited for any romantic interlude.  The two charttoppers are ""Playing Your Game"" and ""It's Ecstasy When You Lay Down Next To Me""; however, the best track is the last one: ""Of All the Guys in the World,"" a song that needs no explanation in expressing how lucky the singer/giver feels to be a part of the listener's/receiver's life.White always knew the right chords, musically and lyrically, to strike when expressing romanticism at its best."
1,"Toni Braxton's sophomore effort Secrets is a feminine, woman's perspective and mature driven album with an array of slow to mid-tempo songs that display the venerable emotions of women.  The tempo and atmosphere is moderate to slow tempo tracks with deep emotions.  This album begins with the invite ""Come On Over Here"" and another mid-tempo song ""You're Makin Me High"".  Toni seeks to rekindle a love with ""Un-Break My Heart"".  ""Talking In His Sleep"" is a song where Toni speaks of what she hears and goes into her sensual range for the bridge and a calming hook / chorus that intensifies this LP.  For a song of epic proportions very well orchestrated as she questions the downfall of her love on ""How Could An Angel Break My Heart"".  She then goes on to state what she likes in a man and what she deserves on ""Find Me A Man"" that was written and produced by Babyface that is another highlight for Secrets.  ""Let It Flow"" is the same song featured on Waiting To Exhale that's found on here as well.  With an ending to conclude with the climax of what she really wants most is love on ""In The Late Of Night"".  Very mellow and laid back with a lot of emotions, Secrets is a good night cap or the prelude to an evening with a companion."
1,"While this album is undeniably the best of the 3 Wham! albums, it also possesses some of the greatest pop songs from the 80's. After messing around with fluffy dance songs on their first album, George and Andrew show that they understand what makes a great pop song. Amazingly enough, they wrote the classic &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; when only 17 year old, and it's a song that will probably never be forgotten.&quot;Freedom&quot; is one of my favorites on this album. The exuberance of the opening notes leads directly into an undeniably catchy and bouncy chorus. Freedom is a theme that George will return to again in his solo albums &quot;Listen Without Prejudice, Vol. I&quot; and &quot;Older.&quot;"
1,"This remastered version of their Greatest Hits is the perfect introduction to the prog/rock group Kansas.  The most recognizable songs on the disc are the rocker &quot;Carry on my Wayward Son&quot;, the progressive influenced &quot;Point of No Return&quot;, and the thoughtful ballad &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;.  Other less known, but still wonderful songs are &quot;Fight Fire with Fire&quot;, the ballad &quot;Hold On&quot;, and &quot;The Wall&quot;.Unfortunately, in the remastering of this disc there were songs removed as well as added.  Although you get &quot;Pinnacle&quot;, &quot;Devil Game&quot; and &quot;Closet Cronicles&quot;, all worthy additions as bonus songs, the track &quot;Perfect Lover&quot; was inexplicably removed.  Other than that, the album benefitted GREATLY from the remastering, as the song quality and clarity is now excellent.Overall this is a great introduction to Kansas, and a solid glimpse into the early prog/rock sounds that paved the way for more modern groups like Dream Theater and Spock's Beard.  Absolutely Classic."
1,"Andre' Benjamin and Antwan Andre Patton (yes both share a name in common somewhere with me haha) are probably along with Mystikal two people who helped make Southern hip-hop a serious household name outside being novelty tunes for a few one hit wonders. And of course they're known for putting Georgia on the map the way...well Mystikal did the Crescent City. And of course when your dealing with the south and midwest,funk is just naturally going to flow in a certain sense naturally in cross sections of the culture. And that's about where this pair comes in. Both have very distinct personalities-both of which are on display on this second album. They always had a thing going. But their identity wasn't as heavily established until this album.  Featuring a modern day P-Funk style ""cosmic"" type concept illustrated comic form in the liner notes (worth reading) this album also lays down something of a concept musically. But there are also two halves of a whole to deal with her and that's important.Opening up with the dramatic orchestration ""You May Die"",they next tune is...you guessed it: both these guys boasting about Cadillacs on ""Two Dope Boyz"". This does lay out the basic flavor for this album musically. Across numbers such as the title cut,the sexy ""Jazzy Belle"",""Elevators (Me & You)"",""Babylon"" and ""Mainstream"" Organized Noize have created a sleek bed of music with multiple flowing basslines,the funkiest keyboard loops possible that kind of amounts up to a kind of G-funk with a bit more of a twang to it. It flows but it also grooves hard a lot of the times. And identity is important because ""Dre"" (as Andre was calling himself than before Andre 3000 became his moniker) and Big Boi are kind of going about the same mission in different ways. Both are lightening speed rhymers with a heavy rhythmic sense-almost vocal even here. Sometimes even a bit hard to follow. But Dre at this point was with Erykah Badu,starting to play the guitar and developing interests in spiritualism of different sorts. And that effect his lyrical outlook.Big Boi too is clearly not interested in being any conformist. But he where's his ""hood cred"" very proudly. So his approach is more aggressive and prone to a good deal of the same kind of sexist,violent and sometimes mildly childish posturing that is somewhat stereotypical of some hip-hoppers. It's not intended as mean spirited. But for those looking for something new in hip-hop and finding it here,his approach might serve to remind them of the very things in other hip-hop they're rejecting. And that duel nature but singular course became part of the whole OutKast attitude after this album. As the two developed somewhat more divergent courses creatively,the contrasts of style became harder to ignore. And eventually it got to the point where people were playing favorites between them and they just opted for separate projects. But at this point they were really playing up their whole ""two heads on the same body"" type of relationship. And continued to develop a broader interest in just about any music that was in the groove."
1,"The Beach Boys/ Pet Sounds (The complete Albums in Stereo & Mono):  This is a beautiful and absolutely classic album.  This particular single CD version of it gives us both the Mono and Stereo mixes.  Both are great.  I originally did not want to buy a bunch of individual albums by the Beach Boys.  I wanting instead a good compilation but, having been disappointed with the five-disk history set, I turned to the original albums.  I had the old LP of Pet Sounds many years ago and this CD is a revelation of brilliance and clarity.  I could not be happier with this CD, and am glad that I was not forced to buy the multi-disk Pet Sounds Sessions in order to own the album.  Highly Recommended."
0,"If Paula Abdul ever records another album, my ears will explode in blood.  Her debut album was stealing the sound of the era The New Jack Swing, originally of GUY and many others, what Abdul had was the moves and the producers who knew how to cover her voice in extremely catchy beats so she can dance to it in the overproduced videos and people would run to the record store and buy her debut album(wich by the way as many stated here outsold Abdul expectations, by selling more than 7 million copies in the US alone WOW!), of course this slick record contains 4 #1 singles but only two of them sound like #1, STRAIGHT UP wich I must confess to like, and COLD HEARTED dirty things always sells, but OPPOSITTES ATTRACT i do not respect an artist who dances with animated cats, and FOREVER YOUR GIRL sound sooo sooo DATED!....I bought this album when I was a child so it's soooooo long ago, Miss Abdul had her time, now she's an AI judge(wich in any way will make Paula look any cooler, just the other way around), Paula Abdul was in FACT very very LUCKY....because sadly this album lacks of consistensy and do not include the original video version(boomer).....Paula surely knew people in the industry that's why she got the type of marketing she got, a clever move for a cute sweet corny cheesy Cali Girl."
1,Since I am a Shania Twain fan my opinion may not be entirely objective.  None the less it is simply Shania Twain doing what she does and I thought it was great.
1,"This is one of the best live albums I own by anyone.James does a fantastic job on this. Songs like ""How Sweet It Is"" and ""Your Smiling Face"" totally jam. I'd even go so far to say that the live versions included here are even more fun to listen to than the great original studio versions.JT's slower live songs are nothing to sneeze at either. Songs such as ""Shower The People"" are sung with a lot of passion here.Another thing I love about this album is that it includes some of Jame's lesser known great songs like ""Shed A Little Light"" and ""Slap Leather."" He and his band totally bring these songs to life here.You just can't go wrong with this album if you're a James Taylor fan."
1,"Robert Johnson's music is fundamental to so much that followed it.  He is not only the most important figure in the history of the blues, he is also one of the foundational figures for rock and roll.  Just listen to ""I Believe I'll Dust My Broom"":  give the man an electric guitar, and that would be unaltered a 1950s rocker.  By any conceivable standard, Johnson stands as one of the most influential musicians that American has produced.  It is not at all surprising that he was one of the original inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, for the influence he exerted on the genre.Even if someone has not previously knowingly heard Johnson, a host of the numbers on this set will be familiar.  ""Kindhearted Woman Blues,"" ""I Believe I'll Dust My Broom,"" ""Sweet Home Chicago,"" ""Rambling On My Mind,"" ""Cross Road Blues,"" ""If I Had Possession Over Judgment Day,"" ""Love in Vain,"" and many other numbers are blues standards that have been covered by countless artists.  They reveal a consummate artist:  a great singer, an innovative and accomplished guitarist, and a brilliant songwriter.  There is a rawness that permeates the album, but that is not surprising when one realizes that he was recording not in a studio, but in a hotel room with relatively crude recording equipment in place.  These are one-take performances, with no recording or editing.  One can only imagine what he would have achieved under more auspicious circumstances.Though illiterate, Johnson was clearly a man with a consistent poetic vision.  These songs are filled with hauntingly beautiful though terrifying images.  Take the final verse in his classic ""Love in Vain"":When the train, it left the station with two lights on behindWhen the train, it left the station with two lights on behindWell, the blue light was my blues and the red light was my mindAll my love's in vainFor someone uneducated and unlettered, this is a subtle verse.  What does he mean by the red light being his mind?  Is murder on his mind?  Anger?  Suicide?  Any and all are possible, but the openendedness is typical of much great poetry.Many of Johnson's songs are demon-haunted.  Greil Marcus, in his brilliant study of American music, MYSTERY TRAIN, argues that Johnson is the last of the Puritans, because he took the reality of Satan and evil as serious as Jonathan Edwards.  Only, in Johnson's universe it is the devil and not God who has triumphed.  The songs often go way beyond the blues to deal with damnation and power of evil.  The devil is what makes Johnson's world make sense, even if it doesn't make good sense.  For instance, Johnson's actions sometimes so perplexes himself, that he has to turn to the devil as an explanation:Me and the Devil was walkin' side by sideMe and the Devil was walkin' side by sideI'm goin' to beat my woman until I get satisfiedIn other words, the Devil literally is going to make him do it.  But he is hardly repentant.  In one of his greatest songs he sings some of the scariest revenge lyrics in the history of music:If I had possession over judgment dayIf I had possession over judgment dayLord, the little woman I'm lovin' wouldn't have no right to prayJohnson repeatedly resorts to the language of murder, evil, hell, revenge, and savage loss.  One listens to Muddy Waters or Howlin' Wolf or almost any other blues great, and one quickly realizes that Johnson's world is far nastier and less forgiving than theirs.  It is no accident that the only blues figure as scary as Johnson is another Johnson, Blind Willie, who sang the Gospel Blues.  The Johnson boys agreed:  it's God or the Devil, heaven or hell.  When I listen to Robert Johnson, I think of the great words Max Brod recorded Franz Kafka as having uttered.  When Brod asked Kafka if there is any hope, he replied, ""Oh, plenty of hope, an infinite amount of hope-but not for us.""  Nor is there any hope for Johnson, what with his walks with the Devil and the hellhound on his trail.This set, when it first appeared, created quite a shock in the world of music.  For one thing, it replaced a great deal of mythic speculation about Johnson's life with a great deal of fact.  Many authorities had Johnson dying at 21 of everything from being knifed to getting shot, whereas he made it a good seven or eight years longer and was poisoned.  Also, the album was shocking in that on its cover was the first photograph of Johnson that the public had ever seen.  It was widely thought that no photo of Johnson existed, but in the research for this set two were discovered.  He went overnight from being almost a complete myth to a real human being.As an adopted Chicagoan (my home state is Arkansas, the eastern half of which formed much of Johnson's stomping grounds, with West Memphis and Helena serving as major blues centers, both of which receive mention in his songs), I have to make one comment on ""Sweet Home Chicago.""  The song very nearly became the official song of Chicago, and probably would have, except for that odd bit where Johnson sings about going back to California, to Sweet Home Chicago.  I've heard deejays comment on Johnson's apparent ignorance of geography.  In fact, Johnson has his geography right.  One of the things we know about Johnson is that he had a brother stationed at Port Chicago, California.  That Chicago, and not the great city on Lake Michigan, is undoubtedly what Johnson had in mind in his song."
1,"The Moody Blues have had numerous sounds in their 35+ years of existence, and many of those sounds make an appearance on this CD.  Overall I found the music to be pleasant and enjoyable, with several standout tracks.  A worthy addition for a collector of Moodies music.The CD opens with the Justin Hayward penned ""Blue World.""  The music to me sounds quite similar to some of the music from ""Strange Times,"" which appeared 16 years later.  I also thought that some of the style of this song was similar to songs from Justin's 1985 solo effort, ""Moving Mountains.""  While Patrick Moraz' keyboards are supportive in this song, the style evokes a comparison to the 1986 CD ""The Other Side of Life,"" where Moraz' keyboards nearly swamped the CD.  The imagery of the lyrics is interesting, a conjunction of words that give you an impression rather than detailed description.  One interesting phrase in the lyrics is ""Fly me high,"" which was also the title of an early Moodies song released on ""Prelude.""  The lyrics are very interesting, but as with many Justin Hayward songs, it is about love.Every Moody Blues CD has to have at least one collaboration between Justin Hayward and John Lodge, and the second track ""Meet Me Halfway"" is the one such collaboration on this CD.  The music will be familiar to long-time Moody fans as it is similar to many other Hayward-Lodge collaborations.  The pace is fast and the voices of the pair harmonize well, as always.  The lyrics are less inspired than many love songs penned and sang by the pair, but still a decent song.""Sitting at the Wheel"" has an interesting musical opening that gives the song a touch of a progressive feel before segueing into John Lodge's fast-paced vocals.  The music in this song is typical of Lodge's music in the 80s and on ""Strange Times.""  The lyrics are also reasonably typical.  An average song for John Lodge.The next song is one of the unique songs on this CD.  ""Going Nowhere"" was penned by Graeme Edge and sang by Ray Thomas.  This song harkens back to the Moodies style of the early 70s and has the flavor of Ray's singing on his solo ""From Mighty Oaks.""  This song is one of those timeless Moodies songs that could have come from any era.  The music is mellow with interesting sound effects complementing the music.  Patrick Moraz' keyboards fit well with the rest of the group in a classic Moody Blues style.  Excellent, mellow song.""Hole in the World"" is a John Lodge instrumental reminiscent of those wonderful instrumentals from the classic 7 albums of the late 60s and early 70s.  The sound is evolutionary for the Moodies, with the styling of the earlier period but with an 80s flavor.  The theme of the song and the style is set up for the subsequent John Lodge composition ""Under My Feet,"" but the theme could have been explored more extensively and thus the instrumental is much shorter than it could have been.""Under My Feet"" is (once again) a love song, with the style is along the lines of 1981's ""Long Distance Voyager.""  Interestingly, the song has a strong Beatles or John Lennon flavor.  In the second verse particularly the vocals reminded me strongly of John Lennon.  As with many John Lodge songs the pace is among the fastest of the songs on this CD, with strident percussion.  There is also a trumpet in this song that is not credited on the album cover, unless they somehow accomplished this sound with a synthesizer, but it sure sounded authentic.  The end of the song is a reprise to ""Hole in the World,"" a nod once again to the style of early Moody albums.Justin Hayward follows with yet another love song, ""It's Cold Outside of Your Heart.""  The music has a country flavor, with vocals that would fit into ""Strange Times.""  The intro and verses are mellow and slow, with the pace picking up in the refrain.  This song is a solid, though uninspired, Justin Hayward song.Justin's fourth contribution, counting the John Lodge collaboration, is ""Running Water.""  A mellow song that makes good use of Justin's vocal abilities, the lyrics are among Justin's best on this CD.  I particularly like the refrain, where Justin gets to reach for highs.  This song is classic Justin Hayward and classic Moody Blues.The last two songs are Ray Thomas contributions, and, as with many Ray Thomas contributions, are interesting and unusual.  The first is ""I Am,"" which has a significant flute contribution.  The song is nearly a poem with incidental music in the background.  While this CD is pretty far from the Moody's early days as a prototypical progressive rock group, there is a flavor of those progressive years in this song.  Once again, the song could have been much longer to explore the progressive styling of a group that was one of the most significant contributors to formation of this genre.""Sorry"" closes out the album in a way that, as with many Moody Blues albums, leaves me wanting more.  Ray Thomas' lead vocal on this song is outstanding, and this song is my favorite on the CD.  The soaring, emphatic vocals, the harmony, the synthesizers are classic Moody Blues of all eras.  The music is wonderful, with each instrument contributing in the most typical Moody Blues collaboration of any on this song.  This song belongs on ""best of"" collections of The Moody Blues.The Moody Blues have gone through a lot from 1967 to their most current release, ""December.""  There are few groups that have survived for 35 years, and fewer yet that have managed to remain relatively consistent over the years.  ""The Present"" is not one of The Moody Blues' most inspired albums, but it is good Moody Blues, and worth having for any Moodies fan, with ""Sorry"" making the album."
1,"This is definitely not in the same league as LONG DISTANCE VOYAGER, but that one's definitely hard to beat. The songs that make this album desirable are ""Blue World"", ""Sitting At The Wheel"", and ""Meet Me Halfway"". Not really a bad album though, it just doesn't have the six great songs that LDV did. But everybody's different and some Moody Blues fans might just fall in love with this one. Enjoy!!!"
1,"One might think with all the exposure via hip-hop,rock and the ""indie cred"" this album has earned over the years that it wouldn't quite have the same impact now that it may have in it's time or during the funk revival of the 1990's. Well I have to say that after listening to this album all the way through again....it's actually gotton better and gained all the more meaning with the passage of time. For Parliaments third album for Cassablanca this not only finds them hitting a very serious stride. All of the now legendary musicians are here: Mike Hampton,Bootsy,Bernie,Glen Goins,""The Horny Horns"";the entire P-Funk mob in it's classic form and this was the first time everything that had been represented on it's first couple of albums. The concept presented? Basically a metaphore for keeping funk alive through a story involving intergalactic DJ's on a radio station WFUNK looking to convince dancers they had ""all that they needed to save a dying world from it's funkless death"". For the most part this albums message has been taken as light,comedic satire but all it takes is listening to it in today's musical environment and one may realize the satire was more genuine and prophetic this is in the lyrical respect. The concept plays itself out over the course of the album but in such as a way that each song is a seperate entity as well. Two things are important to know here: this album is built on full on funk with not a slow jam/ballad to be found. On the other hand the type of funk this album presents IS by nature slower. So it makes it's point in this curiousities. The songs ""P-Funk"",the title song and of course the bands biggest hit ""Give Up The Funk"" all express that idea well along with the keyboards,bass and horns that really put it all together. On the other hand other songs such as ""Unfunky UFO"" and ""Handcuffs"" are still pretty straight ahead in terms of not having the heavy musical coloration of some of the other songs. ""Supergroovalsticprosifunkstication"" is actually a much denser rhythm than anything here with this somewhat hollow keyboard sound processed in with this slogging rhythm. The album concludes with the marching big band funk flavor of ""Night Of The Thumpasurous People"" with it's vital ""ga ga goo ga"" chants leading us out of the album. Yes it presents an ""all funk"" album and P-Funk itself as a certain key moment and all that but also what makes it sound as good as it still does is that good variety in rhythm and dynamics this gives you as a whole."
1,"If there was any Wu-Tang member that could make a solid album between the 36 Chambers and Wu-Tang Forever era, it would be GZA. Every member of the Wu-Tang was talented and created in their own ways, but GZA knows how to make a phenomenal underground rap album. Unlike the majority of rap ""stars"" nowadays, GZA can craft excellent lyrics. The vintage kung fu sound clips also give it an extra step up. RZA did an excellent job in producing this album. With ""Liquid Swords"", GZA tells us how rap should be done: with meaningful lyrics, talent, distinctive vocal styles, and the soul of the Wu-Tang. A must own for the underground rap fan."
1,"this is %100 the best album ever.. the lyrics are absolutely amazing. everything he says comes from his heart and his mind.. he knew what was going on with the world and said things that others never even thot of.. the beats are crazy good and addictive, tupac clearly had a great flow and had a way with his words and spoke with passion. not only that but he made this album in 7 DAYS!!!!! if all that isnt enough idk what is. buy this classic, EVERYBODY should."
1,"Let me indulge readers in an alternative perspective of Wang Chung. The other reviews here seem to rubberband between worshipfulness and thrashing. How about a more reasonable, more objective view? I remember seeing the video for ""Dance Hall Days"" from their 1984 album ""Points On The Curve"" as my first exposure to Wang Chung. I was unaware at the time that they already had a previous album.In 1985, I was aware of ""To Live And Die In L.A."" and saw the video for the title track (and later the film by William Friedkin--The Exorcist, The French Connection).In October 1986, ""Everybody Have Fun Tonight"" was inescapable, and to a 13 year old kid like myself the video was unique and the song was infectious. ""Let's Go"" was the second single/video, and I was sold. I saw Jack and Nick at an in store signing at Sound Warehouse in Aurora, Colorado in March 1987. The third single, ""Hypnotize Me"" was also good, and was used in the film ""Innerspace"" with Dennis Quaid and Martin Short.All eight songs on Mosaic are well produced and arranged. If you didn't like the New Wave sound of the 1980s, then you probably won't like ""Mosaic"". I thoroughly enjoy the punk/New Wave sound, so 20 years later, I still enjoy ""Mosaic"". ""A Fool And His Money"" I think of as being the weakest track. Otherwise, ""The Flat Horizon, ""The World In Which We Live"", ""Betrayal"" and ""The Eyes Of The Girl"" are all solid numbers. Unfortunately, ""Mosaic"" would prove to be the pinnacle of Wang Chung's career.In 1989, I was quick to buy their next album ""The Warmer Side Of Cool"", which may surpass ""Mosaic"" artistically. However, by 1989, many popular artists of the 1980s were being snubbed by radio and MTV/VH1, and so Wang Chung disappeared from view.I have ""Strictly, Inc."" with Jack Hues and Tony Banks (of Genesis) from 1995 which received no recognition. Then their Greatest Hits was released in 1997 with a new track ""Space Junk"" which I felt showed great promise, but there was to be no new album.In June 2005, after I thought they'd vanished into the annals of pop music history, Jack and Nick showed the world once more that they are trained experts at their craft when they performed on the television show ""Hit Me Baby One More Time"" covering Nelly's ""Hot In Herre"" with the precision of a surgeon. There was talk of a new Wang Chung album (which I'd snap up in a minute), but alas, a year has come and gone and no new album.And so those of us who appreciate Jack and Nick's vision have to deal with derision from anti-80's music snobs who are in no position to judge music they weren't old enough to experience the first time around or who were old enough, but preferred hair bands or the fledgling, underproduced rap music of the day.I give ""Mosaic"" four stars because I never felt Wang Chung were allowed to reach their true potential, but what they did leave behind is pure melodic New Wave/romanticism that no one seems capable of duplicating 20 years later. It was another time and another place 20 years ago, and while there is a new Neo-New Wave music crowd burgeoning, I haven't heard anything remotely similar to what Wang Chung were able to devise."
1,"I live in a prepy area. Blue eye, blonde hair girl/boys make up the majority of where I live. And yet, this CD - still this very day, hear blasted out of people windows, along with 50 and Eminem.Of course 50 could never be Pac level, and Eminem is just...different, shouldn't really be compared to Pac.But this is one of those albums that will never get old. 10 years from now, 2013, people will still love this album, and give it mad probs. Little kids today, and in the future, will somehow get ahold of this album and just realise how hip-hop/rap was so much better during this time period (mid 90's)It's a shame he had to go, it really is. No more of these cheap rappers making money of him would be here polluting the radio with there non-sence if he was still alive.2pac had the tightest flow - the wittest and yet touchable way of using lyrics - and his beats weren't always overproduced - They were straight ridin' beats. His voice sounded good over any beat - Whether it was a bluesy beat (Life Goes On; I Aint Mad Cha) or a hard beat (2 of Amerkiaz Most Wanted; Cant C Me) or just a straight top - down, window down, blastin' your ear drum beat (California Love; Holla at me; All about U)Anyways, this type of rap is sincerely missed in the hip-hop culture, and I feeling this type of quality material will never be reproduced or repeated.2pac was one of kind.Sad but true."
1,"Oh, Barry White. Wasn't he great? I miss the big guy. I just felt he knew soul frontwards and backwards and every way in between and this CD proves it. He had such a great voice and really knew how to use it.It's such a shame that he's not with us still, but I know that the theme of his Life was and probably still is, Love. Love makes all things possible and Barry knew this at a deep, deep level.Keep on keeping on, Barry...we miss you."
0,"This is the worst metal record I have ever heard. Danger Danger were a decent live band, but their studio debut is 100% grade A cheese. The keyboards are what destroys this record's chances. Keyboards add to a band if you know how to use them to the benefit of the album. This was forgotten for years in my record collection. It was overshadowed by the superb debut of Skid Row. If you want a record you can't hardly sit through, by all means bye this. It's only real value is as a collection piece for hair metal historians."
1,"tom waits is a very interesting and compelling performer. he tours infrequently and mostly at small night clubs and bars. he sings depressing tales of lovelorn, despair and lowlives. there is something about that i've alwayed loved. and his voice! oh his voice is magic! i mean when he records does somebody shove 34 cigarettes in his mouth and light them? just check out anywhere i lay my head. and 9th and hennepin always sends a chill down my spine. tom waits isn't like anything i've ever heard. its poety. its art. but like beefheart and zappa its an aquiered taste. its not for everyone. but for the articulate people that do enjoy it, waits is a rewarding experiance."
1,"First of all, if you are new to Daft Punk, mostly because of Random Access Memories or the Tron: Legacy soundtrack and looking for more of there music; and you are not otherwise into electronica /house/techno, this is not a good place for you to start.  Your next album should probably be Discovery, as that's the closest thing to DP's more recent work in there back catalog.  If you can't get into that, you'd be advised to just stop there.This debut album is really early-- 1997, actually-- and is hard core club music: very loopy, very repetitive and mostly made to dance to.  And very electronic.  That is not to say that it lacks depth, however.  Active listening reveals many surprises and subtleties that make trancing out to it a great experience.  So if you like good electronic music, this needs to be in your collection."
1,"Seas of Cheese is Primus's major-label debut. Primus is a very strange band, heavy bass, weird sounding vocals, and good lyrics. is what makes them famous. Primus is weird, but not weird enough to the point where can't even listen to them. They have a very attractive sound that lures you in with ""What the Hell is That?"" I recommend this to anyone who hates modern music and wants something differant."
1,"Black Sheep are Dres and Mista Lawnge two talented MC's back in 1991 when this was released. I bought it just for ""Choice is Yours"" for 3.33 which is a bargain and was worth it. The standout tracks are Choice is Yours (remix), Stroblite Honey, Flavor of the Month and pass the 40. The whole cd is dope and should be bought immediatly"
1,"E-Dubb brings it in 1995's Double Or Nothing.  Many say he does not have a good flow or deent lyrics.  If you want killa flow, try Nas, Biggie, Snoop, E-40,  Mr.Sermon's homie Redman, Big L, or whatever.  Erick Sermon is decent on the mic; he can bust some rhymes when he wants, but he wants you to know, his fortay is production.  The beats slam all the way thru with that Cosmic Slop!!!  His beats range from deep groove funk, to bass heavy almost boom-bap.  This music is definitely great house party or rider music.  He is easily one of the best producers on the East Coast, if not across the continent.  Beats like those on ""Welcome"" ""Boy Meets World"" almost approach a G-Funk atmosphere.  Other beats such as the ones on ""Bomdigi"" ""Do Your Thing"" have that awesome bass shakin' East Coast thump.  Any one from the East, West, South, or Midwest should find at least something to bump here.  Also, check out his solo debut, No Pressure from 1993 for that funk fo ya trunk."
1,"I guess if you decide to take a 5 year vacation....it's best to do so after making a phenomenal musical statement.This is the ultimate Moodies album...it would have been their ""Abbey Road""..had they decided to retire.The remastering was done superbly...nothing out of original balance..all songs are as they were recorded....a much cleaner sound and more output than the original cd's."
1,"From the reviews on this page, it seems people either adore or hate this album.  I'm somewhere in between.  When I was a youngun', this one loomed large on my radar, as it did for a horde of adolescent boys, what with its epic sounds and themes.  More importantly, it served as a gateway drug to the more serious prog bands.  I'd say that going from Asia to ELP and Belew-era King Crimson is well worth the inexpensive price of this album alone.The album certainly starts on a deliciously memorable note with ""Heat of the Moment,"" perhaps the only ballad in 10/4 time to ever top the charts.  I can never get sick of this one: Howe's mammoth guitar tone seems to encompass the world, John Wetton's vocals ooze regret and longing, Geoffrey Downes's synths bubble along sweetly, and of course Carl Palmer beats the drums silly while surrounding with you the echoes that the production adds.From here, it goes ever-so-gradually downhill.  The problem with this prog supergroup is that their public face, bassist/vocalist John Wetton, represents the least impressive era of his previous band's existence.  King Crimson was certainly impressive with him, but didn't have the same schizoid allure as they had with Greg Lake or Adrian Belew at the helm.  His stint with Crimson represents their poppiest in their almost forty years of existence.  Take Belew, Lake, or Jon Anderson, of Yes, say (tho' of course Asia would really be Yes with the latter) and have them singing and co-penning the songs and you wouldn't have an album that constantly flirts with vapidity.Which is what the album does more and more as one song heads into the next.  It's not about the musicianship, which always remains at a world-class level, it's about the tone of the compositions.  Their second single from the album, ""Only Time Will Tell,"" is certainly an enjoyable confection, but is just a little too sweet, making the listener think that perhaps too much of this stuff might rot the brain.  In its own way, that's fine, because this album is okay to put on once every year, much like one tends to have only have fruitcake once a year, making it enjoyable then and only then.  Compare this to a true prog masterpiece like Yes's _Close to the Edge_; the compulsion factor to listen to that one over and over again is palpable, as that confection is not whipped to a sugary froth; no, that one is shot through with dark chocolate, thick and dark with just the right amount of sugar to keep from overpowering the listener.Song three, ""Sole Survivor,"" is fun and flirts at the edge of rocking out, much like the rest of the album.  The only song that really rocks with what seems like reckless abandon is ""Heat of the Moment,"" where Palmer and Howe are ""let off the leash"" for a good time at the end (tho' of course the song fades out in the heat of the jam at the end, lest it be too long for radio).  The rest of the album is more restrained: my theory is that this is so because of Wetton's ""English reserve.""  On bass, he may have the ability of a Chris Squire to cut loose and go into ozone-aiming trills and hammer-ons off the top of his head (tho' I doubt it), but he never does this.  His lyrics match this approach.  They are clever and evocative, but never hit the ecstatic pitch of abstraction and sheer nonsense that helps the lyrics of Jon Anderson and Greg Lake to put you in a completely other place.  This approach characterizes Wetton all the way back to his Crimson days.  For nine-tenths of this album, you know that you are precisely on earth, which is a little too much of the quotidian and a lot too little of the sublime for these ears.I could give you a blow-by-blow of the rest of the songs on this album, but I'm going to leave it up to you.  I think you should buy this album, but you've already heard the highlights if you listen to classic rock radio.  The rest of these songs are competent prog lite that serve well to put one in a slightly ornate and ""just fine"" kind of mood, good for cleaning the house, say.  If you're looking for a profound listening experience, though, this is not the place to go.  Go to the bands from whence the musicians here came; the pleasures that Crimson, ELP, and Yes offer in their primes are certainly not guilty ones."
1,"It's something of a miracle that Depeche Mode's 1997 album even saw the light of day.  Since their misguided 1993 release ""Songs of Faith of Devotion,"" the group lost key musician Alan Wilder, and singer David Gahan had a very public meltdown and battle with drugs.  Impressively, Gahan was able to clean up his act and reunite with Martin Gore and David Fletcher for ""Ultra,"" which finds the Mode returning to their synth roots after they tried (and failed) to be a rock band on ""Songs of Faith and Devotion.""  Yeah, guitars pop up here and there, but this is an electronic album all the way.  The album's best cut is easily the single ""It's No Good,"" which features rubbery, agressive bass set to Gahan's trademark moan.  ""Useless"" has funky drums, abrasive guitars, and bleeping synths.  A favorite track, ""Sister of Night,"" is a near-ambient gem that radiates in its quiet beauty.  Gore hasn't lost his touch as a songwriter, and he comes up with lyrics that reflect Gahan's personal tribulations in the single ""Barrel of a Gun,"" which vaguely refers to his battle with drugs.  ""Ultra"" isn't one of my very favorite Depeche Mode albums, but it's an impressive return to the spotlight considering the hurdles this trio faced during its making."
0,"In the early 1980s, Adam Ant dominated the pop charts for all of eighteen months with some really irresistible hits: ""Stand and Deliver,"" ""Prince Charming,"" and ""Kings of the Wild Fronteir"" before he cracked the American market as a solo artist.  Anyone looking for the tribal beats and twangy guitars that made his ""antmusic"" so distinctive will be big-time disappointed in ""Strip.""  Granted, there are two polished-up but enjoyable singles on this album: ""Puss and Boots"" and the title track; both were produced by Phil Collins.  Everything else is flat-out bad.  ""Strip"" is really two singles weighed down by a whole lotta filler.  If you wanna hear classic Adam Ant, get his earlier discs and avoid this. It flopped upon release in 1983, and for a good reason."
1,"It seems to me that in 1966 Donovan was already in that special asteral plane The Beatles, Stones, Beach Boys and everyone else was seeking to be. Sunshine Superman and Mellow Yellow were but glimpses of the cosmic landscape Donovan would lay on us in A Gift From A Flower To A Garden. And if that was not enough, the addition of For Little Ones, is as near a perfect compilation of charming English childrens songs, as can be found this side of Atlantis. In a world full of tinkers, magpies, enchanted gypsies and starfish, Donovan resides as the man-child truberdour strumming his guitar and banjo as he sings us all to sleep."
1,"Uneven as all get-out, but at times this is unbelievably good. The beautiful, melodic love song ""Your Song"" was the first and arguably best of John's big hits: the strength of the melody and John's emotional performance help it rise above moronic lyrics like ""If I was a sculptor/But, then again, no"" - a lyric that makes some of my worst moments look like ""The Raven"". It's all about that melody, you know? Interestingly, ""Your Song"" was a b-side: its flip, the manic, lyrically incoherent unbridled rocker ""Take Me to the Pilot"" is another personal favorite, even though I've got no clue what the hell Bernie's talking about. Several other songs pack a punch too, most of them energetic: the gospel shouter ""Border Song (Holy Moses)"", which got the royal treatment from Aretha Franklin and became the highlight of her sterling Young, Gifted and Black album; ""The Cage"", a solid song about alienation; the threatening ""King Must Die""; and the low-key ""I Need You to Turn to"". Paul Buckmaster's orchestration dominates as usual, and while it never gets out of hand on the best tunes, it's responsible for screwing up the worst ones (""Sixty Years On""; ""The Greatest Discovery""; ""Last Episode at Hienton"", the first of many sexist Taupin songs). Speaking of sexism, there's a dollop of it on the awful country parody ""No Shoestrings on Louise"", which is arguably the worst Elton John song not found on Victim of Love. This is a pretty good album, but it can't stand in the same room as the next one."
1,"I never was a fan of Johns until lately, but this album has many of his top hits and I got it online for under 5.00. What a deal, its kind of nice to hear someone sing about the past or how different times were, innocent times when holding hands meant something. He sings about rural America and its beauties.Look it  up and buy it.....you wont be disappointed."
1,I heard this when I was 12 and loved it.It has tight beats and will have you nodding your head. It has that funky sick wit it style all over this one. I noticed the beats are different though that is the only bad point.THis is a rerelease so it get 4 stars.
1,"This is Dylan's most personal album. It is about his marriage that crumbled apart. Though the songs are sad the music is beautiful. It was like Dylan was back to himself after experimenting for awhile. Songs like You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go and Buckets of Rain make me cry at times. Dylan proves he is a gifted songwriter and shows that his own problems won't stop him. Favorites include Tangled Up in Blue, Simple Twist of Fate, You're a Big Girl Now, Idiot Wind, You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go, Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts, Shelter from the Storm, and Buckets of Rain. Highly Recommended."
1,"i got this from amazon a few months ago, and its on constant rotation. i believe i had every album with a dr dre production or guest rap except this album. i had heard it was dissapointing to some people. i dont know why, its not really a dre album, its a compilation with 7 dre beats on it.i though everything was gonna be dre beats so i was dissapointed, but truth is if i didnt read the credits, i woulda thought all the beats were dre anyway. dre raps on 2 songs which are both dope. half of this cd is rnb songs. which are pretty damn good. mel mans(didnt know he rapped)sh*ttin on the world is the best rap song here and is perfect to smoke to.choices by kim summerson is the best rnb track, which is the best flip of isaac hayes look of love ive heard, and makes ashantis song rain an excercise in futility(altho its obviously not as great a song as jiggas can i live). musically this album is straight bumpin and the other producers do a good job of keepin up with dre. most of the artists featured are no names but it doesnt matter because the beats are so smooth and bangin. i would recomend this to fans of rnb and smooth hip hop. i got this while im waitin for 'detox' and i played it a lotta times. its definetly worth the cheap price"
1,"I went through three copies of this album. One cassette,one double LP and one single CD. I still have the LP and CD. I lost the cassette somewhere. My mom bought the cassette shortly after she bought a new Lloyd's stereo with cassette player in late 1979. Several months later,we bought the 2 LP set. In October 1995,I bought the CD. The title track was the only original track and was a hit. There's also a long version of the song following NO MORE TEARS which is much longer(playing time for NMT is 11:44). NMT is a duet between Donna Summer and Barbra Streisand. It's also on Streisand's 1979 album,WET. Summer was introduced in 1975 with the megahit LOVE TO LOVE YOU BABY. Other megahits are LAST DANCE,BAD GIRLS,DIM ALL THE LIGHTS,HEAVEN KNOWS and HOT STUFF. MacARTHUR PARK is a cover of the 60's hit written by Jimmy Webb(I don't know the artist who first recorded it). DIM ALL THE LIGHTS was written by Summer herself. All the other songs are great. Side 1 of the cassette has the songs from sides 1 and 4 of the LP. Side 2 of the cassette has the songs from sides 2 and 3 of the LP. On the LP,side 4 is opposite side 1 and side 3 is opposite side 2. When this album was released in 1979,phonographs with stacking spindles were still made and sold. So owners of this album could place side 2 atop side 1 and side 4 atop side 3. After this album,Summer was dropped from Casablanca and signed with the newborn Geffen label. This was in 1980. Summer had four more big hits after this album. They are THE WANDERER from the 1980 album of the same title,SHE WORKS HARD FOR THE MONEY from the 1983 album of the same title,THERE GOES MY BABY,a cover of the Drifters' recording,and SUPERNATURAL LOVE both from 1984's CATS WITHOUT CLAWS."
1,"As a landlocked kid growing up without ready access to beaches or a car, I had a hard time relating to the Beach Boys. Their celebrations of sun, surfing, and hot-rodding were too removed from my own experience. It wasn't until I got older that I appreciated them. Songs that had once sounded frivolous suddenly revealed multiple layers of emotions which had previously eluded me.Mind you, that wasn't true of every Beach Boys song. But classics like ""Surfer Girl"" and ""Don't Worry Baby"" were wistful and beautiful evocations of love and longing - both questioning and reassuring.Brian Wilson then outdid himself with his compositions for the landmark 1966 album ""Pet Sounds"" - their apex and finest achievement - and arguably the greatest record ever released by an American band. Paul McCartney has said that if you haven't heard it, your musical education isn't complete. He further said it inspired the Beatles to make ""Sgt. Pepper"". I don't really hear ""Pet Sounds"" influence on that record, but I do on ""Abbey Road"" - especially on tracks like ""Because"" and ""Here Comes The Sun King"".This CD contains the full album in mono and stereo. Wilson's musical and vocal arrangements still sound stunning to this day. If for any reason you've resisted buying this, you shouldn't. At the very minimum, any serious music fan should own ""Pet Sounds"" and a good collection of their hits such as ""Sounds Of Summer"" (2003).Wilson's solo career has also been of interest. ""Brian Wilson"" (1988) was a good one. So was the belatedly completed ""Smile"" (2004), which was originally intended as the follow-up to ""Pet Sounds"" - wherein he proved himself to be a latter-day Gershwin. ""Smile"" collaborator Van Dyke Parks and Wilson had previously released the excellent ""Orange Crate Art"" (1995). Recently, Wilson issued ""That Lucky Old Sun"" (2008), another innovative song suite in the style of ""Smile"" - and it's fine. All are highly recommended.Whether you live in California or not, don't miss out on the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson."

0,"-I don't know.  I love GG, and many of their albums are perfect.But this one, I can't wrap my head around it.It's too simple, and a big step down from AQUIRING THE TASTE.Alot of people love it, so maybe it's me.But, IMHO there's only one good song here.  Not enough to make me spend my hard-earned money.-"
1,While his dancing was truly great and his live shows were nothing short of phenomenal...I think folks forgot that he actually could SING!  As he got older his voice actuallymatured into an instrument that was smooth as silk.I think we all need to actually stop and again take a real listen!
1,"Innervisions by Stevie Wonder is so essential on so many levels, I probably should not even try to put this album into words. Frankly, no words can encompass art of this high order--the highest. I am afraid to say one more word, but I want to write about Innervisions all night long.Where do you start with an album that represents a peak artist at peak power: musically, lyrically, commercially, socially and technologically. Stevie Wonder, who in 1970 was a singles artist. By the release of Innervisons, 1973, he was making some of the most important records in music history.Music, in raw essence, does not get better than this. Listen to the vocals of ""Too High,"" which has the a tonal complexity to rival John Coltrane'sGiant Steps. Wonder may have a jazz composers mind, but he translates this--not waters it down--into pop, funk, synthesizer music. Music that comes at the art whole. Big as music itself.""Livin' For The City,"" is just as big, as important. Wonder could have had a perfect single here, but he would not settle for that. The interlude here turns the track into sound cinema. Wonder is taking pop and using it to plaster the plight of inner city blacks--1973 terminology--all over the radio. All over top forty AM. All over progressive FM. All over white kids turntables. It's pop. It's funk. It's progressive. It's experimentation. It's the picture no one wants to see--and Wonder put it EVERYWHERE.!The second the story is over, Wonder snaps back with a drum roll and a mournful vocal progression, ripping your heart out with the  final echo.  It's searing, but just as your chocking up, he overlaps, segues into the celebration of ""Golden Lady."" What were you choked up about? I don't know. But wow, is this ""Golden Lady"" a beautiful love song.Not even my ex-girlfriend could toy with my emotions this well.Drained? How about some smooth Latin. ""Don't You Worry About A Thing,"" opens with Wonder speaking in tongues, talking about languages from all over the world, the world Wonder seems to own. A little fun shuffle for the dance party--a world party, and yeah, that's Stevie's, too. A little love song, but Wonders reach is so comprehensive at this point, you just sit in awe of how GOOD this guy is. Even the lighter material is huge.Did I miss something? Yeah, I missed a hell of a lot. I missed some important tracks, because every second here counts. How many albums can you say that about. Not many. Not many times do art and commerce and invention and genius meet in the right place at the right time and equal the perfect piece.But there are a few times, and one of those is Innervisons"
1,"No doubt about it, &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; is a very solid piece of work.  Each of the 10 songs is a winner with &quot;Tangled Up In  Blue&quot; and &quot;You're a Big Girl Now&quot; standing above the pack.  But this is not Dylan's best album by any means.  It falls far short of his  true masterpiece (&quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;), and even pales beside such  woefully underrated efforts such as &quot;Desire,&quot; &quot;Street  Legal,&quot; and &quot;Shot of Love.&quot;  Furthermore, once you've heard  the powerful live version of &quot;Idiot Wind&quot; that appears on the  &quot;Hard Rain&quot; album, there seems to be no point in even listening  to the original studio cut again (and by &quot;original,&quot; I mean both  the version that appears here and the earlier rendition that was released  on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 1-3&quot;).  The lyrics convey plenty of  rage and fury, but Dylan's performance does not, making the song one to  admire, primarily for the lyrics, but not one to feel in your gut."
1,"One of the icon's of the 90's rock music, Etheridge follow up to her blockbuster smash hit album &quot;Yes I Am&quot;, different from her previous is that &quot;Your Little Secret&quot; it's harder and more rock that ever, her leading single the title song it's justa great example of what I'm talking about, a rock song and it fully extent, the second delivery &quot;I Want To Come Over2 it's one of the most intimate songs for Melissa and one of her top in music interpretation, such a masterpiece and classic tune, just the beginning of the song tells you everything, &quot;Nowhere To Go&quot; a little sad and melancolic that drives you to a story of incomprehended love, &quot;Unusual Kiss&quot; silly lyrics with great rock performance, &quot;I Realy Like You&quot; Rock! Rock!, this album is one of those that will live you wanting more....great delivery."
1,This is my FAVORITE CD of all time! I call it a relationship bible because it touches on so much and is still relavant today. Just musical perfection! I luv it! This is definitely a needed CD in any true music lover's collection!
1,"This is my favorite Laura Nyro album, a favorite among favorites. Many cite New York Tendaberry as her best work but for me that album is less accessible, whereas the songs on Christmas blend together better. That's just my two cents, of course, but I would say that this is not only my favorite Laura Nyro album, it's my favorite album, period.That's not the main reason for this review, however. I bought the CD thinking that it was a remastered version since Amazon lists it as being released in 2008. In case anyone is interested, this is exactly the same recording as the original CD issued several years ago so if you have that one, don't bother buying the 2008 release.And as for Ms. Nyro - if you like her works and don't have this particular album, by all means get it. You will not be disappointed."
1,"And I am back into the days of reckless youth wishing that the old body could withstand the rigors of once abused substances that made it all sound so perfect...but what the hell...it's great music for the tread mill and weight machines.  I think that I am rocking out while exercising, but hard bodied youngsters with I phones and ear buds probably think it is elevator music.  This is a great album although I still think that the song &#34;The Low Spark of the High Heel Boys&#34; is their masterpiece."
1,"1979's ""Product,"" the fifth album by Brand X, sees the very-welcome return of Genesis drummer & singer Phil Collins to the fold after a one-album break (Phil was busy with Genesis the previous year, so Chuck Burgi stepped in on the drumkit for Brand X's 1978 release,""Masques""). ""Product"" also sees Brand X swell up into an eight-man line-up, not only band veterans Collins, John Goodsall, Percy Jones, Robin Lumley & Morris Pert but also keyboardist Peter Robinson, bassist John Giblin, and Mike Clarke (though I don't have the info on what Clarke plays on the album, and my CD booklet doesn't say, either). I suspect that Brand X named this album ""Product"" because the band were trying for a more radio-friendly feel with this release, even including two ""proper"" songs with vocals & lyrics (95% of the band's music, I'd say, is strictly instrumental). But there's no need to be put off by this, because ""Product"" is a great disc, featuring the group's incredible knack for whirlwind, progressive jazz-rock fusion & musical chops. The two songs with lyrics, ""Don't Make Waves"" and ""Soho,"" are both very rockin', and feature excellent vocal performances from Collins (""Soho"" was even released as a single---a rarity for Brand X---but it didn't go anywhere). I also enjoy the expert jazz-rock of such tracks as ""Dance Of The Illegal Aliens,"" ""Algon,"" the great grooves of ""Wal To Wal,"" and the ferocious instrumental ""And So To F,"" penned by Phil Collins himself (who totally outdoes himself on the drumkit with this one). The music is terrific, and the band's performances are mindblowing. It's another winner for Brand X! I'm very confident you will enjoy this ""Product."""
1,is Eddie Van Halen's guitar solo for 'Beat it'.
1,"another funky cd by the group that is most instrumental and you get to hear the instruments to their entirety..one of my favorites is &#34;Summer Madness&#34;, which i call it the &#34;brown liquor song&#34; of the hour because of the great rhythm section of the group...i watched the group perform &#34;Summer Madness&#34; on Soul Train and them brother got down"
1,"First out, although this isnt Scorpions best album, its surely one of the toughest. The energy just seems to burst out of every second, and although Klaus Meine had undergone an operation right before the album he sounds just awesome. He prooves his newfound power with the memorable title song &quot;Blackout&quot;, which also is the best song on the record. Other highlights on this album is Arizona, When the Smoke is going down and You give me all I need. The other songs are generally good, and there is no bad songs here. However, this is not as good as Love at First Sting, which combines the best elements from both cd`s, hard and fast hitting songs with great melodies.I wasnt sure wether or not to rate this 5, but since it lack the perfection of Love at First Sting, It will have to do with a 4. A STRONG 4 however, as this is very, very good Scorpions as we all love them."
1,"Steve Earle had two well received and critically acclaimed country albums under his belt, but he had been saying all along that he didn't consider himself a country singer. Being a big lefty liberal wasn't endearing him to the staid conservatism of the Music Row establishment. With these worlds colliding, Earle went all in for his third album, 1988's ""Copperhead Road."" MCA Nashville and MCA Los Angeles were so befuddled by it that they resurrected the old UNI Records imprint to try and find a bridge between the two worlds. And for his part, Earle hit a park on ""Copperhead Road"" that took him almost a decade to recover from.The album is, at its absolute best, a perfect ahead of its time blend of rockin' with the new country crew that Earle was initially batched in with. Rock as hard as he wanted to, but he couldn't escape that southern drawl and many of the lyrical tropes of the genre. At the same time, the guitars, drums and overall sound were closer to John Mellencamp than George Strait. The epic title song is all but a Mellencamp record with a tougher lyrical punch; a story about a moonshiner's son who comes back from Vietnam with a bag of pot plants and post traumatic stress disorder. With that kind of content, it's no wonder that the Suits in Nashville didn't know what the fox to do with him. The same with the unknown soldier who is angry about how his Grandfather came home a hero, but he's disabled, standing alone on a runway in San Diego and ""there's nobody here, maybe know body knows"" (in ""Johnny Come Lately"").Earle could still do convincing country, like the gunslinger's lament ""Devil's Right Hand"" and the pedal steel ballad ""Once You Love."" All the same, Earle had reached a crossroads, personally and musically. ""Copperhead Road"" remains his commercial apex and is among his best albums, but his decline into addiction and his overall distrust of the music industry left him stranded until 1995 and ""Train a'Comin'."" But for the sheer raw power of a battle waged and won, Steve Earle's ""Copperhead Road"" remains a must listen."
1,"Without question 2pac is the greatest rapper who has ever lived, if you weren't convinced by &quot;Me Against The World&quot; this album pretty much proves it. This is 2pac's most commercial album without question it produced 6 hit singles and sold millions of copies. There are also many underrated tracks on this album; Ambitionz Az A Ridah, Got My Mind Made Up, No More Pain, Only God Can Judge Me, Can't C Me, Holla At Me, Ratha Be Ya N..., All Eyez On Me, and Ain't Hard To Find. This would still be a great album even without the hit songs; All Bout U, How Do You Want It, 2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted, Heartz Of Men, Life Goes On, California Love, I Ain't Mad At Cha, and Picture Me Rollin' all of which are featured on 2pac's &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. If you weren't keeping track that's 17 excellent songs, even the ones I didn't mention are still good. The production is great throughout the entire double disk set thanks mostly to Daz, Dr. Dre, and Johnny &quot;J&quot;. There are also plenty of great guest artists; The Outlaws, Nate Dogg, Daz, Kurupt, Method Man, Redman, KC &amp; Jo Jo, Snoop Dogg, Rappin' 4-Tay, Dr. Dre, Danny Boy, Big Syke, CPO, Richie Rich, E-40, B-Legit, and C-Bo. It's hard to say if this is indeed 2pac's best album, personally I like &quot;Me Against The World&quot; a tad bit more, but anyone who considers themselves a fan of Rap music should have this classic album."
1,"Leave it to KRS-One to teach what hip hop is supposed to sound like. After dropping the Boogie Down Productions name, Kris comes correct on his 1993 album, Return Of The Boom Bap. The production on here is pretty much on point, courtesy of DJ Premier, Kid Capri, Norty Cotto, and Showbiz. All those dope producers, expect that signature east coast sound to represent.A good number of tracks here are excellent. Tracks such as ""Outta Here"", ""Slap Them Up"", and ""Sound Of The Police"" (if you can, get the 12"" that has the B-side ""Hip Hop Vs. Rap"") are easy standout. ""Mad Crew"" is an easy headbanger, along with ""P Is Still Free"". Another favorite of mine is ""Brow Skin Woman"".Kris missteps here on early points on this album like the boring sounding ""Mortal Thought"" and the odd concept of himself being a blunt being passed around to various rappers on ""I Can't Wake Up"". A few others float around, but that doesn't stop that from being a good album. Given that this is one that defiantly needs to be in your music collection, as this one would be in rotation for sometime.

1,"On Blood On the Tacks Bob Dylan returned to his folk/acoustic roots and produced an album of incredible majesty. The lyrics are not as full of imagery as some of his earlier works but the language is straightforward and goes right for the juglar. There are so many memorable passages that I won't quote the songs in this review. I'd rather just say that for me these songs contain an astonishing level of insight on life, love, human nature, and lonelyness. Even the more lighthearted Lily, Rosemary and The Jack Of Hearts is inhabited by characters that are remarkably well drawn in what is almost a condensed novel put to music.I won't say that this is the Best Dylan album, since that is largely a matter of taste. It is however an album that I could not be without."
0,"This is not one of the strongest albums Joni Mitchell has released. The are a lot of guest vocalists and they don't always match with Joni's voice or songwriting. The lyrics are ok as well as Joni's voice, but the synths sound so dated by now. Most of the songs suffer from that. There are a lot of albums who have a distinct 80's sound but this one hasn't hold up that good. I own all of Joni's albums and hate to talk bad about her but this album is not one of my favourites. There is only one song on this album that is really good, the closer A Bird That Whistles. A simple acoustic track with saxophone from Wayne Shorter. The photography on the cover is beautiful as well. So, not one of her best but she has made so many exellent albums that this one pales compared to those."
1,"The album opener 'Everybody (Backstreet's Back)' is handsdown one of the best party songs of the 90s and of the boys along with the intoxicating, 'If You Want It to Be Good Girl (Get Yourself a Bad Boy)'.'As Long As You Love Me' still is a lovely love ballad about unconditional love and has never gotten old to me as I still hear it being played over the radio.'10 000 Promises', 'Like a Child', 'That,s What She Said', and 'If I Don't Have You' are very romantic songs that further captured how much the boys love to sing about love, not to mention how wonderful their singing voices are. ;-)'All I Have to Give' is such a beautiful love ballad on the album and has always been my favorite from the boys and speaks about what REAL love is.'That's the Way I Like It' (which might had been sampled for the boys 'Millennium' song 'Larger Than Life') is a swell mid-tempo song as well as 'Hey Mr. DJ (Keep Playing This Song).'Set Adrift on Memory Bliss' is a very smoothing which shouldn't be overlooked along with the other songs from the album that weren't major hit singles.The second album from BSB has what their debut album has, a few catchy Dance and Funky songs, but has more love ballads-which displays how REALLY talented Nick, A.J., Howie D., Brain, and Kevin are. :-)"
1,"Fighting is the first of several really strong hard rock albums that Thin Lizzy put out in the mid to late 1970's. Phil Lynott's songwriting really blossomed here and the band got their hard rock sound cold. ""Rosalie"" kicks off the album with a bang and rocks harder than the Bob Seger original.  ""Fighting My Way Back"" is a joyous yet pounding rocker as Phil Lynott's vocals roll with venom on the verses while Brian Downey's drumming is laced with both conviction and grace. As many reviewers have stated, this is where the band really got their trademark unison guitar sound down and Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson really shine on the jazzy turns heavy ""For Those Who Love to Live"" and the soulful ""Wild One"" among others. The band also reveals two of their best heavy songs in the murder tale ""Suicide"" and the wicked ""Ballad of a Hard Man"". The remaining tunes (the ones that didn't make their live albums or compilations) are quite mellow but all of them, particularly ""King's Vengeance"" and ""Silver Dollar"" really grow on you. Longtime fans know how good this is. If you only know them for the ""hits"" or the Jailbreak album, pick up or download Fighting. You'll like it and then you'll want more Lizzy."
1,"This is surely Don Henley's best album, ripe with not only his trademark sarcastically, clever, and sometimes cynically honest lyrics; but with full-out music and arrangements. Beautiful, reflective songs such as the title track, If Dirt Were Dollars, and New York Minute are among his best. Also, rounding out the album, are heartfelt ballads like The Heart of the Matter and The Last Worthless Evening. The former is one of my favorite ballads, and the latter is noteworthy for it's clever lyrics. If you're looking for a Don Henley album, this wouldn't be a bad place to start."

1,"B-Legit holds it down for the Yay Area but not with &quot;The Click&quot; but solo wise. He makes sure you feel this album with knockin' beats and lyrics showing you that he's not in 40 waters shadow. Not only does he put it down by himself but he features some of the top rappers puttin' it down for California. I recommend this album to everyone who likes E-40, Suga T, D-Shot, and &quot;The Click&quot; because B-Legit shows he's a major part of &quot;The Click&quot;"
1,"This sounds just as mind-blowing, sexy, seductive, and way ahead of its time as it did in 1981 when I first bought the LP when I was like 13 years old - been a big Grace fan ever since, but I don't think she's made a more consistent, ground-breaking and just...well...PERFECT album.  The songs here - Walking in the Rain, Pull Up to the Bumper, Feel Up, Use Me, Demolition Man, etc. - you could record them tomorrow, and they would STILL sound like nothing else around.  Grace is/was a singular artist; I just wish she would get more credit than she receives - and while you're at it, why not RE-ISSUE her sadly, glaringly out of print early LPs like MUSE, etc.?"
1,"I got this CD a month after its release(Christmas Day, to be exact)and though at first I didn't listen to the whole thing from beginning to end(due to the fact that there were SIXTEEN songs on the album) I began to  enjoy it with more listens. Since there is no half-stars on the rating  system, I actually give it 4 and a half stars because I don't care for that  version of &quot;You're Still the One&quot;, which is why I was excited  when I found out that there was going to be an internaional version  released with that version on there. Overall, a great CD."
1,"THE BAND: Rudolf Schenker (guitars), Klause Meine (vocals), Matthias Jabs (guitars), Francis Buchholz (bass), Herman Rarebell (drums & percussion).THE DISC: (1982) 9 songs clocking in at approximately 37 minutes. Digitally remastered and reissued in 1997. Included with the disc is a 3-page foldout containing song credits and lyrics, one band picture, and thank you's. All music written by Rudolf Schenker. All lyrics written by Meine and Rarebell. Label - Mercury/Polygram.COMMENTS: As far as I'm concerned (like so many reviewers here as well), this is the Scorpions at their peak. This is the band's break-through album. The Scorpions' enjoyed mild success in their native Germany with hits from earlier albums from the 1970's (""The Zoo"", ""Loving You Sunday Morning"", ""Holiday"", etc), but the album ""Blackout"" made them global superstars. The song ""No One Like You"" was their first worldwide smash hit - and with good reason. It still sounds fresh decades later. Some awesome deep album cuts like the rocking ""Dynamite"", ""Now!"" and ""Blackout""; as well as the slower songs like ""When The Smoke Is Going Down"" or ""You Give Me What I Need"". The Scorpion's next album ""Love At First Sting"" (1984) might have sold more records, but it was because of it's predecessor ""Blackout"". Note - check out any of their compilations or 'live' albums, and ""Blackout"" is the best represented on each. Though ""Blackout"" is short at only 9 songs and just under 37 minutes - there is absolutely no filler here. ""Blackout"" is the band's heaviest and most solid album ever produced. The 24-bit digitally remastered disc has crisp sound production. Classic disc."
1,"This is an OK CD but it could be better. 4 songs that I like on this CD are Don't let Him Go, Keep On Loving You, Take It On The Run and Tough Guys. On Tough Guys I like the intro with The Little Rascals. That just adds so much to the song. Keep On Loving You is a very good love song. Don't Let Him Go has very good drum work on it. Take It On The Run has always been one of my favorite songs of REO. I do not care for the other mix of songs on this CD. For Instance, In Your Letter I think they are trying to bring back the early 60's music of Please, Mister Postman and I just hate that song. REO has done a lot better and that is why I gave it only 3 Stars."
0,"How the son of a country star could claim to have hillbilly credibility is frankly beyond me, but there he is. For the most part, Hank sounds like just what he really is, a poseur whining about the trails of being a rich rock star. He does hit the mark on occasion as with `The American Dream' and `A Country Boy Can Survive' but mostly this is just fluff"
1,"Most of us here in the states never heard ELTON JOHN until YOUR SONG. This disc was a melodical feast .I NEED YOU TO TURN TO ,SIXTY YEARS ON,TAKE ME TO THE PILOT,BORDER SONG my two favorites  THE GREATEST DISCOVERY and THE KING MUST DIE.One listen you knew ELTON was gonna be around a long long time."
1,"Elton John-Madman Across The Water ****The dynamic duo of Bernie and Elton are to pop music what Mick Jagger and Keith Richards are to rock n' roll. In the early days Bernie would crank out some excellent lyrics (for the most part) and Elton would create beautiful melodies to complement the lyrics, and Madman Across The Water is one of the very best examples of the duo before they called it quits on each other.As 'Tiny Dancer' prances it's way out of your speakers you can really tell you are about to here some pure British pop bliss. Needless to say 'Tiny Dancer' went on to become one of his biggest hits due to it's lush instrumentation and picturesque lyrics, with just a slight country twang. It is among El tons all time best. 'Levon' follows next, and aside from, 'Mona Lisa's And Mad Hatters' off Honky Chateau it might just be his very best track. The story telling lyrics and great piano work make for one memorable track. 'Razor Face' aside from being sandwiched between two classics is quite the amazing tune itself. In El tons canon it stands alone as it sounds nothing like the rest of his work and must be heard to truly understand and appreciate. The title track, and focal point of the album 'Madman Across The Water' runs next and boy is it epic. Shock-pop at it's finest. At a staggering length the song never bores and is always haunting. 'Indian Sunset' is quite the adventure. Really the only song that could follow the title track. It is up, it's down, slow then fast. The sudden tempo changes mixed with the creative instrumentation paint a picture in your head to follow the lyrics making this one of Elton and Bernie's most memorable ventures together.Now this is where they lose me. The rest of the album I could honestly do with out. 'Holiday Inn' to me is pointless and annoying. 'Tiny Dancer' had some twang to it while 'Rotten Peaches' sounds like Elton and Bernie are trying to do Hank Williams Sr. and well that just doesn't fly. 'All The Nasties' is for lack of better terms or care is just plain stupid. While 'Goodbye' could have redeemed the later side of the album even it could have been discarded and Elton could have just released this as an EP in my book.Over all I still gives this a four star review because the good is amazing, and while the bad does smell pretty rank....Elton at his best is chilling and his best here is just that. Totally worth checking out!"
1,"Bob Marley and the Wailers were really on that night in London in 1975.  Like many great live albums in the pantheon of rock music they were able to find their groove early on and it does not stop until the very end of the album.  Bob's singing is as passionate and heartfelt as a blues singer and often times is even more so.  His &quot;sisters,&quot; the female back-up singers, only enhance the songs because their voices are so beautiful.  The guitar and bass playing is, with most reggae, rythmic and melodic and it's impossible to keep from nodding your head or tapping your feet to the beat.  The guitar player pulls off some really great solos that once again only enhances the feeling of the song.  The organ is rythmic and improves the already incredibly tight sound of the rythm section.  It was at this gig that the legendary live recording of &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot; took place.  Perhaps even more impressive is &quot;Get up, stand up&quot; which makes you want to start your own revolution against crooked politicians and everything else that is wrong with this world.  &quot;Stand up for your right&quot;... that's damn right, Bob.  My favourite tracks have to be &quot;Trenchtown Rock,&quot; a perfect opening track, &quot;Lively up yourself,&quot; &quot;Get up, stand up,&quot; and a SWEET song called &quot;Kinky Reggae.&quot;  The bass playing on that song just makes me wanna cry from joy it is so good.  Even though it goes without saying, buy this album as soon as possible.  One Love."
1,"""Elemental"" is quite more than that, as a matter of fact. Not only does it introduce the band to a new decade, after the eighties during which they harvested one hit after another. It is the first TFF album after Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal parted ways, leaving the latter to produce arguably one of the best albums of the band... makes you wonder how much did Smith actually contribute to their sound, but that is just speculation, or maybe not?As for the album specifically, though ""Break it Down Again"" is the track that made it famous, it's far from the best song. The opening track is fabulous. ""Mr. Pessimist"" and ""Gas Giants"" both remind of Talk Talk, which is to say a lot to me, considering they are one of my favorite acts. And ""Brian Wilson Said"" and the closing track leave you more than wanting more: they show the great musicianship and songwriting that will continue to make Roland Orzabal legendary.Simply put, this is an album not to leave on the table. It belongs in the shelves of any serious music collector. Get it so you can ""get it""."
1,"ABBA (Annifrid, Benny, Bj&ouml;rn and Agnetha) are the super group from Sweden who dominated the UK charts, and most of the rest of the world in the 70s, with their trademark piano riffs, light fluffy pop, and girl group choruses. Great musicians who penned all of their songs/hits.They had 18 top ten hits in the UK, 9 of which were no.1s (surpassed only by Madonna, Cliff Richard, Elvis Presley and The Beatles) and this was their 9th no.1 album in a row in the UK.Most of their UK top 10 hits are featured on this collection (except `Summer night city'). Opening track `Dancing queen' with its great piano, disco beat, and catchy vocals was their sole US no.1 single.Other classics are the melancholic yet sweet `The winner takes it all' (inspired by their personal break ups), `Super trouper' (about life in the spotlight), `Knowing me knowing you', and the slightly reggae-ish pop of `One of us'..Then there are the fantastic ballads `SOS', `Fernando' and `Chiquitita', and earlier rockers like `Waterloo' (their Eurovision winner), and `Mama mia' (from where the very successful musical borrows its name).The CD I have is a UK version which comes with a bonus DVD with 18 of their videos.The CD booklet is chock full of great photos, as well as the ABBA story.Cool or not, syrupy sweet or not, these are great songs which have stood up well to the test of time, and are being rediscovered by a new generation of listeners. A gold collection indeed."
1,"I first discovered R. Kelly and his talent back in 1995; two years after 12 Play was released. I listened to 12 Play dozens of times and I just became overwhelmed by his skills and his ""raunchy"" lryics. Released in 1993, 12 Play was where R. Kelly became a true R&B superstar. It was a concept album that showcased his talents and versatility perfectly. The opening track, ""Your Body's Callin'"" is a classic. It's a smooth and sexy ballad with airy instrumentation and the amazing vocals. ""Bump And Grind"" is another song that will go down as his most popular tune. The song has memorable bouncy beats and throbbing lyrics, that make this an instant classic. ""Homie, Lover, Friend"", ""Freak Dat Body"", and ""Back To The Hood Of Things""; all show off his rapping skills with the G-Funk inspired beats and the awesome hooks. ""It Seems Like You're Ready"" is a slow jam with R. setting the bar high on his romantic persona. ""I Like The Crotch On You"" is another one of Kelly's X-rated themed songs with the G-Funk inspired rhythms, but after half of the song ends, he tones it down by singing with other male vocalists about the ""cons"" who hates his music. He also plays the piano on there. ""Summer Bunnies"" is an upbeat song about the ladies. ""For You"" is a personal favorite of mine. It's a nice ballad with smoothed-out vocals, romantic spanish guitars, and the lushy strings. ""Sadie"" has R. doing a cover song of The Spinners' classic. He wonderfully dedicates the song to his mother. ""Sex Me"" is an 11-minute epic that has R. singing the most notorious lyrics of his career. It's a well-crafted ballad with the airy synthesizers, bumpy drumming, and spacey vocals. The title track, ""12 Play"" is what I consider to be the climax of the whole album. It's a lovely, slow jam with memorable hooks. Overall, all I can say about 12 Play is that it's Kelly's most raunchest and unified album, in every sense. His 2000 album, TP-2.Com, the sequel to this album, 12 Play, might've been more sexually explicit and thugged-out, but 12 Play just took him to a whole new level: bringing him to a mainstream audience and redefining his image. I really think it's a 1990's R&B classic and one of R. Kelly's best recordings. A"
1,"I consider myself a really big ELTON JOHN fan and this album is just lousy .In context it's a bit more rocky than the 1970 -1975earlier lps.But after listen to this album even after many of his lesser ""hit albums"" it just doesn't do it for me now or then.ISLAND GIRL though a big top 40 hit is down right corny.I really don't give a hoot about DAN DARE or the STREET KIDS.The only saving grace is I FEEL LIKE A BULLET..On a possitive note SUGAR ON THE FLOOR one of the cd extras is a vocal beauty and a really nice song written by kikie dee.The other down side is that this was the first album without the likes of NIGEL OLSSON and DEE MURRAY"
1,"A DEACADE OF HITS 1969-1979 is a wonderful compilation of Allman Brothers classics from the 70s. All of their albums from this period, except for WIN, LOSE, OR DRAW, are represented by one to four songs. There are so many exceptional cuts here that nothing really stands out. The fact that past and present members of the Allmans advocate sanctions against countries which convict foreign tourists for trumped-up crimes proves that these guys have good hearts as well as lots of great music, making this CD/cassette an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience. You should buy this one while you're buying the first five albums and ENLIGHTENED ROGUES."
1,"After 18 years in hiding, Odessa is finally back where it rightfully belongs - competing for `Best of the 60's Concept Albums.' Odessa is a symphonic tragedy of love and loss at sea. The original album had an  elegant and luxurious velvet cover. Technological innovation has negated  the cover, but the sophistication and grandeur of the music  remain.Melody and harmony are the Bee Gees strong suit. `Black Diamond,'  `Melody Fair,' and `Lamplight' challenge the most infectious  Lennon-McCartney melodies. Maurice, Barry and Robin share lead vocals.  Maurice and Barry are provocative on the more whimsical stuff (Edison,  Melody Fair, I Laugh In Your Face). Barry sings naturally - he's no  pathetic castrado here. And Robin's nasal vibrato is ideal for the love  songs (Black Diamond, Lamplight, First of May). If the Everly Brothers own  the patent on flawless sibling harmony, then the Bee Gees borrowed it for  Odessa. Their harmonies are dazzling.On a literal note, the majority of  the lyrics are nonsensical: `It took a thousand years to find out why  you'll never see my face again,' and `my brother is friendly for reasons if  I am the same just for four hundred seasons we all live in rain.' Matter  not. You'll sing them regardless. Odessa is a mushy and overblown sixty  minutes of beauty, tragedy and love."
1,"Actually, I give this one:---4.5 Stars------The first time I heard the title tune, I knew it was a hit.  Much had changed between his previous album and this, his third.  The country hillbilly influence was still there, but the twang guitar had given away to a hard rocking, driving guitar.  The sound on this album is at times huge, as witnessed by the big bass impacts on the title track.  The change in production, coupled with a change of mucical direction made for a totally new sound.Critics christened Copperhead Road as Earle's rock album, but that was gross oversimplification.  Sure, half of the tunes did rock, some of them to more effect than many bands that were trying so hard to rock.  But it was the contrast given by the ballads that makes Copperhead Road memorable.  Check out ""Nothing But A Child"" or ""Even When I'm Blue"", both excellent tunes, both excellent counterbalances to rockers such as Snake Oil.  Classic disc."
1,"This dudes flow and lyrical prowess is truly amazing. He reminds me a bit of Rakim.The pro-black, Nation of Islam type lyrics are not enough to bother me either. His anti-white lyrics are overshadowed by his gift on the mic and the hard-hitting, funky as hell beats behind him.Cop this CD if you are into politically conscience, rapid fire flow lyrics, with some amazing beats. This is one of the hottest CDs that you've probably never heard."
1,"I first heard this at the dentist! I put on the headphones and settled in for drilling.  At the first note, I was hooked! Song after song was fantastic! I went out and bought it immediately. All the tunes are extremely funky and soulful. I don't know why this wasn't a bigger hit, it's really a terrific CD. Every song is catchy and your head will be bobbing and your feet will be tapping. Buy it."
1,"In my view, this album by itself represents the birth of New Wave (that is, before it had a name).  When the Cars released this, their first, there simply was no other sound like it--and it would take years before other artists even came close to reproducing the cool, beat-laden, tech-heavy resonances of such songs as Good Times Roll, My Best Friend's Girl, Just What I needed, You're All I've Got Tonight, and the terrific combination of Moving in Stereo and All Mixed Up.  In short, mock all you want the haircuts and vapid lyrics of the boy bands which came later, but this one is real, hard, and as original as it gets."
1,title song is the best on here anyway mtume spokwe out against sampling and ironic he founded the rap group cosmic slop shop plus he's been sampled himself.
1,"Simon and Garfunkel's fifth and final studio album marked their commercial peak. Though many fans find the previous album,Bookends, to be the apex of the duo's artistic creativity, it's hard to think of another pop act that exited with a success comparable to this album and its title track. Despite Garfunkel's initial reservation, ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" made good on Simon's feeling that it was the best song he'd ever written, topping the Hot 100 for six weeks and winning Grammy awards for song and record of the year. Though the recording is deeply tied to Garfunkel's brilliant vocal performance, the composition spawned dozens of successful covers, including Aretha Franklin's Grammy-winning R&B; chart-topper and Buck Owens' Top 10 single. In the 1970s it became a staple in Elvis Presley's stage show, and cover versions continue to be recorded to this day, with a live version from the 2010 Grammys having charted, and the television show Glee having featured the song the same year.But the title song is far from the album's only jewel. With Garfunkel away for the better part of 1969 filmingCatch 22, Simon was left to work alone, and apparently consider a post-Garfunkel career. ""The Only Living Boy in New York City"" and ""Why Don't You Write Me"" are easily heard to be contemplations of Simon's isolation, while ""So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright"" includes the telling lyric ""so long Frank Lloyd Wright, all of the nights we harmonized `til dawn,"" an allusion seemingly tied to Garfunkel's study of architecture at Columbia. The seeds of Simon's multicultural solo career can be heard in the Peruvian flute of ""El Condor Pasa (If I Could),"" broad rhythm instrumentation of ""Cecilia,"" and reggae styling of ""Why Don't You Write Me."" The album topped the chart, won Grammys for engineering, arranging and Album of Year, and spun off four hit singles.This CD/DVD set marks the 40th anniversary of the album's January 1970 release, and combines the original eleven tracks with two hours of video material. The DVD includes the duo's rare 1969 CBS television special, Songs of America, and a new documentary, The Harmony Game: The Making of Bridge Over Troubled Water. The special, aired only once on November 30, 1969, has been bootlegged many times, but never before officially reissued. At the time of its airing its social and political viewpoints - particularly its explicit anti-Vietnam war messages - caused sponsor Bell Atlantic to pull out. But with backing from CBS (the same network that had fired the Smothers Brothers earlier in the year), the program found a new sponsor (Alberto Culver, the makers of Alberto VO5) and was aired uncut.Both video features are extraordinary documents. The 1969 special, originally shot on film and pieced together from two different sources, is a post-Woodstock look at America in which Simon and Garfunkel seem to be trying to explain the younger generation to adult viewers. They surface the questions and doubts on the minds of many young people in 1969, starting with the incalculable loss of the decade's heroes - JFK, MLK and RFK - and reflections on the brutality of poverty and the activism of the farm workers, UAW and Poor People's March. First-time director (and future famous actor) Charles Grodin skillfully mixed compelling newsreel imagery with voiceovers and interviews, and interwove performance footage and behind-the-scenes shots of the duo at work. Simon and Garfunkel are spied working out arrangements of new songs, rehearsing their stage band and recording in the studio.The making-of documentary repeats some moments from the '69 special, but adds context with discussions of the program's creation and controversies. There's additional concert footage and contemporary interviews with Simon, Garfunkel, their manager, Mort Lewis, their engineer/producer, Roy Halee, and two of the studio players (drummer Hal Blaine and bassist Joe Osborn) featured on the album.. The conversation with Halee is particularly illuminating, as he describes how the duo's studio sound was produced, and provides specifics of the album's tracks. The song-by-song discussion reveals numerous details on personnel (Fred Carter Jr., for example, played guitar on ""The Boxer,"" Joe Osborn played an 8-string bass on ""Only Living Boy in New York City,"" and Larry Knechtel developed the gospel piano on ""Bridge Over Troubled Water""), recording locations, production techniques, and brightly highlights the creativity everyone concerned poured into the album.Missing from the CD are the bonus tracks (""Feuilles-O"" and ""Bridge Over Troubled Water (Demo Take 6)"") available on earlier releases, as well as the oft-bootlegged session track ""Cuba Si, Nixon No,"" but the video disc is priceless and a fantastic bonus to celebrate this album's anniversary.

1,"This is Europe's 1983 debut album that was not available in the U.S. until around 1988-89. Europe was a quartet at this point in time (sans full-time keyboardist) with the line up of singer Joey Tempest, guitarist John Norum, bassist and group mainstay John Leven and original drummer Tony Reno.  Although Europe could stand a little room for improvement as songwriters, from a performace standpoint they were already hitting the mark.  Especially the sonic guitar playing of John Norum.If you love a good, bombastic, Stratocaster guitar rock album, with playing low on pretension, this is a good one to get. Singer Joey Tempest is in fine form as a vocalist at his young age, but John Norum also is as well a guitarist.  Not only was Norum was already playing exceptionally well for such a young guitarist, he was one of the most underrated and one of the best hard rock gutiarists of the 80's.If you had started listening to Europe with ""The Final Countdown"" CD, go backwards in their catalouge instead of forwards.  Go with this stellar debut and their second album ""Wings Of Tommorow"".  These three CD'S are the best representation of their work."

1,"YES I AM, released just as Melissa Etheridge was coming out publicly as a lesbian, is also her best album ever. This time, critics on both the East and West coasts raved about the album, and some of the negative reviews it got in the Midwest and the South were from people who disagreed with Etheridge's lifestyle and didn't give the album a good listen. I remember that when I was in a program in Connecticut in the 90s, a few of the more conservative staff tried to help me develop hobbies so that I wouldn't listen to this album, but that's because they seemed to have an issue with anyone who was gay or lesbian, which in eastern Connecticut wasn't widely accepted at the time (though it was tolerated more in Boston, MA; Portland, ME; and Burlington, VT). That's a pity, because this CD is great and expresses a wide variety of human emotion."
1,"In 1993, Cyndi Lauper returned from a 4 year hiatus with Hat Full Of Stars.BEFORE:Cyndi Lauper was a 1980's superstar who had fallen on hard times, when word got out that she was putting a new cd out, everyone predicted comeback, as acts like Boy George and Duran Duran scored comebacks that year.AFTER:the album didn't quite give Cyndi the renaissance she expected, peaking at #112.  However, it insured a cult following that lasts to this day of fans who realize that she is a great songwriter, and she's come a long way from the Girls Just Wanna Have Fun days.  She scored 2 modest hits off it,  the Adult Contemporary hit &quot;Who Let In The Rain&quot; and the Dance hit &quot;That's What I Think&quot;.Hat Full Of Stars ranks among Cyndi's best albums, and it also seems to be a personal fave of Cyndi's.  It displayed a more alternative/Lillith Fair side to her that would peak with her next album, Sisters Of Avalon.  Not as instantly accessable as She's So Unusual or A Night To Remember, but a worthy listen.  Sally's Pigeons is one of her best songs ever."
1,"The Backstreet Boys started out Europe,because they felt that the US were'nt ready them yet.! And when they released this CD it caused them to explode into the USA spawning 5 top 10 hit singles!!!

1,"This album seems like an album people both love and hate. For me, I am closer to the love side, but then again, it's DM, and some of these tracks make the album more than worth owning. Martin sometimes sings on some of the weaker tracks, but not on this album. His two tracks are some of the strongest on the album. The only thing that brings the album down a little bit is that the instrumentals don't really do much, even the closing (unlisted) ""Junior Painkiller."" It has my favorite DM song, ""Freestate,"" which has this kind of worldly and trippy feel, and shows a great maturity of the band. I think I prefer ""Violator"" and ""Songs of Faith and Devotion"", but as it stands, those are my two favorite DM albums (but I also like a few others more). While it may not have the kind of lively energy that made everything from ""Black Celebration"" to ""Songs"" great, it works perfectly fine on this record. Some mourn the loss of Alan, but for me, this group never put anything bad, and while I feel he is what turned DM into a great band, I wouldn't disregard everything else in particular. Totally worth a listen."
1,"Damn, seeing that Outkast had a movie and a new album out, I realized that I haven't reviewed not only one of their albums except their greatest hits album. Outkast has really represented the hometown since '93 when V103 (ATLiens know this station) used to bump ""Player's Ball"" on the radio airwaves. And ""Southerplayaisticmuzik"" back in mid '94 help place Atlanta on the map. Two years later, they come out with their sophomore album ""ATLiens"" in Sept 1996.This time, they flipped their whole concept around compared to their first one. While their debut was mostly about pimpin and smoking weed, this one was more ""out there"". The production by Organized Noize was more laid back and smoother sounding. Their first single ""Elevators (Me & U)"" was heavily rotated back in summer of '96, and everybody was trying to memorize that hook ""Me & U/Your momma and your cousin too..."" (lol). Antwan ""Big Boi"" Patton and Andre ""3000"" Benjamin's rhymes took a side step (not saying they didn't improve, but just went a different direction with their rhymes). On the song ""Two Dope Boyz In A Caddilac"" would be a good example of what I'm saying, as well as their second single ""ATLiens"". The most ""out there"" concept on this album would be the two songs ""Millenium"" and ""Extraterrestrial"" that will garuntee to have you head nod. The latter song may sound wierd to many listeners because the song doesn't have any drums, so it sounds like they're freestyling accapella.Guest wise is pretty dope too. Goodie Mob's Khujo and T-Mo appear on ""Mainstream"" as well as Cee-Lo, Big Gipp, and Cool Breeze on ""Decatur Psalm"". Witchdoctor would handle the hook on the song ""Ova Da Woodz"".As much as I LOVE this album, I have to gripe about one thing (and I may come back and edit this to a 10 rating, because this should have been on the greatest hits album). ""Jazzy Belle"" was the third single back in early '97, and if you remember it was remixed with Babyface singing the hook to the song. On this album, that isn't on here (eventhough the origonal was a good song) I believe that this album should be remasted and that should be on here. Thats my only tiny gripe on this album. Otherwise this is an awesome album to catch musical vibes off of. If you're new to this Outkast, I highly recommend ""Dre and Big Boi Presents: Outkast"" before you buy any of their albums.Lyrics: A+Production: A+Guest Appearances: AMusical Vibes: AOverall: A+Other Notable Tracks: Wailin', Wheelz Of Steel, 13th Floor/Growing OldChandler Infamous, and I'm ghost, Peace!"
1,"Coming on the heels of 1982's successful Screaming for Vengeance, Judas Priest hoped their next release, Defenders of the Faith(1984), would be their commercial breakthrough. However that was not to be, and soon the flavor of heavy metal epitomized by Priest would be swept away by thrash and hair(ugh!) metal.As for Defenders itself, musically they kept to their heavy metal roots and ""Screaming"" formula with about the same success. ""Freewheel Burning"" ""Rock Hard, Ride Free"" ""The Sentinel"" ""Love Bites"" and ""Some Heads are Gonna Roll"" are all scorching metal tracks, and truly the best ones on the album. ""Night Comes Down"" is a slow, ballady, pop-rock song that's rather average overall, while ""Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith"" goes way over the top and falls flat, as do the rather sick lyrics of ""Eat Me Alive"". While Rob Halford delivers his normally awesome vocals, his lyric-writing continues to slide into the same pattern of ""We are Judas Priest. We are the Metal Gods. We are the best band in the whole world"" over and over, which gets kind of annoying on Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith""(the most obvious example).Overall, Defenders is inconsistent, but the plusses outweigh the cons and this one is highly recommended to someone looking for more 80s Priest(pre-Turbo, that is...then again I like to think they never made Turbo). The heavier sections of the album will not disappoint."
1,"There's a good reason why this album sold over 18 million copies in the U.S.  This album blends country with rock/pop better than any album before it.  And Twain once again shows off her song-writing capabilities on her this, her third Lp.  This is her second effort produced by husband Robert &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange and he certainly helps make it shine.  Come On Over was certainly worth of all the Grammy nominations and wins it received.  But no one should criticize Twain for &quot;going pop&quot;, because all that does is draw more of a fan base to country music.  It certainly did for me.  There must be a reason why we have 3 copies of it in our house."
1,"THis was a adult listening top of soul cd. It's about a theme of brotherhood and was not supposed to be a funky release of dancable songs. Instead this is full of ballads and lush arrangements and on that level it is a masterpiece, it's a artist doing something on a different level. It's easy listening but beautiful but it's NOT a dance cd at all. Think a mixture of pop and soul with easy flowing songs and you have this gem.  Plus it has the big  hit 'what's going on' on here as well. Funk fans may not dig this one but you need to broaden your horizons then."
1,"Just to be different, I'm not gonna spend this review rambling on  endlessly about whom Nick Drake sounds like or whom he's influenced.  Instead, I'm gonna talk about his music -- specifically, in this case, the  album &quot;Pink Moon&quot;.  Ready?  Let's begin:All of Drake's albums  are pretty terrific.  &quot;Five Leaves Left&quot; is wispy and  fragile-sounding in a typical late-sixties folksy kind of way.  The only  thing that makes it rise above the sandal-wearing fray is the strength of  the songs themselves -- which, when you think about it, is a pretty good  way to rise above the fray, if one feels compelled to do such a  thing....Drake's second release, &quot;Bryter Layter&quot;, is something  quite different.  This time, the songs (while still -- genetically, at  least -- wispy and fragile) are beefed-up through a more ambitious (did  someone say intrusive?) production technique.  The end result is intriguing  (&quot;Hazy Jane I &amp; II&quot;) and burdensome (&quot;Poor Boy&quot;) in  equal measure.  Call it a draw.Which brings us to &quot;Pink Moon&quot;.  Apparently, Drake was uncomfortable (surprise, surprise) with the pop star  treatment of the &quot;Bryter Layter&quot; material because &quot;Pink  Moon&quot;'s stark, acoustic offerings are obviously a bold reaction to it.  These songs are so quiet and introspective that they make &quot;Five  Leaves Left&quot; sound like Deep Purple's &quot;Machine Head&quot;.  But  that is exactly why &quot;Pink Moon&quot; is Nick Drake's crowning  achievement.  If anyone's songs were meant to be recorded in a bedroom with  nothing but a few wooded instruments and whispered vocals for  accompaniment, it's Drake's.  Just listen to &quot;Road&quot;, &quot;From  the Morning&quot;, or the astounding, otherworldly title track and tell me  that I'm wrong...."
1,"After the luke-warm reaction to his ""Walking With A Panther"" album LL went back to his old stomping grounds in an attempt to rejuvenate his talents and come back out stronger. It was here while his grandmother (Big Momma)spawned the words of encouragement to her disillusioned grandson ""Just Knock'em Out"" and so we got this album. LL promptly hooked up with Marley Marl and together they came up with this, the 1st of 2 albums they did together. Marley's production skills were+still are legendary. His beats are bone crunching and the samples that accompany them are always original. They percussion on this album in the form of piano riffs and guitar licks were simply mindblowing as they were used in perfect ration to the rock hard beats and funky basslines. All of this was before LL even ripped a verse!!!!!! Around this time LL was in afew beefs with Kool Moe Dee and Ice-T so alot of his verses were heavy battle type rhymes were he took no prisoners. The title track alone was, is and always will be 1 of the greatest diss records of ALL TIME!! The opening track ""The Boomin' System"" was about the systems that heads were fitting into their cars and that whole car culture that was peaking in the early 90's. The legendary line ""2 mile an hour so everybody sees you"" still gets me amped. ""Around The Way Girl"" was huge back then and still holds its own as a decent rap ballad by an mc that has mastered the genre. ""Eat 'Em Up L Chill"", ""Mr. Good Bar"" and ""Murdergram"" are all tight head nodders that showcase his impressive, more amped, stronger, rejuvinated style to the tee. ""Murdergram"" is a live performance that will literally blow your mind, what breath control??!! ""Cheesy Rat Blues"" is a tale about how the tide can turn and you could be left without a pot to p*ss in and what could happen to the people that are supposedly by your side, in times like this. A very personal track. ""Farmers Blvd"" was a track were LL shouts out his crew and afew of them for some mic time and put it down nicely. Next you hear the immortal words ""c'mon man..."" and the horns and then all hell breaks loose with ""Mama Said Knock You Out"" exploding through the speakers. One of my all time favourite hiphop songs EVER. ""Milky Cereal"" explores the subject of getting laid. Nice beat and funny rhymes. ""Jingling Baby"" is a superior version than the 1 on the ""Walking With A Panther"" album, in my opinion. Marley's production is top notch. ""To Da Break Of Dawn"" is another diss joint where LL rips apart Ice-T and Kool Moe Dee with relative ease to be honest over a smooth hard beat laced with acid tongued rhymes that Im sure would still sting those cats now. ""6 Minutes Of Pleasure"" and ""The Power Of God"" were the only tracks that I thought were weaker back then and even more now. The last track that I havent mentioned is ""Illegal Search"", a humourous tale about the police and their treatment of his race but with a nice funny twist. Still after 16years this is a soundbomb. A timeless classic. He and hiphop certainly dont make joints like this anymore."
1,"In terms of the funk era of the early/mid 1970's? It was The Commodores,in terms of newly formed bands, who most thoroughly represented  the genre on Motown. Milan Williams,William King,Walter Orange,Thomas McClary and of course Lionel Richie in particular had now proven important members of a formidable musical team. Many of the bands members were multi instrumentalists. With their previous albumHot on the Tracks,the bands funk was at its most diverse and creative. Their funk was able to blend strong pop songwriting with hefty grooves that put them into the possible position of being a Southern version of Earth Wind & Fire in terms of success. Story goes that around this time,the bands co-producer James Anthony Carmichael had told Lionel that the songs he was writing for the Commodores didn't work. And that he should be recording the songs he was writing for other people instead. This album marks The Commodores at the exact point before that change began to seriously take place.""Squeeze The Fruit"",""Funny Feelings"",""Funky Situation"" and ""Patch It Up"" are all very much in the league of the classic 70's Commodores sound-that think,bass/guitar fried sound that...well to me always represented what made them distinct among the funk bands of that era. On the faster of those numbers? The feeling is almost rocking in a very clean and soulful way. On the slower numbers? The effect is very much in the Sly Stone vein-again with that Southern twist.  ""Heaven Knows"" can actually fool you. It starts out sounding like a mid tempo,melodic love ballad before spinning of into that Southern Sly Stone variant funk sound on the choruses. ""Won't You Come And Dance With Me"" and ""Funky Situation"" both have slightly more jazz oriented choruses as a wraparound for the heavy funk elements. ""Zoom"" is actually a very elaborate,cinematic ballad that contrasts heavily with the the countryish gospel leanings of the big hit ""Easy"" which closes out the album. ""Brick House"",with its bass line and cat calling is not only the best known Commodores funk hit but among their very sexiest as well.Just as a frame of reference,without introducing any needless musical spoilers? This would be the last Commodores album that would have this particular sound about it. Their final two albums of the 70'sNatural HighandMidnight Magicwould favor melodic soul/pop and slow Lionel Richie penned ballads to a far stronger degree than hard funk. At least in terms of how their albums were put together. I do realize their are people who would say that entire change was already underway by the time of this album. And if someone asked me over a decade ago I'd probably have agreed with them. But one thing I realize is even the Commodores slower numbers during this period represent part of a diverse,fuller funk/soul album package than they might've seemed. On this album? The slow songs are slow jams. Full of soul and full of cinematic funk. They have a rhythm and you can tap your foot to them. So when all things get done? This is in fact something of a coda on The Commodores classic funk sound. And a very strong one that any Commodores/Motown/funk admirer who doesn't already have it should seek out."
1,"The cd is just a flat out classic.I own every cd pac released while alive and this one, and The 7 Day Theory is my favorite of them all. This is a cd that you can easily play from start to finish without skipping any tracks. The album starts out strong with 3 classics: Hail Mary, Toss It Up, and To Live & Die in L.A. Then goes into a mix of social and fun songs, and finishes off with some political songs and a strong ending that compliments the intro.The worst part of this album, imo, is this stupid part in the song Me and My Girlfriend when you hear this girl shooting a gun yelling out things, just lame, but only a short part.The Tracks.1. Bomb First (Intro): 10/10 - Great intro, sets the stage.2. Hail Mary: 10/10 - Classic3. Toss It Up: 10/10 - Classic4. To Live & Die in L.A.: 10/10 - Classic5. Blasphemy: 10/10 - M.O.B. (I like the following part lol)""They say Moses split the Red SeaI split the blunt and rolled the fat one, I'm deadly""6. Life Of a New Outlaw: 9.5/10 - Good song7. Just Like Daddy: 9.5/10 - Another good song8. Krazy: 10/10 - I really like this song. This song is definitely in my top 5 favorite 2pac songs.9. White Man'z World: 9/10 - Pretty good song10. Me and My Girlfriend: 9/10 - Silly part that is annoying forced a 9 here.11. Hold ya Head: 10/10 - Another one of my favorites12. Against All Odds: 9.5/10 - Good song that finishes off the mood started in the intro, great way to end this cd imo."
0,"Together with the other guys in Eagles, Don Henley assured his immortal place in rock history. I wonder - how can a man who was a part of something so great as the Eagles release such a [bad] bunch of songs? I just don't get it! I owned this album for many years but when it was time to ""weed out"" my cd collection I decided that this one have to go. But before I sold it, I wanted to record the best songs from it, but I must admit that I couldn't find a single song I really like. So, now it's gone, and I have not missed it for even a split second!"

Other Billy Joel fans will have their favorite albums; but for me this one and Piano Man are tops!The CD track set begins with ""Big Shot;"" this number starts off with some great guitar as the drums and the percussion mark the beat. Billy sings perfectly of a woman who ""went over the line"" the night before when she was out on the town. ""Honesty,"" my favorite song on this album, features Billy singing with great sensitivity as he plays piano. Billy sings of how rare it is to find a lover who will love him for who he is rather than just pretending to love him and playing games. Awesome tune! Moreover, ""My Life"" has a great keyboard arrangement and Billy sings this without a superfluous note!""Zanzibar"" features Billy again singing at his best; he sings about a young man searching for romantic time alone with a woman he likes. ""Zanzibar"" is a terrific jazzy number with good guitar. ""Stiletto"" begins with a great horn solo; and Billy plays his piano to perfection. Billy sings this song about a man who stays with his woman even though she treats him poorly.""Half A Mile Away"" has a funky 1970s pop flavor to it that's very catchy; and Billy sings of taking some time for just himself. Love that piano, drums and percussion! The title track, ""52nd Street,"" is a short piece about a man having a good affair with his woman; the drums and percussion enhance the natural beauty of this ballad.There are some videos on this remastered CD; and the liner notes give you the songs credits, too.Billy Joel's 52nd Street remains a great album even today; this is timeless, ageless music that just couldn't ever be tossed aside. Hopefully Billy Joel will continue to entertain us for many years to come.Great job, Billy!"
1,"Picking just one favorite Luther Vandross album is a daunting task for me, but 1983's ""Busy Body"" is among his very best. A great mix of suave upbeat r&b and smooth ballads, Luther's third CD is a classic release that puts much of modern music to shame. The upbeat track ""For the Sweetness of Your Love"" has Luther at the top of his game with his butter-smooth voice, the song's memorable bassline, and its undeniable groove. ""Make Me a Believer"" is a killer love ballad that's become a beloved favorite among fans, while he shares the spotlight with Dionne Warwick in ""How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye."" But the real deal is the dynamite closer, the 9-minute soaring love song ""Superstar/Until You Come Back to Me."" In an age where overprodced, trendy, and image-conscious singers rule airwaves and collect platinum discs, it's refreshing to know that there are mature, serious vocalists who have a genuine passion for music. ""Busy Body"" is a timeless r&b classic that, without hesitation, belongs in your CD collection."
1,"right from the opening tones of &quot;if i were a bell,&quot; miles and  company (the classic quintet with john coltrane, red garland, paul  chambers, and philly joe jones) set the tone for a quietly swinging set of  cool jazz. miles continued to explore his own version of cool jazz (much  more bop oriented than west coast jazz), but here the sound is becoming  even more uncategorizable, more distinctly miles' own voice and timbre. he  explores melody and themes finding his own phrasing and expansions, leaving  plenty of room for the song to develop as it will. in sum, he uses silence  as part of the form, like ahmad jamal, for instance, creating tension and  setting fires within the tune. the band is stellar and one can hear  coltrane getting his own voice, as well, laying the foundations for what  was to come in a few years. well worth any price!"
1,"This cd is packed with timeless music. Rollins' performance on this classic from 1957 not only solidified him as one of the greatest tenors of his generation, but, along with all of the other material from his illustrious fifty plus year career, has stood the test of time to make him one of the all-time greatest musicians regardless of style. Backed by a duo of legends in bassist Ray Brown and drummer Shelly Manne, Rollins cooks from beginning to end. He is in prime form, still a relativly unknown tenor when this album came out, he plays like a man ahead of his years. Sonny's tone is hard, percussive, rasping, and even playful, a full spectrum of colors and moods. What makes this a truly great album is that every single note Rollins plays is a highlight. His soloing stands up to repeated listening and rewards the effort with something new each time through. Manne and Brown contribute fantastic performances of their own, matching Rollins by producing phenominal solos of their own. Even the usually aggravating practice of  sticking alternate takes behind the originals hardly makes a difference. Rollins, Manne, and Brown are so brimming with ideas, the longer alternates offer the listener just that much more of a good thing. This is one of those albums that needs to be in every jazz collection, even the cover photo is a classic. Buy this cd if you do not already own it, you will not be dissapointed."
1,"This is a truly wonderful display of musical innovation & inspiration. Rickey Wright, in his so called review of this album, stated that it wasn't a ""concept"" album.  Nonsense!  Earth, Wind & Fire were a concept band in and of themselves, every one of their albums from the decade of the 70's had 2 main concepts, Oneness & African Pride!  They understood the rich and unprecedented history of the African people worldwide and brought this knowledge in mystical terms to the masses.Like all great prophets before, Maurice White in particular & the Elements as a whole, spoke in parables and those with eyes to see and ears to hear were amazed and electrified at what was being revealed!  Their lyrical content was second to none and greatly under appreciated by ""so called critics"" like Rickey Wright. This album is one of the finest expressions of musical & lyrical genius as you'll find.""Serpentine Fire""- Pure power and mysticism, a song about the rising of the coiled, serpentine energy up the spine & through the Chakra's till it reaches the crown & enlightenment occurs!  Who truly understood the power and magic of this song with it's unmatched lyrics and hard funk influenced rhythms.  Those who study ancient eastern religions will understand this one totally.""Fantasy""- One of the hits off of this album that you hear all over FM radio & has been featured in a miriad of soundtracks to films. Beautiful piano intro that precludes some of the most astonishing strings & horns you'll ever here.  Lyrically, another masterpiece which those who've studied eastern religions will get without any problem.  The hints it gives about reincarnation and other brothers and sisters from other worlds shows Maurice's lyrical mastery.""Jupiter""- This is the song were the Phenix Horns get a chance to show off their other worldly talent with a blazing intro that burns throughout the entire song.  Great bass guitar work here by Verdine ""the Fire"" White as well.""Love's Holiday""- After a short interlude, then comes this beautiful ballad by Maurice White.  Pure poetry here as a lover asks the object of his affections, ""Would you mind, if I touched if i kissed if i held you tight till the morning light""! Maurice's gorgeous tenor shines in this song which ends with a nasty funk laced guitar solo by Johnnie Graham.  One of the true highlights of the album.""Brazillian Rhyme""- This is probably their most famous ""interlude"" ever.  It showcases the groups unparalled vocal harmonies with Phillip Bailey's falsetto leading the way!  Great Keyboard by Larry Dunn and Verdine tears it up on the bass!!""I'll write a Song for You""- This may be my personal favorite on the album. Beautiful song written by Phillip and Al McKay, this song is both a love ballad & a mystical adventure.  Pure poetry in motion about a lover describing his undeniable devotion to his soulmate. Stunning acoustic guitar by McKay & Graham on this one with lush orchestrations & the Elements outstanding melodies and vocal harmonies.""Magic Mind""- This is a pure funk tour de force!!  Great keyboards, horns, bass and nasty rhythm guitar work.  Lyrics are tremendous with lots hidden messages along the way.""Runnin""- This is the instrumental selection that has everything you'd expect for Earth, Wind & Fire!  For those who have the double LP ""Gratitude"", this will remind you somewhat of the jam ""New World Symphony"".  Great movements and progressions throughout the song with nasty trumpet & sax solos by the Phenix Horns!""Be Ever Wonderful""- After the most gorgeous intro i've ever heard (the longer version on their box set is other worldly) comes this song.  It has a pure gospel feel to it with simple yet profound lyrics and incredible vocals, horns!  This song builds to an absolute flurry of brilliance at the end with the vocals soaring to places that just having never been reached before!This group was able to bring together many elements from Jazz, Funk, R&B;, Rock, Latin & Classical musical influences and merge them together into a sound that was not then nor has it since been duplicated.  They truly were the Elements of the Universe and the Greatest Band of all time!"
1,"In the same way that one becomes colder the further away from the sun travel, the quality of MJs CDs/LPs diminished the further away he departed from his best CDOff the Wall. As this is the CD after the great 1979 release, he still has something in his favor. By & large he was still blessed to be working with Quincy Jones & the under valued Rod Templeton. At this time he wasn't chasing the title of King of Pop, or following the latest trends. He was also using live instruments ( the lack of which, I feel, diluted his future CDs) Add to this base, the writing skills of Toto, the guitar skills of Eddie Van Halen, the vocal 'rap' of Vincent Price, and you have all the ingredients of a major, major hit.This was the first LP (as it was then) that I ever purchased, and I still have it to this day. Whilst this release has its poppier moments ('Beat It & Thriller' being prime examples) there are some quality moments on offer. I have a soft spot for 'The Girl is mine'. Maybe because I can remember hearing it on 'Top of the Pops' and being melted away with it. 'PYT' is another favorite (co-written by James Ingram, and featuring Janet Jackson as a vocal Pretty Young Thing) the much sampled Toto offering 'Human Nature', and the gorgeous 'Lady in My Life'Subsequent releases from Mr. Jackson would suffer with being compared to this big money seller, and the quality would diminish as a result"
1,"I like most people was wondering when the real PAC was going to come back and not the Death Row produced PAC.  Don't get me wrong I loved ""All Eyez On Me"" and the tracks on the ""Gang Related"" & ""Gridlock'd"" soundtrack produced by Death Row but PAC was at his best early on before Death Row and as evidenced by this Makaveli album and the rumors that he was bolting Death Row to start his own thing, was on to bigger and better.  After selling 7 million + of that double CD, and the first rapper to do so I might add, following up ""All Eyez"" was not going to be easy.  But listening to this CD is was clear that PAC wasn't trippin off the record sales, he just wanted to be free do what PAC wanted to do.  Which still lends credence to the fact that I still think Suge had PAC set up.  When have you known someone to drive by a car and rain shots into a vehicle and just kill one person but leave the other person harmless.  When you raining down a vehicle in ammo, you are going to leave no witnesses period, unless it's the witness who paid you off to begin with.  Anyway, enuff of that, now to the LP,Bomb First I was really feeling but I've never been a fan of the Outlawz and their rap style.  I know PAC loved taking in dudes in his camp who have a little talent and helping them out but it's clear after his death that the Outlawz just aren't that talented.Hail Mary, A hip hip classic for all ages with an eery sound and an even erry lyrics.  That bass kick in the backround is untouched.The only song I probably hated was ""Toss It Up"" he did with KC & Jo Jo (who were fulfilling obligations to SUGE for getting them out of their earlier contracts)until I saw the X-Rated video for it.To Live and Die In LA was a catchy single/pop tune to show his allegiance to the West.  ""Blaspehmy"" was political PAC to a certain degree and lyrically tight.Krazay, is the introspective PAC and showed a mature side to him I think fans were on the brink of seeing in his later years along with his usual album tribute to his mother and women in general in ""White Man's World"".  The lyrics are really deep and poetic and shows the range PAC has to go from straight gangsta one minute to someone who cares deeply about his community going awry.Me and My Girlfriend shows PAC at his rawest and blew up the entire fall/winter 96-97 with this track.  I think it was a dig at NAS's earlier release of ""I Gave You Power"", which was also about a gun.Hold Ya Head strays more towards the political side of PAC and seems to suggest that he knew his time was near.And of course he saves the best for last in Against All Odds.  If ""I Hit Em Up"" is considered one of the best comeback diss records of all time since ICE CUBE's ""NO VASELINE"" diss of N.W.A., then ""Against All Odds"" can't be far behind.  2PAC basically pulls no punches on who he thinks set him up in N.Y. the first time he got shot named as many suspects as he could and even ate NAS a new azzhole (which is lyrically not an easy thing to do, ask Jigga Man).  It's not only an angry song, but it seems like a song of feelings PAC had pent up for a long time that he was just busting on everybody's ass who had anything to do with anything concerning the New York shooting.  Vicious song.Unfortunately we may never know which PAC we were going to get at any moment.  However, I do know PAC was the last boulder removed that permanently destroyed Death Row.  Suge was able to keep Death Row afloat as long as he had PAC and once PAC was on his way out and later killed, Death Row has crumbled and been rubble ever since.  But if Makaveli was any indication of what was to come, we really missed out and is short dog."

1,"I bought this in 1993 .  A few of the songs had already been released as singles.  And I pretty much liked everything she had done.  But I hadn't bought anything by her.  I was kind of waiting for her to come out with a Greatest Hits.  But then when they released Passionate Kisses I bought this cd.  That song is still my favorite song by here.  And to me the highlight of the cd.  That is full of signature songs.  The Hard Way with the line Everything We Got We Got The Hard Way shich I think we all can relate to.  He Thinks He'll Keep Her, I Feel Lucky, I Take My Chances are all signature songs.  And almost make this a Greatest Hits cd any way.There were a couple more songs that weren't as big The Bug and the duet with Joe Diffie Not Too Much To Ask.  I dont know if Mary-Chapin Carpenter wasn't really mainstream enough.  She went on from here and stayed popular for awhile.  But not as long as she should have.  This is a good cd with good songs."
1,"What can I say about this incredible album?, that is the biggest selling album by a female singer? (I'm sure everyone knows that already), The thing is that it's one of the best country albums I've ever heard, all 16 songs are soooo catchy, and the ballads are just amazing, actually this album is the reason I am a Shania Twain's fan now and it is still a pleasure listening to it (even if it was released more than 6 years ago).If you don't have it, BUY IT, I'm telling you it's COMPLETELY AWESOME, I also recommend her new album called &quot;Up&quot;, wich is just as great or even more than &quot;Come on over&quot;. My favorites are: You're still the one, When, Black eyes Blue tears, I'm holdin on to love, whatever you do! don't!, man i feel like a woman, don't be stupid and that don't impress me much."
0,"This review refers to the 180g vinyl edition , released on the Vinyl Lovers label .I bought this album on vinyl because the remastered cd has a terribly compressed digital sound , only to discover that this album has been mastered directly from the cd and also has that awful digitally compressed sound , which defeats the object of buying the vinyl to hear this record in it's original glorious analogue sound .Vinyl Lovers might be the name of the record label , but do they really love the sound of vinyl , as all of their releases on vinyl have been directly mastered from the digital cd releases ( including the bonus tracks ) , and all sound terrible .It makes buying vinyl from this record label pointless !"
1,"The year was 1975 and after telling us about &#34;Chocolate City and it's Vanilla Suburbs&#34;, the Parliament took off for the &#34;Chocolate Milky Way&#34; with this groundbreaking and historical album.  MOTHERSHIP CONNECTION had been years in the making actually as the band experimented and tinkered with its line up and sound.  By the time 1975 came around, they had their formula down to razor sharp perfection, lyrics, compositions, vocals, recording, it all came together on this LP.Much of the success of this album and all subsequent LP's can be owed to James Brown.  Besides the members of the band, George especially, being huge fans, William &#34;Bootsy&#34; Collins had come from JB's backing band a few years earlier.  Mothership Connection was the first album by either Parliament or Funkadelic to include Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley, who had left The J.B.'s, James Brown's backing band as well.  They all brought that classic &#34;on the one&#34; beat and rhythm that James used to wow crowds all over the world.Parliament & Funkdelic would both take that type of musical formula to incredible levels and produce some of the most gut bucket, down home, nasty Funk to ever be put down on wax.  Mothership Connection was their first truly &#34;crossover&#34; album and became platinium selling smash hit.  So important was this singular work on the land scape of music across genre's that the Library of Congress added the album to the National Recording Registry in 2011 , declaring &#34;the album has had enormus influence on jazz, rock and dance music.&#34;Mighty high, fine and completely appropriate praise for this game changing LP, as George would later say when describing the making of the album, &#34;We had put black people in situations nobody ever thought they would be in, like the White House. I figured another place you wouldn't think black people would be was in outer space.&#34;  Mr. Clinton, you took us to the White House, Outter Space, and to Other Realms beyond description and I would like to personally thank you for the ride!"
1,I saw the video for &quot;The Box&quot; on MTV a few years back and was  intrigued by it.  I didn't remember much about the music other than it was  repetitive.  Curious about the electronic scene I picked up &quot;In  Sides&quot;.  Fast forward to now and three Orbitals CD's later I can say  that this one is their best one.  Others tend to have the same opinion  also.  There is just something about their music especially in this album  that doesn't make it boring to listen to.  The track that I enjoy the most  is &quot;Adnan's&quot;.  This is the perfect to listen to while you are  getting ready to go out with friends.  There is so much going on here  musically it's hard to keep track.  If you buy one Orbital album make it  this one.  The others just won't make you notice as much as this one.
1,"&quot;Bad&quot; is the downfall of Michael.The first single,&quot;I just  can't stop loving you,&quot;was refused by Whitney Houston and Barbra  Streisand.Siedah Garrett,who sounds so much like Michael on the record,was  fantastic.Siedah wrote the greatest song, &quot;Man in the Mirror.&quot;  This is  the only cut from &quot;Bad&quot; still played on radio  stations.&quot;I have to give Michael alot of credit for singing this  song,about changing yourself first.I did enjoy this album,but hardly ever  play it anymore.This would be my last Michael Jackson record.I still liked  some of his singles released,like &quot;Jam,&quot;but never bought another  CD."

1,"Considering what a critics darlingKing of Americawound up becomming Elvis Costello rebounded with the Attractions and original producer Nick Lowe for this album. This is not only very different from the previous album but very different from the last two albums with the Attractions before this. The best I can describe it is as something of a mid 80's updated mixture of the jerky new wave rhythms of his late 70's albums and some of the more carefully crafted pop/rock styled music of the early 80's. Taken individually the songs on this album are all highly melodic,tend towards the upbeat musically and have particularly biting and scatching lyrics even by Elvis Costello standards. One of the great things about Costello is his ability to express emotions such as betrayal,irritation and even anger without resorting to childish simplifications or witless cynicism. Much as John Lennon before him (perhaps even to a further degree) Costello can take a negative subject and intellectualize it to such an extent it pretty much becomes a more positive thought or,at least a more setttled one anyway. ""Uncomplicated"" opens the album with a harsh,agitated melody and guitar sound whereas ""I Hope Your Happy Now"",""Home Is Anywhere You Hang Your Head"" and even the conveniently possitioned ""I Want You"" all possess the rolling drums,jangly guitars and melodicism of mid 60's Beatles,part of the classic Attractions sound as it was. Later in the album you hear more elaboratly constructed songs such as the darkly textured ""Battered Old Bird"" and ""Poor Napoleon"",named after the alias he'd taken for this albums release. As with the previous album,even though this is more based in modern pop music than that had  been this album is still somewhat atypical of much of pop music of it's time. Because it in many ways anticipates the decades to come this album holds up a lot better in todays environment where with the exception of maybe REM at this point this may have seemed a bit different from most of what was commercially popular. It winds up a solid Elvis Costello/Attractions album regardless and is one of the finer releases from any period."
1,"Definitely Nick Drake's most mainstream release in his all too brief discography, Bryter Layter is filled with more somber guitar lines, Nick's expressive vocals, and even drums/flutes/other instruments! Wow!Those elements are a turn off for those who like more of his raw and unpolished music, but a lot of the songs on this album are just as emotional as those on Pink Moon or 5 Leaves Left, though some of the songs can do without the overproduction.Still worthy of a listen, and of a purchase."
1,"This is a great boxset with 3 CDs and 1 DVD. CD1 contains the original Bad album (remastered). CD2 contains some bad era outtakes and demos plus three remixes. Remixes are not my thing but the Speed Demon remix by Nero is a good one if someone enjoys remixes. I love the demos. The CD starts with the demo Don't Be Messin' Round which is, in my opinion, the weakest/less finished of them, but the other demos are great. I cannot really decide which one is my favorite of them, I enjoy them all.The crown jewel of the boxset is, however (to me at least), CD3 and the DVD which contains Jackson's concert from July 16, 1988 at the Wembley Stadium. (Would you believe that it's the first time a live audio CD of Jackson has been released?)If you are not one of those people who are so spoiled by modern technology that they are only able to enjoy something if it's HD/Blue-ray quality then you will appreciate this DVD!Jackson's Estate did not make a secret of the fact that they could only find an old VHS in his personal collection from which they could restore the video of this concert. The camera angles aren't perfect either as what you see on the video is what was recorded for the Jumbotrons during the concert. The audio on the other hand was recorded on multitracks, so that's great (as well as the live CD).Despite of these handicaps I still rate this concert 5 stars because Jackson's mesmerizing performance more than makes up for them! Surprisingly the stage show is rather purist, especially compared to what we see in many concerts today. No spectacular stage scenes, no high-tech effects, no laser shows, no fireworks, not even an army of dancers (there are only four, besides Jackson himself), no strip shows, no pole dancers. There are a couple of costume changes (like the inevitable warewolf and zombies in Thriller), but we cannot talk about a parade of spectacular costumes either. Mainly it's just Jackson and his singing and dancing. And that is good so! Actually it's one of the most impressive things to me about this concert and Jackson himself: that the concert has a kind of magic feel to it, you just cannot take your eyes off the screen for two straight hours, it's highly entertaining, enjoyable, uplifting, breath-taking, mesmerizing - and that's all down to Jackson and his talent, charisma and stage presence and not to stage gimmicks and high-tech! He was a truly great performer.Maybe because of the lack of gimmicks and high-tech, but the concert has a kind of intimate charm too - if you can say that about a show in front of 72,000 people. It's hard to put this into words but I don't see the type of mechanical, calculating, cold artificiality in it that I see in so many concerts by other singing-dancing stars. Jackson is light on his feet, he's cool, relaxed, joyful, clearly enjoying himself, like he was born to do it. He probably was. His happiness is infectious too. And all the while he's putting on an amazing show.PS: To react to the reviewer before me: I do not have any problems with the package. In fact, I think the box is pretty neat. But even if it wasn't, it's the content that matters and that is excellent."

1,"It's funny to see how ALMOST BLUE still divides Costello fans after all these years. I remember seeing a documentary produced for British TV (Melvyn Bragg's ""The South Bank Show"") that chronicled Costello and the Attractions' Nashville adventures. Producer Billy Sherrill, after displaying a lot of initial skepticism,  responded to Elvis' pumped-up version of ""Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used to Do?"" with a reaction like -- ""Now we're getting somewhere! That's why I took on this project!""  (Elvis meanwhile had confessed to the cameras how nervous he was about going into the studio and letting Sherrill hear what he and the gang had done to the track.)  Detractors aside, ALMOST BLUE holds up as a classic collection of country covers -- packed with more drinking and heartbreak than most pasty punk rockers could endure -- and the first of many (mostly) successful musical digressions in Costello's illustrious career.Standout tracks: ""Why Don't You Love Me (Like You Used to Do?""), ""I'm Your Toy,"" ""Brown to Blue,"" ""A Good Year for the Roses,"" ""How Much I Lied."""
1,"Even when my Rock music feedback is mainly based on British ""Classic"" and ""Heavy Metal"" Rock (i.e. Yes, ELP, Genesis, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Uriah Heep, Jethro Tull et al), I must admit that Bon Jovi is, certainly, ONE OF THE BEST ROCK BANDS EVER (Made in America)!!!This album includes almost every known major ""Hit"" of this talented Band.No loss for your Rock collection!"
1,"Michael was an incredible child prodigy. These 2 CDs I think summs up the reason why the Jackson 5 were so extremely popular and gives the basis for why he himself became the megastar that he became. I was really taken aback while listening to these songs and just couldn't believe someone so young had that amazing ability. I could have cried when I thought about what he has become and then thought about the reason, this wonderful music and all the hard work he had to do at such a very young age. But moving on, some of my favorites are mostly on the 2nd Cd, Music and Me, One Day in Your Life, Happy, Call on Me and many more. The Jackson 5 classics are I'll Be there, Never can say goodbye and an unknown J5 song, Too Late to change the Time (which is wonderful). This compilation is a must for MJ fans and for anyone that wants to hear some great soul music from Motown."

1,"For me this album was Henley's high water mark as a solo artist.  The album was another huge hit that spawned several big singles and propelled the album well beyond platinum status.  This is one disc that deserved the sales in my opinion as every song on it is a winner.  Henley's social, religious and political commentary has never been more prevalent, and whether you agree with his points of view or not, the subject matter is always thought provoking.  Highlights of the disc include the opening title track which was co-written with Bruce Hornsby.  Bruce's signature piano is the main instrument of this tale of lost innocence in the Regan years of the U.S.  ""I Will Not Go Quietly"" is a rocking duet with Axle Rose from Guns And Roses.  ""The Last Worthless Evening"" is a cool ballad that was a big hit.  ""New York Minute"" was another big hit with great lyrics.  ""Little Tin God"" is Henley's reggae-ish take on religion.  ""If Dirt Were Dollars"" is another great lyric and one of the heavier rocking tunes on the disc.  The last track ""The Heart Of The Matter"" is  one of those relationship songs that came along at just the right time in my life.  This song always brings me back to my turbulent 20's, and relationships gone badly.  The lyrics pretty much reflected exactly what I was going through at the time, and it was like Henley got in my head and ripped this right out of my brain.  He does this type of song as well as anybody in my opinion.  Henley is once again supported by an all star cast of players.  The music is never overly adventurous, but fits exactly what Henley was trying to get across in most cases.  There are a few weak tracks here ""How Bad Do You Want It?"", ""Shangri-LA"", and ""Gimmie What You Got"" are all ok, but not up to the rest of the disc.  Overall though this is a very enjoyable album and the best of Henley's solo career."
1,The title of this cd says it all. Parliament music's just can't be beat. I'm working on my CD collection now. My albums are worn out!!!!!!! Love George Clinton what a visionary.
1,"Let's face it. The music world of 1993 was very very divided. There were those concerned mainly with matters of media credibility and those interested in the creation of their particular art. On both ends of the pond soul and funk music at this time generally wasn't created. It was being programmed. That mixed with the whole credibility situation wasn't making for much harmony. Than came a British fellow named Jason Kay (known as Jay) and a talented quartet called Jamiroquai. Putting themselves out there in a mix of other groups in the ""acid jazz"" genre (often used as short hand for most varities of funk) with people such as Brand New Heavies and Incognito this band didn't exactly have the jam band tendencies of the former,nor the house/dance leanings of the latter. But they did something very special that meant a lot to myself personally.Equally capable of top notch musicianship and melodic invention,another thing Jamiroquai understood was the value of instrumental production. The music is well mixed,with the right touches of reverb and echo when needed. Basically it's going for a 70's jazz/funk/soul sound that's produced authentically. Jay's vocals,long and very incorrectly compared with Stevie Wonder have a high to mid range lilt about them that are elastic enough to fit these songs. A better musical comparason might be Curtis Mayfield,especially the soul stepping funky soul groove of the opening ""When You Gonna Learn"" and it's environmentalist poetry. ""Too Young To Die"" extends to a similar groove with a more anti war message. On ""Hooked Up"" and ""Revolution 1993"" it comes out what fantastic musicians they are well with polyrhythmic jazzier funk grooves with a more instrumental leaning.""Music Of The Mind"" is similar though on the more mid tempo end of that area. Headhunters style clavinet type stop/start funk is prominant on ""Whatever It Is,I Just Can't Stop"" where as ""Blow Your Mind"" has this lean sophistifunk sound with Jay's scatting George Benson style with the violin. The band also did for the digeridoo in funk what EWF did for the kalimba: to bring it into the consciousness of the bands sound and hopefully the listener. The title song,with it's disco friendly dance-funk sound reprises the environementalist concerns where ""If I Like It,I Do It"" again brings the Mayfield/Impressions type funk/soul to the forefront. Although clearly under the wing of his influence,it was likely too many comparisons that commercialy doomed this band. Jamiroquai stand as very much their own musical animal. Sometimes sweet as funk can be,other times as deep in the groove as you could get. They epitomized everything a 90's era funk band could be. And even for the doubters they have,this album stands very very strong."
1,"The title sums it up, easily the greatest p-funk album and is the blueprint for west coast hip hop but also all rap. Simply beacuse Dr. Dre sampled one of these tracks for his iconic track, ""Let Me Ride."" (NOt the only reason but is one of the many) but the fact is is that Let Me Ride or Dr Dre has anything on Funk or even this one album. While The Chronic is about guns, violence, and other rap subject matter makes it uncomparble to this clean crisp peice of the mothership. Wheather your a rap fan or parliament fan you should check this record out. Everytrack is a unbealivable masterpeice that even the p Funk members could not come close to on any other record but to be fair this is a concept record but even the next Parliament album in space (Gloryhallastoopid) was funkee but not even comparable, honestly this album doesn't even sound like any other Funk or even P=funk record ever realesed, the perfect mix of space and funk, the Mothership Conncetion"
1,3 1/2High quality warm-up material here not to be dismissed is on par with some of his overpraised conceptual works further down the era.
1,"1978... a time when punk/techno/disco was invading the radio & mainstream bands were losing stride because of it.  Then there was kansas, styx, genesis, & RUSH who all seemed to hold on to their fans & keep getting bigger.  Then came TOTO (1978) who quickly dove into that category of rising bands.  this was their first album & I think their best along with 1979's Hydra.  David Paich - piano/vocals (long time Quincy Jones friend) helped put together this band that consisted of many great guys icluding steve Lukather - guitar/vocals, Steve porcoro - keys  Jeff Porcoro - drums, Bobby Kimball - vocals, & David Hungate - bass...  All great musicians.  this album shows their ability better than any other TOTO album although most of the songs are, per usual, in 4/4 time.  I love child's anthem, I'll supply the love, manuela run, takin it back (steve porcoro on vocals - rare), & angela. Hold the line is fine but it's been done to death as you probably know.  Again, like many rock bands in the late 70s, the yamaha cp-70 electric piano makes it's appearance & makes the music more powerful & balanced.  The keyboards by steve are also great with good acoustics. TOTO also have good arrnagements here with the album sounding balanced & no musician is drowned out by others.  There is a good symetry here between the guys.  Great Album... Buy it... Also buy Hydra (1979) & TOTO IV (1982)..."
1,"Most people know Men At Work for their hit single ""Down Under"" (and for good reason) and possibly for their other top 100 singles ""Who Can It Be Now"" and ""Be Good Johnny"" . These 3 songs are great 80's rock tunes that alone make the album worthy of a purchase (they at least help its appeal), but the album does contain several other good tracks too. Unfortunately it's all kind of a guilty pleasure which hurts its possibility of being a classic. It's also pretty uneven so chances are you'll skip several tracks. The lyrics aren't that great, but like their singles they're simple and catchy enough to have fun singing along with. The singer I think is  sort of love-it-or-hate-it for most of the songs. Its three hits move it up from a 4 to a 4.5 (it's also a kind of unique album musically - it's mostly jazz/blues influenced rock but it has a little new wave thrown in). Overall a very good debut that 80's rock fans and those with an open mind will probably like (and its relatively cheap price certainly helps). Recommended!Highlights include:""Who Can It Be Now?""I Can See It In Your Eyes""""Down Under""""Underground""""Helpless Automaton""""People Just Love To Play With Words"" (kind of)""Be Good Johnny""""Down By The Sea"" (kind of)"
0,"Yet another classic that only became popular because their audience was stoned. Blaring, muddy, unmusical crud."
1,"Brand X is the progressive jazz/rock fusion group that Phil Collins played drums for in the late 70's during his breaks from Genesis. Although there's no question about Phil's awesome drumming with Genesis, Brand X allowed Phil to *really* cut loose on the drumkit, free-form style. In fact, Phil felt that he had so much freedom playing with Brand X, that he momentarily considered leaving Genesis. As Phil himself put it, &quot;Genesis was the wife, and Brand X was the mistress, and I just wanted to take my clothes off and live a bit!&quot; However, Genesis started to loosen up musically around the late 70's, toning down their art-rock leanings and going more towards the rock mainstream, which ultimately convinced Phil to stay with the wife and say goodbye to the mistress.But Phil did record four studio albums (plus a live album) with Brand X between 1976 and 1980, and he also toured with the band in 1979 (though Brand X would carry on, off and on, through 1997). The group's first album, &quot;Unorthodox Behaviour,&quot; is a stunning debut disc. Phil, guitarist John Goodsall, bassist Percy Jones, and keyboardist Robin Lumley have musical chemistry that's simply explosive. &quot;Nuclear Burn&quot; is just as barnburning as it's title suggests, &quot;Euthanasia Waltz&quot; is a sparkling laid-back jam, and &quot;Born Ugly&quot; is funky with a capital F. Also groovy are &quot;Smacks Of Euphoric Hysteria&quot; &amp; &quot;Running On Three,&quot; the title track is a steady, assured rocker, and the closing &quot;Touch Wood&quot; is a samba-flavored beauty. Goodsall delivers some fiery guitarwork, Jones is a monster on the bass, Lumley's keyboard-playing is superb, and, of course, what needs to be said about Phil's drumming---he's fantastic. I wish more people knew about Phil's work with this outstanding fusion band. Like I've always said, Phil Collins is first and foremost a *drummer*, and if Genesis and Phil's solo work can't convince his detractors of this, then his astonishing playing with Brand X most certainly can. Not only that, but Brand X---Goodsall, Jones, Lumley, and Collins---were simply an awesome band. &quot;Unorthodox Behaviour&quot; is a terrific debut album from one of music's best-kept-secret groups. Definitely start your Brand X collection with this one!"
1,"This album has everything a rap fan would want. The rapping is straight and has a nice flow. The lyrics are real good and touching. Some of the beats are good as well. My favorite songs in the first CD are: ""Ambitionz Az A Ridah"", ""2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted"" featuring Snoop Dogg, ""No More Pain"", ""Heartz Of Men"", and ""California Love (remix)"" featuring Dr. Dre. My favorites in the second CD are: ""Can't C Me"", ""Shorty Wanna Be A Thug"", ""When We Ride"", and ""Picture Me Rollin"". Both CD's are good, but the first one is better.I'm a big 2pac fan and have all his albums. I like all his albums, but this is the best one! I never have to skip 1 track when I put it on the car. Before you buy any other album in the store, consider buying this one!"

1,"I have this CD but I am not playing it that often. In fact this album is sitting on my shelf for weeks or months on end. My U2, Depeche Mode, and Enya CDs are getting a lot of spins. As Long As You Love me, and Everybody are good in my opinion. I do enjoy the Halloween video for Everybody. It was one of the best videos I had seen in a long time back then in 1997. Meanwhile songs like Hey Mr. DJ, a cover version of Set Adrift On Memory, and If You Want to Be Good Girl are just plain awful to the point to being almost unlistenable. The rest are ok. The music on here is very teen oriented with some blue-eyed soul influences.I,m not very fond of this CD. Not that I call it bad but just so many other CDs I have get many time more spins in my CD player.Backstreet Boys would improve dramatically on their Millennium album two years after this one but would come crashing to the ground with the oh so boring Black and Blue."

1,"The best three songs from this nine song collection are onthe box set. Strip away those three and the rest of ""Madman"" ranges from album cuts that do no damage to one rotten exercise in filler. Were I to pluck a fourth track for the box set it would probably be the album closer, ""Goodbye"".That's not to say that the box set snaps up all desirable Elton John tracks.Tumbleweed Connectionis an excellent album and is woefully underrepresented considering that the box is a 4CD set. The single album live set11-17-70is also highly recommended. That album of Elton raucously burning down the house back in his nightclub days is entirely unrepresented on the box set.One gets the impression that after this album Elton, with or without the discreet advice of label execs, decided that he'd taken the singer-songwriter path about as far as he could. He wisely foresaw that the singer-songwriter fad would be running out of steam in the next year or so, and with his next albumHonky Chateauhe steered a course toward pop. Like ""Madman"", its three best songs are also onthe box set. This was a transitional time in Elton's career as he laid the groundwork for delivering some of the best pop singles and albums of the early-to-mid-70s."
1,"In June of 1977, Barbra Streisand had released her twenty-second album entitled, STREISAND SUPERMAN. I was expecting this album to prompt me in giving the album a three-star rating, but I wound up finding myself having to prompt myself in giving it a four-star rating. It is not good enough to receive all five stars, but it was good enough to come close as a great album. Many of the songs on are really amazing.SUPERMANI have really enjoyed this song many times and I still enjoy hearing this song. Great song all the way.DON'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU READThis is something I can totally agree with because so many paparazzis are writing in papers many untrue things, so Barbra just tells us simply this, ""Don't Believe What You Read"".BABY ME BABYGreat.I FOUND YOU LOVEGreat.ANSWER MENot bad.MY HEART BELONGS TO MEGreat.CABIN FEVERI do not want to be the next victim of ""Cabin Fever"". That's all I'm saying.LOVE COMES FROM UNEXPECTED PLACESNot bad.NEW YORK STATE OF MINDThis song was originally recorded by Billy Joel.

1,"I remember it well:  my big sister and I went to Tower Records on Sunset Blvd. the day after Christmas 1980 to buy Laura Nyro's ""Christmas and the Beads of Sweat."" And who was there in the store but Peter Bogdonavich and Cybill Shepherd! I was very young at the time but I still rememeber that day well.  And it wasn't because of Peter and Cybill.  It's because this music is still so vibrant, vulnerable and magical. ""Freeport,"" ""Blackpatch,"" ""Brown earth,"" ""Up on the roof"" and on and on...songs of love, songs of despair, songs of protest.  What maybe people don't know is that Laura Nyro was the consummate musician: she wrote, she played piano, she sang, of course, she produced most of her albums and she wrote the arrangements.  When is someone at Columbia/Sony going to realize how important an artist Laura Nyro was and digitally re-master complete versions of at least ""Eli,"" ""Tendaberry,"" ""Christmas"" and ""Smile.""  It is long over do."

1,"This album usually gets high praise (for having all the original members) or absolutely shrugged off as unworthy.  But it's neither.  It's less a serious, focussed effort than a transition album from their old sound to the newer poppy 80s sound.  It's got songs that show how each of them has developed musically over the years, with mixed results.  Despite the fact that there is no transition of albums from 1972 to 1978, through the years, all of the group's members were taking in the new musical developments, picking bits of it that they liked and incorporating it into their own music.  Had the Moodies stayed together possibly we would have heard their sound EVOLVE to what it was in Octave, or at least something close.  Not only had years passed but there was significant parting of the ways philosophically for members of the group, unfortunately Pinder got fed up with things and left halfway through the making of this album.  Patrick Moraz was hired to help finish off the album with the now somewhat dejected band, and as a competent keyboardist certainly would have been an asset to the band.  I don't even mind the direction the band went in, it had to change, and I actually liked their albums until TOO MUCH keyboards and sequencing (which are absolutely smashing when used wisely) put an end to what I thought was their creative strengths - putting together music by carefully choosing what sounds they needed for each well-written song instead of churning out 3 chord bubblegum songs with lyrics more childish sounding than when they actually were teenagers.  There's no mellotron on this album - the spacey mood that crude late 60s sampler keyboard imparts is entirely gone at this point, but I'm sure the band members were beginning to sober up somewhat by now, and just weren't INTERESTED in writing stuff along those lines, which is all they had been doing for years.  I suspect they were not doing it so much for the money anymore either, they already had experienced that and fame as well, so they were more interested in writing songs that would bring in money to their record label and allow them to tour and at least, as a band, make more money than they spent (artists traditionally make their money from tours, not records, so I would imagine this was their plan).  There is no real mood (besides an overall tinge of regret) to this album, the production seems a bit distracted and the sound veers from one extreme to the other.  I think there was some disagreement with Tony Clark at that time too, but he's listed as producer of this album.Ray Thomas probably comes off worse on this album - 'Under Moonshine' is a somewhat dated orchestration backing a pleasant enough song, with a bit of sadness expressed about someone departing, who had good and bad points, but will be sorely missed *cough*  ""I'm Your Man"" on the other hand, is a very frightening bit of 70s cheese, that has not aged well.  Well, I guess that's a bit harsh to say.  Nothing on this album is really AWFUL but there are some very cloying moments.Graeme Edge surprisingly has a good song (though the ending shamelessly copies Moonage Daydream).  An upbeat, rocking song, lyrics sound like they're about his son, with good guitar work by Justin throughout and some nice piano flourishes during the fadeout.As for Pinder, he has one song with ""One Step Into The Light"" which outlines his religious beliefs and trust in a higher power.  The song is actually not bad, a lot of it feels like it was added after Pinder had left, around his vocal line.  The guitar in it, in particular, in parts feels a bit disjointed and like its in the mix to hide a flub or something.  When Pinder sings ""play my mellotron for you"", the strings that immediately follow do not seem to be mellotron but some kind of a string synthesiser, a keyboard that had been developed by then that was cheaper and more reliable than a mellotron, though less of that spooky character.John Lodge has picked up some 70s cheese as well, with the meaningless ""Stepping In A Slide Zone"" at least presenting a good time feel, ""these boys can still rock"" start to the album.  As some reviewers have noticed, it is rather a gimmicky sound compared to their stuff on TOCCC or any of their classics.  Survival is getting pretty cloying (but that rot had set in with ""minstrel's song"") and a strong hook saves it (just barely) from sounding like something Barry Manilow would do.  The orchestra in it is at least more reminiscent of their older classical outings, than the more R&B; strings in ""I'm Your Man"".  R&B; is somewhat explored in the odd ""Top Rank Suite"" which is a bit surprising until you remember they always had a bit of R&B; influence in their songs from John Lodge.  ""Ride My Seesaw"", ""Just A Singer"", ""Simple Game"", to name a few.  Lots of inspired backing vocals and simultaneous different harmonies, and the result is actually the best of his three songs.  The saxamaphone makes it authentic though somewhat cheesy.Probably because it's co-written by the hitmeister Justin, who rescues this album with his superb guitar playing throughout and his excellent singing.  Plus the fact that he writes a good song or two.  ""Had To Fall In Love"" is a teeny bit dull, but still a beautiful song with close harmonies, probably the best harmonies on this record.  ""Driftwood"" was the hit, and it's a pretty good song too, a bit on the poppy side but still undeniably classic.  Moraz provides a nice string background without intruding very much on the band's sound at this point.  A mellotron would have given that song a completely different feel, for the worst IMO.  ""The Day We Meet Again"" is the album's emotional high point, it is also pretty obviously about Pinder though it never gets too specific.  It sounds rather wailing at times, and it ends the album off with a rather mournful mood."
1,"For all you Costello completists out there, DO NOT toss your Rykodisc copy once you get this new Rhino version.  There are two ""Live in Aberdeen"" tracks on the Ryko pressing that did not get carried over onto the new one.As for the record itself, when I first bought the vinyl 20+ years ago, I knew very few of the songs and had none of the original versions.  Now I have almost all of them, as well as a deep appreciation for country music.  I have Elvis and my wife to thank for that!"
1,"As everyone already knows, 'The Jacksons' (1976) marked the begining of a new era for Michael & his Brothers (With Randy & minus Jermaine!). This debut on the legendary Philadelphia International Label was very interesting because Gamble & Huff were the KINGS of the then fledging Phily Sound (incl. acts like The O'Jays, Teddy Pendergrass, Blue Notes, The Three Degrees, Billy Paul, and a host of other acts).'The Jacksons' was a moderate success, spawning 2 well known hits ('Enjoy Yourself' & 'Show You The Way To Go'), and it was a nice start for the Jacksons in 1976 after leaving Motown. The Brothers would end up recording one more album in 1977 under Gamble & Huff's direction ('Goin' Places'), and it didn't do as well as expected, but the album had some nice moments ('Different Kind Of Lady' & 'Find Me A Girl' for example!).As I listened to the 1st 2 albums by The Jacksons, it became apparent that they sound better when playing them back to back, and that the sound quality REALLY needed to be improved. For some reason Epic/Sony won't remaster the original CDs, so I cleaned them up for a fanstatsic 2 on 1 collection featuring BOTH 'The Jacksons' (1976) & 'Goin Places' (1977) on a single CD! Fans can do the same if they have decent remastering software (Magix for example), and the sound is incredible. Come on Sony, remaster & release the 1st 2 Jacksons albums on a single CD..it makes all the sense in the world!Peace, SD(of 'Chaka's World')"
1,"THIS (Blieve it or not) is the Moody Blues' best, most consistent album. Every track is worth it, there R no big let-downs, &amp; the music is GORGEOUS! &quot;Blue World&quot;'s lyrics R practically a string of cliches, but it's great stuff! &quot;Meet Me Halfway&quot; is a great Hayward/Lodge collaboration. &quot;Sitting at the Wheel&quot; grows on you. In &quot;It's Cold Outside of Your Heart,&quot; Hayward Goes Country! -- Njoy the twanginess! &quot;Running Water&quot; is simply a gorgeous Hayward ballad; &quot;I Am&quot; is a Ray Thomas blast from the past; &amp; &quot;Sorry&quot; is 1 of Thomas's best songs in YEARS! The remaining 2 tracks R at the very least solid filler -- great Patrick Moraz keyboard sound effects on &quot;Hole in the World,&quot; 2 (even if it is just a prelude 4 &quot;Under My Feet&quot;). Great production from Pip Williams (who also helmed LONG DISTANCE VOYAGER), &amp; all the guys R in Xcellent voice! Don't know why this album took such a beating from fans &amp; critics, &amp; the sales figures were some of the guys' worst ever. But it's brilliant! A magnificent way 2 bring down the curtain on a long, honorable career. 2 bad the Moodies have only pulled off about 4 good songs since this album came out...."
0,"In an age of ""boom boom"" dance music and overblown, hyperamplified grunge, I was inclined to think that, when I heard Coolio's ""Gangsta's Paradise"" - even as I was knowing about what ""gangsta"" meant in relation to rap - was something a little better.The fact was/is, that this style of synthesised, semimelodic rap today sounds like the perfect prototype for, yes, the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears. Coolio clearly sounded like he wanted to remove the melodies and the hooks that at least made commcercial music from the eighties easy to listen to (well, I listened to nothing but for the best part of two decades) and replace it with a synthesised, airy, flyweight sound that would serve perfectly as background music on your commercial station. The song is not memorable like hit singles of the 1980s were, and the singer can never tell whether he wants to talk or actually to sing.This was perhaps the first song to be a hit AS background music on the radio, rather than from simple, catchy lyrics and vocals that had made hit singles before. As it stands today, this soundtrack rap album is almost a protype for the Backstreet Boys, who sound quite similar to Coolio, actually, even if they never rapped.If you like the Backstreet Boys or N'Sync (no need for rudeness) you'll love this for the meandering melodies and total absence of memorable rhythms. if you want more substance, stay right away. Coolio copies Stevie Wonder's ""Pasttime Paradise"" on this one: going back to the source would be most welcome."
1,"This album could very well be the culmination of everything Elvis Costello would ever be; bombastic, tender, thoughtful, political, sullen and completely unmerciful.  I was fortunate enough to witness the Armed Forces  tour and was completely overwhelmed with volume and attitude for the one  hour Costello gave his audience.  The opening song of &quot;Goon  Squad&quot; will forever reverberate in my skull.  This happened at a time  when Elvis Costello literally ran neck and neck with Bruce Springsteen as  the &quot;King&quot; and the &quot;Boss&quot; duked it out for the 70's  hottest songwriter accolade.  Unfortunately, Costello's stock has fallen  and is now relegated to playing theater shows and hall dates with Burt  Bacharach before pipe smokers while Bruce still packs the arenas with his  over exuberance.  And in some ways, after reviewing Armed Forces again, the  listener realizes that Costello trapped himself in a seventies time warp,  with his over emphasis of the Vox Farafisa organ and a weak snare sound.  Still, the artist that is Costello comes through and his domination of the  period is easily understood.  Senior Service, Goon Squad, Two Little  Hitlers and Chemistry Class (where Costello immortalizes himself with the  punishing line &quot;You've been around so long but you still don't know  what to do..&quot;) demonstrate the well roundness and helter skelter  manner that has became his songwriting trademark.  The almost sad fact  about Costello is his music often times just doesn't hold up anymore,  sounding somewhat dated and dusty.  But blame it on a new wave mentality  and crank up the volume, because when Elvis Costello puts forth, it's at  least a more than admirable effort."
1,"LEAP OF FAITH is one of my favorite Kenny Loggins' recordings:  excellent musical arrangements; the use of Native American rhythms and instrumentation; good songs; and a more mature Loggins, who started using his own life experiences to influence his lyrics.  This is evidenced strongly in the sincerity of THE REAL THING; his homage to his son in CODY'S SONG; and the bittersweet MY FATHER's HOUSE.Both the vocal and reprise of WILL OF THE WIND are beautiful; there is insightful majesty in LEAP OF FAITH and CONVICTION OF THE HEART soaked in superb musical accompaniment; joyful euphoria in SWEET REUNION and IF YOU BELIEVE; intense energy in NOW OR NEVER; tender pleading in I WOULD DO ANYTHING; and strong resolve in TOO EARLY FOR THE SUN.The pop star of the 70s and 80s entered the 90s as a more introspective musician.  Although he would overdo it with his future AN UNIMAGINABLE LIFE, this album is an outstanding showcase of his creative maturity."
1,"Elton John's &quot;Honky Chateau&quot; LP, released in 1972, contains some of lyrical partner Bernie Taupin's most interpersonal and melancholic lyrics to date. As I understand, Elton John was going through some pretty rocky times at the release of this recording. As a result, Taupin's kaleidoscopic lyrics really show. Elton John basically struggled through depression throughout much of his career, which led to experimentation with various drugs later on, including cocaine (which almost killed him in 1990). Elton even had thoughts of suicide early in his career, which is a theme presented in one of the selections here, titled &quot;I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself&quot;. The gay nineties styled music wonderfully offsets the depressed lyrics in this track, as is the case in contrast throughout most of &quot;Honky Chateau&quot;'s selections. Elton was also experiencing some relationship problems during this era. Songs such as &quot;Susie (Dramas)&quot; and &quot;Amy&quot; make light of these relationship dilemmas, but once again, the uplifting musical arrangements featured in these two tracks adds a silver lining to these dark, lyrical clouds. &quot;Mellow&quot; and &quot;Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters&quot; teeter on the brink a bit, although the latter number sort of probes the dog eat dog world in which we live. Quite possibly, Elton transcribed Bernie's lyrics into prayer, as is the case in the semi-optimistic &quot;Salvation&quot;, to help EJ cope with his difficult struggles in dealing with his rise to fame, relationships, insecurities, etc. &quot;Hercules&quot; (Elton's &quot;newly adopted&quot; legal middle name by this time) displays EJ's newfound confidence being restored in the Relationships, Inc. department, as noted in the lyrics, as well as in the uptempo musical cohesiveness provided courtesy of Davey Johnstone's guitar licks and Nigel Olsson's powerful drumming technique, which is the album's saving grace in response to the somewhat down in the mouth lyrics, which have a wonderful appeal all their own. &quot;HC&quot;'s lone bonus track &quot;Slave (Alternate Version)&quot; is too uptempo, although it has a nice Jerry Lee Lewis quality to it, courtesy of EJ's quick piano ramblings. The slower version of this track, also featured here, works better on record, and fits in more comfortably with the rest of the album. &quot;Honky Chateau&quot;'s star tracks, &quot;Rocket Man&quot; and &quot;Honky Cat&quot; are out of the ordinary, good time standards, particularly the latter track. The Mardi Gras atmosphere of &quot;Honky Cat&quot; is superseded by the sci-fi theme prevalent in &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, which gives this track an unparalleled coolness. What makes &quot;Honky Chateau&quot; special as well, is that it is the first in a series of Elton John albums that were recorded at the famed Strawberry Studios, located in France. EJ's next album, &quot;Don't Shoot Me I'm Only The Piano Player&quot; was also recorded at this same studio, and is the album that pushed Elton into international superstar status. The cold, pessimistic atmosphere of &quot;Honky Chateau&quot; is aesthetically pleasing, and is among EJ's and Taupin's most decoratively cherished works, which are the all-time best in the world of pop music. Folks, it's that simple, you need this CD in your Elton John and/or pop music library today!"
1,"I like this double-album (now one one CD), though it's not as good as Hot Pants. Still, I've got a couple minor gripes: while the classic title song is pretty cool, it seems like he's trying to reinvent it on several cuts, bringing the wah-wah and orchestral ending back. Running times hurt the otherwise-good Take Some... Leave Some; Time Is Running Out Fast and Shoot Your Shot (the shortest song is 5:52, and the longest is 12:54 or so); and the ballad Doing the Best that I Can has JB doing a failed Curtis Mayfield impression, complete with falsetto and strings. But there are some great songs on this album: certainly the title song, plus the funky, tightly-wound jams that close the set: Stone to the Bone and Mind Power. Both run over ten minutes (the latter over twelve), but neither seem to drag: if anything, they're both too short."
1,"It's sad that many people won't give mystikal a chance just 'cuz he's stuck with the ""Southern Rap"" title.This album is some of the most unique hip-hop I've heard, but not in a lame artsy way. It's raw and real. Kinda like a southern Busta Rhymes.Take some off-beat, chopped and screwed jazz beats and add mystikal's frantic outbursts of lyrics about weed and girls and you have a very unique album which never gets boring."
1,"This is one of Bob Dylan's best works.  It appeared after a couple lame works and a so-so album.  It marked a wonderful ""comeback,"" if you will.  There was an acoustic sensibility that worked.  His harmonica playing worked well.  His voice was, to the extent that it was possible, in good form (sometimes, his vocal rendering of songs becomes somewhat strange).""Tangled up in Blue"" is a terrific song, one of the best on this CD and one of the best he ever did.  The images come, one on top of another.  A powerful work.""Idiot Wind"" hearkens back to an earlier day, when his singing was explicitly political.  This is an angry song, and it works pretty well.  The line when he remarks that the idiot wind interacts with ""the Capitol"" (sung in a compelling way) highlights this cut.""Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts"" remind me of some of his offbeat, strange, metaphor-riddled works such as ""Desolation Row.""  Images emerge one after another from this piece.""Shelter from the Storm"" is a laid back, evocative tune.  It ends up with an upbeat, optimistic feel to it.And on it goes.  No need to mention each song in its turn.  But most of the cuts on this CD are fine pieces of musical art.In short, one of Dylan's best."
1,With the painful death of James Brown the glorious book of the soul movement has lost his last exponent. He is now part of the legend as well as Wilson Picket.
1,"...these boys done f@&amp;ked around and got a triple-double with this!  the production on here is rich and deep...you can play this on your granmama's ol' clock radio and its gonna make you sit up and lissen! it's true, tho, they aint sayin a whole lot...references to drugs and sex are integrated into damn near every verse!  but they are so skilled in creating lyrical landscapes and the production is so tight that true hip hop fans wont complain too much...but if you want insight and meaning then check out mos def, talib, outkast or any of the old school recordings that are still out there.  these boys only wanna keep it crunk."
1,"Loverboy's Get Lucky is an excellent follow up to their debut album from the previous year. One of Loverboy's best known songs kicks things off, Working for the Weekend. You always know what's coming when you hear the cowbell! Other highlights include: When It's Over, Jump, Lucky Ones, and Take Me to the Top. Anyone who enjoyed Loverboy's first album will enjoy the follow up as well."
1,"The review by Darth Kommisar pretty much sums up this release. Anybody who actually likes 80's hard rock should own this album as at this point Europe were really in their own little world. They may have loved Thin Lizzy but this release has a teutonic grandiose sound that Lizzy just wouldn't of done.Memories is right up there as one of the tremendous rock songs about lost opportunities. Seriously, anyone over the age of 14 or so should be able to relate to this song as it's so universal. Paradize Bay - the music and the lyrics sound like they should be two different songs. Whatever Joey Tempest was drinking at the time he wrote these lyrics I want some, it should NOT work but it does.Of course this is a debut effort and thre are some creaky bits. But I can forgive it all as a guilty pleasure, and John Norums Boyazont is not the low point that many instrumentals are. In fact to me it's one of the highlights of the album. And also shows why he won best guitarist in the competition that saw Europe get the funding for this, their debut effort."
1,"Shania's third album, Come On Over, is a country/pop giant.  It is loaded with great songs that Shania sings with energy and feeling.  There's a reason this sold a bazillion copies - it's awesome.  If you don't have it for some dumb reason, or just haven't gotten around to it, correct that mistake soon and get this."
1,"I don't care--it's just such a great song. It's fully on par with anything  from the four or five albums right after &quot;Future Passed&quot;. A lot  of people think that the &quot;Genesis Trio&quot; were the inventors of a  sound I never heard anyone come up with a label for (maybe  &quot;progressive soft-rock?&quot;). Nope, the Moodies had already done it  15 years before with that late-sixties cycle of albums. And &quot;The  Voice&quot; on this album is a reminder of that fact. And they pulled it  off without Mike Pinder, no less! Don't be put off by Pat Moraz's syrupy  intro--buy this album for that song, program your player to do the album in  its entirety--then tack on a repeat of &quot;The Voice&quot; as a  user-defined reprise."
1,"Is Marvin Gaye's masterpiece, What's Going On, outdated?Listen...War, crime, poverty, drugs, inflation, taxation, ecological disasters. These are some of the social and political issues that Marvin Gaye addresses on his brilliant 1971 album, What's Going On.And in 2008?Take a look around. These same issues are (still) What's Going On.This album couldn't be any more direct in identifying the world's most urgent problems, or in suggesting that the world slow down and take a spiritual and peaceful approach to solving them.Outdated? No.A masterpiece? Yes.The atmospheric, funky and smooth soul music is powerfully emotional, and perfectly highlights the thought provoking themes. Jazzy saxophones, flutes, congas and funky bass lines accompany Gaye's soulful piano and heartfelt vocal expressions. The sweet Motown orchestration brings it all together beautifully.Every song has a social conscience, and each one addresses one or more of the planet's important issues, then and now.What's Going On:Mother, motherThere's too many of you cryingBrother, brother, brotherThere's far too many of you dyingWhat's Happening Brother:Can't find no work, can't find no job, my friendMoney is tighter than it's ever beenSave The Children:I just want to ask a questionWho really cares?To save a world in despairWho really cares?Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology):Oh mercy mercy meAh, things ain't what they used to beWhat about this overcrowded landHow much more abuse from man can she stand?Inner City Blues (Makes Me Wanna Holler):Rockets, moon shotsSpend it on the have notsMoney, we make it'Fore we see it, you take itWhat's Going On is simply a brilliant and satisfying album. It couldn't be any better. The music is great, it's socially and politically relevant, and even as it tackles difficult issues, it's message is spiritually uplifting and positive. There are no romantic love songs here. They'll be on the next album. This isn't a sweeping epic, either, and more power to it for not being one. That would overwhelm Marvin's message. This is music for the people. For God's Children.What's Going On."
1,"Massive Attack has paved the way for all trip-hoppers and electronica artists.  They masterfully out-do themselves on every album (with their best album therefore being Mezzanine) and with slow songs, gradual climaxes, and heavy beats, its irresistable to an electronica fan.  There is no question that the best song on the album they put first, the title track, Protection.  Its a sweet song, with tracey thorn's smooth vocals (I cant change the way you feel, but i can put my arms around you) with a great guitar riff and the classic massive attack beats, at more than 6 minutes long.  No downtempo collection is complete without at least one massive attack record- and the rest of the album is pretty good- but the whole album is worth it for just that one song."
1,One of the first CD's I ever brought.  And I'm glad I did.  Bluey and company raised the standard of what soul music should be.  I love &quot;Millenium&quot; and &quot;I hear your name&quot;.  Definetly not your average R&amp;B group.  Buy it and jam on!!
1,"Now this is a greatest hits collection.I'll always remember seeing Diana  Ross in Vegas,and  Diana's on a screen singing,&quot;Ain't no mountain  hight enough.&quot;Then all of a sudden,she's walking down these long white  steps,and  comes right out of the screen.The audience went wild.During the  concert,Diana has everyone hold each others hand singing,&quot;Reach out  and touch,somebody's hand.&quot; This was a huge hit for the singer.I  remember going to church one Sunday when this song came out.The Priest  mentioned this wonderfull new record during Mass,about helping others  .&quot;Love Hangover,&quot; is one of my favorite songs.On my web-site,its  on my top 25 hits of all time.From all the Disco records to come from the  70's,this one's a classic. I'm so glad &quot;Upside down,&quot; and  &quot;I'm coming out&quot; is on this CD also.Your going to love this  collection of Diana's greatest hits."
1,"Donovan met the Maharishi and perked enough interest in Transcendental Meditation that after he finished recording A GIFT FROM A FLOWER TO A GARDEN, he was able to lead a troupe of celebs to Rishikesh, India, among the notable names: all four of The Beatles with their wives/girlfriends (John and Cynthia Lennon, George Harrison and Patti Boyd, Paul McCartney and Jane Asher, Ringo and Maureen Starkey), Mia Farrow and her sister Prudence, Mike Love of The Beach Boys.  The inspired troupe pretty much all came away disappointed.  In fact John wrote Sexie Sadie as a blistering indictment on the two-faced Maharishi (the song was originally titled ""Maharishi"", same four syllable enunciation as ""Sexie Sadie"", and George warned him that it could be libelous), John and Paul chronicled Prudence's locking herself in the room in hiding from the guru in Dear Prudence, Ringo left after only 10 days with his wife Maureen, unable to reconcile himself to the vegetarian diet, and some other sources even implied that the Maharishi made overt advances to Mia and/or Prudence.  Donovan remained mum on the entire experience.  One positive thing did arise out of the trip and that was a source of inspiration for Beatles and Donovan music.  According to Paul McCartney, it was during this time that Donovan instructed Lennon and McCartney in the claw hammer style of finger picking which is highly visible on Dear Prudence, Julia, Blackbird, and Mother Nature's Son.  For Donovan, the cross-fertilization of The Beatles with Donovan Leitch, resulted in a desire to reach the wider audience of trendier rock which was blooming into the late 60's ""classic rock"" era.  For his next recording, Donovan wanted Jimi Hendrix to play guitar but he was on tour and it was looking like he would call on old friend Jimmy Page again.  John Paul Jones and John Bonham would round out the New Yardbirds about to lend their hand to the HURDY GURDY MAN.HURDY GURDY MAN further benefits from eastern Indian classical influences as in previous inclusions of sitar, tablas, and other instruments, but takes these patterns a step further with the inclusion of harmonic drones.  Chiefly used in Peregrine, The River Song, and Tangier, the effect is hypnotic.  Those who enjoy and are familiar with Led Zeppelin's song In The Light (Physical Graffiti) will appreciate the earlier use of this.  Hurdy Gurdy Man itself was released as a very successful psychedelic-electric single and to that date was Donovan's hardest rock song yet.  The electric guitar leads swirled around the listener and no doubt Page contributed to this song!  It charted to #4 on the Billboard charts and #5 in the UK.  In addition to distorted guitar leads, an east Indian tambura is played by Donovan for seasoning on what would soon be labeled the ""Celtic Rock"" sound and what would eventually form into Led Zeppelin.  The tambura was a gift from George Harrison.  The other single on the album, also released prior to the album release was Jennifer Juniper, written for Jenny Boyd, sister of Patti Boyd who was George Harrison's first wife.  Donovan met both Boyd's in India with the Maharishi.  He became enamored of Jenny's free spirited manner which is reflected in the lilting song featuring wind instruments and a French coda.  Included on the CD as a bonus track is the third single from this period, Lale&ntilde;a, written about a character portrayed by Lotte Lenya in the 1931 film, The Three Penny Opera.  Of it, Donovan says ""she's a streetwalker, but in the history of the world, in all nations, women have taken on various roles from priestess to whore to mother to maiden to wife. This guise of sexual power is very prominent, and therein I saw the plight of the character. Women have roles thrust upon them and make the best they can out of them, so I'm describing the character Lotte Lenya is playing, and a few other women I've seen during my life, but it's a composite character of women who are outcasts on the edge of society.""Most of the other songs on the original album are uplifting, accessible, pop-rock numbers with a splash of jazz or Caribbean flavor, rounding out an excellent album of the highest musicianship, lyric writing, and songcraft from an era.  Get Thy Bearings, West Indian Lady, and Teas are significant standouts, but HURDY GURDY MAN is the one Donovan album I pick out as perfect with no warts.  Even the bonus material on the CD is the best addition out of all four of the EMI reissues.  Lale&ntilde;a already covered above, is accompanied by its B-side Aye My Love and the B-side from Hurdy Gurdy Man single, Teen Angel, both are fine songs.  Poor Cow, the B-side to Jennifer Juniper was written for and used in the film of the same name, another very poignant song.  What A Beautiful Creature You Are is a duet sung with the amazing Lulu, an infectious, happy, and slightly sexy song with a wisp of Jamaica Mon!  Finally, HURDY GURDY MAN is rounded out by the bonus track addition of re-recorded (and actually better sounding) singles of Colours and Catch The Wind which first made their appearance on Epic Records 1969 release of Donovan's Greatest Hits, when Pye Records would deny them access to his first two hit singles.  Including them here was pure genius on the part of EMI!I've given all five of the ""hippy"" albums, and the small label pastiche Catch The Wind folk album, 5-Stars, but I would like to say that HURDY GURDY MAN, for me, is the 5th Star above the others.  Stellar!"
1,"This album opens with a run of five songs as good as anything you care to call Great: sleek and taut disco tracks so pared back that any addition - shards of trumpet, an unexpected backing vocal - stands out stark and strange.  Jacko is at his most playful here, his voice moving with ease from unearthly falsetto to a more amused tone; the tantalising, delayed-start opening, whispers followed by the swirling disco strings of 'Don't Stop 'Til you get enough' set the tone for this fantastic pop.Schizophrenically, the album suddenly changes into slower, ballady mode.  'Girlfriend', 'I Can't Help it' and 'It's like falling in love' pass muster by virtue of cheeky lyrics, evocative choruses and imaginative instrumentation, but 'She's out of my life' is indefensible mallmuzakmush.  The album is redeemed by the Stevie Wonder-like excitement of 'Burn this disco out', but it's a shame 80s pop took its cue from this second half, and not the first."
1,"I absolutely adore and love this album.The songs just never gets old.My favourite song is ultimately Dangerous, i just fell in LOVE with the lyrics.How it flow and theverses he spoke were truly mesmerizing."
1,"In junior high school, my algebra teacher had countless laminated Neil Diamond posters on her classroom walls. This was enough to make me ignore Neil Diamond for the next decade. When you grow a little bit older and a little bit wiser, I guess, you can grow to appreciate talent. Neil Diamond is undoubtedly a talented singer and songwriter, and having given his material a fair listen (despite the early and haunting posters-in-math-class nightmare), I can say unequivocally that this album of his early songs is not only listenable but effectively entertaining. It chronicles what I consider to be the very best of Neil Diamond, before he started the easy listening drivel of later years (a la &quot;Coming to America&quot; sorts of things).  Diamond has been both revered and mocked by artists to come after him, including a band who does all Diamond covers. And of course songs like &quot;Girl You'll Be a Woman Soon&quot; have been high profile remakes (by Urge Overkill in the Pulp Fiction soundtrack). The beauty of this collection is that you cannot listen to it and hate it. It is just Neil Diamond at his best, and even if you are not a Diamond fan, you can appreciate it and will recognize the songs..."
1,"Rolling Stone Magazine recently devoted a whole issue to the 500 best albums of all time.  I was stunned that this album did not appear at least in the top 10.  It drives me to drink that there are millions of rock fans out there who don't even know this music exists.It is well known what the back-story is for this record.  Clapton fell for George Harrison's wife, Patty.  They had a fling and then she turned her back on him.  The resulting emotional devastation for Clapton wound up expressed as these songs.  When the original album came out, we knew none of this.  For the first couple of years, Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs was overlooked not only because the public didn't know the story but also because most didn't even know Eric Clapton played on it.  But on first listen, we knew ""something"" happened.  For all we knew, some girl who worked in a teashop could have dumped him.  It didn't matter.  Something real and wretched happened-this wasn't show business.Most women, unfortunately, do not know men can feel this way this deeply.  This is not to fault them.  They simply fall into the common human mistake of assuming that if men do not express it then they do not feel it.  Most men know well that these ""blues"" are all too real-they just rarely speak of them among themselves.  Sometimes they can pretend they are immune to them.  But deep down men know that ""that certain woman"" can destroy them.For all too many the only way we can talk about these things is through the anesthesia of intoxication.  While it is true that we often drink to forget, just as often we drink to remember because it is only with a numbness that we can deal and look at what's eating us.  So it was with Clapton.  He was taking large amount of drugs during the making of this album-heroin being just one.  Some argue that it was only through the haze of drugs and alcohol that Layla could be made.  Maybe yes.  Maybe no.  But even if were true that Layla had to have the ""blessing"" of intoxication to be made, it does not explain why this music is so beautiful.I have listened to this album ever since 1971.  Along the way, every single song at one time or another has become my favorite.  ""I Looked Away"" is the nice, gentle quiet before the storm.  It is deceptively a ""light"" beginning; but it immediately tells the listener what's going on.  ""Bell Bottom Blues"" is more dynamic but interestingly many dismiss it the first couple of listens.  Upon repeated hearings one becomes aware just how much this song ""cooks"".  Thematically, I would argue that Clapton's story is first summed up here.  ""Keep On Growing"" seems to a positive, exciting ""rave-up"" except a few notes of self-doubt which seep in.  The end of the first LP side of the album is wrapped up with ""Nobody Know You When You're Down And Out"".  Compared to ""Keep On Growing"", ""Nobody Knows You..."" is more somber.  It is a blues musing on how as times are good and bad friends come and go and after a while one is no longer so certain what those ""friends"" are worth.Side Two begins with ""I Am Yours"", an acoustic pleading that in spite the loved one's coldness the singers love still flows from the heart.  This followed by ""Anyday"".  I am surprised how many people do not care for this song; but you would have to have a heart of stone not the feel the combination of hope and anguish as the refrain is repeated:The second side finishes a long version of ""Key To The Highway"" and the third side opens with ""Tell The Truth"".  These two songs may seem to have little to do with the main story until one recognizes that both deal with ""leaving"".  The album then continues with ""Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad"".  While good in its own way, this version seems to be a mere blueprint to the extended one which appears on the In Concert album:  one of the all too few examples of where the ""live"" version is much better than the original.  The third side concludes with ""Have You Ever Loved A Woman"".  A sort of mediation and prayer over a love in which ""the water is wide...I can't cross o'er"".  It seems it's all over.But there's more.  The fourth side opens with ""Little Wing"".  Clapton worshiped the ground Hendrix walked on and he cried at Hendrix passing not because he left but because Hendrix didn't take Clapton with him.  So it has been all the more surprising and delightful that Clapton took Hendrix' sad, quiet and gentle song and made it raw, emotional and thunderous.  It is a successful example of two contrary emotions being expressed at the same time:  the lyrics are worshipping and loving while the music is heartbreaking and cries of desperation.  ""It's Too Late"" is a relatively simply and ""clean"" realization that ""that one last chance"" is gone.  It is a little gem.Then we end with ""Layla"".  ""Layla"" restates the story of the whole album and begs the lost love to take the singer back.  ""Layla"" ends with a dreamy, grand instrumental suggesting a sweet reconciliation of the two lovers.  The time of distress and torment is over.But with ""Thorn Tree In The Garden"" we realize that dreamy reconciliation existed only in the hopes of the singer.  It is a new day and our lover is still gone.This is one of the greatest rock and roll records ever made.  Do yourself a favor and get it.  Listen to it a lot.  Make it yours.  You will love it.  And then maybe after twenty years you'll begin to understand it.  May you never have to experience something like it for yourself someday."
1,"This was the first album I had ever bought with my own money.  My sister told me to get it, so I was like okay and I bought it.  This album is amazing, everytime I had a bad day or was disappointed I would put this album in.  This isn't considered by many to be thier best album, but to me there is probably nothing more timeless than this cd.  I'm personally attached to this album, it changing my perspective on music, on almost everything.  Before this I was trapped to the radio and populare culture, I didn't know just what music lay out there, what great sounds can came from the underground.  This opened me up.  Every song I enjoy, every cd I buy that I love, every band who gets money out of my wallet better pay this album respect becuase it is probably the only reason why I'm here today.  Music is important, it's my life, it is one of the only thing that I am truly passionate about.  This album opened up so much for me, it gave me so much.  Thank you NOFX for the music you have put out."
1,"It's interesting to see that, although there is a divergence of opinion on just where to place this CD in Cyndi Lauper's oeuvre, most of the reviewers below find &quot;A Hat Full of Stars&quot; to be a quality effort.  Indeed, there was little reason for Cyndi's '90s work not be better promoted and better known.  Tastes change, of course, but Sony really should have found a better marketing strategy to promote Lauper's more mature work.  The fact that many people still consider her to be a sort of novelty act is disheartening.  She is a singer of considerable range and an artist who takes her work seriously and has seldom, if ever, come up short.Rock critics, who championed Lauper in '84, pretty much abanoned her by the late 80's.  That's a pity, because she was developing as a singer and as a songwriter the whole time.  I understand that some fans found this more seriously-themed effort (she addresses such topics as abuse, abortion, and racism) as something of a &quot;downer.&quot;  But &quot;Feels Like Christmas&quot; is exuberant, and the (mysteriously ignored) single &quot;Who Let In the Rain&quot; is elegant pop.  Perhaps the only problem with the song is that it was released shortly after Madonna's similarly themed &quot;Rain&quot;--echoing the whole &quot;True Colors&quot; / &quot;True Blue&quot; synchronicity from the '80s.One thing Cyndi Lauper does not need is more Madonna comparisons.  Yes, they did emerge at the same time and they both were originally exponents of thrift store chic, but the similarities pretty much end there--well, OK, they're both Italian-American Catholics too...but the similarities really DO end there.  OK, OK, they both came from homes that were at least at times single-parented, and they both had issues with step-family.  But the similarities really do end there!!  Here's the key difference:  Cyndi Lauper decided, at some point, to focus more on her music than on her persona.  She has paid a price for that in terms of commercial viability.  But as this CD and her subsequent work demonstrate, she remains a talent to be reckoned with.  It's a downright shame that her work has been so ignored."
1,"While not the heights that Rocks or Toys in the Attic attained, Get Your Wings is a great hard rock CD. ""Train Kept a Rollin'"" is worth the price all by itself, but you also get ""Same Old Song and Dance"", ""Lord of the Thighs"" and ""Seasons of Wither"". There's more maturity and depth to these songs, not just a cool guitar riff, and Tyler's voice is stronger and more confident. While their first album was good, Get Your Wings was the beginning of a four or five year run for Aerosmith as the world's biggest rock band."
1,"I know this is a classic but the reason I said 4.5 stars is the last few tracks wihich let it down a bit. The standout tracks are ""How could I just Kill a man"" ""Psychobetabuckdown"" and ""Hand on the Pump"" ia also think ""pigs"" is good too. This is the debut and is tight so ya gotta cop it.and thats all I have to say about that"
0,Been there done that sound. I can think of a thousand bands that deserve the deluxe remastering treatment over this drivel.
1,I love this album. It's the sexy side of Melissa. I'm on my second CD of this because I wore out the first.
1,"On this solo release by Daryl Hall, he forgoes the pop/rock/soul mixture that was the trademark sound of many H&O albums for a brilliant update of the classic ""Philly Soul"" sound. The Teddy Pendergrass/Marvin Gaye influence is very obvious here, but these songs are still under the control of Daryl Hall, whose singing here is probably the most impassioned and heartfelt of any album in his (or H&Os) career. The track ""I'm In A Philly Mood"" is unquestionably one of the greatest ""black"" songs by a white guy ever."
1,"Seventh Sojourn is one of those albums that never grows old.  I first purchased it as a vinyl way back in the early 70s, and fell in love with it.  The arrangements are lush and evocative; the music itself is poignant,  melodic and memorable; the lyrics danced across the turntable.  Songs such  as &quot;For My Lady,&quot; &quot;When I'm a Free Man,&quot; &quot;Lost in  a Lost World&quot; and &quot;Isn't Life Strange&quot; will be Moody  classics in years to come.  AS most reviewers agreed, despite it being a  fun tune, &quot;I'm Just a Singer&quot; is seriously out of place on this  album, but who can help but like that bass leadin?  It's truly one of their  best, and for a band that's been around for over 30 years, that's saying a  lot!"
1,"With those words, Mark E. Smith more or less sums up The Fall's entire aesthetic. Even when the music moved in a poppy direction, Smith's rambling bursts of vitrol always remained front and center. After the pop-influenced, but no less brilliant Wonderful And Frightening World Of The Fall, This Nation's Saving Grace returns the band to a more atonal direction, one which blends the shiny textures of the ""Brix-era"" with the feedback-drenched cacophony of Hex Enduction Hour. ""Bombast,"" ""Barmy,"" and ""My New House"" are all The Fall doing The Fall and doing it without sounding the least bit redundant. There's even the synth-jittery ""L.A.,"" a minimalistic piece of pop that only Smith and his crew could pull off. What perhaps makes The Fall so significant is that their layout was ripe for repeating itself, yet they always sounded vital. Maybe it's also for the sub-avant-garde experiments like ""Paint Work"" and ""I Am Damo Suzuki."" But The Fall still sound unquestionably original today, not just because music is in an awful state, but because nobody can touch what they did."
1,"Xscape truly brought it to the masses with this album, and in the manner in which they spoke their minds in song, they proved to be a force to be reckoned with and they couldn't be denied. Songs like Just Kickin' It (personally, I prefer the remix over the original), Understanding, and I Got Love On My Mind are 3 major examples off this album that back up my thoughts. It's definitely worth having."
1,"What do you get if you cross blues, folk, rock, pop and funk?  Answer:  this album.  I know it sounds preposterous, but this is the most accomplished product of ""borrowing"" that I have ever heard.  The tracks are formed from an eclectic variety of musical elements.  For instance, ""Train"" sounds like Southern blues-rock (it actually reminds me of the theme song from HBO's vampire series ""True Blood"") with some Red Hot Chili Peppers funk thrown in.  More Chili Peppers can be heard in ""Superfly"", ""No Place Like Home"" and ""Calling All The People"".  ""Pleasantly Blue"" has a riff reminiscent of both ""Tobacco Road"" and Bowie's ""Jean Genie"", then morphs into a little Stray Cats style.  The hit, ""What's Up"", is to me a great neo-hippie song with vague social observations;  and there's more of that in the power ballad ""Dear Mr. President"".  ""Morphine & Chocolate"" is slow blues about addictive crutches.  ""Spaceman"" is like a folky, fantasy take on Velvet Underground.  In ""Old Mr. Heffer"", you can hear both Elvis and CCR.  ""Drifting"" is a really pretty but ""shouted"" acoustic, angsty ballad with strings.So, what ties all this together?  Singer-songwriter Linda Perry, of course.  Her voice is strong and exuberant, and her persona radiates confidence, good will and sly, intelligent humor, making this album a more than adequate artistic statement.  Too bad it was the only one the band made."
1,"Marvin Gaye in the late 60's and early 70's was an important artist in the Motown family. His soulful voice, combined with his passion and energy in his songs, made him a shining star. However, closing in on age 30, he was ready to try something new, expand his artistic vision, something that never ever was done in the Motown factory. Berry Gordy was pretty clear on what he wanted: chart topping, radio playing, record selling hits. He hired singers to sing these songs, and writers to write these songs. The songs were light on meaning, heavy on melody, and always loaded with hooks. Gaye was itching just like the Beatles in the 60's did to move past simple songs. He wanted to write his own material, and sing what was really on his mind. Finally, in the early 1970's, he released ""What's Going On"", an album that Gordy was very hesitant in releasing. What ended up happening was history changing.""What's Going On"" is a concept album, in which Gaye co-wrote and sang songs about many of the issues of concern at the time. The title track deals with his brother Frankie coming home from the Vietnam War and what they thought about the whole war. ""Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology Song)"" tackles environmental issues that were going on at the time, including the increase in nuclear power. ""Inner City Blues (Make Me Want to Holler)"" talked about the increasing problems in the city, with drugs, crime, etc. These three songs hit the Top 20 to the surprise of Gordy, and in the process, it helped other Motown artists (mainly Stevie Wonder) in getting their artistic freedom to try new things with their music.The music is meaningful, and it makes you think. It's smooth, soulful beat reminds me of walking through a park on Sunday morning. Gaye broke down the doors that all R & B music had to be about fluffy, bubblegum topics and that artists could create their own sound and meaning. Gaye redefined himself as a socially conscious singer/songwriter with this album, and would later define himself also as a highly romantic artist with ""Let's Get It On."" It helped in sealing the legacy of the late Marvin Gaye. Get a piece of music changing history today."
1,"""Dangerous"" came out at a time when Michael's fame was so in your face you just couldn't escape it. And then, the video for ""Black and White"" debuts with the infamous temper tantrum and crotch grabbing at the end that really did me in. (But still, I found myself oddly entranced at the boldness of that section of the video. I still find the crotch grabbing really unnecessary. Yet, the temper tantrum....well, remained intriguing). I never liked ""Black & White"" as a song very much and I still don't. And the face morphing was done more effectively by Diana Ross ironically in her promo video for ""Heavy Weather"" from ""The Force Behind the Power"", her worldwide smash that came out about the same time. The execution of the morphing is not as seamless but infinitely more moving.  I had purchased the very special pop-up package that was quite elaborate. At a distance, the artwork looked like Michael wanted us to believe he was some super-human, god-like even. It was around this time that the press release had gone out to MTV, VH1, BET and all other music outlets dictating that they proclaim him ""The King of Pop"". It was all a bit too much. That said, the Teddy Riley-produced tracks on ""Dangerous"" help to make it edgy and exciting. But I wasn't ready to concede this point in 1991. The chorus to ""Jam""  .....""it ain't too much, it ain't too much, it ain't too much for me"" caused me to say to myself, ""no Michael, it ain't too much, it's just a bit much for me"". The riffs felt like recycled James Brown-licks, which were signature for Michael, hot, but, heard on many of his best hits previously.Though I found ways of escaping ""Dangerous"", there would be moments like being in a cab in Rio de Janeiro and hearing the driver playing the CD. I would have to say to myself that it sounds better than I wanted to give it credit. And in a sense, the music from ""Dangerous"" would haunt me for years to come. Oprah's praise of ""Who Is It?"" left me feeling a little out of the loop. On the other side, my friends and I would chuckle at the title of ""In the Closet"" like if indeed we were in the know. The romantic entanglement between Michael and Naomi Campbell was not believable either. But the music kept coming back to haunt me. The 2nd biggest legitimate hit off the album, ""Remember the Time"" also reminded me of trying to recapture the light airy-ness of ""Rock With You"". I still couldn't get the album out of my head though. So finally, as the year's ensued.....his mega-stardom was dimmed considerably, it felt safe to go back and listen to ""Dangerous"". (And never forget the super cool pop-up promo package that I have to look at).Now, in his sad transition. I unfortunately, get to listen even more intently. And in that listening, I find that ""Dangerous"" may be as strong as ""Off the Wall"". ""Thriller"" was great but far too calculated for my epicurean taste. I am completely enamored with the Teddy Riley-produced tracks including ""Jam"", ""Why You Want to Trip on Me"", ""Can't Let Her Get Away"" ....love that song right now, love it and the title track. As previously mentioned, ""Dangerous"" really should be weighed as 2 albums. The Riley tracks ARE the ""dangerous"" tracks in their brooding, hot rhythms. Vocally, it has always been fascinating how Michael takes the funky adlibs of James Brown and blends in Diana Ross cooing to come up with his own sound. The other tracks are good, some giving the album that ""global/world music"" feel in ""Heal the World"" and ""Will You Be There"". It is that dichotomy that stops ""Dangerous"" from being superb. (By the way, the ""Dangerous"" album is currently not available for purchase as an Mp3 on iTunes or Amazon???). But if ""Dangerous"" were a EP featuring only said tracks it would be a 5-star winner in my opinion.It is sad for me personally that it took his passing for me to come full circle and acknowledge that he is/was one of the greatest artists of all time. I have been a fan since Diana Ross ""presented"" The Jackson 5. I have always loved his melodic chord changes blended with his funkiness. If he had not become so obsessed with being the greatest, he would not have needed to try so hard because he was already there."
1,"&quot;The End of the Innocence&quot; really hit home.When JFK was killed in Dallas,I lost my Innocence.This song,that Bruce Hornsby co-wrote,and plays keyboards on,just brings back that terrible day.I was only 8,but I still remember sitting in my 3nd Grade Classroom,and being sent home.This song also tells about the terrible Reagan years,with the line,&quot;For this tired old man that we elected king,&quot; and the preachers telling us not to sin,while there sleeping with everyone and stealing our money.Every song on this CD has some special meaning.&quot;I will not go Quietly,&quot;about turning your life around,&quot;The last worthless evening,&quot; a loveless relationship,and a the wonderfull fun cut,&quot;Shangri-la.&quot; The last song on the album,&quot;The Heart of the Matter,&quot; is my favorite.Just forget about hatred,and move on.&quot;You keep carryin that anger,it'll eat you up inside.&quot;When you play &quot;The End of the Innocence,&quot; you think about the end of he 80's.This album is Don Henley's greatest solo Album."
0,"This album was the denouement of my high school existence.  I give this competent, pleasant, easy listening soft rock formula pablum two stars, however, because, like the urge I get to put on an aural-opium laced Celine Dion album occasionally, it's addictively listenable as background muzak.  It's like listening to the closest thing to rock 'n' roll that Elvis recorded between 1960 and 1964.Stylistically, what I wanted when my gonads woke up and took over my mind at puberty was hard drug rock, pounding Chicago blues rock 'n' roll chords, Chuck Berry riffs, Elvis before he was fixed at the Vet's, Jerry Lee Lewis pounding out boogie woogie, the Who, and the Rolling Stones telling off my parents.  All of that stuff came of age with my older brother, while my generation got Boone-vanilla'd by James Taylor imitating a folky Der Bingle, Helen Reddy vamping around in a boy-cut hairstyle trying to Aussie Barb Streisand's act but clipping off her vocals in the most annoying manner, and Carole King whining that men wanted only one thing....  My parents had all those Ray Conniff, Andre' Kostelanetz & His Orchestra, and Percy Faith albums--that style of music tried to accomodate rock, both Percy Faith and Perry Como recorded a Patridge Family #1 hit! My generation endured the lectures about what was ""good music"" (We wanted the other stuff!).  Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, Boston (we could get Boston; it was the one bright point in an otherwise dreary selection at the hardware store's record room), AC/DC, and Kiss came in big just as I was hitting high school, but my crowd got John Denver, Anne Murray, Mike Curb Congregation, and Bread--getting the hard stuff, the good stuff, took getting on the good side of some cool friends who could get past the lady at the record counter censoring our purchases--AND threatening to call our parents.  Pass me that 8-track Olivia Newton-John's MAKING A GOOD THING BETTER, please....  The best we could hope for was America, the Eagles, Captain & Tennille.Well, if ya can't beat 'em, join 'em.  REO Speedwagon and a little later Styx schamltzed their sound, made easy listening soft pop records, accomodated the same market share as THE EAGLES GREATEST HITS, AMERICA-HISTORY, NEIL DIAMOND SEPTEMBER MORN (how far he'd fallen since HOT AUGUST NIGHT!),and CAPTAIN & TENNILLE COME IN FROM THE RAIN.  This album:  mix up and process Cronin's voice to sound like the Ray Conniff Singers, soften the sound with keyboards, record the guitar work to suggest Percy Faith's string section, and mix down the bass, the beat, the rock rebellion.  This album was the gateway drug to Air Supply and Pablo Cruise...and Neil Diamond's YOU DON'T BRING ME FLOWERS."
0,first off this album lacks imagintation its unbelivable admittedly they have a good guitarist in the form of tom mellero but otherwise they are a load of crap this is the worst cd in my collection and i have never brought another ratm record since if you want to hear political rock i sugest system of a down this the worst cd in my collection now there are some who may like this if you like rap you may do but the rap element isnt perticullary good quality even by the standard it has been set so unless your a fan of rap-rock (crap rock) then buy thisnow i only borrowed this album from someone who said it was brilliant it is probably worth borrowing if you like catchy guitar riffs ruined by some crap rapper
1,"Serpentine Fire, Fantasy, Jupiter, Lover's Holiday, Brazilian Ryhme. We're just talking about one side of the album. This is their best record ever!!!!!"
1,"It was 1987 and forty-one-year old Cher had been the star of a highly rated television series (with former husband Sonny), had won an Oscar (and had received several acting nominations), and had become a fashion icon. However, she had somewhat alienated herself from the younger record-buying public. She had to show the kids that she could still rock with the best of them.Well, she really showed them with this self-titled album, a collection of hard rocking tunes that exhibits the singer's passionate vocal and distinctive style.She also pays tribute to her past with a hard-hitting remake of ""Bang! Bang!, as well as the dance-flavored ""Skin Deep.""Of course, the quadruple punch of ""I Found Someone,"" ""We All Sleep Alone,"" ""Working Girl,"" and ""Dangerous Times"" are the album's highlights, but this is an excellent release from a legendary performer.It is also one of the best albums of the 80's and it's sometimes good to ""turn back time"" and reflect on monumental music."
1,"Helmet caught everyone's attention with their monster song &quot;Unsung&quot; in 92.  I saw the video on MTV's Headbanger's Ball and used to sit in rapt attention every week hoping that Rickie would play it.  Just so I could hear that wall of guitar sound...the beautiful reverberation of the snare head and the pounding of the kick drum....ah.  That was heaven.  I purchased the album and immediately liked some of the songs, especially &quot;In the Meantime&quot;.  While this disc was a trendsetter, some of it just sounds blah and repetitive.  Most of the other tracks do not standout or contain anything terribly interesting.  That said, Helmet knew how to rock.  They had a tight sound that was delivered no-holds-barred.  I appreciate their enthusiasm and delivery, however, at this point in their career they had yet to become GREAT songwriters with the exception of the above mentioned tracks.  So if you see this disc lying around and have not heard it give it a try, maybe it will be your thing.  You are sure to like at least some of the tunes a lot."
1,"Most, and most likely all, of the people who don't like The Beach Boys' classic,Pet Sounds(1966), just don't like The Beach Boys. If you don't like the beach, you're not gonna like surfing.Pet Soundsis actually quite a remarkable piece of of work. Introspective and deeply personal, the songs are about life, love and yearning, not surfing and hot rodding on the strip. The album is a symphony of sophisticated chord changes, wistful melodies, sweet vocal harmonies, and reflective lyrics of love and longing. The true genius of Brian Wilson realized.The classic Beach Boys sound isn't completely lost here, and it's especially highlighted in the album's first song, Wouldn't It Be Nice and in the sailor's boisterous lament, Sloop John B, but mostly the atmosphere onPet Soundsisn't the usual fun day at the beach. It's quiet, thoughtful and lonely.Sometimes I feel so very sadAnd I guess I just wasn't made for these timesConsidering this was released in 1966, it's an amazing accomplishment. Sir Paul McCartney praised the album by saying, ""No one is educated musically until they've heard Pet Sounds...It is a total, classic record that is unbeatable in many ways.""There is another dimension toPet Soundsthat's evident to people who were around in 1966 and remember listening to the album when it was first released. The loss of innocence. The world was changing fast in the 1960s, and The Beach Boys represented good, clean and carefree fun to a lot of people. The melancholy spirit of many of the songs onPet Soundsseemed to be sadly saying goodbye to the endless summer of innocence in America. And in many ways, it actually did.Could I ever find in you againThings that made me love you so much then?Could we ever bring 'em back once they have gone?Oh, Caroline no"
1,"CARIBOU, Elton John's fourth album as a real rock & roller (and his tenth overall, if you count the soundtrack to the film FRIENDS) is a great one. This is one of the most underrated Elton albums of all time, and anyone who claims it's not the equal of GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD should be institutionalized in a psychiatric facility's secure ward. I know I'm sounding a bit harsh, but I feel this way because this album was the first not to feature the hollow-sounding orchestral arrangements of Paul Buckmaster, who seemed to make real violins, violas, and cellos sound synthetic. Instead, we get the Tower Of Power Horns on many songs, which adds punch to both the rockers and the ballads. Any putdown of this CD is, in my view, a form of temper-tantrum."
1,"to this day is one of the BEST instrumentals on the planet with its gorgeous melody &amp; sleek groove. Ramsey Lewis, a master keyboardist and jazz legend in his own right combines forces with the &quot;elements&quot; to make this musical gem. Not only does EWF lend an unforgettable vocal melody, with Maurice and Phillip on percussion, Verdine and Johnny Graham on guitar, Don Myrick on sax and Charles Stepney on fender rhodes, &quot;Sun Goddess&quot; is the epitome of a classic jazz masterpiece. The drumming on this track is amazing as all other solos (check out Myrick's sax and Verdine's bass...too funky!) &quot;Sun Goddess&quot; is 8 1/2 minutes of bliss.The seventies vibe continues flowing with &quot;Living for the City&quot;. The S.Wonder interpretation is laced heavily with rhodes and a punchy string arrangement by Richard Evans. &quot;Love Song&quot; features Cleveland Eaton on upright and fender bass while Ramsey puts in serious work on all 4 kinds of keys as well as guitar. The horns and strings on this track add just the right flavor. &quot;Jungle Strut&quot; is a fun track that showcases the playful verbal antics of Derf Rehlew Raheem, adding African ryhthmic sound effects and dialect. &quot;How Dawgit&quot;, like the title track was produced by Maurice White and features the smooth vocals of Phillip Bailey. &quot;Tambura&quot; has a spacey feel to it with its sound effects and percussive arrangement.  Kinda brings the image of Bootsy Collins en route to the moon to mind. &quot;Gemini Rising&quot; is another great track on which Maurice Jennings drumming and C.Eaton's bass playing stand out, especially on the solos within the song. Ramseys keys ride the track smoothly.Overall Sun Goddess is a great CD for jazz lovers or anyone who wants to slip back down memory lane and relax in the mid 70's. Go ahead and put those platforms, bell bottoms, sunglasses and apple caps Right On!CLB."

1,"Michael Jackson will always Be to My Ears.as a Kid not many Before or since can hang with His Depth&Raw Soul.He is truly one of the Greatest Artists Ever.these Songs showcase a Young Brother who just had that ""IT"" that you can't plan in a Boardroom.He has that Gut-Bucket kind of it that Legends are made of.I'll always Be down with the King of Pop.He truly is One of a Kind.The Brother is still Badd!!"
1,"Well, I was doubting a little or I should give this album 5 starz or 4.5 'cause I think Big L was and still is one of the most talented rappers out there but some of the beats are wack. Unfortunatly I don't own this CD, I just borrowed it from a friend but I'll buy it for sure! All the lyrics wich come out of his mouth are true and deep and he's one of the best storytellers in the game. Everybody who likes hip hop should have this album, I can guarantee you'll love it. True, the production isn't outstanding but that's just another think wich makes this sound so great, it makes you feel back in the earlier 90's. And not ALL the beats are plain, there are some good ones too like &quot;put it on&quot; wich is my favourite, &quot;No endz no skinz&quot;, &quot;8 iz enuff&quot; and &quot;All black&quot; wich is also on Nas' Illmatic album &quot;Halftime&quot;. Anyway it's a true classic and it should be in everybody's collection! COP it!!"
1,"What can I say about this album? One word: exciting. Every track is pleasing to the ears. My favorite song on this album would have to be Breathe Again. Toni is truly a star, and I don't think many singers that are out right now can mess with Toni."
1,"Just blew my review with a flick of a pinky.  Suffice it to say, this thing is a must get.  Super solid pop radio perfect punk songs, not hardcore at all, along the lines of 999.  What's striking is that it is virtually the perfect album with zero weak songs and 80% of the songs would easily have been top radio hits if pop punk had ever made it outside of England.  If you like the first two albums of the UNDERTONES or the hits of the BUZZCOCKS or even the pop punk of the Incredible Shrinking DICKIES, just get this album.  If you have not heard it, you will be amazed.  I first heard it around 1980 and each decade that I listen to it again, it still is as totally fresh as it was when I first heard it.  Sing alongable songs, classics.  There's a review here that gives it 1 star.  Ok, so not everyone gets it.  But, believe me, and I've spent all these years listening to punk, from hardcore to pop punk and a range of rock and jazz and have owned 1,000's of albums and 7""s and cds and this is one of the best ones I ever bought.  Super high quality musically, fun, snappy, enjoyable, just what you would expect to hear on the radio if pop punk had made it big.  Do not short change yourself, this is the one to get.  If you don't like it, like that one fellow, then I am not sure what you actually like, but it ain't fun sounding, classy, jumpy, catchy power pop punk.  Cuz that's what this is, start to finish, a stone classic. chrisbct@hotmail.com"
1,"This was a breath of fresh air in 1997. The Sneaker Pimps are the awkward cousins of Garbage and the neighbors of Everything But The Girl, and as they march toward their latest release Blood Sport, they come with pretty decent material under their belt. Becoming X is a smooth, ambient-laced odyssey that at times seems so right and others just unnecessary and too sleepy for its own good. The best stuff is at the top of the disc: ""Low Place Like Home"", ""Tesko Suicide"", ""Six Underground"", and the title track. They all have their own charm though, mixing a punky attitude in some places, folky guitar in some, and Nyquil-ish trance in the others. One of those albums that starts off great and loses steam toward the end. Worth purchasing for the mentioned songs, and a few other elements. Maybe the electronic boom is passing. Who knows? Maybe Blood Sport and Moby's upcoming 18 can save the rave."
1,but this joint is pretty solid.  got kind of an old school vibe to it (because its old).  probably freaky tales and dope fiend beat are the two highlights here
1,"I first heard of Slint when Steve Albini was raving about them, and then also when I bought the KIDS soundtrack, Slint's &quot;Good Morning, Captain&quot;, off this album, was on it. &quot;Good Morning, Captain&quot; is such a terrific song, and it propelled me to go and buy all of Slint's stuff. The first album I bought by Slint was &quot;Tweez.&quot; I wasn't immediately impressed by this album, but it grew on me.I then bought &quot;Spiderland&quot;, which I have listened to over and over again, and then I listened to &quot;Tweez&quot; and it just sounded that much better because I was used to their precise, mathematical style of music that they play.&quot;Spiderland&quot; is just an amazing album. I like this album so much that it has rendered me incapable of trying to describe how good it is. My only recommendation is that you buy it and hear what I'm talking about."
1,"I remember my DAD having the original 33 which was fun to listen to so naturally this CD is special.However, Barry White is one of those artists whose songs sound a bit alike after a while.  So you can buy a GREATEST HITS collection and leave it at that.I bought this one for two reasons:  MELLOW MOOD Pt. 1 and the introduction on YOU'RE THE FIRST, LAST, EVERYTHING cause that intro was left off on the GREATEST HITS CD.If you're a long time serious White fan, get this album.  Otherwise, a GREATEST HITS album will suffice."
1,"I was really on the fence about this. The album has a droning sameness to it and the production was rather flat and sometimes annoying (can't believe it was Steve Lillywhite). But it does have ""Sister Europe"", a cover of ""Mack The Knife"" and a demo version of ""Flowers"" which sounds just like the Velvet Underground and is much better than the version they put on the album."
1,"After getting his major debut in the group The Madd Circle, with west coast rapper, WC, Coolio came out with his solo debut It Takes A Thief back in 1994. His debut was able to blend in with the popular west coast rap scene around that time. Here Coolio takes you through a tale of stories before he became a recording artist. The album's concept is interesting, but at the same time, gets kind of repetitive. But the overall product is highly enjoyable for one fan to like.With the lead single ""Fantastic Voyage"", Coolio creates a track for one to bounce to. ""County Line"", and ""Mama I'm In Love With A Gangsta"", he rhymes about being broke and being locked away for some time. The latter track features up and coming rapper Leshaun (you might recognize her from LL Cool J's ""Doin' It"") who drops an okay verse. Further down the album are tracks like ""Can-O-Corn"", and ""Sticky Fingers"" where he reminisces over times he used to shoplift to get by in life. The album's title track is one of the biggest highlights on the album as Coolio tells stories on how he used to rob people for their goods. ""N Da Closet"" is another standout, as he explains about the effects of his drug habit. The end of the album ""I Remember"" is another great track that features J-Ro from the Alkaholiks, and Billy Boy.Given that this is an excellent album, Coolio missteps on such songs like ""Ghetto Cartoon"", and ""On My Way To Harlem"". Both tracks are one of the few that failed to standout in my opinion.Overall Coolio's debut was a great album. Coolio sounds very motivated and hungry as he strives to keep his lyrical content above the average. I enjoyed the content that he placed here on this album, and it will keep a listener interested. Given that this is out of print, and only sells for a penny, this is one purchase I would recommend, especially those who are new to Coolio and are on the fence about his material. Peace.Lyrics: B+Production: B+Guest Appearances: B+Musical Vibes: A-Top 5 Tracks:1. It Takes A Thief2. I Remember (featuring J-Ro and Billy Boy)3. N Da Closet4. Fantastic Voyage5.

1,"Stevie Wonder-Innervisions *****1973 was one of the greatest years in music. Many of the worlds greatest albums were released that year and Innervisions is with out question one of those albums. Innervisions is on par with Talking Book, and Songs In The Key Of Life, both of which are concidered his two strongest albums with this as a close third. I Personally feel that this is stronger then Songs In The Key Of Life, far better in fact.The album seems to loosly follow a pattern of a funk driven grooved out song followed by a more mellow track, this is especially true on the first half of the album. I must say that I do not like the albums opener, 'Too High' the lyrics seem childish for someone of Wonders stature as a song writer. The music however is fantastic. 'Visions' has the albums best lyrics but lacks musicaly. The total packages on the album are 'Living For The City' which is easily his all time best, 'Higher Ground' is another classic though I prefer the Chili Pepper remake. 'Jesus Children' is a fantastic track vocaly, music wise, and lyricaly. 'Don't You Worry Bout A Thing' was another minor hit and while it can be self indulgent at times it's still pretty good.Innervisions may not be the best Stevie Wonder album but it is close. If your looking for something besides what you hear on the radio then this is a good place to start along side Talking Book, and Songs In The Key Of Life."
1,"Cream - Disraeli Gears (1967)These 60s rock gods made some of the best music of the era which was, along with Jimi Hendrix, a precursor to Heavy Metal. Each musician was and still is extremely talented. Drummer Ginger Baker loved to make full use of his kit. He turned the drums into musical instruments, far beyond simply functioning to keep time. Especially of note was his genius use of the double kick drums, putting all his limbs into fluid motion. Eric Clapton really came into his own with Cream, finally playing with musicians who could really challenge him. As great as his music has been over the years, I think his playing with Cream finds him at his most adventurous, a true creative peak. And main vocalist Jack Bruce is a unique bassist who could hold his own with Clapton.Having said all that, this album, great as it is, doesn't exactly sound timeless to me. It's very much stuck in the 60s, a product of its time. Of course, the best rock ever made was in the 60s and DISREALI GEARS is very enjoyable today, but I think younger kids just getting into it won't look at it the same way or even as fondly as those who were there. I actually hate a lot of the frat-punk, nu-metal, whatever-you-want-to-label-it that's around today, but I don't think younger people would find Cream as exciting as newer bands like, say, Van Halen, Rage Against the Machine, Death or Mars Volta. Of course, this review will get poo-pooed on by the old cheese-cutter types who were ""there"" and who would claim that 60s groups like Cream are the be-all-end-all of rock and that rock has hardly changed or progressed in any interesting way since then (me? I'm somewhere in between, born in 1970).Also, many rock fans will no doubt be happy with a ""best-of"" Cream collection that includes the best songs from this album (""Strange Brew,"" ""Sunshine of Your Love,"" ""Tales of Brave Ulysses,"" and ""SWLABR""); the others are less essential. They're good though, especially if you like old-school blues with standard chord changes - Cream handles this style expertly.Like most really talented bands, seeing them live is where it's at. To my amazement, they've recently reunited and immediately started selling out shows in London. If you can't catch them, at least try to get a hold of some classic live footage where they've really played out their improvisational jazz-influenced skills to the hilt.My impressions of DISRAELI GEARS:""Strange Brew"" - killer, loping melody that's almost funky. Clapton totally off the hook and all over the frets. *****""Sunshine of Your Love"" - a monster, possibly their most famous tune save for ""White Room"" which still gets played to death on classic rock radio. Incredible, but Jimi Hendrix, who loved Cream, could play this one better than anybody. *****""World of Pain"" - good song, classic Cream sound, Clapton tripping the psychedelic tones. ***1/2""Dance the Night Away"" - mysterious sounding rocker loaded with psychedelia. ***1/2""Blue Condition"" - written (and I believe sung) by Ginger Baker, this is a quirky waltz with honky-tonk piano accents. ***1/2""Tales of Brave Ulysses"" - ""Slow Hand"" speaks through his guitar in pure note-warping heaven. ****1/2""SWLABR"" - with the possible exception of ""Crossroads,"" this might be the most upbeat, exciting, rockin'-est Cream tune ever and my personal favorite on the album. *****""We're Going Wrong"" - as the title indicates, this is a rather downbeat number, although Ginger is just all over his drums. Amazing performance, but probably my least favorite track here. ***""Outside Woman Blues"" - upbeat, standard blues, Clapton on vocals. Quite enjoyable if you're into this sort of thing. ***3/4""Take It Back"" - peppy down home blues shuffle accented with harmonica and crowd noises. ***1/2""Mother's Lament"" - basically a joke song with vocals and piano, the boys hamming it up, having a ball.Worth getting, and I would agree with most other reviewers here, this is Cream's best album - but see 'em live! (however you can!)"
0,"Track 19 ""Waterloo"" is corrupt. The first part has been cut and it jumps when the song starts. I contacted Customer Service and found out that it's located in the Philipines (according to the tech); they couldn't understand what I was saying about it being corrupt and insisted that the download failed. Playing it on the Amazon Cloud Player results in the same problem. I insisted on speaking to a manager who said she would take care of it and with a an hour I received and email saying the problem was fixed. But the problem was not fixed as of this writing."
1,"This cd is the best by Outkast. Its southern hip hop at its finest, and the Kast tell life from the south in a funky, and unique way. A must have for true hip hop heads. This is a classic, along with The Chronic, E.1999  Eternal, Me Against The World, etc etc.......Definatly  reccommended........."
1,"This album is a rap CLASSIC! Every song on it is perfect. The best songs are Got My Mind Made Up, 2 Of Amerikaz most wanted, and How Do U Want It. This album is a MASTERPEICE"
1,"Remember when you were but a small child, and when you had trouble falling asleep your parents would come and bring you into a lull with nursery rhymes? In short, that's what ""The Memory Of Trees"" is, a collection of sweet and hushed songs designed to put one at ease and carry them into a peaceful sleep. Now one would think that since the title of the album deals with trees, the whole work itself would have an environmental theme to each of its songs, but it does not. Enya started this cycle when her debut album ""The Celts"" featured celtic chants and jigs, her second album ""Watermark"" had a collection of water themed songs, and her third album ""Shepherd Moons"" had songs that dealt with a world beyond this one. Actually, ""The Memory Of Trees"" does a very nice job of breaking this cycle, because there are only a few songs that deal with anything related to trees or the environment, and all of them are highlights of the album. These include ""The Memory Of Trees"", which is the opening track and one of her best songs ever composed, ""China Roses"", a beautifully crafted pastorale and ""La Sonadora"", a descriptive narration of dreams of landscapes. This album is probably one of the few Enya collections that have 3 instrumental tracks, all of which are very nice transitions to each section of the album. I do not advise you to play the album in its entirety in your car, because you will surely fall asleep. True that's the greatest strength of the album, but also its fatal weakness. If you manage to stay awake through all eleven lullabies, your purchase was very well worth it."
1,"While Thriller was the most important album the world had ever experienced, to Michael, this was his most important albu that he'd ever recorded. Although Thriller was unarguably more popular than Off The Wall, or any other album in history for that matter, this album classified as a true solo superstar. Although he'd made previous albums before this one, all of Michael's best and most popular were within the confines of the Jackson 5, and Michael had too many good ideas to hold them inside. While albums like Music and Me were an interesting departure for the younger Michael, they weren't prime material. Off The Wall definitely is prime material on all levels, and it really showcases Michael's talent.However, all of the credit on this album can't go to Michael. While he is definitely the driving forces behind this album, there are numerous production credits from music legends Paul McCartney, Rod Temperton, Stevie Wonder, and the mastermaker of all modern music, Quincy Jones. They help to bring Michael's album together, and with everything in the right placem Off The Wall is one of the best albums ever in history. Song highlights include Rock With You and Don't Stop'til You Get Enough."
1,"I had this album on vinyl, 8Trac and casset. I wore every one out.I remember seeing Heart just before this album was released. Like every other young man in the room I fell in love when Ann Wilson sang ""Love Alive."" I bought it the week it came out and have loved it ever since. Like Dreamboat, and now Jupiter.So here's the deal...This is an album that every Rock fan should own. The remastered values are good and the added tracks fit in whith the theme of the album well. Long live the Queens of Rock!"
1,"My gosh... there was a time when except for a couple of short compilations put out here and there by Polydor, it was really impossible to find most of this stuff, unless you intended to pay some heavy bread for the original 45s and albums... and even then without a good discography in hand and the right resources it was hard to track down.  - - Then when the hip hop DJs discovered this stuff and started sampling it, the values of the records themselves went through the roof.... now, finally funkateers, here they are, the best stuff, all in one place on a double CD anthology.  - - The JBs epitomize the heavy funk side of James Brown... If you're a die hard funk-a-haulic, there's no need to preach to the congregation... If you're hear because you just happened to type the keyword &quot;James Brown&quot; and you're looking for &quot;I Feel Good&quot; or &quot;Living In America&quot; - - its time to get hip to the real, deep heavy funk, my friend.  - - Though JB productions, JB is definitely at the healm throughout most of these sessions... in fact, the impression you get, is many of these sessions were just out-takes from If you're down with Bootsy, Maceo, Fred and all the gang (circa their P-Funk days) and JB's sound circa The Payback, Hell, Good Foot and Body Heat... here's the instrumental side of it... and its even badda' and better !"
1,I like nearly all of Elton John's music.  This album was one of my many favorites.  I already own it in LP format but wanted to get it in CD format too.
1,"NEIL DIAMOND-CLASSICS/THE EARLY YEARS: Long before morphing into a glitter-shirted, arena-filling superstar, Brooklyn-bred crooner NEIL DIAMOND paid his dues as a songwriter, offering up JAY & THE AMERICAN's SUNDAY AND ME and several well received MONKEES chestnuts. CLASSICS/THE EARLY YEARS collects his own earnest highlights recorded for the BANG label including gutsy singalong CHERRY CHERRY, gospel rave up THANK THE LORD FOR THE NIGHT TIME, and the amiable KENTUCKY WOMAN, not to mention his solid original take on I'M A BELIEVER. In the ""shoulda been hits"" department are the equally vibrant, smartly crafted DO IT, THE BOAT THAT I ROW, and YOU GOT TO ME, all awash in DIAMOND's confident vocals, energetic acoustic strumming, and punchy female backing choruses. It's also nice to sample the stripped down simplicity of RED RED WINE, known to most listeners through reggae ensemble UB40's dancehall take. DIAMOND would go on to create dozens of further hits, but he seldom bettered the joyous selection of pop utopia highlighted on THE EARLY YEARS.RATING: FIVE GEMSTONES"
1,"This second album by Elvis Costello is far better than My Aim is True, in my opinion. The tunes are more immediate with much more of a pop flavour whilst the music is also more rhythmically varied and compelling. It marks the transition to his wonderfully accessible Armed Forces masterpiece.There is even a reggae beat in (I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea and a ballad with lovely piano - Little Triggers. My favourites on the original disc are the up-tempo Pump It Up, You Belong To Me and the poignant This Year's Girl, plus of course the pulsating Radio Radio with its subversive lyrics. Night Rally is somewhat dark and disturbing.The second disc includes a wealth of previously unreleased tracks, demo tracks, live and alternative versions. Not all of these alternate takes are as gripping as the familiar versions but they are certainly interesting and worthwhile, demonstrating various facets of his extraordinary musicianship."
1,"What a great, rocking record! I dusted off the CD this week and gave it a spin. Great tunes...&quot;Hard Luck Story,&quot; &quot;Yell Help Medley,&quot; &quot;Grow Some Funk Of Your Own,&quot; &quot;Dan Dare,&quot;..all great tunes.This record has aged very well. Unfortunately, it was panned when it came out. Perhaps they were looking for a profound statement. Elton just wanted to rock!!Buy this now!!"

1,"Although not as good as his subsequent album, The Future, I'm Your Man is certainly the album that got Leonard Cohen back on track. The album starts off strong with First We Take Manhattan, a lyrical fantasy that actually features some compelling backing music. Song like Ain't No Cure For Love, the title track, and (to a lesser extent) the somewhat cynical Take This Waltz are the kind of romantic and erotically tinged lyrical imagery that Cohen does so well, but the true centerpiece of the album is Everybody Knows, a bitingly sarcastic satire on the follies of the human race that also touches quite a bit on the AIDS factor in relationships. After these, Tower of Song ironically closes the album well. Undoubtedly one of his finer efforts."
1,"I have got to say that this album has brought me back during my high school days. I grew up listening to him and other artist such as Keith Sweat. I remember attending to his concert in Radio City Music Hall performing with Salt-N-Pepper right after prom night.Kelly does almost everything by himself. The production, songwriting, and mix's, etc.... and he's brilliant as a multi-instrumentalist.Every fan of R&B; and soul will love this smooth laid-back music. I mean who can forget classics like ""Your Body's Callin'"" and ""Bump N' Grind"". Songs that just make your head bounce. Don't forget The Best R&B-Song; of 1993 ""Sex Me"", for its seductive, made-for-lovers-in-bed sound. Other very good low-tempo songs are ""It Seems like You're Ready"", ""For You"" ""12 PLAY"" and ""Sadie"". It was with the album ""12 PLAY"" that he acknowledged his real music and showed the world his enormous talent.Overall ""12 Play"" is a very good album and although released in 1993, it can stand up to anything on the R&B; market now. This is a very sexy album great for all kinds of lovers. I definitely recommend this to all Kelly fans."
1,"Mr. Scott Brown (below) is exactly right.  This 1986 release was the first substantially sized Supremes set put out in the CD-era.  It exactly duplicated the 3-LP set of the same name from 1974 and, to take advantage of added room, it reached back further for ""Your Heart Belongs to Me,"" then included a dozen obvious selections from the post-Diana Ross era. Certainly the '74 vinyl issuing was a big deal, but by '86 this was considerably less exciting.  Some substitutions might have livened things:  from ""A Bit Liverpool,"" their sassy reading of ""You Can't Do That"" over ""A Hard Day's Night,"" ""Cupid"" over ""You Send Me"" from ""We Remember Sam Cooke,"" and the comic ""Sadie Sadie"" or ""If a Girl Isn't Pretty"" over ""Greatest Star"" from the ""Funny Girl"" album.This set was subsequently reworked in 1995 and 2001 and, in my opinion the September 1995 version, if you can find it, is the best of the three CD versions.  The 'outside' material was dropped for LP and B-side rarities:  ""Mother Dear,""  ""He's All I Got,"" ""Remove This Doubt,"" ""Long Gone Lover"" and the Phil Spector-produced ""Things Are Changing,"" among them. Best of all, it was in mono and, for us 50-ish types, this took us back to the way we remember Supremes stuff when it was REALLY new.  But I also bought the 2001 version even though it went back to stereo and restored the show tunes, because it also reached all the way backward to ""I Want A Guy,"" and finally included ""Whisper You Love Me Boy."" Motown ain't stupid, and each re-working has included one or two new must-haves, so you shell out the money even though you've got 90% of the stuff already.  (You bet, before it was a month old, the five-disc, crushed red velvet box set of 2000 got bought too, and ""70s Anthology"" awaits). Such is the lot of hard-core Supremes fans.Classy guy that he is, Mr. Brown chooses understatement when referring to the included booklet.  It's downright laughable to read contemporary Motown releases stubbornly perpetuating the party line that, in 1967, Florence Ballard ""wearied of the groups hectic schedule and traveling, and bowed out to spend more time with her family.""  As if anyone, not yet even 25, would CHOOSE obscurity over placement in the number one female entertainment act of the time. Give it up already!"
1,"I ordered this cd cause i never heard the entire album just certain songs , and man it is awesome . The cd came in better condition than what was said it would be in so i was happy as hell."
1,"THIS ALBUM IS THE GREATEST IVE EVER HEARD, THIS BEATS OUT ANY 50 CENT ALBUM, WHICH IM NOT A BIG FAN OF, BEAT OUT READY TO DIE, BEATS OUT REASOBABLE DOUBT, THIS IS THE ALBUM EVERYONE NEEDS TO HEAR I DIDNT THINK THE HYPE WAS TRUE BUT YEA I DIDNT THINK IT WAS TRUE CUZ IT WAS COMMERCIAL BUT ITS HOT. THE BEATS ARE PERFECT NOT TOO CATCHY AND NOT BAD JUST RIGHT, AND THE LYRICS ARE GREAT. COP IT IM OUT TO CELEBRATE WITH MY FAMILY."
1,"More Like 4.5 Stars. It is not a perfect record, but it is very unique and creative.  Key Lime Pie is slower than the albums before this one.  Dave Lowery writes witty and ironic lyrics which can make you think, laugh, or actually picture the scene for yourself.  The violin is absolutely soothing, even on the raunchy The Humid Press of Days. Borderline and I was born in a Laundromat are two best cuts. When I win the Lottery is down right hilarious.  This album will take time, so don't make your conclusion after the first or second listen. Let Key Lime Pie seep into your bloodstream and enjoy. Dave Lowery and CVB are genius! I will have the pleasure of purchasing New Roman Times when I get the chance.  Excellent!"
1,"This album is creative, rich, exciting, adventurous, andeverything one would have come to expect from Elton duringthis time period... let down???!!??? You've got to be joking!It's got wonderful, interesting harmonicprogressions and use of eccentric instrumentation.. allof what make Elton such a fascinating, enigmatic musician..it's a great album.. highly recommended!!"
1,"One great track and three excellent back-up's.&quot;Earth Tones&quot; has one of the most insiduous jazz riffs ever conceived - up there with Horace Silver's &quot;Song To My Father&quot;, Miles Davis' &quot;So  What&quot; and Lee Morgan's &quot;Sidewinder&quot;... what goes on  throughout the rest of the track is definitely not in keeping with the  lounge music sax playing that Grover Washington is best known for... rather  an anticipatory, sometimes rambling build-up that keeps you waiting until  &quot;that riff&quot; re-appears... brilliant and unforgattable. Worth the  price of the album on its own.&quot;Mister Magic&quot;, &quot;Passion  Flower&quot; and &quot;Black Frost&quot; are more standard jazz-funk...  perfectly enjoyable and imbued with equally insiduous riffsDon't ask me  or my children why... a generation different in musical experience and a  world apart in musical preferences but... if you, like we, are into funky  jazz then this album hits the &quot;unforgettable&quot; button.Buy this,  lay back and float upstream."
1,"Like the book, the radio broadcast, and the film that all prededed it, &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; is a wonder to behold.  Expertly arranged, performed, and produced, it is still as mesmerizing today as it was when I  first heard it almost twenty-five years ago.Richard Burton, one of THE  greatest voices of the cinema and the stage, is stunning as the narrator of  the classic tale of the Martian invasion of our planet.  He is not just  reading the script; he is enabling us to experience the terror and suspense  so craftily done by the pen of H.G. Wells.The rock performers (David  Essex, Julie Covington, et.al) bring the right passion to their roles as  various inhabitants of the literary masterpiece.The orchestrations are  captivating and soul-stirring along withe sound effects that bring the  otherwordly invaders to life.  A blend of rock, classical, and pop makes  this one a welcome addition to an audiophile's collection.If only Cliff  notes could be this fun!"
1,"Stevie was one of the most influentual artists of the 70's and he made classic after classic that both featured great songwriting, ahead of it's time production, memorable hooks and genre blending sound that was able to attract fans of all kind. Stevie Wonder had been able to discover his own sound withMusic of My Mindcrossover with the funkyTalking Booksocio conscious themes onInnervisionsand lovely ballads onFulfillingness' First Finale. After releasing 5 albums in just 4 years, he now took two years off to record his masterpiece, ""Songs in the Key Of Life"" a double album with over 100 minutes of music and over 20 songs!. Alot back in 1976. Like a friend of mine pointed out, Wonder basically had 3 styles 1. Up-tempo Funk 2. Soul 3. Love Ballads and on this album we got it all + all of the diffrent themes that life has to offer from spirituality to society ills from love to joy from tributes to blessings. How could an album so diverse be so good, you may think?. Well, ""Key Of Life"" got everything you could ask for and demonstrates Stevie Wonder at his creative peak. There are so many songs here that are famous, either for being hitsingles, used by other artists or used for tv. And it shows what Wonder had learned through the last few years after the emancipation from Motown's Berry Gordy and how he put it all together at one, to create a timeless masterpiece and just like some previous album there's a long guest list here too like George Benson, Herbie Hancock and Minnie Ripperton. The album spent 14 weeks at #1 on the album charts, selling several millions and is also considered one of the greatest albums of all time.Where do I start? with so many songs it's hard to do everyone justice. However, it starts with the wonderful love-ballad ""Love's in the Need of Love Today"". If you liked the ballads of his last album you're gonna love this one too. The spiritual ""Let's Have a Talk With God"" got really good arrangements sounding a bit avant-garde. ""Village Ghetto Land"" is also very exprimental with an classic music orchestra backing him, the song deal with poverty and demise of a good society caused by selfish and greedy people. ""Contusion"" which is intrumental sounds like the Jazz Fusion of Weather Report. Wonder was more then the average soul singer for sure. The funky ""Sir Duke"" got one of the best intro's in music, and it's a tribute to Duke Ellington that died two years prior. The song would top the billboard charts and it' not hard to see why. Another funky #1 uptempo is ""I Wish"", a classic that Will Smith later sampled by the way. The song is about the memories from Stevie's childhood and how he wish those days would come back. Another wonderful ballad is ""Knocks Me Off My Feats"". Wonder sings "" I Don't Want To Bore You With It/ Oh But I Love You"" Nothing wrong to express your sentimental feelings for your loved ones!. Coolio covered the song ""Pastime Paradise"" and renamed it ""Gangsta's Paradise"", Stevie's song is better and proclaims for the people to stop living in a past and build a future paradise were racism and other malicious things of the past are not present. An exotic song with latin arrangements called ""Summer Soft"" seems to be a song about love. It makes an very challenging listen atleast. The last song before the album has gone halfway is ""Ordinary Pain"", it's a funky song where Wonder doesn't appear at all, instead we have Minnie Ripperton singing, backed by a choir.""Isn't She Lovely"" brings memories back to my childhood, it's perhaps my favorite Wonder song. It's a celebration to his newborn daughter Aisha. Her cry can also be heard in the recording and Stevie's Harmonica plays a vital part. Ballad ""Joy Inside My Tears"" seems to be a song to his wife. One of the definite highlights is the funky ""Black Man"" a song that clocks at over 8 minutes. The title is actually a little misleading cause the song is about people of all races and backrounds that built America together. Wonder gives a history lesson here, paying tribute to people of the past that made great archivements. At the end a school teacher will be asking her children who did what, and they will reply and also mention what race the person had. The conclusion of this song is that America became what it is, thanks to everyone. On ""Ngiculela"" Wonder uses exotic arrangements and sings in both Zulu and Spanish. Wonderful song that always makes you smile. ""If It's Magic"" is a slow accoustic ballad while ""As"" later covered by Mary/George Michael is timeless soul with one of the most romantic lyrics ever written. On ""Another Star"" we find Stevie exploring Brazil. Another exciting listen. ""Saturn"" one of the greatest and most poignant Wonder songs I've ever heard, we find him making comparsions to the dream society of the planet of Saturn and our own world with it's many problems. He sings ""Going back to Saturn where the people smile/ Don't need cars cause we've learned to flyOn Saturn/ Just to live to us is our natural high"". ""Ebony Eyes"" a happy song about ""A girl that can't be beat/born and raised on ghetto streets/ a devastating beauty/ a pretty girl with ebony eyes"". The ironic midtempo funk of ""All Day S*cker"" is followed by the instrumental ""Easy Goin Evening"" which is the closer.Overall, In my books there are few albums as good as this one. MJ'sThrillerand a couple of Beatles albums for sure, but not that much more. What's so good with ""Key Of Life"" is that you got everything of Stevie at once. All diffrent styles, themes and plenty of exprimental cuts aswell. It's like a summery of everything he archived when he changed the rules for music back in the early-mid 70's. If you want to start exploring this man's music, start here cause with over 100 minutes running time you'll get everything you'd ask for and a little more. ""Songs In the Key Of Life"" is a must have."
1,"Can we finally blow this myth about every ambitious rock album being compared to the BeatlesSgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. There was orchestral rock before this masterpiece, and most rock albums using strings and horns from 1967 or 1968 sound nothing like Sgt. Pepper.Odessa sure doesn't. Where Pepper was really, on one level, about applying any type of music to rock--making it a limitless expanse, Odessa is extremely consistent in sound.Odessa shoots for an almost Spectorian, Wagnerian sense of orchestral pop. Huge strings, huge echo on the voices. Listen and the Beegees seem to sing out of the funnel center of the bigness they crate.You'd better get used to this  sound if planning to sit through Odessa, because it runs through what was a double album. (Young? Call mom and she'll explain.) If you like this sound, it is like being stuck in orchestral mud honey. Just surrender and drown in it for the next seventy minutes. There are deviations: some silly sixties light pop, and some country tinged experiments that really work.But what there is not is a grinding guitar like on Pepper's ""Getting Better,"" rock and roll stomp like""Good Morning."" You would barley know guitars plugged into amplifiers listening to Odessa.I understand why Pepper is used as a bench mark, and in the sense that rock bands were more free to ""experiment,"" after Pepper, this is accurate. But if Odessa does not actually sound like the Fabs benchmark, that is ok. This massive red string thing sounds fine on it's own"
1,"This was not only one of Dan's most commercially successful albums, spawning a couple of hit singles (""Longer"" reached No.2) , it also happens to be one of his best albums.""Longer"" I suspect must be regarded as one of the weaker songs on the album, despite its fame as Dan's highest charting single ever. I prefer the gentle, lilting ""Gypsy Wind"" and the catchy ""Last to Know"". Interesting melodies abound on the album, the hallmark of Dan's early work, and his soaring vocals and close harmonies are used to excellent effect.From simple songs like ""Along the Road"" to the more ambitious ""Wishing on the Moon"", the songs on ""Phoenix"" gel together into a fine whole, with perhaps only the rather forced conscience of ""Face the Fire"" grating. If you were to get only one Fogelberg album you could do much worse than this one."
1,"This Grammy Award Record is undoubtedly  one of the premiere recordings of all time.  These nine stupendous songs were all written from the heart and  the soul.  There are hooks just about everywhere on this record.  The  lyrics are so true to life as it really reflects on emotions(Visions, Jesus  Children of America) and social issues(Higher Ground, Living For The City)  that we all face.  Stevie has never been in better form vocally."
1,"George Michael and his partner Andrew Ridgeley had hit large chunks of paydirt in 1984 and '85 with their sophomore album MAKE IT BIG. I remember buying this LP back in 1986 when this album was released. The cover(front and back) and the label were weirdly conceived. First of all,there is no side one and side two. Instead,the first side was labeled ""HOT SIDE"" and the second side was labeled ""COOL SIDE"". The front cover,a red-orange-yellow spectrum,lacked information without the removable sticker affixed in the pressing plants. The back cover,a green-blue-purple spectrum was intentionally wordless. The only permanently printed info was the artist,title,label and designation number on the spine. Now for the songs:the title track(the last four words only) features superstar Elton John playing his Yamaha piano(or was it his electric Roland?). BATTLESTATIONS is a tadbit funky,featuring a sexy,hooker-like beauty with a velvety voice and a childish giggle. I'M YOUR MAN was first released as a single in the fall of 1985. WHAM RAP '86 is technically,a re-release of WHAM RAP from 1983's FANTASTIC. A DIFFERENT CORNER is a nice,easy listening piece. BLUE is a live piece derived from a China concert. Michael admitted at the beginning of the track that was very personal to him. WHERE DID YOUR HEART GO? is the only track on the album that was not composed by Michael. Then,there's the previously released LAST CHRISTMAS which was played by many radio stations worldwide every Christmas season since 1984. Michael and Ridgeley mutually decided to call it quits with Wham! in '86,but remained friends. The pair moved on to solo careers,Michael with his '87 Grammy-winning debut FAITH followed by LISTEN WITHOUT PREJUDICE in '90(both released on Columbia). Ridgeley released his solo debut in '90 also."
1,"That is one of life's more difficult questions because the more you listen to Monk the more you hear. Certainly that is true on this Cd. It ranks as one of my favorites because the music is so unpredictable and the musicians that are on this particular Monk recording do an amazing job interpreting Monk's compositions. Every cut is different and each  has something that just blows me away every time I hear it. Pannonica , the 3rd track is one of Monk's more understated and underrated tunes. His piano playing on that number can only be descibed as sweet.  The Blues turnarounds on Bal-Lue Bolivar with Monk and Sonny Rollins are knock-outs and Monk's version of I Surrender Dear is especially unique.I would be remiss not to mention Max Roach's drumming on this entire cd is fantastic but he particularly shines on Bemsha Swing. Then the icing on the cake is a beautiful trumpet solo on that cut by Clark Terry.This is certainly one of Monk's finest recordings and on certain nights it is my all-time favorite. Don't miss it."
1,"No matter what controversy Paula Abdul tends to generate these days, there used to be a time when she was much more well-respected, and rightly so with this high-energy, hits-heavy album. ""Straight Up"" and ""Forever Your Girl"" are two songs that really say ""bring back the 80s"". A lot of people said that she had no singing talent, and while I can agree on the fact that her whiny, nasal wail is not the most pleasant singing voice that somebody could've been blessed with, she still knows how to sing with energy and passion."
1,"As the title for this 1996 CD suggests, the more mid-tempo/ballad side of Mr. Gill are given more prominent on this release. Now this wouldn't be a problem if these songs were of the quality that we are used to on afore mentioned CDs by Johnny. What we have here are some half decent songs, that whilst not awful, are a par down on what we are used to from this artist. On to many of these songs, they all merge into each other. Only a hardcore fan/lover of quiet storm moment would fine anything of any value here. I never had my copy for long, giving it to my big Sister, who loved all things Johnny back then.As for the more the more up-tempo songs, 'I know you Want me is OK' as is 'So gentle'.This was the last Johnny Gill Cd I purchased( and I think that this was his last major solo CD release) With a voice like Mr. Gill has, this is a crying shame!"
1,"Keith Murray returns after 2 years, to bring a solid 4.5 star sophomore solo album.  Of the 6 solo's of his I have this may be the best (close with ""Rap-Murr-Phobia"" - both 4.5 stars), he has 3 4 star albums, (""The Most Beautifullest Thing in the World"", ""Puff Puff Pass"" and a low 4 star album in ""It's a Beautiful Thing""), and one 3.5 star album in ""He's Keith Murray"", not to mention Def Squad albums.  This one has 12 songs, of the 12, 2 are almost classic, 2 are ok, the others are good, mostly real good songs.  Guests are on 4 songs rapping and do the hook on one more.  Production is very nice as well, no surprise as Erick Sermon does 8 songs, Sugarless does 2, and Rod Kirkpatrick and The Ummah each do 1.  As usual he shows why he is one of the top lyricists to grace the mic, in my opinion as his lyrics are always on point.

Her first 2 albums are classics and her work since then has been inconsistent but usually very good however she hasd never been able to hit the high water mark of those first 2 albums.

1,"In 2005 in celebration of Barbra Streisand's 25th Anniversary of her ""Guilty"" album Columbia rereleased the record as a dual disc with one side featuring all 9 songs from the original remastered, and the other side a DVD version.The songs sound impeccable, but the crowning jewels for fans who didn't own the original ""Guilty"" CD is the DVD with a plethora of bonuses including with new interviews with Miss Streisand and Barry Gibb, two live performances from 1986's ""One Voice"" concert, and a photo gallery from the original photo sessions for the ""Guilty"" project.""Gulity"" has become Barbra Streisand's most successful record in her long, distinguished career selling over 20 million copies, garnering her a Grammy for Best Duo for the title song with Gibb, and giving Streisand a huge #1 hit with ""Woman in Love"".This set was released in preparation for the less-successful ""Guilty Pleasures"", the sequel to ""Guilty."
1,"Since the great has passed on, I figured I would review the cream of the crop from the James Brown catalouge. Recently I reviewed ""Say It Live And Loud"", another favorite of mine. That particularly is way up there on my faves list, due to the fact that the band in '68 was so damned tight and proffesional, with the man, Maceo movin' the orchestra along. Arguably James Browns best band was that one. Huge. But in 1969, Maceo demanded more money for any futher services, and with just an hour before showtime, James Brown told him to take a hike and called up two kids that had jammed with some chick he was banging at the time... Bootsy and Catfish Collins. They pulled the show out of thin air, which pissed off the crowd that night, who were obviously expecting the tightness and precision that the James Brown Orchestra had come to be known for. What they got was the loose hooks and rythms of the brothers collins, and the beggining of something new... funk.This is the only live recording of James Brown with Bootsy (he would soon help the Parliament Funkadelic take off) and it shows that James Brown didn't need to rely on his big old orchestra to make good music. In fact, these days, Soul brother number one, is probably better known for what he did after ditching the big band and just jamming loosely wih a couple of stanky funkateers.This disc is almost the opposite of what Say it Live and Loud is about, but yet still as good and still as powerful. The job gets more than just done here, its louder and grittier than ever. If you are looking for James Brown funk, this is your best place to start."
1,"Michael Jackson returned with this studio album in 1991 following the tremendous success of the 1987 album, BAD, and the string of singles taken from it. Where as THRILLER remains his very, very best work, BAD did come close to that and this too is a very good album with some exceptional tracks but his momentum is slightly lost. Where as THRILLER and BAD were stunning and surprising releases this is a little too predictable. However judged on its own merits its stil worth having and what does remain stunning and unique are Jacksons' highly charged vocals. Pumping pop tunes JAM, BLACK OR WHITE, IN THE CLOSET, DANGEROUS, REMEMBER THE TIME and the truly touching, HEAL THE WORLD are the best of the bunch. This gave him another succesful run of hits. On the whole very good throughout but the format sticks closley to that of 1987's BAD. Recommended never the less."
1,"Although most of the songs on this cd can be heard on the compilation, I had to hear Everything's Different Now in its entirety. It is a real shame that Epic only saw this album as a commercial failure as opposed to an artistic gem. This album is the beginning of Aimee's brilliant but troubled solo career. Songs like Rip In Heaven and Everything's Different Now are so catchy that they stick in a person's head for a long time. I definitely consider this cd as &quot;must-have&quot; for any Aimee Mann fan."
0,"It's a shame 'cause Depeche Mode used to be such a great band - it was even THE band back in my gymnasium times.What a pity to release such a sleepy album. The instrumentation on 'Ultra' is pretty inventive but most of the songs do lack positivity and maybe even musical willingness. You simply get sleepy, 'cause they're all in the same far too slow atmosphere.Especially the hit single 'Barrel Of A Gun' is embarrassingly boring. Not worth the former Depeche Mode quality stamp.Only highlights are 'It's No Good' which COULD make it to a 'Best Of' compilation, and 'Freestate', especially its crispy guitar.Depeche Mode needs to work on this adjusted style. It can work. But it'll TAKE some work!A big compliment though for sending 'Ultra' out on vinyl too!!"

1,"i kind of have to laugh at the ""best album of all time"" discussion.  i have my own albums that i consider the best of all time, and they were all made within the last 15 years.  but that's not the point.  the point is, is the music great or not?  and i think it is.granted, this album does have some SONGS that you could reasonably call some of the greatest ever (wouldn't it be nice, god only knows, i just wasn't made for these times).  the other songs aren't as strong, but they're good.  i don't listen to pet sounds much because i'm just not really into the high-vocal, pop sound going on here.  regardless, i find the psychology of the album fascinating.  it's commonly referred to as a ""coming of age"" album, and in every song, you can hear brian wilson's fragile, sensitive personality trying to come to terms with the grown-up world he's just now experiencing.  the very fact that he was able to get something like this across in pop music is pretty amazing.  he longs for a perfect romantic world on ""wouldn't it be nice,"" simulatenously explores the joy of love and the terror of its absence on ""god only knows,"" and mourns the passing of his love and a more innocent worldview on ""caroline, no.""one song in particular that i love but gets overlooked is ""that's not me.""  while the vocals sound upbeat, the lyrics portray an absolutely heartbreaking scenario - brian's out in the big, wild, lonely world, completely removed from the comfort and love of his home, and knows ""that's not him.""  the lyrics are understated but so sad.the other songs might not be as intense, but they're fun to sing and well-made.  they cover problems brian has with other people, like uptight people with big egos, a girl he waited around for but doesn't love him now, and a great warning to ""the new guy"" about his former lover in ""here today.""the other beach boys did a great job singing on the album, even though they were despicable hacks who treated brian like [...] and butchered these songs in the 80's.while brian's new ""smile"" album is good, i don't think it really measures up to the innocence and charm of ""pet sounds."""
0,"The music Giorgio Moroder came up with for his soundtrack to the classic ""Metropolis"" was unbelievable and actually enhanced portions of Fritz Lang's masterpiece. But this ""offical"" soundtrack contains ALL butchered versions of the great music found in the movie. Why couldn't they have just inserted what we heard in the film onto the soundtrack instead of revising (for the MUCH MUCH worse) all the songs?  The most disappointing track is when Pat Benatar's incredibly moving vocals in the film are destroyed and replaced with a lame effort here. Moroder's film versions of these songs introduced me to deep feelings of romantic love I'd never experienced, and this ""official"" soundtrack doesn't even match the emotional level of a cheesy chick flick.  If you like Giorgio Moroder, do what I did and record the audio off the DVD or video of this film onto a tape or CD... do NOT listen to this soundtrack."
1,"It seems every year soloist, Brian McKnight, drops a chart topping single to prepare us for an album and the title track, ""Anytime"" leads off well with the Me'shell N'degeocello sample piano.  Anytime contains the complete involvement of a relationship and he doesn't forget to give a little more with the almost spiritual ""When The Chariot Comes"" to conclude this lp.  Because Brian does most of the writing and producing it's almost as if you like one, you'll like them all and the impressive drums and sample was a good addition for ""Jam Knock"".  The easy listening of ""You Got The Bomb"" and ""I Belong To You"" adds some substance to the smooth vocals of Brian McKnight.  Anytime after dark let this soothe you."
1,"I can see why this was MJ's best album and best album in the world!!  Its really great and since early 1983 we are still giving good reviews about this jewel and if they do not think this is a great album (although do not like MJ), they got a real problem!  I love all the 7 singles.  My favorites are Wanna Be Startin' Somethin', PYT (the hit at many black college parties when they play old school music), the funky, but revolutionary Billie Jean (blend of soul and r&b; plus one of the first heavy rotated black music videos on MTV), the beautiful Human Nature........DAMN IT, I love them all.  Baby Be Mine, excellent mid-tempo groove that should have been released as a single, but unlike most of the other poplike singles on Thriller, this one was as urban as Luther Vandross' early songs - very very soulful.  Nothing tops soulful like the other lp track, Lady In My Life, which was (and still is) a hit in Black Radio Stations.  Beautiful ballad (sampled 13 years later by Boys II Men and LL Cool J for Hey Lover) and should have been released as a single (probally #1 on Black Singles charts if a single). What more can I say, when they say ""1983 is the best of Black Music or 1983 AND 1984 was the year of........"" THRILLER IS IT!!!!!!!!!!!  Many awards won and I'm proud of him (after 23 years, the lp is still on fire!!).  50000000000000000000000000000000000000000++ Stars!!!  Not 5!"

1,"&quot;Pink Moon&quot; is one of the saddest--and most beautiful--albums put to tape.&quot;Road&quot;, &quot;Horn&quot;, &quot;Things Behind the Sun&quot; and &quot;Parasite&quot; are the sad songs. Otherwise, I think the album has more of a bittersweet feel to it. Sure, Nick Drake was melancholy and depressed, but he was able to find beauty in it and make pure art out of it all.This is my favorite Nick Drake album because it is so pure with no strings attached--literally. Just his voice and his guitar, and a little twinkle of piano in &quot;Pink Moon&quot;. And the brevity of it all is so amazing--Drake says all he needs to say, and I wasn't thirsting for more. Sure, I would have loved to hear more of Nick's songs, but I don't think the album would have had as much of an impact on me. More songs and albums should be this way--it seems so many albums now and even back then thrived on excess.And Nick's guitar playing really shines through. He was an exceptionally skilled guitarist, and he uses unique tuning on most of the songs on this record. His way of guitar playing has also shown influence on some of today's folk troubadours like Elliott Smith--another disciple of despair, misery and heartbreak.As far as the Volkswagen Cabrio commercial goes, I don't look on it as a bad thing at all, so everybody should just stop their whining. It's bringing Nick's music to a wider audience, and I hadn't heard of him until a year and a half ago, so I feel VERY grateful. Nick Drake was one of the most talented singer/songwriters, and his music is a true work of art."
1,"My dad bought this album, and I thought anything my dad listens to can't be that good. But Listened to it when i was alittle older and realized how  amazing it is. It really stands the test of time, and is really one of the best r and b/ and or pop music albums ever made. I mean mercy mercy gives me chills. What's goin on is classic. Wholy wholy is an interesting tune. Marvin Gaye really hit his creative peak at this point. I think the only other R and B album that came out during this time that can compare is Al Green's Let's Stay Together. I'm still glad he's at least around to make music. HOw can anybody not like this album or not think that it has any depth. I think any fan of music in general will love this album. Most of the music is slow,but really works for his voice and is indeed very poetic. You should go and buy the album,its worth it!"

1,"Strong debut for the Boston post-punk/new wave band, fronted by the legendary Ric Ocasek (though bassist Benjamin Orr could almost be considered a ""co-frontman""). Snide charm and effortless hooks dominated this effort, with several deserved hits along the way (and at least a couple more that probably could have been smashes as well). Heavily influenced and influential, its flavor is dulled a bit by time--their fusion of punk/new wave with catchy hard rock is no longer quite as new.""Just What I Needed"" is, of course, the standout of the bunch, but the underrated minor hit ""You're All I've Got Tonight"" is nearly its equal. Meanwhile, the hit track, ""My Best Friend's Girl"" hasn't aged quite as well, but it's got such a goofily fun hook that it's nearly irresistible. Surprisingly, one of the weakest tracks, ""I'm in Touch With Your World,"" is the one that works hardest to stand apart; unfortunately it falls victim to a weak melody and the clich&eacute;s of punchy psychedelia.Best cuts: ""Just What I Needed,"" ""You're All I've Got Tonight,"" ""Good Times Roll,"" ""Moving in Stereo,"" ""Don't Cha Stop,"" ""My Best Friend's Girl,"" ""All Mixed Up"""
1,"I have several Rollins albums in my collection like ""The Bridge"", ""Alfie"" and ""Saxophone Collosus"" but this one gets the most play on my system. Why?  It is a very free form Rollins captured spontaneously in the studio with probably the most empathetic sidemen he has ever had:  Shelly Manne and Ray Brown!!  A perfect example of this is when Manne completes the drum roll on his solo, Rollins duplicates this on his sax--pure alchemy!!  So if you're starting a Rollins collection, start with this one or ""Saxophone Collosus""--you can't lose on either one!!"
1,"Long before this album appeared in april 1997, I had the Depeche Mode fever. I felt something great was going to happen, especially after hearing Barrel of a Gun. When it finally came out, the album turned out to be even  better than expected. It still is getting better and better, after two  years. I love all the songs. Personal favourites are beside &quot;barrel of  a gun&quot; &quot;sister of night&quot; and &quot;the bottom line&quot;,  but my opinion changes all the time. One period I am convinced  &quot;Insight&quot;is the best track, the next I think it's &quot;It's no  good&quot; etc. Now I would say it's &quot;Sister of night&quot;. Black  celebration is my second favourite album. It's unbelievable that some peope  prefere older stuff like from the Speak and Spell and Broken Frame period  over this stuff. Those people haven't grown along with the band. This is  serious stuff."
1,"Dylan is a legend--even though he doesn't consider himself one.  He's influenced so many artists to sing from their hearts and not listen to the critics.  One case in point is on the length of a song.  &#34;Like a Rolling Stone&#34; certainly exceeds the limit of most songs in the past and present, but it never stopped him from singing it.  I'm sure critics told him to shorten it, but he didn't.  It stands out today in my mind as truly unique both in its lyrics, music, and length."
1,"Jay-Z's 3rd album (if you count ""Streets is Watching"") is probably his second worst to date (behind Vol. 3).  It does have some good songs on it, track 1 is my favorite - it's hot.  Numbers 5,6,& 9 are all pretty good too.  Not recommended as it doesn't show his best work or his talent fully but it does have a few good ones on there.Shawn Carter -- b. 12/4/69 -- Marcy, Brooklyn, NYP.S. - Check all my Reviews1"
1,"This is the final Isley album for the 70s,1979 to be exact, and trust me it is another fine piece of art!!.It's got 14 songs, a double album. The feel is basically the same as the rest of the 70s albums, offering funk, rock, disco and R&B sounds. Favourite bouncy songs are ""wanna be with you"", ""winner takes all"",""life in the city"",""it's a disco night"",""what you do to me"", which are all very great cuts, but I really love ""let me in your life"", bouncy and groovey at the same time!!. Smooth and sensuous pieces are, ""let's fall in love"", ""how lucky I am"", ""your'e the key to my heart"", a favourite and ""your'e beside me"", my very favourite here.I personally love this album very much, and recomend it to diehard Isley fans and to new fans who is intrested in the Isley's early works.If you scan the career of the Isleys from then till now, you just can't help been in awe of thier incredible talents, and this awesome album truly testify to that!!!. It is well secure in my private stock!!!."

1,"...and with a title like THAT, I'd better tread lightly.  OK; the old Playboy Magazine/ancient hippies' phrase, a ""mixed bag"" comes to mind when reviewing this album.  It is a ""given"" that Stevie is simply one of America's greatest national resources, musically, so very, very versitile.  And on ""July,"" he displays his natural prowess, creating a field of sound just by himself with keyboards, synths, and let not forget that he's a heckuva harmonica player and a drummer, too!  Three songs really bear mentioning, though: A) ""Happy Birthday,"" a tribute to Dr. King; B) ""Master Blaster/Jammin'"" - please forgive an old hippie for inquiring, but did Stevie or da Rasta Mon, Bob Marley, do this first?  Nevertheless, ""jamming,"" it IS, and if you're a musician, you know what I mean by THAT...  And MY fave track is C) ""Ain't Gonna Stand For It"" - Stevie's doing Country here!  A MARVELOUS, simply incredible track!  A true Rastamon buddy of my guitar player and me played this for us one Saturday while we were...(ahem!) ""doing other business,"" or something, and dared us, ""OK: Play THIS!""  After about 30 minutes, we HAD it, even to our Rasta buddy's scrutinization - and that evening, we had a gig at a COUNTRY place, and with only ""minor alterations,"" we, the band, and the crowd LOVED it.  And that's what GOOD MUSIC IS, folks:  not some tunnel-visioned excess that only inner-city gangstas or (on the other end of the spectrum...like Ian Hunter said, ""or is it only a few blocks away?"") whiny, syrupy goons wearing cowboy hats can dig:  it appealed(s!) to both crowds!  I was there that weekend, I know!  Here's to You, Stevie!"
1,"Man oh man, the is definetly a classic for the times.  I am a hip hop head and have been listening to rap since before many of my friends were kissing girls.  This Cd reigns at the top of my lists.  It is a fact that this is some of the most classic West coast material EVER.  All of Tupac's material is classic material and I have over 2 gigs of his music on my laptop and I never skip his songs.  Don't get it twisted, All Eyez on Me was a thugged out party ridah bumper, Me Against the World was the lonely and ambitious 2pac, but this Cd shows something the world never seen before.First of all by changing his alias to Makaveli raises many questions.  He was bringing a new deepness and meaning to his music.  He was actually incorporating political messages and was calling all of his listeners to action to demand change.Jada was right, if 2pac was still alive, even if Biggie was killed and 2pac lived, all these wack fools today in the rap game would be asking, You want fries with that?  Haha I love it because it is just too true.  Every track on this CD is a cut.  A majority of the songs have the absolute best beats I have ever heard, but 2pacs lyrical ability makes even the decent beat tracks classical rap material.  The early to mid 1990's was the golden era for rap and hip-hop.  This was brought to a terrible end by the killings of the 2 kings( we all know who).When I listen to this cd, I feel as though I am listening to a person who is alsmot super-human, which is why I refer to 2pac as a miracle of a man.  Only a thug of this stature could be brought to such an ugly end.  Go and see Ressurection and you will understand what I mean.  THIS CAT DID NOT KNOW HOW TO MAKE A BAD SONG.  Just remeber when you hear 2pac rapping and rhyming, you are listening to a higher power coming through human form.If this Cd came out instead of All Eyez on me when Pac was out of Prison, I would have sold even more than All Eyez, but that is just how the story had to go.  A book like the bible could be written on this man and his ideology.But enough Ho Hum got out and get this damn thing!"
1,"Ah, Aerosmith, how do you describe them? Hard, driving rock with plenty of mainstream accessibility (but not to the point of absurdity). This is where it all began, way back before they started doing pop rock. They were delivering some of the heaviest music of the time. Every song on here is great, but the standout track would have to be, without a doubt, one of my favorite Aerosmith songs of all time, &quot;Dream On&quot;. This song came on the radio when I was driving in my car yesterday, and I just had to crank it (even though it's really not that heavy). However, although the whole album is good, there's really nothing else on here that's all that memorable. &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; is a much more solid album. If you want to hear some great music, this is inarguably a wise choice. Not quite the best album of '73 (It can't compare to &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;), but it's still a heavy metal landmark."
1,"Once again The O'Jays behind the genius of Gamble & Huff belt out another classic album. Again like with ""Back Stabbers"", the social conscious is all over this record. 6 of 8 songs covers everything from abuse of money, to the polluted air. "" You Got Your Hooks In Me"" is really another power slow song, this one about no matter how bad the relationship, they just can't tear themselves away. From the expressive album cover to the material inside, this is defiantly one of the best albums of the O'Jays long career."
1,"If your into pop, catchy, sing-a-long tunes (Dancing Queen for example). This will be brilliant for you. Also some nice well written not so sing-a-long tunes (Fernando for example) which are brilliant. This is one of the best pop acts in the world as you probably know so if your into that this is a must buy."
1,YO THIS WAS HYPED WHEN IT CAME OUT I WAS A SHORTIE TO BUT IT WAS ALL GOOD I STILL KNEW THE WORDS AND HAD THIS ALBUM WHEN IT DROPPED BUT YO I LOVE THIS CD TO DEF FOREAL!!!! BUT WE MISS AND LOVE YA BABYGIRL FOREVER!!!
1,"Many debate which is better, Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... or GZA's Liquid Swords. It has been discussed for over 10 years, but there is no result. One of the best that came out of Wu-Tang, with sharp lyrics and flawless production from RZA. Killah Priest gets credit for Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth and with Invesitgative Reports, Raekwon shines on it. Although with ""Labels"" and ""Gotcha Back"" shows why GZA has labeled himself as the Genius."
1,"2Pac is by far my favorite rap artist, he has a great voice,beats,and themes. This album was one of his best and the first double disc in rap. I belive that 2pac is still alive and will come back one day. 2PAC 4 LIFE"
1,"I've read some pretty terrible reviews here about Shania for which I cannot understand. Shania is on her way to outselling Garth Brooks. This is the best album of the 90's by a female artist period. They may not be slow  Celion Dion type stuff or hip hop of Mariah Carey, as this album rocks (but  at a country tone)! Nobody has the talent like Shania. Every song is good  enough to become a single. Her husband Robert &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange  produced and cowrite every song (with Shania, of course) on this album to  make it as big as it has become, selling 16 million albums and even today  it is still #1 on the billboard country charts after two years of being  released! I think that is a record for him as he has produced The Cars,Def  Leppard and Bryan Adams, all being popular groups, thanks to his  production. The two together are dynamic. Buy this album as every song is a  winner. 16 Million people can't be wrong."
1,Warren G can be down right smooth.  But he can also be down right boring.  I dont think anybody in the game has as much of a broad span as Warren.  This is mainly because hes good tracks are absolutely great.  Cant You Feel It is a dead set stand out on this album.  The thick bass line is so spine tingly and so much so digs into your soul and pumps your heart with so much love.  However there are 3 other tracks on the album that would sit nicely in a greatest hits collection but the rest are just a waste of time listening to.  Smokin Me Out is one of the 3 naturally enough.  It has bounce and the other 2 lesser tracks are Young Fun and Back Up.  I shot the sherriff is a joke and I dont know why people love this.  If you took the best tracks off all 4 Warren G albums it would be one of the most soulful listens you would have the plessure of hearing but there are way to many boring moments on his albums and this is no exception
1,"'Thriller' stands out in all contemporary music as a 'must-own' album in anyone's music collection.  It was the album that really put Michael Jackson 'on the map,' especially as an entity separate from the Jackson 5.  It's also culturally relevant, because it caused an African American to gain international stardom on a level previously unheard of for ANYONE.  Something like that never would have happenned in the USA 50 years ago.There were also *7* top ten hits from this record!  When Michael Jackson performed 'Billy Jean' live for a motown reunion show, and first introduced his wild stage performance, it launched the singer into the upper echelons of fame.The music takes a new turn from Jackson's OFF THE WALL - it is much darker on THRILLER, and this gives a new life to the music; an originality lacking in his earlier work.  Not only do we get Quincy Jones as a producer again, but we also have cameos from Eddie Van Halen on 'Beat It' and Paul McCartney on 'The Girl is Mine.'  There's a funny monologue at the end of the latter where the two singers are having an argument: Paul says 'Michael, we're not gonna fight about this, OK' and Michael says 'Paul, I thought I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter!'The most popular songs here are probably the title track, 'Beat It,' and 'Billy Jean,' a song about a crazy fan who stalked Jackson, claiming that she was having his baby.  When recording the music video for 'Thriller,' Jackson was informed that the content of zombies and the paranormal went against his religion, as Jackson was a Jehovah's Witness.  There was eventually a disclaimer to be placed in the beginning of the video, put ended up being pulled last minute.  I guess Jackson didn't really care - he was rich!I won't attempt to critique the musical style, because I feel that as a fan of mostly Jazz and Rock, I lack the knowledge to write a critical analysis. I will say that it's an album I still enjoy listening to quite frequently, and it's a record that I sincerely believe will continue to be huge in the decades to come.  There aren't really songs you'll want to skip over.  Apart from the more popular songs, we have the upbeat 'Wanna Be Startin Something' but on the other side of the coin, Jackson still delivers with the ballad, 'The Lady in My Life.'  His musical versatility is at a peak.Most importantly, we cannot let the artist's private life shadow our judgment of the music itself.  Even if Jackson were found guilty, this should not make the listening experience any less pleasurable.  There are plenty of other rock stars and famous celebrities who have issues, and we frown upon them.  However, we must also separate the artist from the creation.  If you don't own any Michael Jackson, this album is the best place to start.  You will not be disappointed."
1,"A top ten all time collection of songs in my heart, some of the most fantastic sax on record, hoppingest tunes and heartfelt recording available.  Simply perfect.  I've given five stars to CDs I know are less than perfect, because I love them, but this is pure.  I don't have to tell you all what you already know about Sonny Rollins and this classic release.  We are all lucky Sonny Rollins has stayed with us so long and shared with us so much.  I'd just like to use this public space to thank Sonny again personally for his kindness in taking the time after a fabulous energy-draining virtuoso performance at Kannai Hall, Yokohama, in May '97, to sign this CD and take photos with me and a friend.  These treasures make me proud.  Thank you Sonny."
1,"Lisa Loeb's 1995 Tails album was very well anticipated after that 1994 megahit Stay.  It lived up to all the hype.  Very solid pop songs and excellent songwriting from Lisa.  She has managed to stay in the spotlight for a decade making very solid songs and albums that she chooses to do.  I wanted Do You Sleep to have the same kind of airplay and huge response that Stay did, keep that momentum going. Wanted it to go to No. 1 too, but it peaked at No. 18. Actually, adult contemporary stations liked that song more than the pop stations.  She rocks on several songs on the second half and takes no prisoners.  Loeb is one of the '90s best songwriters and this album proved that."
