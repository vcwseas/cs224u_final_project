1,My young skin is often acne prone and washing my makeup off is essential to keeping that at bay.  I love this cleanser and it is the only product I have found that melts away my makeup.  Every other facial cleanser left eye liner under my eyes and I ended up using makeup remover after my shower to finish the job.  In the years I've been using this cleanser I've never have that problem!  It works great!  I've also convinced my boyfriend to start using this because as a coal miner he can't find anything to take the dust out of all his pores without drying out his skin.  He loves it!
1,"I was looking for a portable jar of pads/wipes to refresh my face.  The witch hazel pads work, cutting oiliness and getting grime off my face.  I will purchase these again!  Reapply sunscreen if you're doing outdoorsy stuff, though."
1,"It's expensive, but it is the best. It leaves my skin feeling wonderful after every shower. Can't wait to try the lotion next."
1,"5 stars, for as I said that this is the only nail polishthat I purchase.yes, i would tell you to buy"
0,How can people market such crap. It does nothing. Absolutely nothing. Total waste of money. I have tried alot of eye creams. This one is right there on the bottom.
1,I gave this product four out of five stars because I haven't tried it yet. It looks good in the picture though.
1,"Love this French Vanilla body cream. Out of all of the Camille Beckman products this is my favorite scent. I always try to have this and the hand cream around the house. I like to keep the smaller hand creams in my car console or purse too. Feels wonderful on my skin and absorbs quickly. The scent isn't too strong, it's light and delicate. The bottle is even pretty enough to keep out on the counter."
0,It doesn't blend well and it dry very quickly plus it very light for my skin. I don't recommend it for anyone and it too expensive!!!
1,"loved this eyeliner ever since I saw a makeup artist use it on an e!news show, it goes on pretty dark for a liquid eyeliner."
1,it is a great choice when you have a short time and need gorgeous hair. I brush mine straight and use conair in the ends. I am very happy with it.
1,"I take a lot of medication because of my disabilities.  Several of the medications have the side effect of drying my skin.  If not treated, the skin begins to crack, which brings the danger of infection.  Usually the biggest problem is my hands.  For various reasons, I wash my hands many times a day (one day I counted twenty times).  Every time I washed my hands, I make my skin dryer.So, my physician told me to find a body wash that is not soap.  Most products that I found were body washes with drying agents and perfume. The bars of ""soap"" that I found mostly emphasized chemicals to remove the products of hard dirty labor.  The few exceptions were ""beauty bars"" that were full of lotions (usually with alcohol, which dries the skin).Then I heard about Basis but could not find it in my stores.Recently I found Basis on Amazon.  Basis does not have perfumes or dyes so I do not need to worry about reactions to chemicals.  Basis also avoids drying agents.  With Basis, I need only watch the moisture lost due to toweling and chemicals in the water.Using Basis  almost eliminates drying of my skin.  Basis contains camomile and aloe vera so it is very gentle.  I highly recommend Basis,  especially for people with dry skin."
1,"I've been using this product at night for about a month, 2 days on - 1 day off (repeated).  It's strong so I wear a night time moisturizer over it and haven't had any drying issues.  It's not a product to initially use every day due to the strength of the anti-aging elements, but after about 3 weeks of use, I found I can use it every day without sensitivity, if I choose.  I haven't noticed any change in the reduction of fine lines, yet, but overall my skin looks better.  Other reviewers said it took several months to see a significant change in the fine lines.  I've decided to keep using it and see for myself.  Will post again after six months of use to give update on reduction of fine lines.  My skin does look a bit toner, which his always good.  I'm 48 and have been using moisturizers since about 15 years old.  I don't have very many lines in my face; just an expression line in my forehead, little bit of smile lines around the eye area, and some lines above top lip.  I'm really hoping it makes a different to forehead and lip area.  To be continued . . ."
1,"It is natural and super cute, I never use one blush so I paired it with Laguna as a contour and madly as a blush and put penny lane on my apples it look super cute and natural. And if you can order cactus flower it is so pigmented and easy to use you will not regret it."
1,This did lift my medium brown hair to a yellow blonde. Which I toned down with a purple toner and now it is a lovely blonde.I left it in for 40 minutes after applying it to my hair. It took me about 20-25 minutes to complete the application so some areas of my hair had  60 minutes of contact with the product. That hair came out completely blonde. Next time I will leave it on a little longer.Left my hair in great condition in comparison to other brands I have tried.
1,I love Olay.  I use several of their products and this is just one more good one.  I highly recommend it for all.
1,This is impressively good shampoo - and great price - compared to the Nexxus equivalent. I strongly recommend this product!
1,"I won't harp on how great OPI is...we all know that, or we wouldn't spend so much on the stuff. However, this is one of the best reds ever. I do believe this is one of the best selling and most popular red shades all around. Everyone knows what you are talking about, but I will say, you won't get points for originality on this one. Everyone who loves polish can spot ""Not Really a Waitress"" red. That said, this isn't a screaming tomato red, or even what I might call a classic read (Revlon Red is classic, in my estimation). This is a more grown up red, it's classy enough for work or a special occasion, but still has enough ""WOW"" for a night on the town. All I can say, is this ain't your grandmother's red!"
1,I have used this each morning and evening before applying lotion in the morning and after bathing in evening.  I have not had any problems with it - the smell is nice and soft - not overpowering.  I'm 48 and happy with this product.
1,"Any product by this company is a winner.  I have aging skin, well, I guess we all do, but, these products have reduced my fine lines and wrinkles, immensely.  Be sure to purchase the under eye, lip cream.  I am happy!"
1,"My husband has been cutting his hair for several years and had an older Wahl set but really needed a newer, sharper set. We researched a little and found this set was a nice set for the price. It works great and included several size trimmer combs and other accessories too. Works like it's suppose too with just average noise.Pleased with our purchase and recommend it."
1,"It's okay however it's very light coverage, so if your looking for medium or full coverage look elsewhere. They don't give very much product, I've had mine for a month and it's almost gone. I only do my makeup 2-3 times a week, so it's a good product if you don't plan on using it very often."
1,Really nice soap that makes my skin super soft.  I was having trouble with flaking skin even though I use lotion and exfoliate in the shower.  I have tried lots of other products but no help.  My doctor advised glycerine soap with either aloe or vitamin E so I got the one with vitamin E.  I have not seen one with both aloe and vitamin E so it would be nice if I could find one.  Until then I will stick with this one because it stops the flaking.
1,"I liked this detangler, made my hair detangled quicklyMakes hair feel soft and not waxy, oily, or crunchyA great find for the price!"
0,"This bottle is not even 2 ounces and it costs more than $11! What a rip off. It doesn't work any better than other moisturizers, in fact I prefer the texture of other moisturizers and this one also has an odd smell. You can buy Olay or even the generic brand moisturizers with SPF and they have the same ingredients and work great. I will not be buying this again."
1,"Natural cocoa butter is weird. Every time I get a jar its hard as a rock, some ugly grey color and smells funny. It does not want to melt. But I get it all out of the jar (generally with a screwdriver, I'm a guy, my less brutal female friend puts hers in a hot water bath to loosen it) put it in a double boiler and heat it till its completely melted and clear. Then I pour it in a pan, and, when its set up, prise it out and break it into small pieces. These shards smell more like white chocolate and melt quicky at body temprature. My friend pours her melted cocoa butter into small candy molds (the flexable silicon ones!SiliconeZone Flower Butter Mold, Orange). She also adds half a vanilla bean when she melts the stuff. Then it smells totally like white chocolate! I do not know why natural cocoa butter needs to be remelted before it becomes useful. Just don't judge it by the way it is in the jar-after being melted and cooled, its a different product entirely"
0,"Tried this deep conditioning hair mask and was not impressed at all. The container it comes in means you take a huge risk of getting all the contents wet when opening in the bath or shower especially since you need to dig in with a wet hand. I always feel like when I open this container it is soaking wet and needs to be drained of excess water. Maybe I don't like it due to the fact that the product always seems to be watered down, I would rather use Aussie 5 Minute Miracle which is cheaper and way easier/less messy to use!!"
1,"I love using rose water and glycerin as a moisturizer...and love just using rose water as a toner and perfume. But, wish it came in a spray bottle instead of a squeeze bottle...I know this probably helps keep the cost down,but would be so much more convenient. Heavily scented...if you love the smell of roses as I do (reminds me of my grandmother), then I highly recommend this for you."
0,"This was my first time using henna so I followed the included directions exactly. One thing I was not expecting is the scent! It is such a strong herbal scent that it made my entire apartment smell like henna, and gave me a terrible headache. Once rinsed out & after several shampooings my hair still smelled like henna for about a week.I rinsed my hair with conditioner to remove the henna, and waited over 24 hours before washing with shampoo however, the color still only lasted about 4-5 washes and then it was completely gone.Overall, I didn't think it was worth the trouble it was very difficult for me to wash out the henna paste, and I ended up using at least half a bottle of conditioner, and lost a lot of hair in the process of trying to get it all out."
1,"This is definitely my favorite lip product, as it always glides on smoothly, doesn't taste bad, and does make my lips fuller without stinging or burning them. The pink is the perfect shade of nude to complement my complexion (asian) and makes my teeth seem whiter. It is not sticky or goopy when it goes on, like some of the other fusion products. Highlight recommend - not sure why they discontinued these at Sephora and Nordstrom."
1,I don't love the color but bought 'cause my name is Suzi :)I do love O P I though! Thanks!
1,"I have to add this as my new best friend in oils, top 5 anyway..I am 48 a lil mature, decent skin, just needs attention...I truly like this, tho I mix it with hemp seed, rice bran and rosehip oil...25% each..for a roller, I am loving it.."
1,"I've used the Facial Wash for about 15 years now.  I found out about it when I received a facial and have since expanded to their face lotion, which has sun screen.  I've even turned my mom and aunt on to it.  I recently went in for a facial, as I hadn't had one for years, and the technician mentioned my skin was in fabulous shape.  I also use the Apricot Gentle Facial Scrub."
1,This a great brush for blow drying my fine hair. Gets every hair in the crown area and helps give me extra fullness with no static.
1,"purchase this as a gift and my friend love the Body Fantasies Body Spray for Women, Cotton Candy Fantasy Fragrance. Glad I did get this for a friend and was very please with this Body Spray."
1,I used to use Orlane and then switched to Oil of Olay products and I can honestly say that I can't see any difference except for the great savings in using the Oil of Olay product. Highly recommend!!
1,"I've bought this product 3 times which means I love it.  I usually change once I use up a product, sometimes sooner.  As a user of Retin A, I need a product that helps hydrate my skin but that also has UV protection.  This product does both and does it well.  I hope that I can always buy it and that it's not discontinued.  The price on Amazon is amazingly low which makes this a win-win."
1,I've been using these brushes since I was 17. They are great and have always helped me keep my skin looking good. It's amazing how much more dirt and makeup comes off with the use of this brush vs just your hands. I have since moved to the Clarsonic but I still take this with me when I travel.
1,"I love Dermablend Cover Creme. It covers wonderfully and is not thick and cakey. I have broken capillaries on my face and I use it after the face lotion, then go over it with Estee Lauder Double Wear powder foundation. People tell me my skin looks great and it's as if I am not wearing makeup. Beautiful thing! Product lasts months, too."
1,"Within a few minutes my cuticles are softened and easy to push back & clean.This also works very good for cracked fingertips during the winter,and softens knuckles, elbows.The cream has an enjoyable light lemon smell and soaks in pretty well.Our family has used Burt's Bees products for many years with complete satisfaction.We feel this cuticle cream is an excellent product.Contains, Sweet almond oil ~ beeswax ~ lemon oil ~ tocopheryl acetate ~ tocopherol (vitamin E)~coca butter ~ candelilla wax ~ rosemary extract ~ beta carotene."
1,I LOVE THIS STUFF! This is by far the most moisturizing cream I have used without being oily. I use it on my lips and as eye cream and can totally see the difference. If you have chapped skin I would use this.
1,"After trying multiple cleansers, scrubs, matte cleansers, and other fancy products,  I tried this soap.  It cleans my face and smells great.  This is now my go to facial soap."
1,I liked that this had sunscreen and it is very thick.  If you use too much though it doesn't absorb very good and the white stays a while so I just use less or tab a little other moisturizer on too.  I have been using it on my neck and noticed the lines going away.
1,I Really like this soap i wouldnt use it as a body soap but i didnt buy it for my body i bout it for my face it leaves you face with a clean feeling .... But i wanna know how much emu oil was used too make this
1,"LOVE this color! It is a little bit darker in person than it is in the photo, but im glad it is. The prettiest blue color. I actually bought their entire Winter 2011 collection."
1,"I've used a Denman Cushion Brush for as long as I can remember.  I have a couple of other brushes, but if I were alone on a desert island with only one brush this is the one I would want.This cuts through my thick hair like a hot knife through butter.  It massages my scalp and feels wonderful.  My other brushes simply don't do the job of cutting through my dense hair like this does.The nylon bristles are rounded on the ends and give just the right amount of scratch to my scalp, not too much and not too little.The icing on the cake is that it is easier to clean than my other brushes.  I can grab the hair this accumlates and pull it out more easily.This is my tried and true brand of hairbrush, the one I will never be without.  I've paid a lot more for brushes but this is the ultimate."
1,"Our pediatrician recommended this when our 3-mo. old had moderate eczema, and after 1 or 2 uses, we had a baby with very beautiful skin. To this day, he's 14 mo. old now, we still use it every night after his bath. Great for infants and toddlers."
1,My favorite color for filling in my eyebrows! I'm fair skinned but I think this color works well on different skin tones. Product was genuine and arrived quickly which was good because my eyebrows needed help. Hahaha.
1,"Age: 56Skin type: slightly sensitive with slight rosaceaI'm in the first week or so of my first tube of RoC - the first time I've used a RoC product! So far, so good! I'm curious to see how it affects my skin as time passes, however, it's a great night cream. I alternate it with another product and so far I have had no problems. Although, according to what other products I use with it, it does create a slight stinging--but, on it's own, I don't notice any stinging (or I've grown used to it after a few uses).I worried with my sensitive skin I'd have redness or flaking issues, but nope, not a bit!I use this also on the backs of my hands and on my throat and chest - the price is so reasonable, I feel I can splurge a bit on where I apply the product!Even if I don't see marked changes in my face, I would buy the product again. There is only so much an over-the-counter product can do, so even a slight change is okay by me. And again, for the price, well, I think it's a great product."
1,Use it whenever I want to smooth out my crazy curly hair while blowdrying. Helps keep my hair soft and shiny.
1,"I have really nice smooth skin for being 50 but Bare Minerals has not been good for my face. It acentuates every line and does not cover well if you have any kind of dark spot or spider veins around the nose. It is drying and can be irritating. It's terribly messy and the amount in the container is much less than you think you are getting. I have lots of problems with the brushes as they lose bristles easily.. The price varies everywhere. I have to wonder about the all ""natural, pure minerals that come from the earth"" hipe. They don't tell you how the colors come out so bright and multi shade. Manufacturing affects verything we eat or wear one way or another so we are paying for the sales pitch. Some of us can wear any kind of makeup and look great but this is not for most. Good Luck"
1,I has a very strong rose fragrance.  And it really works as an astringent.  A little goes a long way.  I've owned it for over a year and still have almost a full bottle.
1,The best product ever for the shower.  It gets all dead skin off and makes my skin smooth and silky.
1,"I have used Olay products since they only had &#34;Oil of Olay&#34; back when I was 16 yrs. old. At my age, 57, I don't have the wrinkles or dry skin that other people my age have. I occasionally  have tried other products, but never twice. I always go back to Olay, because it feels the best on my skin and does what it says it will do."
1,My mother-in-law gave me one 44 yrs ago and I loved it; after a couple of moves I lost it and couldn't find anymore..  Saw this and jumped on it and I LOVE IT!!!  Files cleaner than emery boards and much easier to use than the fat wide ones that are suppose to be &#34;so chicy&#34;.
1,"We really like this sunscreen. It absorbs into the skin well and glides on easily. It is expensive, but even after quite a lot of use, our bottle doesn't appear to be very empty. The blue bottle is such a neat idea and it is the one my older boys like the most because of it. Definitely my new fave."
1,"I've ordered from Plantlife several times.  And ALWAYS they send you a free sample of something, they're super fast and everything is wonderful."
1,"Ok, so I'm anal.  I pour over reviews for hours before making a purchase.  It was so well worth the effort in finding the Cetaphil cream!  This cream is light weight, but works wonderfully.  I really don't understand the few reviewers who said this cream was heavy or greasy.  At 52 and still prone to acne from moisturizers, this cream is fabulous!  I purchased a chemical peel that recommended this product for use after treatment and I am so glad I did.  No breakouts, hydrated skin and a steal compared to the other ""miracle"" creams out there.  Also, my hands and legs have never been so smooth and soft.  No more oily/greasy feeling on my hands and legs as with other moisturizers.  Plain and simple, this product works!Thank you Amazon.  Your review system, lightening fast shipping and unlimited selection of products keeps me coming back again and again."
1,This is a very rich hair treatment that's more effective than regular conditioner. It leaves my hair very soft+shiny. For best results I completely wet hair with lukewarm water/slather on/wait for 15 minutes/wash with placenta shampoo from the dollar store and follow up with a dollop of Suave Milk+Honey Conditioner (another cheap product that smells divine). If I go more than a few days without this regime -- my hair becomes dry and dull ... probably due to the hard water we have in SF Bay Area. I cant recommend this product enough. DO YOUR HAIR A FAVOR AND BUY THIS NOW :)UPDATE: Pls dont use dollar store shampoos or Suave. I switched to Body Deli shampoos to avoid toxic parabens+amines. The scalp absorbs chemicals.
1,"Haven't seen any results yet, hope that it works before it runs out or I'll probably not reorder this item."
1,"but it lasts forever, smells amazing, cools and cleans my humid skin after a hard day and I think well worth it.I saw it in another reviewers comments and I had to give it a shot, so happy I did and kudos to him (whomever he is!) for turning me on to it."
1,"I've had two annoying cracks in a thumbnail for a couple of years. Nothing worked before, but after applying Barielle for a few weeks, the cracks are almost grown out. That's a happy result."
1,worked really well
0,"When I took off the fake eyelashes, there was still glue, it wouldn't come off, and it was super irritating!"
1,"This is a winter must-have. The balm is thick and moisturizing. It keeps nails from cracking and cuticles from getting ragged. The lemon oil makes it smell absolutely amazing. It's a little sticky, since it's so thick, but I find that this is not a problem if you just dab a little on your nails and work it in. Or, I smooth it on my hands right before bed, which gets rid of chapping.The tin is also great; it closes tightly so you can stow it in a bag."
1,Excellent product.....not a bubble bath which is fine because this is more soothing and leaves skin very refreshed...Will get again with subscribe and save
1,I've never used this before but wanted a safe soap for my sensitive skin. This tried and true bar is just what I wanted. Just what Mom would have recommended.
1,"I was hopeful after reading other reviews that this would indeed give me a nice ash blonde color but, even with the addition of &#34;red-out,&#34; the results are still way too orangy/golden. My hair is naturally a dark ash blonde, but for whatever reason, coloring it always pulls out the red. Sadly I'll have to keep looking for a color that will give me better results."
1,"This mask works really well.  I just wish it didn't have parabens in it.  My skin has become very sensitive lately, and I have to be very careful with some of the ingredients in products.  So I would say if your skin is not sensitive, this would probably work well for you."
0,"I loved Atopalm. It was a rich fragrance free moisturizer that I could use on my entire body, including my face. The company changed the formulation in 2010, basically removing the parabens and adding fragrance. This made a huge difference to the efficacy of the product. It is no longer a rich emollient cream. It is now like many other drugstore moisturizers. And because my facial skin is very sensitive, the fragrance (although very subtle) STINGS my skin. I'll use the jar I have for my family (who it does not bother), but won't be buying again. Very disappointing."
0,"First: I did not over apply this product.  I was being conservative I used less than recommended because I have sensitive skin.  After two days of use, I broke out with bad acne at the application site.I cannot say whether this works or not for hair regrowth since I stopped using it."
1,The cool tip on the end is too short.  Care must be taken not to burn your fingers.  shipping charges are excessive
1,"I've been biting my nails on and off ever since I can remember. I was always able to stop by myself by just getting my nails done and painting them. But even with that, I would still use my teeth to chap the nail polish from my nails and then eventually would get back to biting.Mavala Stop tastes really bad. Like, really. So even though I have my nails long, I still use it to keep my hands out of my mouth. It's been helping me a lot, but it does bother me that finger foods are pretty much ruined for me right now. Hopefully I'll be able to break the habit soon and not need it anymore.I recommend this product."
0,"This eyeliner is OKAY.I am not too fond of it as I honestly think that my E.L.F. liquid eyeliner is even betterthan this. First off, I do not like the hard felt tip brush, I like the soft liquid eyeliner brushes as they willput on the liquid eyeliner with a thinner line like I like it.Also, it goes on too sheer. It also contains too little product as the bottle itself is too small.I think I will stick to my E.L.F. liquid eyeliner for now."
1,"I tried the semi dye, color only lasted 2 weeks. So is this a permanent dye? How long does it last?"
1,"This product is to be used as part of the Acquarella system, and also can be worn in lieu of the Acuarella nail polishes as a clear nail polish. I adore this nail polish system:  it's easy and the results are beautiful.  As soon as I received them, I read the instructions on every product completely, followed all the instructions exactly, and I now always sport a gorgeous pedicure.  The polishes dry quickly and wear extremely well.  (I don't usually use polish on my fingernails, I use a simple two-sided nail buffer & shine block on my fingernails--anything more & my nails grow too fast [I'm a pianist] and I don't want to have to take the time to file my fingernails more than once a week.)The entire Acquarella system must be purchased and used in order for any & all of the products to work:  1) Buffer Kit, 2) Remover, 3) Conditioner, 4) the nail polishes are optional & you can use just the conditioner as your only polish.  I also bought four of the nail colors: French Kiss, Pink-a-Boo, Plasma, and Aristo--I prefer traditional colors in the creme opaque and translucent colors, and all of these are gorgeous.  I'm going to buy also Prissy and Brave.  Also, there are no obnoxious smell or fumes in any of the products.The colors come off easily when using the remover exactly as directed, the polishes apply easily & quickly because of the good brushes & polish consistency, and dry quickly.  I bought this system because I was looking for an organic/natural nail polish product, and I am so happy with it I'm not interested in using any other nail polish product of any type, organic or otherwise.  It is so much better than any other nail polish products I have ever used, conventional or otherwise.  Had I known how good this stuff is, I would have abandoned conventional nail polish years ago even before I started using all organic beauty & household products."
1,"I love this color but have a hard time finding it in drugstores. It's a great red color, very rich and holds the color better than other brands. It also is gentle on my hair."
1,"I use this approximately every other day due to the drying it causes but after a week or so, my pores were visibly reduced, not gone just not as noticeable. Just a splash on a cotton square and I go in upwards motions after my morning face wash and before I moisturize. I will continue to use but will not use everyday as my skin is prone to dryness. It worked in all areas of my face, my nose and forehead were most noticeable to me and now they are much smaller. Recommend to anyone looking for an easy way to reduce size of large pores."
1,"This is one of the best products I've found for very dry skin.  I even use this as a facial moisturizer, and my skin hasn't felt better!"
0,"I didn't notice any true results from this. In addition, it really, really stings my eyes. My husband tried it as well and said the same."
1,"I bought these recently at a local drugstore, and tried them today for the first time. I have never used hot rollers before, and was apprehensive about having to do it for my sister's wedding in a month. But these were just perfect... easy easy easy to use, and even as a beginner I did an almost perfect job, just by following the enclosed instructions (which were simple as pie). I had a couple of rollers in the back of my head get a tiny bit tangled when I tried to take them out, but I attribute this to ""pilot error"" and not any deficiency in the product. I think they are great!!!! Get them, you won't be disappointed."
1,This lip stick (gloss) will always be the best for me.  I really like the way it makes my lips feel. It is long lasting also. Iuse it everyday especially after eating. I Just want to thank You Again.
1,"i like the consistence,the covereage is medium,not bad not good but with power over it it looks nice i would buy this again."
1,You can't go bad for the price. This conditioner is the one that I am on to right now. I really like this conditioner.. It's not my favorite but it gets the job done.
0,"A total disappointment....one star for the nourishing moisturizing activesPros:Good light weight,matte, non-comedogenic moisturizer suitable for sensitive and oily skin.Cons:Doesn't rub in well, leaves horrible white spots and streaks."
1,"I bought this for my teenage son and my husband (shhhhh). They love it. It smells like Sunday morning when I have enough time to bake breakfast. It smells like home all cinnamony and warm. The scent does NOT last once you step out of the shower but this is a BONUS when you are a guy who doesn't want to leave the house smelling like you smeared cinnamon roll all over yourself.  Co-workers and kids can be seriously mean and are always on the lookout for a new means of attack.We use it as a shower gel. As a shampoo? Well, as a shampoo I would only use it in a pinch because I don't like the thought of all of that fragrance (even if it doesn't linger) on my scalp and drying out my fragile hair. As a bubble bath? Eh, the suds don't last for long and you have to use a lot of this rather pricey stuff to get a good amount of sudsy action going.My daughter and I love it too but we tire of scents quickly and like scents that stick around a little longer and we are always switching it up. This one I replenish purely for the guys."
1,"My hair is fine like a baby's and rather thin.  This conditioner gives it fullness and thickness I've never had before.  I will be buying more.Update 4/17/14:  I was about to purchase another bottle of this for someone else and noticed the price has more than doubled since I first purchased it a month or two ago.  I will NOT be buying more, and I'm outraged!  It's good, but NOT worth $20+ !"
1,"I won't send this back but I won't be buying anymore of this particular fragrance. It instantly reminded me of an elderly lady who use to visit us. As other reviewers said, it does stick to your hands for a LONG time. It is so overpowering and not in a clean fresh way but in a very strong rose water way.I am middle aged and I would not be caught dead wearing this fragrance on purpose."
1,The brush is exactly the size and shape that I wanted.  The only thing I would have preferred is if the bristles were natural boar bristles or other type which is supposedly better for your hair.  But it works great.
1,"I've used this regenerating serum for more than six months and have found it to be as described--easy to apply, absorbs quickly, no scent, and overall a winning formula for a moisturizer.  Another plus is the price which is much more reasonable than the same type of item in department stores and it does the same, if not better,job."
1,I bought this along with the shampoo because my previous shampoo was making my hair fall. After some months of usage I can't say for sure if it thickened my hair but at least it helped stop the loss. It leaves my hair very manageable as well. This conditioner is very thick and it didn't take a lot to detangle my hair. Will buy again.
1,This color really seems to mix with a lot of the pale summer colors without losing it's effect.  It still stands out.
1,"I absolutely LOVE this product. I thought by common belief that oil was bad to apply to acne prone skin. The real fact (after much done personal research) is that some oils are beneficial to acne prone skin. Breakouts occur for three major reasons 1. Genetics. 2.Bacteria and 3.Dry skin. Not going into much detail of who what and how causes of acne breakouts but let me tell you THIS soap is perfect for my skin. Tea tree oil is antibacterial, its moisturizing to my dry skin and best of all its organic, no harshness to my sensitive skin! love love love. Really controls my breakouts and complection."
1,"Not sure it is better than similar creams, but it is definitely not worse than others. I like that it is thick and unscented. Like the pump bottle. Not unattractive sitting out."
1,"Different than &#34;same&#34; lotion I bought a year ago. Lighter and less coverage. Also, they offer far fewer shades so I can't quite get the right color. Might try something else."
0,"It's cheap but when you recieve the color you want it's different. I got Auburn and it's more like a brick red,. It does'nt match my auburn/blonde hair at all! I tried it out and it smeared on my hair and it's to hard to blend. Thank god it washed right out the next morning. Stick with regular hair coloring or try try the  powder kind which I'm gonna try next."
0,"I returned the product because I noticed the box listed the Phenylenediamine (PPD) chemical known as coal tar, which may cause a flare up (or irritation) of asthma or a dermatitis-type skin rash.  This product may work for others, however."
1,"It's a beautiful color, I got a lot of compliments! But it peeled off fast for me. Still a good polish, will use again."
1,Looks great with a light hand... Has some shimmer and doesn't turn a weird orange like some other bronzers. Easy to blend and works well to contour. Better with contour brush than a fan brush though and will last you well over a year with daily use.
1,"I just love this blush color. The closest Sephora to me is a over a hour, so I was thrilled and wiry to find it on amazon. It is the real deal. I compared it to my amlost empty blush. Orgasm is the perfect color for spring and summer."
0,I was hoping for better results from this product.  I don't feel like it makes my hair stronger nor does it help with thinning hair. I feel like I have to use a lot more of this shampoo just to get a good lather.  I will not buy this again.
0,"I purchased this after reading positive reviews on reputable product review site Cosmetic Cop.Pros: Effective ingredients (niacinamide & peptide are the star ingredients of anti-aging), affordable price tag, fragrance free, decent packaging.Cons: Sits on top of my skin, feels very silicone-y and sure enough it broke me out a fair amount.I'm typically ill tolerated by products with higher composition of silicone, other silicone-heavy products that broke me out are Smashbox primer & most Giorgio Armani foundations. This serum congested my skin congested & broke out at areas where I usually don't. I looked back at the reviewers who gave low rating to this serum & unsurprisingly, a good portion of them said that it broke them out as well.My skin was normal again after switching back to (my favorite) Caudalie Vinosource SOS serum.I'd love an affordable & high performance serum, too bad this isn't it."
1,This is a great product and does what it says. It springs new curls into a failing perm.
1,"this is my second time getting this i use it on my problem areas before i put on my foundation then i put on a different concealer afterwards, very close to my skin tone it is a bit to dark but once i blend it it looks fine. if you have dry skin this will accentuate that area. i used this when i had no primer and when i did have primer. i would say use primer, it will go on smoother and be easier to blend, with out it it did kind of look chalky. if you leave this in the heat it will break! happened to me with both of mine because my bathroom heater is on 24/7."
1,"I've been using this cream for about a month - almost every day - but I'm not convinced it's doing anything (it's ok purely as a moisturizer). I also don't like the smell - kind of gluey and unpleasant. I'll continue to use, because it's certainly not doing any harm, but I probably won't repurchase (unless my skin all of a sudden takes a sharp turn for the better)."
1,"My skin can be fairly sensitive to fragrances and chemicals. I use a fragrance-free HE detergent in my washing machine, and if I use shampoos or conditioners with certain chemicals my skin can develop a rash. So over the years I've tried a variety of soap products to try to be careful with my skin's health.I was thrilled with the idea of the Aveeno Naturals. It has no fragrance and is actively aimed at an audience like me.The body wash lathers nicely. I use a ""puff"" and put in about a half dollar coin's worth of soap. It works very well. I don't have any irritation at all. So it does exactly what it's supposed to do.I may be in the minority of people in this situation - but in addition to having the sensitive skin I also have oily skin. I don't use lotions. So I don't like a slick / slimy feeling on my skin when I'm done washing. I find that uncomfortable. When I finish washing with the Aveeno, I have to wash for a fairly long time with fairly hot water in order to get that ""slimy"" feeling off my skin. Even when I'm done, the feeling still lingers in a few spots. So for me that's not the way I want to finish my shower.So I'm sure for many people - and especially people with dry skin who love using lotion - this will be perfect for them. I'll give the product 4/5 stars for that reason. But for me, I'm just not fond of that slimy after-feeling. It feels as if it didn't thoroughly wash off (which I imagine is what is happening). For me, I want a soap product that is completely removed when I'm done. So I'll have to keep looking.I purchased this Aveeno with my own funds in order to do this review."
1,"I ordered this for my sister in a different city, because I want her to try it. It's my favorite mascara. It's lengthening and natural-looking."
1,I went into a GNC yesterday and they have it on special  Buy one get one half price. Great dealC
0,I purchased this after reading all the great review for sensitive skin- but this product made my skin itchy and reddish pumpy.. I had to throw it away after 1-2 use. It still has pretty strong smell for sensitive cream.
1,this product works very well for me...im 33 and keeps my face fresh looking...love all olay products. Ive tried a lots of brands before...Olay helped me decide to stick with it for a while..a long long while
1,"works like a charm! I love wearing cat eye, eyeliner and bold mascara - both which are typically waterproof. This helps remove my eye makeup easily. I put quarter size of the makeup remover into a small part of a face towel and press it on my eye for 10-15 seconds and swipe the towel down and most if not all of my makeup comes off in the first swipe. This has never irritated my skin or my eyes and I am really pleased. The only thing I did not like was the actual bottle and the lack of a dispenser. The bottle opening is just .. a normal opening, it's way too wide. I had to rebottle it to not waste as much product. I just finished my first bottle and I will definitely repurchase."
1,This is a nice pressed powder the size I got was small and has lasted for sometime now it feels nice.
1,Love Mrs. Meyers products.  Good for the earth and us.  The apple smells DELICIOUS.  I'll get it again and again.
1,"This is my ""everyday"" mascara.  I don't actually use it everyday (because I don't wear make-up everyday), but whenever I do during the daytime, this is my ""go to"" mascara.  It is great because it separates lashes well, looks more ""natural"" than other products (sometimes, people can't tell I am wearing it...and that is a good thing), applies evenly, and lasts a long time.  I have also found it to be economical, not only because it is cheap, but also because the applicator holds enough mascara to cover all my lashes (both bottom and both top) with just one application (no double dipping needed).A couple downsides:  1) It does sometimes clump in places.  The way that I prevent clumping as much as possible is that I get a clean tissue and gently roll the applicator on it.  It removes any excess mascara and goes on more evenly.  2) Sometimes, at the end of the day, I'll see little flakes of mascara on my cheek.  It isn't too bad, but does happen.One last thing - if you are looking for a mascara to really lengthen and thicken lashes, this isn't really it.  This mascara is simply provides your lashes with color and a little thickening/lengthening - which is why I use it for my ""everyday"" mascara because it provides a more natural look.  But, when I want something more dramatic, I use another mascara."
1,"I've been using this face wash on and off for YEARS!I just saw this at Ulta for around $6 so I will use this until they stop selling it.I started using Alpha Hydrox about 8 years ago. I had bad acne from using the pill and was on ProActive.This cleanser worked just as well and it wasn't $40!My skin was so soft and seriously, after one day of use my skin cleared up.I'm so happy I found this again. They've stopped selling this at most drug stores.I have dry skin during the winter and super oily during the summer. This is great cleanser during the summer months.It's a bit drying on my skin during the winter so I use Aveda moisturizer after.Btw,If you love Aveda cleansing gel, you might like this."
0,so I like it for a hairdryer but I bought is as a QUIET hairdryer for grooming a skittish pup and it is not quiet.
1,"I use if for my face after peels and for anything that might scar, like after an extraction, or a scrape. (My day and night serums already contain E). As I understand D-Alpha Tocopheryl is the highest quality and best vitamin E for skin healing. Other inferior products will have more IUs but are not D-Alpha Tocopheryl so they are far weaker. This is very potent stuff. I use to open the gels from the oral vitamins thinking that was best. but this is FAR better! Alot of them are not as many IUs or D-Alpha Tocopheryl, they might be DL-Alpha Tocopherl which is synthetic and cheaper, but also inferior."
1,"I order this for my husband and he uses it on his beard. He likes the Red (Fox) color and it turns his African-American, naturally black hair a deep auburn. He has salt n pepper in his beard and it turns the silver a bright gold-auburn :) He has gotten compliments and people (men and women) asking how he color his beard. I like that it's natural, halal, and makes his hair healthier.He doesn't use it as instructed but has come up with his own method: he mixes a tiny amount with water in a small container to form a thick paste; let sit for an hour; apply to hair to coat; let dry. After completely dry, just use a comb or fingers to comb it out.  Sometimes he lets it sit in his beard for several hours (or overnight) around the house before combing out. He stores the leftover paste by covering the container and uses the rest again. If it dries out, he just adds a little warm water and mixes to a paste. It works better after sitting longer. He remixes another batch whenever needed and reapplies every few days or once a week. Using it this way, one box lasts him a few months. I'm sure it would go faster using it on your head but I'm sure the same method would work and avoids wasting any.Results are visible after the first use, but the color builds and looks richer after more applications. hope this helps."
1,Exceedingly refreshing!
1,I've tried many body lotions over the years. I tend to get bored using the same stuff with the same smells.But I always come back to this product. Just hydrates like nothing else without being greasy. I'm sixty-one and it keeps my skin supple where other shea butter cremes and such just end up drying it out in no time. Also love Alba sunscreens for the body.
1,"After a few minutes, it like feels like it's sucking your face, this made my nose run a bit, it feels kinda stinging, but it leaves your face feeling amazing."
1,This little sponge (too bad you can't get it bigger than 4 inches) is a gem! You won't be disappointed! This little sponge is gentle yet extremely effective. I use it with the Alba Hawaiian pineapple enzyme facial cleanser and it cleans my face well. It's amazing how much product this little sponge can hold. Rinses out well and dries quickly. Good use for makeup application too.
1,"I very much enjoy OPI nail polishes. The quality for the price is unbeatable. This color is a very dark blue verging on black. With good lighting, you can see the red and purple shimmer in the polish which is lovely. The shade is very flattering on all skin tones. I would definitely recommend using this with a base coat because like most dark nail polishes, it will stain your fingers when you try to remove it."
1,"Being a CNA keeping my hands from cracking & bleeding is a full time chore. The gloves dry my hands out & washing them so much during the day really does mess up my skin badly. I've tried other lotions, creams, gels, everything I can think of & nothing has worked. After reading the reviews on this hand cream I thought maybe it would be worth a try & if it didn't work, then there wasn't a real loss because the price is so good.My hands are cracking, bleeding & they hurt so bad. I can't even get rid of one cut before there's another on my fingers or top of my hand.I've started using this cream & immediately it softened the cuts that are already healing & soothed the skin around them. My hands are smoother, softer & the cream absorbed quickly without a greasy after feel.Even after washing my hands it didn't feel like I had to put on more cream right away, my skin wasn't so dry that it was about to crack like it normally does.This really does take just a little bit at a time & leaves my skin smooth. I'm going to try it on my feet too.I have ordered a couple more so I can have one in the car & another at home. Plus I'm going to give this away as a gift to someone else who suffers from cracking, bleeding hands. I'm so glad to have ordered this stuff.  If you have dry skin, consider giving this a try."
1,This is exactly what I expected. It is always a gamble ordering something like this without seeing it. It is a nice concealer and blends in well when I test it on my hand. I will write more when I actually use it under my eyes.
1,"I was very skeptical about this product based on the reviews and the price, but thought that I should try it as it is natural and I would lose nothing but few bucks. I am in mid 30s and lately have been going through a lot of stress combined with lack of sleep and I have noticed early signs of aging - forehead wrinkles. I think botox is too much of a leap at this age and would want to resort to it may be in a few years from now. I couldn't wait to try it and I followed the instructions and glued it on my forehead and left it on all night. It is a think paperback with glue on one side. Honestly, I didn't expect great results but I was SHOCKED to see that it works. The very first day the major wrinkle on mid-forehead looked like it was ironed. The lines on the sides were still visible. The affect stayed the whole day until the night and I glued another piece back on so I cannot tell if it works longer than a full day. I did not notice dramatic results the next day as it would be unrealistic. However, the best thing is that it works. and for the price, it's just awesome. I am going to return the Olay and Neutrogena anti-wrinkle treatments that I bought this in despair as I am a true believer in natural treatments. I have also been using Indian Clay mixed with raw apple cider as a mask once a week. It seems to firm-up my skin.After 2 weeks of use, I wanted to update my review. It is ok the first couple of days, but it does not do much after that. If you really are looking to iron out your forehead wrinkles for a special day, then use it the night before and your would see the difference. The point is that it does not iron them out every day. I basically now see that I am using it but see no difference. I might have to go laser skin tightening or botox way looks like or might use the Retin-A if my derm suggests it tomorrow. Good luck!"
1,"Skeptical at first, great price, face feels so refreshed I use it once a week, twice would be better but still giving it a try. So far so good"
1,This fragrance free body wash has worked wonderful for my children with very sensitive skin.  We use it for bath time with two little ones who were breaking out in itchy bumps on a regular basis using typical baby wash.  This wash didn't cause irritation like previous body washes did and the bumps actually went away.  I think it's a much more affordable option too as compared to what the dermatologist had recommended.
1,"There are plenty of reviews here on the performance of this dryer, which I think is fine, but I wanted to comment on it being a ""quiet"" dryer.  It ""is"" quieter than most, but my previous Conair Ionic hair dryer was 80 decibels on high, and this one is 90 decibels on high.  Anything over 80 decibels can damage your hearing, so I'm a bit disappointed in this, but again, it's still quieter than most hair dryers... but I would have thought the ""newer"" dryer would have been even more quiet."
1,This bar is less drying than most.  Years ago when I was a young girl a dermatologist recommended an oatmeal bar.  Then I had oily skin - now of course dry.  It is not as moisturizing though as I would like now.
0,"I have used this shampoo for awhile now and I have to say that it's just okay.  I am a wash and air dry girl, I rarely apply styling products.  After using it for more than two washes in a row it tends to not do it's job so much, I'll still start to get build-up on my scalp along with dry hair and have to switch to another shampoo and conditioner, then come back to this.  The smell however I find is very invigorating, and really wakes you up in the morning, it's also sulfate free which I find also to be a plus because I don't like to use a lot of chemicals on my hair.  The conditioner that goes with this shampoo is very thick, and very moisturizing so much though that I cannot use it on my scalp I can only use it on my ends.  When I use it on my scalp I appear to have oil build up by the end of the day.  After I finish using what I have I doubt I'll ever buy the combination again."
1,"The product itself is good, came on time and as ordered.It moisturizes moderately well. They could improve a bit on the moisturization level.My biggest complaint, and it's just a preferential one, is the overwhelming coconut smell. Yes, I know, it's coconut lotion, and a milder one at that...but it lingers too long for me.I am only using it about once a week. If I start using it more than that I can't tolerate the tropical smell I carry with me all day long.Again, it is a great product, no complaints about that...just remember to be in a coconut mood! :)"
1,Great product! Just got this today and had to try it right away. I also have the China Glaze to coat!  I own a lot of China Glaze nail products and crackles. Love them all. Always get lots of compliments! I recommend China Glaze products. I never have chips even after a week or more wearing these products.
1,"I've only used it two times, but it seems to be helping. The consistency of the mask feels like honey and once it dries, it is easy to peel off. I really enjoyed peeling off the mask. Overall, it's a good product."
0,I like the aveeno day moisturizer very much so thought will give this soap a try. But it made the skin very very dry. On top of it started getting more acne. So discontinued using. I got a pack of 3. My husband uses the aveeno face wash and really likes it. Since 2 more soaps were left over and also each and every person skin type and tolerance level are different. We thought he would try using it. But it made him break out immediately. He skin is normal and never had problem with breakouts. So that is it.. We thrashed it and never thought about buying again.
1,This is a great product. Use as base coat and top coat. No need to buy two products. It works very well.
0,"This has the exact consistency, color, and smell as room temperature butter. It is moisturizing but it doesn't work well for my skin since it makes me break out. Plus, it made me feel like I was smearing butter all over my face, which turned me off to this product.Will not purchase again."
0,"Smells. I have allergies. I love Aveeno products, but this one not so much. Face scub is great. Lotion great. This, not so much."
1,"This is my new favorite nail product! I have short, thin nails that tend to rip and peel. I have been using this for a few weeks and it has made a big difference. My nails no longer peel and they may chip now and then, but the whole nail no longer rips off. I can simply file down a chip and maintain what nail is left. My nails are growing better and are healthier and stronger. I will keep using this."
1,i thought it was going  to be more of a detangling conditioner sort of spray productthis just leaves my hair smelling really good..oh well i still like it
1,"This goes on cleanly with hte pump dispenser but can be a bit difficult to wash off afterwards - hence the 4 star review.  Nor has this ever really foamed for me.  But it doesn't leave my skin feeling soapy and stiff, nor does my skin get irritated from it.  I think I prefer the Olay Foaming Face wash for the scent but both are really good products."
1,"Very good makeup remover, doesn't harm my skin and I don't need to apply it that many times for the makeup to come off."
1,"I have used it a few times. The first time I didn't really follow the directions and didn't steam my face for 5 minutes first. I just hopped in the shower and tried it. I got some slight peeling from my forehead and beside my nose, but that was it. I wasn't impressed. Then I tried it again a week later, after letting my face steam in the shower for the full 5 minutes and the difference is amazing. The dead skin just rolled right off. My skin looks like a kids. It's shiny, but not in a oily way, in a fresh, brand new skin sort of way. (I'm 45)I tried it on my chest too, and all of the sun damaged areas and fine lines look much better. It's too expensive to use on the chest again, but I wanted to see what it would do.You only need a little bit. Tonight I only used about 1/4 of a package and got my forehead, chin, nose and cheeks. It doesn't work on my eye-area, but probably because I am already using a retinoid there. Or maybe the skin is too thin. Either way, no peeling action from that part of my face, so I know it isn't just the product rolling up into balls.I use it once a week. I have dry skin, but it's not overly sensitive, so that seems to be a good schedule for me."
1,I bought this when Makeup Geek recommended it. I like that it is more natural and does refresh your face. Just make sure you spray at a good distance or you will get splotches. This is the only spray I have tried. So I really can't compare it with another product but it's a good price for what it does.
1,"This soap is very creamy, leaving your skin soft and smooth."
1,"**Update from my last review: I absolutely love this stuff! Yes, the price has gone up a little, but most things have. I have no complaints about this product, and I have substituted with other products on impulse in order to save money and/or try something different. All that did was solidify that I love this product. Aveeno products are consistently known for being gentle yet effective products. Almost all of my skincare regimen is Aveeno and I couldn't be happier. It's best to purchase from Amazon, especially when you have Prime membership which just makes it even more awesome. I use this as a daily moisturizer and a foundation for makeup. It provides just enough cover up to even my skin tone without leaving residue, buildup, or causing my skin to feel weighed down. Regardless of the weather, it doesn't wear off either. It provides sunscreen, and overall continually moisturizes my skin during the harsh cold season and dry summer season also. This product won't ever let you down!**From my teens into my early thirties now, I still have combination/oily skin that is incredibly sensitive to the point where it becomes bothersome. I've been using this product for years, and for good reason!I needed a quick morning makeup routine that would even out my skin tone, provide sunscreen, Moisturize and of course simple to use. I've tried many, and this is the only product that works best for me. It blends in smoothly (I have very fair skin so that's the shade I choose). I use 1 pump and it's more than enough to cover my entire face evenly, not too much and not too little. A little pressed powder and lipstick, and I'm done!! Now, for the important reasons why I chose this brand over all the others.Makeup  tends to be too heavy, which causes my already oily prone skin to feel weighed down.  Others are too light, fading away into oblivion before I walk out the door in the morning.This product has multiple benefits:1) A little goes a long way, so the cost really isn't an issue for me.2) It contains sunscreen so my skin is protected.3) It's dermatologist recommended, so I can trust that it's safe for my sensitive skin because  it's free from harsh irritants (everything says 'dermatologist recommended', so I did research to confirm it).4) It's hypoallergenic. This ties in with reason #3, but this is a completely separate issue for me. Having sensitive skin requires a product that's hypoallergenic. If it's truly not, who knows what in it? I don't like taking those kinds of risks.Three years and going this product will always be part of my morning makeup routine."
1,Can't believe it took me so long to find this stuff.  I have fought bed head all of my life and foorced a comp through the tangles and couldn't really get it to comb properly but this stuff changes that.  Spray some on my hair and the comb glides through and it stays where it is combed (some spots may need a little second spray) and my hair appears much healthier.  I am really sold on this product and highly recommend it.
1,I had been looking for a 3/4 inch hot air brush and finally found this one on Amazon.  Hadn't tried this brand before and was a bit nervous because it was so inexpensive.  But it turned out to be a great brush.  It doesn't get tangled up in my fine medium length hair and dries it quickly without damaging it.  I definitely recommend this brush for those who need a smaller diameter brush!!
1,"nothing special, really. didnt notice any &#34;touch of sun&#34; effect whatsoever, and frankly, there are better moisturizers out there too."
1,The smell takes some getting used to as it really smells like roses but it's the best toner I've ever used. Not to drying and when used after makeup removal it really gets down in your pores to get the &#34;gunk&#34; out. Repurchased.
1,I have been using Proactiv for years to control my acne however now in my 30's my skin has become uneven and dull looking.  I needed to get a product that was anti-aging and still control my breakouts.  After doing some research retinol was a proven ingredient so I decided to give Philosophy's Help Me a try.This product is amazing!  I noticed a difference in about 2 weeks.  Since then I trust the Philosophy name and ordered other products and my skin has become make-up optional.
1,"Love this fiber-free mascara. My eyes are incredibly sensitive, and quickly get bloodshot from most mascaras because they're full of tiny fibers. This mascara is not, and leaves my eyes white. It also is a great way to ""paint"" individual lashes. Takes a little longer, but looks fantastic. I also find that if I let Blinc dry completely first, then curl my lashes, they REALLY curl."
1,"This does a wonderful job removing my eye makeup...even my waterproof mascara. It is also very gentle.  And, a little goes a long way.  A bottle of this lasts a long time.  Given the price of other removers, this is relatively cheap too.The only downside is  that it does leave behind an oily residue.  I always wash my face right after removing my eye makeup though, so it isn't a big deal.  Whatever oil is left behind washes right off with my cleanser."
1,"So fresh, clean and natural smelling.  Absolutely perfect for the kitchen.  Love this hand soap, and the price is resaonable as well."
1,"I'd used 2% hydroquinone creams in the past without noticing results, so I was wary about this one; but it was cheap and I was getting desperate. I used it for the purpose of removing unsightly freckles on my chest. A lot of lotions make me get pimples on my chest if I use them, but after nearly 2 months I haven't had such a problem with this one at all -- woo hoo! As to its fading properties, it's been very slow and for a while I wasn't sure if it was working or not. As of this time, it seems to have removed the lighter freckles, but the large dark ones are still plainly visible (I am unsure whether they lightened at all or not -- the package does warn results might not be noticeable on ""very dark skin"" and perhaps freckles are included in that designation.)I have also more recently begun to spot-apply it to a great big dark freckle I have right on the end of my nose, so that one might be a better test for whether it lightens these darker freckles or not. I intend to update the review with results on that. For now I give the product 4 stars though I think if I could I'd really rather give 3 and a half.UPDATE: So shortly after I wrote the review, I ended up spending 6 weeks traveling, during which time I left the fade cream at home. I was a little disappointed that the freckles seemed to all come back rather quickly, even though I was in a cold climate and was almost always covered up. Nevertheless, when I returned I resumed the use, along with someLikas Papaya Herbal Whitening Soap. The two of them together were amazing, and after only about week I began to observe improvement with the freckles."
1,"This is a great eyeshadow to have in your collection, it looks icy white but casta a hue of blue or green, fun color and adds dimension to your eye look.  Nalo Jones, professional makeup artist and beauty expert based in Los Angeles, can view web site at [...]"
1,Very lemon. Smells just like fresh squeezed lemons too. Makes me smile it is so fresh smelling. I will order more.
1,I love these minerals they go on so smooth and it does not cake up but also covers well. It's a little pricey but covers well and high quality.
1,This scent is a pleasant flowery-sweet scent that I think is more for a man than a woman.  It is a modern classic in my opinion.  I doubt anyone would hate it.  You either like it or LOVE it.
1,This is a great color - a medium pink that goes with everything.  And OPI Is my favorite brand so I like being able to order from Amazon and have it come to my door.
1,"i can't really remember why i bought this.  i have psoriasis and i must have read this was good for it and bought it on a whim.it didn't help my psoriasis, but it was a pretty good soap for general use i would say?"
1,"I just bought some of this for myself and my daughter. I'm 34 and she's 15. I'd already tried Proactiv in the past and it did nothing for me except make my face moist. The only part of Proactiv that gets rid of bumps is the Sulfur Mask. Most people don't even realize that it's the only thing from Proactiv they need to buy to get rid of the acne, the other stuff is to take your money. So I thought to myself, why not find another cheaper solution that had both Sulfur and Zinc Oxide in it(same ingredients as in Proactiv). Proactiv's solution has 4% sulfur for $20(less on Ebay), while Bye Bye Blemish has 10% sulfur for only $8-$10.My acne is not as prominent as my daughter's because I do the daily facial washing regimen and care. Being 15, she sometimes forgets to thoroughly wash her skin as often and she also touches her face alot more. She gets really bad blackheads and whiteheads on her cheeks, nose, forehead and chin. We used a blackhead remover to get black and whiteheads cleaned out on her skin. Then we applied the bye bye blemish to each on and she went to bed. I had to say that I was quite impressed. Although you could still see some of the bumps in the morning, they were quite diminished.  Some of her bumps has even smoothed all the way down. After the 2nd day cleaning her skin and adding the blemish solution, most of them could no longer be seen, except for the light scarring of where some of the bumps had been.Before some of you say, ""oh, she must work for the Bye Bye Blemish"" company. I would say that those who speak against the product must work for Proactiv or SkinID, lol. Expensive commercials and superstar endorsements don't make a product work better, it just makes you the consumer pay more for the product. If you check the Bye Bye Blemish website, they have celebrity endorsements too, but it still costs $8, lol. I'll pay $8 once over $40/month any day just to try something that could possibly work better. Just be sure to follow the directions on the bottle! This stuff can dry your skin out if you overuse it!"
1,I got this for my husband with skin allergies.  It works just as well as any other hair spray without the added scents and chemicals that he doesn't need.
1,Love this because it has a non-greasy feeling and doesn't make me breakout when I use it. Takes the makeup right off too!
1,This is a great conditioner for anyone what has any type of damaged hair.  Within a couple of treatments hair is stronger and less frizzy.
1,"I have sensitive skin that either breaks out or dries out. I needed a moisturizer for my face and neck. So I decided to try the Avalon Organics Lavender skin care line. This is a wonderful product. It moisturizes and fine lines disappear. It is gentle on your skin, so it is perfect for people with sensitive skin. I have really noticed a difference using this product. Also just a very light lavender scent. Perfect for anyone who is looking for an organic product that helps minimize fine lines."
1,I have tried so many different shades of red and never quite got it right. This is the color I have been searching for. It is vibrant and sexy and I love it! I recommend this color and this brand.
1,Wonderful foundation powder.  Gives full coverage.  Camouflages and hides dark area above my lip. This stuff works. MAC is an excellent brand.
1,"The trimmer arrived today.  We tried it out by having the wife cut my hair.  it trimmed it up nice and short.  The finishing trimmer appears pretty delicate, but I think if handled carefully it will provide a relatively long life.  Lots of cutter guides to use, theres even one for trimming eyebrows.  Or should I say ""eyebrow"", because if you need to trim it, you probably only have one covering both eyes.I am not to thrilled with the carry case.  Mine arrived cracked.  it appears to be pretty cheap plastic and there are no separators inside the case so everything will slide around.I gave it 4 stars because of the case.  It does appear to be a pretty good trimmer for a very inexpensive price.  I guess if I wanted extreme heavy duty and a great case I could have spent 5 times more money.  But I don't need to this time."
1,"I think castor oil has gotten a bad rap as a natural labor inducer/laxative.  Use this stuff in your oil cleansing method ( [...]) to wash your face without stripping it, use it as an eyebrow/eyelash growth enhancer ( [...] ), and as a skin pack for sore muscles or upset tummy ( [...] ) ."
1,"I'm not a redhead with freckles but a fair skinned brunette and I have sensitive skin. I've been moisturizing since I've been 16 and I feel it's the key to keeping your skin young along with avoiding the sun.It could be genetics but I'm 49 and people mistake me for 35.Anyway, the Aveeno products are the best out there. Forget about expensive department store brands. Lately, my hands were getting a little dry and rashy due to cleaning and using chemical disinfectants without gloves and this formulation worked well in restoring the moisture so that my skin looked and felt great again.I use all the different Aveeno formulas for moisturizing my body and they're fantastic.Always moisturize after a shower because your body absorbs more when you're still wet.(An old tip from my mother).And for people suffering from body rashes that don't respond to prescriptions or if you want to try something natural and inexpensive first, buy some Aveeno Colloidal Oatmeal. It's basically an oatmeal powder that you can bathe in and it's great for contact dermatitis and other bothersome rashy issues that may not respond to conventional treatment."
1,"The first day I wore it my co-worker had to endure my constant updates on how amazing my armpits smelled.  Considering I'm someone that NEVER discusses personal hygiene proves it's one fantastic product.  Seriously though, my armpits do smell delectable."
1,great as lip moisturizer and sun block.does not deteriorate over time as chapstick sometimesdoes. not cheap but all the neutragena products arequality products.
1,It has done a really good job keeping my skin hydrated and i have noticed a decrease in breakouts since using this product.It hasn't fully prevented my breakouts but i think it helps.
1,In researching this product I read a review on QVC that says the instructions say not to use this product if you have TMJ.
1,Found this highest rated on Consumer Reports so ordered it.  Was not too thrilled with it.  Regular ones are OK too.
1,"my 5 yr old grandson and i love this soap. we use it everyday. he really dosen't like to use anything else anymore.  it has a nice clean scent, very creamy and mild for your skin and lasts a good amount of time. we've used many goat milk soaps, and this is our favorite."
1,This product has the greatest density for laying down French nails. It has great covering capacity if one prefers to lay it over areas that need concealing.
1,"i absolutely love this brand especially with the lavender. it reminds me of the oder from lavender fields during my summer stay in Provence, France. not to oily and just right!"
1,"I'm so glad Conair still makes this item. I've tried other brands and other sizes, but this one is perfect for mid length, fine hair and the options of 2 sizes allow you to style hair in various ways."
1,"I have never used rosewater before, but I actually used a few drops in some lemonade and was very impressed. Lovely scent."
1,"I typically use an organic night cream that costs around $30. I wanted to save on my skin products, so I bought this; I must, say it works well so far! I have VERY oily skin; the oilyness of my skin has not gone away, however, this night cream helps control it, so that when I wake up in the morning I am not too shiny! You only need half a dime size of product, so it lasts!"
1,"I purchased these after reading about them on a review for a tanning lotion.  They work so well, I'm going to be ordering a pair for my sister and my mother!  Highly recommend!"
1,This product is great. i love it. I let it on my wet hair for about 2-3 hours though did not use steam after shampoo and blow dry my hair felt extra shiny and healthy.Its a great hair treatment specially for dry or frizzy hair.I highly recommend this.
1,"My daughter used to pick her lips to the point that they were crusted over with blood every morning. I put this on her nails and told her that it was yucky. The first time she picked her lips she realized that it was the truth and she never picked her lips again. I also used it on the door stoppers that the cat was chewing on, and on the tiny (swallowable) toys that my husband just had to buy my son. He put it in his mouth once, spit it out and complained of how yucky it tasted. I got a bit of this on my finger and realized it later when I licked frosting off of my finger. Its bitter and just yucky."
1,"This exfoliant is designed to wake up your skin, scrubbing it with tiny abrasive ingredients to get rid of the old and bring forth the new.  It exposes a newer layer of cells, removing dirt and older skin cells.  One's face feels fresher and looks healthier.  Burt's Bees does this and more, and it's the more that I don't like.In its admirable stance of using natural ingredients, the product contains sweet almond oil and almonds, vegetable glycerine, oats, orange peel and oil, rose powder, pecan powder, grapefruit seed extract, nutmeg powder, clove powder, tocopherol (vitamin E), and fragrance.  It's the nutmeg and clover that I don't like.  The scent is so strong that it feels like you've smeared pumpkin pie on your face.  The scent lingers, even after several rinses.  It's glorious if you love this smell, but it's very annoying if you don't.  Although it's called ""citrus,"" the overloaded spice smell completely dominates; I didn't smell citrus at all.The other problem is a noticeable oily texture.  The oily feeling does rinse away, but aesthetically it's a letdown, antithetical to the fresh, cleansing feeling one expects.  The product has a not uncomfortable ""grit"" to it, so it's up to the exfoliating task. Still, I'd easily recommend similar products by Origins and Alba over this Thanksgiving potpourri."
1,"I've used this for a few months now and this just moisturizes. For reference, I have normal, slightly oily lids. My eye area is incredibly sensitive to retinol. I have really dark circles, mostly due to genetics.Pros:-my skin has not reacted negatively to this product-first ingredient is water, making this a good starter moisturizer for beginners-does not sting or bother my eyes much if I accidentally get some in-affordableCons:-does not get rid of dark circles. There is white shimmer in this gel, which will reflect light making it seem like your dark circles are lighter.-does not get rid/fill in fine lines.-dries tacky. I've varied the amount I put on and there's still a tacky residue through out the day. Might be good for those who use makeup.Although I wouldn't buy this again, I would definitely recommend this product to those just starting out with eye creams. Also, this seems like it will last me a long time. I do use this twice a day."
1,"I have been buying the Mario Badescu drying lotion for a while now and when I heard bye bye blemish was a dupe, I decided to try it out. This works just as good if not better. It dries up the zit quickly BUT, my only complaint is that it can be a little too harsh so you have to be careful. I was able to use the Mario Badescu one on recently popped zits but not this one. This one will make an open sore worse and painful. But I would rather save money and work with this one instead. Probably shouldn't be putting anything on open sores anyway. Oops."
1,"I purchased this mascara for the color... wanted something other than black, but still subtle enough for every day wear. I can see the color clearly on the mascara wand, but not so much on my lashes (which are a dark brown color naturally)...it ended up looking like the same old black mascara, however, maybe in certain lights a difference might be noticed. In terms of a mascara's purpose- to define, elongate and thicken, I would have to give this mascara a thumbs down. I really don't like the brush, which is my biggest issue because I prefer a full, fluffy brush and this one is not that. The mascara isn't clumpy, which is probably the only plus I found, but I needed to apply three or four coats to get my desired result. Overall, if you're getting this for the color, I would say that its VERY subtle/nearly black, so make sure that is what you are looking for... in terms of a mascara, this is really not something that is going to give you a dramatic look in terms of fullness and length. Will not purchase again."
0,I usually like Elizabeth Arden products over all but the green tea deodorant just did not work for me. It has a sharp fragrance that just smelled bad after application and did not last more than an hour.
0,I can't see any difference at all in my night sweats! I still wake up 3-4 times a night sweating and miserable! I've tried this several weeks with absolutely no change whatsoever !! I will continue til it's gone and if by some remote chance it starts working I'll update this review to me it's just a joke!
1,"This performs well and at this price, you get a big bottle that should last quite a long time. Recommended!"
1,I wanted something different but not neon.  This is a very nice shade of gray that held up pretty well.  I'm quite happy with it.
1,JUST GOT THIS TODAY...HOWEVER THE COLOR IS GREAT NOT TOO BOLD...PACKAGING IS GREAT...BUT IT HAS TAKEN OVER A WEEK TO DELIVER...I WONT BE ORDERING AGAIN DUE TO DELIVER TIME...BUT LOVE THE PRODUCT
0,And it dried out my scalp so I got more after. And my hair felt strawy! It's usually very shiny and soft. I did not like this at all.
1,"AGAIN I FOUND WHAT WAS HARD TO FIND IN A STORE, GREAT PRICE, I HAVE USED THIS COVER STICK SINCE I WAS 18 YOA. WHEN MAX FACTOR WAS AROUND. TRY IT. NO REGRETS"
1,"I bathe my 3 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with this shampoo weekly and it's never dried out their skin.  I also use this brand of conditioner on their ears for added silkiness. The shampoo scent is mild but pleasant and long lasting.  The shampoo cleans quite well with one lathering; unlike many other dog shampoos I've used over the years.  The built in conditioner gives a soft feel to the hair and promotes tangle-free hair without adding any greasiness to the feel of the coat.  My hands dry out easily, especially in the winter, and this shampoo is easy on my skin.  My fingers no longer crack after bathing them.  This is a consistently high quality product - been using it for years."
0,"This color was way different than the tutti fruiti opi bottles I bought in the past while my bottle says Tutti Fruit, I put it side by side my old bottle and they are nothing alike.. The color looks nothing like this picture. It's grossly misrepresented."
1,Received this large bottle of castor oil and thisI believe will last me awhile. It was wrapped againin plastic for spillage I guess. And I am gratefulfor that. When I do run out I will order this sizeagain. I am pleased with its size.
1,"I've used this product for several months now and I can honestly say, I don't notice a difference. It does feel good on my skin, it's non-irritating and for that I give 3 stars. I'm just not sure that it's making a huge difference in my complexion. I think I will try a different product/brand and compare and then update my response."
1,This make up is the best. It covers good and last all day.I was pleasantly surprised. I will definitely purchase more.Looks great and is a great price....
1,I randomly got this conditioner when I saw it was only a 1.50 on sale. I was throughly surprised the first time I used it. The scent is quite enjoyable and nice. The texture feels wonderful on your hair and leaves my hair feeling soft and definitely not dried out. I would recommend this conditioner to those trying to keep their hair healthy but may be on a budget and want drug store brands.
1,"I'm a female but I love scents that are a little woodsy or mossy. The type of scents that a lot of people classify as manly. It's funny because when I wear scents such as that I get a lot of compliments. I love sandalwood, cedarwood and vertiver. They just blend with my own natural scent in a special way. I love this oils and used it almost everyday whether I was going out or not,"
1,"This is a wonderful product for layering over absorbent serums in wintertime, especially in the evenings.  It's also a good candidate base lotion for mixing in actives if you are into DIY skincare.  The PH is gentle and its moisturizing properties are terrific because it contains humectants, occlusives, and emollients--the big 3 moisturizer categories.Another product that I recommend for layer over serums to help moisturize and lock in existing moisture is Cellbone's Moist'Seal."
1,This makes my skin feel like a baby's butt. I love it. It smells great and is easy to use.
1,"not much more to say than that - dries quickly, easy to pack - might be too small for someone with long hair - I have shoulder length hair at it just barely made a turban"
1,"I brought it reading the review and worth it , as it worked very good on my skin and keeps it moisturised all teh time."
1,"I purchased this for my 12 year old daughter who is battling with the issues of clear skin while transforming into adulthood.  First we triedClean & Clear Blackhead Eraser Kitand that only seemed to irritate her skin and make her nose look red and raw from using the buffer pad.  She has been overall pleased with the results after using thePanasonic EH2511A Pore Cleanser with Micro-fine Mist. Like other reviews have mentioned before, you get better results if you use it in the shower after washing your face with warm water to open your pores.  The misting option really does not have much of a benefit except the col mist does feel good on a hot summer day.  Make sure you keep constant motion because it will cause a red/purple mark on your face if you leave the suction nozzle still in one place for longer than 5 or more seconds.  The instructions state do not hold the application on each spot for more than 10 seconds, but I thought that number was a little high.  Everyone's skin tones and blemishes are different, so I guess it depends on the user.Has a one year limited warranty.  Easy to clean and maintain.  First initial charge is 12 hours but after that it hold the charge for quite a while.  Completely waterproof and best if used in the shower."
1,"I'll admit that I don't know much about curling irons, but I'm pretty satisfied. I do have a few biffs about it. THe more you use it, the harder it is to curl your hair. You have to let it stand alone for a while to continue. The dial is a PAIN!! That's a big design flaw. It's so easy to turn and often while curling my hair I accidentally turn it down so I am constantly checking to see if it's still there. Luckily I use the highest setting, but if you were using another number, you'd die. Otherwise, curls fine. I definitely got my money's worth, but that's about it."
1,"I used to have pretty bad acne, but thankfully it cleared up! I do sometimes get the occasional pimple..yippee. Lucky me, I got a big one right in the middle of my cheek right before vacation. I bought this on a whim and thought I'd try it on my bad timing zit. I washed my face like normal twice a day and covered the pimple with this. After a day, it was gone! It wasn't red and puffy anymore, and with a little make-up was nonexistant!I don't think you should slather this all over you face though, it does really dry out your skin and leaves it feeling kind of stiff and like you have dry soap on it... but overall, I think it's great!"
1,"THIS AVEENO SOAP MAKES MY FACE SMOOTH AND BABYLIKE. THIS IS THE ONLY SOAP I TRUST MY FACE WITH,& I'M VERY PICKY WHEN IT COMES TO FACIAL CLEANSING . IT ALSO MADE MY FACE A LITTLE LIGHTER , BUT OVERALL I'M A SATISFIED CUSTOMER. DELIVERY WAS EXTREMELY FAST..."
1,"I really like this round brush!  My hair is short, thin, and fragile and the brush does not tangle or cause static."
1,This is a very soft and heavy scent. It probably best suited for an older woman. I use it only as an evening accessory
1,"Love this, been using it for years on my NW25 skin. Gives the perfect glow, never breaks me out. LOVE"
1,Love this product. In my opinion it does everything it is supposed to.The only thing I would like is if the fragrance lasted a little longer.
1,I bought this to help with wrinkles and dark spots.  It does make a difference but you will definitely need another moisturizer since after you use this your skin will feel slightly dry and tight
1,"I'm a 29 year old active male with moderately oily skin and I generally like this product.  The exfoliation is more gentle than most ""scrubs"" due to the very tiny beads.  It almost feels like you are rubbing fine grit sand on your face.  The actual cleansing portion is fairly gentle and smells nice.  Just a little dab of this will easily cover your face and I find one bottle lasting me over a month.One thing I will note is that this tends to be a tad harsh for normal skin - especially during the winter months.  I like to mix usage of this withAveeno Smart Essentials Scrub, since the latter is a little more gentle on the skin for when you don't need much exfoliation."
1,"This product smells wonderful. Though I cannot really tell if it's working, ( i have this issue with other toners ), i use it everyday and I have maintained a nice complexion. Maybe it is because of this! Also, I use this to wash my makeup brushes."
1,"I've just ordered three more packages.  It works for me and I do have one suggestion.  After you fit the product on your two toes, tape the product around your foot to hold the product in place.  Until I did this, the product twisted itself off.  I recommended this product to all with problem toes.  One more thing:  I do not expect this product to correct my problem toes.  Surgery is required.  However, with this product, I am able to wear all of my shoes comfortably with no stress on my troubled toes.I hope this helps.  Cheers!"
1,"I think I've tried somewhere near 20 or 25 different liquid eyeliners.  They all either flake, rub off, aren't pigmented, or irritate the eyes.  Except for this one.  It goes on smoothly and precisely, and stays on until you decide to take it off, be it with makeup remover or cleanser.  This stuff lasts through swimming, tears, and parties.  And it's only about $6!"
1,Wasn't particularly impressed with this product. The odor was just ok. Wouldn't pay that much money for a soap I use daily since this one doesn't last any longer than my usual brand.
1,I love NOW products and lemon oil is a stable in my house because we just love the smell and it has multiple uses.
1,"i have thick frizzy red hair, this bottle of jojoba oil has replaced every high end pricy hair product i have ever owned!! (and i've tried them all..) i use it in my hair while still wet & let air dry.  my hair is super silky soft.  cant beat it.  also, in my 3rd trimester of pregnacy i use it on my belly as an anti itch oil.  works great.  definatly reccommend if you have dry skin or hair.  you will find no better oil than this especially at this price :)"
1,"I'm a fan of Feria Haircolor, so I got this to try last summer, it worked on the highlighted parts of my hair, but not the darker parts. I say if you want to go lighter, then you have to go with some bleach, go to a salon."
1,"I bought one of these a few months ago, and stored it in my bathroom cabinet for safekeeping till I was ready to use it. Every time I opened that cabinet the whole house would be perfumed with the smell of it! Finally last night I went ahead and used the bomb for my bath. The water turned a very pretty pink color, and I thought the fizzing action lasted a lot longer than with other bath bombs I've used in the past, and was somewhat stronger. (It's good if you do that trick of putting the fizzing bomb underneath sore muscles to get some light massaging action from the bubbles.) I love the smell of it -- it's like a perfect halfway between candy and floral scents. The fragrance stuck to me all night, too; it was great. My skin also felt quite nice getting out of the bath (probably because citric acid is a major ingredient in the bomb -- it helps soften skin when put in a bath.)I do wish they were a bit less expensive, but I knew what I was getting into when I bought it. That's why I saved it for a discontented day whereupon I felt I really needed it!"
1,I like it so far - only using it a couple of weeks but I like the richness of it yet it isn't oily when applied. I really like the way the cream is dispensed. Very nice!
0,I received this product in December as a gift.  I just tried it this evening and the unit is broken.  It just makes a clicking noise and does not heat up or steam up.  I am dissappointed as I have used these Caruso Rollders once before many years ago and I wore the old one out.  I am trying to get a hold of the seller to send back for either a new one or refund.I hope everyone else is having luck with their Caruso C97958 Professional ION Steam Hairsetter.
1,"There is nothing else like hope in a jar.  I've been using it for years and I can't live without it.  My husband also uses it. It is light and pleasant.  I am a Philosophy girl through and through, and this one is a winner!"
1,"I bought this cleanser for my husband. He was looking for something simple to help his complexion and he loves this stuff! I was sharing my own personal cleanser with him at first, but he didn't like that. I decided to try this for myself a couple of times. It doesn't foam, but it leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean. I also love the smell. With regular use, I have noticed a change in my husband's skin for sure. Good stuff! It looks smoother and brighter."
1,"I do not use these every day only because they do take a little bit more time than just blow drying my hair. They are very comfy, steamer unit works immediately and they stay in place perfectly with the snap on covers. I use only the very largest roller size to get full smooth look. The smaller ones will definitely give you tighter smaller curls. Glad I bought a second set. I sold my first set in a garage sale and always regretted it."
1,"I'm not sure what Fran Wilson thinks purple is, but purple (which is maroon in the tube) comes out bright pink. It's not even close to being a purple hue. I have purple hair and wanted lips to match, but this is clearly pink. The lipstick is great. It doesn't rub off and lasts a while. I like the lipstick, but not the colour. I'm going to try getting black cos I see that that one comes out purple. We'll see how it works.Update: I've tried nearly all the colours. They all come out in different shades of pink. Some are lighter, some brighter some with a darker hue, some more purple, some more red, but all are pink."
1,"I was natural when I first purchased this product last year, and I hated it. It did nothing for my hair. My hair type is 3b-4a. I was tired of dealing with my natural hair so I relaxed my hair September 9, 2012, and I started using this product in my hair after washes as a leave in and I absolutely love it. It makes my hair so soft and strong. I use this Aphogee Keratin & Green Tea Restructurizer to roller set my hair as well. My hair has never felt better. I had to repurchased another bottle."
1,I have 6-7&#34; long african-american hair and this comb goes through my hair sooo easily and the handle is the right length.
1,"I love this lotion. It smells good but it is not strongly scented, it feels good on my skin (not too heavy, not too light), and it definitely moisturizes all day."
1,"I am 63 and I have a receding hairline.  I believe I see results and I do have realistic expectations.  And, my husband, a barber,  said he sees some results.  More importantly, I feel I have some control with respect to my hair loss.  I feel better using it.  I hope this helps.  Cheers!!!"
1,"I love OPI, but it's so hard to choose a color online. this color shows that it's so much darker than it is. i gave it to my daughters to play with and of course they love it. it's an expensive nail polish (including shipping-which makes it the same price as in the store) to give to my girls."
1,"I have been a makeup ""flirt"" all my life, never sticking with one line or product for any length of time.  ""Philosophy"" changed my own philosophy with its skin care product line.  I have come to depend and recommend their skin care line to friends and co-workers for several years.  I have never been let down.  This is the daily moisturizing I am using currently.  Never greasy or too heavy.Highly recommend!"
1,"My daughter has eczema and I thought I had to buy expensive body wash including this one.  But I could'nt keep up so I decided to start buying dove soap I use both the sensitive and the winter care bars and found them cheaper than  buying this body wash, and I think the dove bars are just as effective."
1,"I went to Whole Foods today because GNC didn't have the supplements I needed.  I stocked up on natural skin products galore. I remember reading about these towels, so I looked for it. Whole Foods had it!  However, I wasn't sure if it was the right one that I read on Amazon with all the stars and bought it anyway, hoping the buyer for the store knew what they were doing.  Thankfully they did.  I tried it last night and it's wonderful. Move over Buf Puf because this towel is wonderful.  At first glance it might seem a bit flimsy, but it will definitely surprise you once you get under the water.  I'm so glad I researched this towel on Amazon.com.  Now I can finally stop putting prescription lotions and creams all over my skin that the dermatologists give me for dry skin, oily skin, PMS zits, and folliculitis, which only work temporarily and I believe have contributed to me always feeling like I need a nap."
1,"My skin is very sensitive. My family uses dove soap but I still get irritated. Overall, this product works well for me."
1,"This is a nice alternative to the oily sunblocks out there on the market. Sure, it doesn't have the scent of coconut oil, but some of us are allergic to that anyway.So, this is a nice sunblock for us sensitive skin types and it is oil-free and non-irritating, not to mention non-comedogenic. Basically, you can use this on your face and it won't block your pores.This cream seems really rich and creamy and then suddenly it just disappears into your skin and feels very light and not oily.Highly recommended for when you are out and about in the sun this summer!~The Rebecca Review"
1,"This product is one that I make sure to have on hand at all times.  It works wonders for those who need the strengthening properties of protein along with moisture.  It truly is a product that balances both, in my opinion.  This conditioner literally soaks into my hair strands and makes my hair very soft and manageable.  I have textured 4a/b hair and this is one of my staple products.  This product delivers without harsh chemicals and potential toxins.  I would recommend this for people who have chemically-treated hair."
1,"I was looking for a travel hairdryer to take on a trip to Europe. I chose this one because it has dual voltage, is foldable, and is available through Amazon Prime for quick shipping. It is rather bulky, but I suppose if it were smaller it wouldn't have the power and other nice features like the speed settings and ""cool"" button. It performed perfectly on the trip (with the addition of a tiny outlet adapter) and is comfortable to hold. Now I keep it in my gym bag.  Overall, I recommend this if you want a somewhat more compact but still powerful dryer."
1,"Burt's Bee's Orange Essence Facial cleanserBased on the reviews, I bought this cleanser for my significant other who has dry skin.  I have combination skin and normally would not choose such a very emollient oil cleanser.  Fortunately [as it turns out] one day I ran out of my normal cleanser and tried this product.  It is oily but just a tiny drop washes your whole face.  I'm guessing at the rate we're going [it's 'our' cleanser now] this one tube can last a whole year. We've had it a couple of months and it's maybe 10% down, if that...  which makes it very eco-friendy in terms of packaging.  To cut the oiliness I just sprinkle in a little baking soda.  Since the first day I tried this I have used nothing else.  Let me tell you why.The orange oil really seems to make my skin more glowy and softer than my old cleanser did.  With the added soft grit of the baking soda it was the most amazing exfoliation I've ever gotten at home.  It doesn't seem to make my pores any smaller, but it does make them look really clearer. The over all texture of my skin is softer and smoother, more light-reflective and has a really dewy feel. The alkalinity of the baking soda is itself tonifying but the slight residue of the orange oil works well in the cold, dry climate of winter where I am. So it seems to balance out the dry effects on the combo skin. During summer, I think I will prefer a lighter cleanser, but at least for winter or dry climates this is now my go-to facial cleansing product.At the time I first used it I had horrible cracks and chaps on my upper lip I had gotten from wind/cold exposure that just wasn't going away with my everyday facial routine... partly because my lips kept cracking at night while I slept.  I thought the problem was that my chapstick wasn't doing it's thing right. I was getting up in the middle of the night to put on chapstick, and still - I would wake up with split lips. So painful.  I didn't know a cleanser could make such a big difference in the health of your lips. The first night I used this cleanser, I had no cracking lips after like a month of suffering, and my lips returned to normal the very. next. day.  For that I am sold on this product.  I would recommend it to anyone, with the caveat that if your skin in combo or oil - sprinkle some baking soda in when you use it, and it doubles as an exfoliater.It's super gentle and helped my skin heal itself."
1,"I have been using this color regularly for 4 years. I love it.It's a very bright carrot-y color at first, but as it fades it becomes a very natural red. I have seen many surprised reactions when I tell people that I am not a natural red head.This is the ONLY brand that I will buy an orange-y red from. It's the only brand with the vibrancy I want.TIPS:-when dying your hair red spray windex on anything you accidentally get hair dye on (it'll come off near immediately)-DO NOT wash your hair for 3-4 days after dying your hair red (it helps lock the color in)-DO NOT use shampoos with sulfate in them (they cause the color to fade extremely quickly)-depending on how much it fades and how long it's been you may have to completely redye your hair instead of touching up on it because of the color difference between when you first dye it and when it fadesGood luck!"
1,"I liked Neutrogena's Blackhead Eliminating Astringent better. This stuff is very effective, but it doesn't smell half as good or leave my face feeling wonderful like the Blackhead Eliminating Astringent. That said, I'll probably continue buying this product because 1) it works well, despite the strong odor and 2) I believe Blackhead Eliminating Astringent has been discontinued by Neutrogena."
1,It was an okay cream. Very creamy. You have to remix it because  the oils separated. I've bought better homemade calendula creams on etsy.
0,This worked ok but it wasn't anything special nor did it seem to help my skin much.  Overall I would not recommend it and it is expensive.  I think there are other options for cheaper that you can get.
0,This doesn't blend into the skin well and it don't seem to cover my redness any better than a regular concealer. If you use too much it also leaves a green hue to your face so you have to be very careful. I wouldn't recommend for large areas.
1,"Don't know if it regenerates, but it does make the skin on my face and neck feel velvety soft. The Rite Aid knock off works just as well and costs less."
1,This is another product I've used for years to keep my face clean. I'm almost 70 and people say I look 20 years younger so keeping the facial skin free of oil and dirt must have some merit. Buf-Puf are a bit hard to find but luckily we have Amazon. Gave one to my granddaughter to help her avoid Acne and show her how to avoid oil and bacteria caused pimples. Buf-Puf Gentle has a little scrubbing action which helps to remove dead skin and keep the skin glowing. Recommended highly for daily use.
1,"we have tried everything from eucerin on up...and this works the best.  This cream is thick, and we apply it after baths......notice a huge difference if we skip it.  works great on dry skin, and although it is sold locally, I prefer to buy it here to get a 2 pack...."
0,Tried it for two weeks: I didn't see any difference in my face and it was a little thick when applied. It also leaves a slight sheen that I don't care for. I'm sure the 0.5 Salicylic Acid is good for sensitive skin.
1,If your hair is breaking and it is not from over amounts of added protein this will get the job done to stop the breakage. I would advise to lessen the usage once your hair stops breaking. I often have to stop using all together as it can have a reverse effect once the hair is better. Of course cutting your hair will always be the best solution for any type of damage but I know some people just have fine easily breakable hair. I use this after I've done something stupid to my hair. Works great. I don't have the product in front of me so I can't describe any scent but I can tell you I can smell stuff no one else smells and this does not have a lingering scent or I'd remember.
1,"I've been using this cream for about a year now, I'm 44, and due to an immune disorder, I have Vitiligo, a VERY mild version of it, meaning, I'm still fairly pale but my skin is uneven and my face is darker than it used to be.  I used to have peaches and cream skin (Irish, German & Italian heritage) but when I moved to Texas, it seemed like my skin disorder was activated.  Anyway, even tho' growing up I wanted darker skin and tanned (I grew up in Long Island), as I got older I really realized the natural beauty of your true skin color. Well, too late ;-( about 12 years after running around Lady Bird Lake here in Austin, I came home and my skin was a yellowish tint.  It was almost as if I'd gotten a sunburn but it didn't really go away ;-(I immediately started to exfoliate as much as I could, and did my best to stay out of the sun but long story short, my skin was permanently darkened because my immune system was compromised.  So back to this cream, Loreal has always been a good product and reasonably priced but I particularly like this cream because1. It feels very cooling and soft when it goes on2. No filmy feel to it on your skin3. I actually like that it's a little heavy in the sense it can make my skin a little oily looking but I prefer that to dry and cakey looking4. It's cheap!5. It seems to help with my slight discoloration and does NOT add to my yellowish tone that I have acquiredDo NOT get this product if you like your skin very matte or a bit dry - or IF you get this - you'll need foundation/powder - I don't use foundation powder - as much as I struggle with my skin color (mostly I notice it - not too many others) I don't like foundation.  I like feeling natural and free with my skin.Overall? This is my favorite day cream."
1,If you are looking for a makeup remover that removes waterproof mascara this works great. It is oily so you only need a tiny amount on a cotton ball or pad. After wiping off all the mascara I recommend that you wash your face and areas around your eyes with a liquid soap you'd use to clean your face normally. Then splash a lot of water around your eyes especially so there is no oily residue left. If you don't do this the oil can be slightly irritating and may make your eyes feel itchy. So make sure to remove the remover and you should have less problems.~The Rebecca Review
1,It sometimes helps my hair to stay in and not fall out. I have stress hair loss so there are times when nothing helps that too much; but this is a good product over-all.
1,I've used this product for years and find it removes my eye-makeup very well and it doesn't irritate my eyes or the delicate skin around my eyes.  I just saturate a cotton ball and gently wipe.  It doesn't leave an oily film on my eyes and removes even waterproof mascara.  I do have a hard time finding it in some stores so I'm thankful it's so easy to shop on Amazon.
1,"This cream is very velvety.  I love the way it feels on my skin.  I apply after washing my face, let dry, then apply a moisturizer.  Your skin is instantly smoother and softer.  Really love the way it makes my skin feel.  Also does not burn or tingle, its very gentle.  I have re-purchased this product twice now and don't plan on stopping.  Highly Recommend."
1,"These rollers heat up within minutes!!! By the time I get dressed, they are hot and ready to go!! Makes styling a breeze:)"
1,"I'm pleased with the effect of this, and also that the applicator tip isn't too bendable, however the bottle is INCREDIBLY tiny. I will update this when I run out, though I don't expect to use it everyday."
1,"I had only used this on horses before I used it on myself. Ask yourself: have you ever seen a horse's tail up close and touched it? Unless it's VERY regularly tamed, it's always a thick and matted mess. Anything that can make a tail like that silky smooth has got to be good. It's been working great for me and I think that I'll keep buying this for myself."
1,"I switched to Aveeno several yrs ago and have love the change. Not sure if it relieves stress, but it leaves the skin soft and hydrated w/ a nice light scent."
1,"Doesn't like it! Smell too strong! But it's nice to make air fresh! You can try in different way, and you may feel some good of it!"
1,"The entire Aveeno Clear Complexion line is amazing. This moisturizer in particular is amazing, and I usually can never find it in stores which is why I strictly have to order it on Amazon - which I am not complaining about! This order always arrives literally 2 days after I buy it, and I am in love with how this moisturizer makes my skin feel. I have very sensitive skin with some oily spots and acne..and this cream is perfect after washing my face in the morning and at night. What I love best about this product is that it doesn't make my face more oily, and it keeps my skin feeling refreshed even during the summer. Love it!"
1,"This is by far the best mascara for STICK STRAIGHT LASHES. I'm asian and have very short, sparse, stick straight lashes that would be invisible if they weren't natrually jet black. I've been using this product for over a decade. I've tried others thinking there must be better mascaras than this pink/green tube that only costs $5. But there is not. At least for me. I always throw the others away and come back to the old tried-and-true. And the price doesn't hurt.The most notable thing about this mascara and why it's so good for stick straight lashes is that this is one of the only mascaras I can find where the first few ingredients isn't water (H20). In fact, this formula does not contain water at all. This is super important to me because I curl my eyelashes before applying mascara. And because my lashes are natrually straight, mascaras with water in them will cause my curled lashes to go straight almost immediately. This is not weird science or anything like that. The same principle applies to curled hair. When you get water on curled hair, doesn't matter if its water in the air due to humidity, rain, the shower, the hair always loses it's curl when it comes into contact with water.If you are having issue with your lashes loosing curl after applying mascara, chances are you need to find one that does not have water in the formula. I highly recommend the Maybelline Great Lash because it is clump free, very smudge resistant, waterproof, thickening, and SO BLACK. (NOTE: This thickens better than it lengthens. Waterproof means you can get water on them and the mascara won't run. But your lashes will lose its curl. Althought I always get Very Black, it does come in various colors). Get a make-up remover to remove this mascara. I find the removers with oil in it works best at removing this mascara. You can also use any oil such as mineral, olive, jojoba, coconut, if you're into that. Most soap/face wash alone won't do the job.Use this and you will find that you will NEVER have to re-curl after putting on mascara again. I hate to re-curl because coated lashes are tacky and gets stuck to, ripped out, or broken by curlers. And lashes end up in worst shape when you curl after putting on mascara. So don't re-curl. Get a good mascara that doesn't have water as an ingredient. Try this one. I highly recommend!!!"
1,"so glad I purchased this one, so many options out there, but I didn't want to spend a lot, so I choose this based off the reviews, so glad I did. it works great, is super fast compared to all other driers ive had, which is many, and I love the ion, I wont buy one without it, and can tell a difference with ion! if you hold in the blue button it will give you cold air, which is great, you don't have to change the switch to cool air, just hole in the blue button on any setting! GREAT! it gets hot, but not so hot that it burns your neck (or my daughters neck, which is always a problem with the girls, she used to hate the hair dryer cus it was so hot it burned her neck ect), however it is hot enough to dry hair very quickly, which is a great deal for her, since that was her other problem with them. and its great for me too, since a lot of time I barely have time to even halfway dry my hair, now I can fully dry it in that amount of time! it is easy to hold/handle, and has all the options that an expensive dryer would, with the add ons (2 different ones!), they clip on and off easy also! it is sturdy, I have had it for a couple months, and I am very rough with them, leave them in the bathroom, laying out, or tucked beside the makeup table, laying in floor, or just through under the cabnit,, and I have had no issues at all, it doesn't have a scratch on it! amazing! i would recommend this to everybody, my sis already got the same one, after using mine,since she loved it, and still does after a month, and now my mom has the same one as well, and we all bought them on here, to be sure it was the exact same one, since in the stores it gets kinda confussing since so many are similar but not the exact same! so, yes, recommended, love it, love it , love it!"
1,"This toner leaves my face feeling fresh, and not tight like many toners.  I love the subtle rose smell, and the generous size.  A little goes a long way, too, so it's a great value.  Glad I got it, will probably stick with it, as it is the best toner I've used so far.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is because as yet, it hasn't made my wrinkles go away, lol."
1,The Pirated of the Caribbean colors are great.. This color on Mermaids Tears is almost a Mint or Light green turquoise color.. Really nice summer color!!! also the product was fresh!!  5 STAR  SELLER  fast shipping.
0,"I tried three times to get this to work (and watched a you tube tutorial) and maybe it's just my hair because everyone else seems to love it, but it wouldn't hold the curl at all...even with product the curls, more like waves really, just fell after a few minutes....resulting in just a mess of hair. My hair is naturally wavy and not especially course, so I wouldn't recommend this, but maybe it's just me....hair is a subjective thing I suppose."
1,This product helped dry out my acne the first day I used it. I use a very thin layer and let it sit over night then apply in the morning. A little goes a long way. I even apply makeup over it with no problems. It doesn't dry out my face and I have sensitive skin. I will buy again.
1,I think the world of this product. Does wonders  for ones skin and works well for people with sensitive skin. I am hooked on it.
1,"I bought this face mask based on all the positive reviews it got, but I was not completely happy with it. I have sensitive skin and this may have been a little harsh for it. I only left the mask on my face for about 10 minutes and then washed it off. Afterwards I felt a burning/rashy feeling around my nose. It also smelled kinda gross after it dried on my face. I may give it another shot though."
1,"My review title sounds a little funky, but that's the color of the Taj Mahal blush! I'd recommend it for darker-skinned or tanned girls, it's a great tropical look...and it has a shimmer to it! I use only a little bit at a time because I'm just medium-skinned. Lights up a tan really nicely! Wear it with coral and/or bronze makeup colors, and you'll look like a Tahitian goddess!"
1,"This lotion makes my skin tone look amazing, almost like a glow. It does appear to even out tone and fade dark marks. However, it takes a while to absorb I guess because when I first put it on, it feels like it's just sitting on my face. A little does not go a very long way with this product. I still love the way it makes my skin look though."
1,"I put in my sons bathroom & he's as picky as me.  This doesn't leak out all over the tub like I thought it would.  I just knew when I hung it & went to clean his bathroom, there would be residue from whatever was coming out of this dripping on to the tub underneath it.  I am happy to say, there is NONE!  Easy to install & this thing isn't moving, installed with silicone which I love.  Easy to refill as well. A+ for this little mechanism!"
1,i made my own hand sanitizer with this stuff and I love the smell. very refreshing and uplifting. also I put a small amount in my oil burner and it took away all the kitchen cooking smells. cheaper and better that air fresheners!
1,I love this soap....the bar is very hard so it lasts a long time...it is great for sensitive skin and even those with rosacea....It is all I use for cleanser on my face...
0,"i dont even know what this does, i bought it hoping it would help keep my hair healthy and cut down on the dryness, over all, it didnt do much for me, invest in something better,although my hair style is curly african american hair"
1,"But rips out a lot of hair. But I like it because it's something different & it gives your hair much more volume. Still perfecting my skills in using this device. I learned how to do perfect curls with a straightener / flat iron. But I think this tool has even more potential to make different styles of curls, such as spirals etc, because the bristles hold hair strands in place, and you can maneuver the way you fold the curl. Pretty interesting. Only wish the heated part was ceramic & that there was no crack in between the metal & plastic handle, which is the part that rips out the most hair."
1,"I swear by this stuff for pro youth (anti aging) skin maintenance.  It moisturizes and holds its moisture better than any other lotion I have tried, and I have tried more than a few.  If you are wanting luscious skin (face and body) I highly recommend exfoliating often and using this.  It really does what it claims to and has even made my eczema patches a thing of the past."
1,"When it arrived I was very surprised by the color..it appears more pink in the photo...in actuality it is more bronze/gold, but once I applied it... it looks and blends beautifully...the blush color is gorgeous. I am sure it will enhance a varity of skin tones. I am very happy with the purchase of NARS Blush, Orgasm."
1,"I had an eye pillow made by a different manufacturer for about 10 years before it finally tore open. Unable to see how I could live without it, I repaired it with duct tape (hey, I'm a guy, what do you expect), but I figured it was time to get a new one. I was pleased to see on Amazon that many eye pillows, such as the DreamTime eye pillow on this page, come with zippers so the contents can be removed and the material hand-washed. I got a different color than the one on this page (I got the ""DreamTime Inner Peace Eye Pillow, Sage Velvet,"" also sold here at Amazon). The eye pillow that tore open on me was unscented and I was hesitant about getting a scented eye pillow; I was afraid it would be too perfumy. But the scent of the DreamTime eye pillow is quite pleasant and to my liking and I don't find it perfumy at all. It has a mild chamomile smell, and when I use it, it is easy for me to imagine that I am reclining in a field of wild chamomile. Having an eye pillow means not having to put my arm or arms over my eyes (or a folded up t-shirt or a towel or whatever is handy) when I want total darkness. The eye pillow gives me total darkness--100% absolute blackness. It also imparts the pleasant sensation that I get when I gently press my palms to my eyes. The scent is relaxing, the sensation of having the pillow over my eyes is relaxing, the absolute darkness is relaxing, and I highly recommend this inexpensive product (especially at the sale price) to anyone who is looking for a natural way to get some deep relaxation. DreamTimes's eye pillow comes in a sturdy reusable cardboard box (with a ribbon carrying handle). DreamTime eye pillows are obviously marketed to women and that's too bad for guys who might not consider trying them because of how they're marketed. Maybe if they make some with a camo design (just kidding). Highly recommended for anyone who wants a natural aid to deep relaxation."
0,"Sometimes you get what you pay for. This is one of those cases. There's no lint on the back that would cause it to overheat or anything. One day it just started switching to a warm/cool setting even though it was set to hot. As time went on, it just doesn't even get hot anymore at all, warm at best. I had this less than 1 year and always kept the back cleared of lint so this is just a junk product. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does come with attachments that similarly priced dryers don't usually come with, and there's a removable cover thing on the lint trap in the back that makes it way easier to clean, you can remove it and wash it off in the sink in 2 seconds. But it doesn't work long so don't expect much."
1,"I have read, with amusement, some of the reviews of this soap.  How complicated they seem to feel washing one's hair to be.&#34;Oh it will dry my hair, oh it will dry my scalp, you have to mix it with something else.&#34;  Maybe I'm just too dense to understand or because I'm a man, I don't get it.  I've used this soap - that's this soap, nothing added, no magic blending with something else - and I cannot in all my 81 years (and yes, I've been blessed to still have a full head of hair) remember my hair looking or feeling as soft, silky and shiny as this soap leaves it.  Perhaps I'm doing something wrong.  I first hook my spray head to the hose on my sink.  Next I wet my hair with pleasantly warm water.  Then, in my left hand, I take the bar of soap and rub it over my hair.  It makes a great lather.  I rub the soap into my hair and using my finger tips, really get it down onto my scalp.  I use my spray to rinse off my hair.  If my hair doesn't squeak when I rub my hands over it, I soap it up a second time, rub, rinse and towel it off.  I comb it and let it dry as I go about my daily duties.  I do this about every 4 days or more often if I do something that gets it dirty like plastering or tossing hay.  My scalp doesn't itch anymore either. I neglected to say I had been having trouble with itching.I'll continue to buy this stuff as long as I need it.  OH yeah, I do use it to wash my face and the rest of me as well.  The smell, BTW is very light but pleasant."
1,"It's the most long lasting concealer I've found but please, with any heavy use of concealer it is critical to use a primer underneath the concealer.  ANY concealer will sink into your lines and cake if you don't.  Nevertheless this is natural, easily layerable and looks good in sunlight, which is always the harshest light out there."
1,"I had meant to order the SPF version, which comes out of the pump a white color.  This is a creamy-whitish.  Nothing wrong with that, but I need the SPF coverage and I actually use it to lighten up my light tinted moisturizer...I'm kinda pale, so I will stick with the SPF next time.  That said, I still use this sometimes at night or if I know I will be bumming around the house all day with no fun-in-the-sun.  It is lightweight and, like all Neutrogena products, of high quality."
1,"I use this band to keep my hair off of my face when I do my washing routine for my face. It has a nice wide width, stretches and so far is lasting."
1,"I wanted a stronger SPF and decided to try the 30. As is usually the case, I don't care much for the texture of this higher SPF. Otherwise it's okay. Unless you really need a higher SPF, you'll probably like the feel of the SPF 15 better. This one seems greasy. I have combination skin, but even when I dried out this winter I didn't care much for the texture of it. The extra grease didn't seem to help my dry skin problem either! It just made me shiny lol. I still use this (just to finish the bottle), but only mixed with make up.I haven't tried the tinted version of this moisturize because they don't make it in brown *ahem!*. :-)"
1,"I recommend Nars products, especially the Laguna bronzer. I have bees using it for years and love that I can order it online as it is not available in stores where I live. A little on the pricey side but worth every penny. It came in original unopened box with layer of plastic Nars protector over the cosmetic."
1,"This is another go-to for me in Fall or Winter.  Somereviewers have called it streaky, but I have had no problemswith it.  Gorgeous shade that I will wear as long as it's available!  :)"
1,"Very fast shipping it actually beat others i ordered a day before this one. Everything's legit, came in a box all sealed with the expiration date on the bottom.. ill update in 2 weeks when it will hopefully have gotten rid of my acne :)"
1,"I was skeptical about ordering this product, as I've tried a lot of similar products and have always been able to tolerate the taste and bite my nails anyways. First opinion of this product is...smells like nail polish remover. I was skeptical because even a little bit of a nail polish remover taste hasn't seemed to work and most just wear off after biting your nails once. Since I got my order last night...I've put it on, and ....first attempt to bite I didn't initially taste it, but boy oh boy is the aftertaste rancid. It takes forever to get the after taste out of your mouth and is a HUGE reminder not to bite. I even tried brushing my teeth to get it out and it didn't help much. After ashing my hands several times it still hasn't worn the taste off of it. Whatever the manufacturers did to make this product to terrible tasting and long lasting...it worked. I absolutely hate putting my hands in my mouth with this stuff on. I'm betting I'll have nice long nails before too long."
1,"I was using only a hot iron before to straighten my hair.  It wasn't until my stylist showed me how to use a round brush with my hair dryer did I see even better results with softer, fuller hair.  I have tried several different round brushes, but my stylist used this brush on my hair and this works the best for my very thick hair and my hair does not get all tangled or wrapped around the brush as with other brushes I have tried.  The result is straighter, softer, fulller, healthier hair.  I cannot live without this brush!"
1,"OVERALL REVIEW:Speaking as a product junkie who prides herself on knowing a good product and being objective, I have to say this is an awesome product.  Yes, it's a bit pricey but the benefits are well worth it. My skin is brighter, smoother and softer. Reduced acne and large pores..............Want or need to know more?  Keep reading :) ...........MY SKIN:I am in my early 40's and have mocha brown skin which tends to get oily in certain areas of my face.  I also suffer from adult acne which can range from a pimple or 2 or 10! These of course, leave some acne scars (due to extraction) but once I have that under control with the use of creams, treatments and use of peels....life is ok!  This past year I began seeing large pores around my cheek area and noticed my face had become uneven in skin tone.  Yikes! *faint*MY(old) REGIMEN:I used at home  salicylic and glycolic (liquid kind) peels every other week.  Exfoliated in between peels and was diligent about keeping my skin and pores clean. However, using these peels I had to wait a week before seeing results and sometimes afraid I would burn my skin, leave on too long or just make my situation worse.  I had anxiety each time I used them, so I was extra careful and received good results.  One day when I went to re-order my peels  I stumbled across ""Instant Peel"".  I figured, what the heck and here we are.HOW I USED THE PRODUCT:The product recommends that you use it in the shower, which I have found is the best method (yeah I tried other non-shower methods like steaming face, warm damp towel on face, etc). There are 6 packets and it is creamy in texture (not thick-creamy a bit liquidy).1. Once in the shower for about 1-2 minutes (your face has to be moist/damp NOT wet), squeeze out a little bit onto the tips  of your fingers.  With your fingers, smooth liquidy cream onto an area of your face; then, using back and forth motion apply light to moderate pressure (don't massage it in using a circular motion-go back and forth). The dead skin will roll off onto your fingers. Just rinse your fingers pat dry with a cloth (hang one over the shower rod where you can get to it easily). I found that doing one side of my face (a cheek and jawline) at the same time works best. I use about 33-40% of the product for each side of my face (twice).  Doing smaller sections works well too but if you have a lot of dead skin then you will spend a little more time in the shower and possibly risk running out of hot water!  :)  Rinse off the product from fingers and splash a little on face to get rid of the residue.2. Repeat process on other side and forehead. I liken this peeling process to having Elmers Glue (white stuff we used in school during art time) being semi-dry on your hands and you roll it off to be free of gluey hands.  You will know when all of the dead skin is off your face because you will not be able to roll anymore off.3. BEWARE!  If you rub too hard and continue to rub vigorously past the ""no more rolling required"" point you will cause your face to be raw and red and even perhaps end up damaging your skin (yes, this is what happened to me! I was overly excited).  Just be sure to stop rubbing when the skin stops rolling off onto your fingers and you'll be fine. The product isn't supposed to affect new skin cells but, again, if you rub like a mad woman (i.e., yours truly) then there is a risk of hurting your skin.  So just don't do it!  :)SIDE NOTE & TIP:Unbeknownst to me, when I first used the product I had so much dead skin on my face it was unreal!  I was sure I would have very little dead skin cell removal because I exfoliated regularly.  Ha!  wrong.  I ended up using a pack and a half of product.  If you have product left over put the unused portion/packet in a ziplock bag and save for next time. Make sure to seal it. This is important because the product will dry out and go bye-bye.THE RESULTS:Once done showering, I dried off, patted face dry and couldn't believe my eyes when I looked in the mirror.  My skin was literally and noticeably brighter and more even toned. After one use?? The large pores on my cheeks had reduced in size, acne pimples drastically reduced in size, face looked younger (a solid 5 years-Girl Scouts' Honor!!), skin was radiant looking and felt baby soft smooth. Again, this was after the first use! I stood in literal awe. Amazing!!!!!  I have not used my at home liquid peels since then.  I continued using this product because this one does the trick and you see instant results.  My make-up goes on smoother and people comment on my skin and it's texture. That's a whole new thing for me.  When I first started using the product I used it 2 times the first week (3 packets) and then once every other week (1 packet). The entire box lasted about 2-1/2 months.  I am now on box #2.  The benefits are so great that this is now a part of my (new) face care regimen. So glad I invested in this product and stumbled across the page.  I love the way my skin looks and feels. I haven't seen my skin this ""bright and glowy"" in yearsIn case you are wondering......MY(new)REGIMEN:Use peel once every two weeks (only have to use 1 packet now).  After using the peel,  I use a quality oil control astringent, and a light moisturizer. In between peels, I use a glycolic exfoliating wash every 2-3 days and this along with the Instant Peels have helped keep the dreaded acne at bay. I will also note that I have not had as much dead skin removal since the first time I used it.  My skin continues to look youthful and the acne marks/spots are lighter. My skin tone has evened out quite a bit especially near the jawline.  I love this stuff!  It really is amazing!  Yayyy :)"
1,"this mask makes my skin feel soft and smooth and clean and de-stressed.when my skin is being overly sensitive this mask clears my pores and relieves the skin irritations and inflamations that i generally experience from the abuse and over-use of beauty products that contain harsh and ""un-natural"" chemicals."
1,"Aveeno is the only brand I buy for my self ,  it is the best  for my skin.  I have tried other and it doesn't do as well."
1,I used this after I washed my face every morning and every night but I did not see a difference in my face complexion or textuer.
1,i have been using for about 13 years I always get compliments. love it. buy it. great investment. great everyday color.
1,This magical potion keeps my Jobst athletic socks from falling down during my 13 hour night shift.  I thank you.
0,"I was so hopeful about these. I wanted an alternative to tampons that was healthy and environmentally-friendly (and cheaper!) So I was excited to try them. But it wasn't at all what I was expecting. I don't want to get into vivid details. But basically, I was not warned that this would be such a MESSY ordeal. Not to mention it's not at all convenient. I do not want to leave it in for too long, because if I do, I know it's not absorbing any fluid, so I worry about leakage, or the horrible mess that it will make all over my hands when I try to take it out. GROSS! Also, the thing itself is absolutely huge. I imagine most people would look at it and be terrified to try to put it in their bodies. I believe there was a reason tampons became so much more popular than these methods. Sorry, but I've got to switch back."
1,I love this nail polish. It just just so pretty and in general I love all essie nail colors that go on so beautiful and they last.
1,This comb is great to de-tangle hair and combing out big curl's. The tortoise shell look is really nice If I need to will purchase again.
0,"Decided I would try this due to my allergies, asthma, eczema and sensitive skin. After using it to wash my hands, my skin was so dried out. My throat began to close, chest tighten and I had to take benadryl and albuterol to stop my reaction. I don't know what's in this, but I guess the chemicals were a no-no for me."
1,"This is the best cleansing oil free make up i used so far. It doesn't sting the eye and effectively remove water proof eyeliner and mascara unlike clinique or lancome. Plus, the price is very reasonable as well under $7 at my local supermarket. Again a must must buy for girls."
1,"I suppose everyones skin is different... But if you have dry skin year round like me, I definitely recommend you to try it! I've been using it for 2 months now, It makes my skin glow after it sets in. It also helps my foundation/bb cream go on smoothly and flawlessly. The smell is also very pleasant! (:"
1,"Hmm I ordered this and received it within three to four days i don't remember.. But anyways, I have been using this product for a week now and haven't seen no changes.. my nails are a little stronger but no different then they were before.. I use to bite my nails like crazy when I was in middle school, but now I'm 20 I don't bite them as often they're just short.. I hope I see progress soon or I'm going to be upset.. that this product was all hype smh..*Update on March 20,2013*I'm going to change my ratings on this to 4 stars because I've been using this product for over a month now, and people have been saying my nails look like they are french tipped! My nails are very strong and if they break it's just a little bit. But I do notice, as soon as remove the nail polish after a day one of my nails break or get real soft. So we'll see what happens..."
1,"Love the color! But face it, who wants to wear something on their lips that tastes & smells pretty bad? I have to put a strawberry clear gloss over it just to cover that up. But like I said, it is a very nice color though.. and looks different from the bottle color when it's on."
1,Smooths on nicely.  Is a little different than some other products I had used.  But it delivered the moisture relief I was looking for.  Scent is minimal-gone before it is completely absorbed-just the way I like it.  Delivered quickly once ordered.
0,A pain. Takes to long. Did not work as well as regular curlers. I tried and tried. Returned it. Egh
1,The smell is fantastic but I wished it was stronger and lasted longer; though maybe this would be good for someone who wants scented body wash but who are sensitive to overpowering scents. My husband even loves the smell. I was happy that there is a good amount of lather since most shampoos that are sulfate free do not have any lather. I even used it as a shampoo and it did not dry my hair out at all! I have since tried the tropical scent of this body wash and I prefer it more over the honey mango.
1,"As many other reviewers stated, I had a bit of peeling, which I expected.  However, it was only for the first few days and then my skin cleared up beautifully. (I only have minor skin blemishes with some clogged pores)."
1,I love this eyeliner it dries completely matte. The only thing is before it dries it goes on really watery & the brush makes it hard for me to get the perfect line so I have to be extra careful & take a little more time with my cat eye but overall I love the eyeliner it's super black and it stays on well.
0,got this for both my kids who chew their nails.  Both continued chewing away.  My daughter even said the taste is not enough to deter her from the bad habit.  Tried telling them there is a nasty ingredient in it.  That worked for like a day.
0,"I know this masque has a cult following in the beauty community, and that is what has inspired me to try it so many times over the years. My skin is very sensitive and while I have used dozens of other clay masques with no issues, the mint oil in this one sets my face on fire. I can't even keep it on for 60 seconds because it is so painful. There have been a few times where I toughed it out and ended up with red, angry, itchy, irritated skin that lasted for days afterwards. This has also caused me to break out, something I have never experienced with another masque. I think most people probably won't have any sort of reaction to this, but if you have sensitive skin I caution you to really think about whether this is a good product for you. At the very least, do a patch test before putting it over your whole face."
1,"Great product to help you calm your nerves and help you relax. I put some drops on my pillow, sheets, and under my nose before bedtime and it really helps me to relax and get ready to sleep. My dog also loves it. He falls right off to sleep as soon as I open the container. It lasts for a long time. I now have to try the diffuser."
0,"I used this a few times and my hair looked really dirty and greasy afterwards.  I wash my hair every other day, and if I use this, the following day my hair looks so greasy that I have to wash my hair a day early.  Perhaps my hair is just too fine. I prefer the Bumble and Bumble thickening spray; it also has the hydrolized protein in it as well."
1,"I'm not a regular user of ROC products, but I was running low on my usual night cream and just happened to notice that SAM's Club had this ROC Deep Wrinkle Night Cream in a double pack a few weeks ago for a very low price.  I wasn't familiar with the product, but figured that when I got home I could check with old faithful Amazon to see what the reviews were like.  My thought was that if it turned out to be a night cream that I didn't want to try on my face, that I could always use it on other areas such as neck, chest, hands, etc.After seeing positive reviews, I decided to give it a shot on my face as well as my neck.  I'm always a bit cynical when a product claims that you'll see specific improvement in a certain number of weeks.  I tend to assume that there is a different rate of improvement in a user who hasn't regularly used a quality skin cream in the past...as opposed to someone whose skin is already well-cared for with other night creams and such.  Frankly, I was also a bit concerned about the reviewers who mentioned extreme skin reddening and irritation.I only applied it to my neck the first night as a trial run to make sure I didn't end up with a red, swollen face in the morning.  Of course, a red swollen neck wouldn't have been too great either.  Anyhoo, no problems with that, so the next night I began using it on entire face and neck (avoiding immediate eye area).  While I used to consider my skin to be sensitive, either it has changed or else this particular cream contains nothing that really bothers it.I've actually been pleasantly surprised with the results.  While it's not going to become my favorite night cream due to texture and greasiness (don't get me wrong...it's not horrible, but I have other preferences), it does seem to make fine lines disappear or at least minimize them.  I don't have any deep wrinkles (yet), but based on the cream's performance with lesser lines, I would assume it would have some effectiveness on more defined wrinkles.So far I haven't experienced any of the redness, tingling, or swelling that was remarked upon by other reviewers.  I do question, however, if the disappearance of fine lines isn't in fact a bit of swelling or ""plumping out"" of the skin due to irritation.  As long as my face doesn't appear noticeably red or ""puffed,"" then I'm satisfied with the results and would probably use in the future...especially when I'm running low on my other favorites or am looking for a more economical skincare line to use."
1,"Silver shatter is ugly...I wouldn't purchase it again. I've tried it on light and dark colors, shimmery and flat, and it's just barely noticeable. It's not even a nice looking silver color, it looks like melted metal over your nail..."
1,"After all the glowing reviews I decided to purchase this and I am glad I did. It makes my face feel smooth and refreshed, and I love the smell."
1,"I'm very picky when it comes to fragrance. I love to wear it, but I don't want to leave it on others after a handshake or a hug. My fragrance needs to be subtle.I sample a lot of fragrance until I settle on one that I really love and right now, BRIGHT CRYSTAL is what I put on each morning.BRIGHT CRYSTAL is like standing in a flower garden on a warm spring day and having a slight breeze blow just a hint of the garden's aroma in your direction.I put on a few drops in the morning and BRIGHT CRYSTAL is with me all day.I can't fully describe a fragrance without including a very important aspect of the product--the bottle. BRIGHT CRYSTAL is a pink liquid that comes in a rectangular clear bottle with an oversized oval-cut &#8220;crystal&#8221; stopper. It looks nice on the counter.If you enjoy a light floral scent, I definitely recommend BRIGHT CRYSTAL by Versace."
1,"It worked really well at first, making pimples disappear in 2-3 days.  Now, it either works in 5-7 days, or does nothing.  Note:  It makes applied area shiny"
1,Loving  my Essie color First Dance such a beautiful red with very good quality of course always use a base coat for reds and dark colors to protect your nails from staining and a top coat to seal it and make it last even longer.
1,"It is a bit wider than I thought it would be but that's perfect. I also will mention some shave soaps I put inside don't allow the lid to fully close, but the soap should go down in a few uses and allow it to close properly. It is nice though =)"
1,"Over the past year I gradually replaced all the expensive, chemical-laden, brand-name cosmetics with simple and inexpensive organic beauty products. The skin gel was one of the first products that I bought and I am very happy with it. I apply it on my face and entire body as a toner/moisturizer after shower. A little goes a long way. Just a pea-sized drop can cover my face. It leaves a smooth, thin layer on my skin which dries quickly but locks in the moisture and tighten the pores. On top I put on some heavier lotion.I have combination skin that's acne prone. With regular night moisturizers, I often wake up to a layer of oil which makes me look like I just spread butter all over my face. It's the skin's own instinct to overproduce sebum to compensate loss of moisture. When I use the skin gel as a toner, however, in the morning I would see relaxed, well-moisturized skin."
0,"It can remove any regular make up however, you have to rub it out for waterproof make up. It leaves this gross oily feeling on your face that you can see. After wiping it off, I feel that my skin still has this oily residue. I was extremely displeased with this product because it does claim to be oil free but you can clearly see the separation between the oil and liquid prior to shaking. Overall it does work, it just leaves a icky oily feeling."
1,"I LOVE this product! For years, I was frustrated with lotions and hand creams, because most on the market are either greasy (like Shea butter) or contain alcohol. Alcohol products disinfect your skin, but they also dry it out--hence, you are constantly having to reapply the product to keep hands soft. Not so with Udderly Smooth!Originally designed as an udder cream for dairy farmers, this stuff is smooth, creamy and contains no alcohol. It takes a few moments to rub into your hands, legs, arms, heels or wherever to make skin silky smooth. I live in the high desert, so (especially in the wintertime) it's a challenge to keep my skin moisturized. This does the trick.Since it comes in a jar, ladies with long fingernails may find it a little tricky to access the cream without getting it under your nails. If you get the handy pump that fits the jar, it's even more convenient--just make sure you stir the lotion before trying to use it.For you crafty or ""green"" types, the jar is reusable. Just peel the plastic labels off the lid and sides, and then wash. You wind up with a pristine white container just the right size for storing paperclips, rubber bands, Q-tips, etc."
0,I was extremely disappointed in this microfiber hair towel.  It is too small to wrap around my head and wet hair after I shower.  It lacks the absorbancy to get the water out of my hair and it needs to be washed carefully.  Overall is this is an overpriced product.  A regular cotton terry cloth towel does a better job for far less money.  I feel suckered by the marketing on this.
1,"I don't know what caused my scalp to itch, but this took care of it.  I let the shampoo soak into my scalp while I shower so it has time to work.  I was worried about the small size of the bottle, but discovered a tiny bit goes a long way so it will last a while. The smell is slightly medicinal, but it's a small price to pay for relief.  The lather is thick and rich, and my hair feels soft after using it.  It doesn't dry it out, like some shampoos.  I'm happy with the purchase and would recommend it."
1,"I discovered this product about one year ago. I have oily, acne prone,and large pores. I tried everything from proactiv to other expensive acne products. Thankfully I came accross these pads and I haven't stopped using them ever since."
1,"This moisturizer is really good. It's just enough to keep zits at bay and aid in healing the ones that you already may have. It can dry out your skin if you use it too often, but once a day is perfect for this product."
1,I love to use these to spritz on before I put on make up and after. It seems to help hold my make up through the day. The size is so convenient and very hard to find in stores. It's also great to take one to the beach or pool to cool yourself off. Also good to wake children up with!
0,"I've got oily, acne prone skin and I'm constantly fighting clogged pores. This did absolutely nothing for me. Impurities were not removed, oils were not absorbed. It smells horribly like vodka and is very painful to &#34;peel&#34; (I don't have peach fuzz or any noticeable facial hair so I assume this is just from it pulling on my sensitive skin). Not my favorite freeman product."
1,"Love OPI nail polish and the rest of their product line. For everyday wear, this color is perfect. I have fair skin and when I wear this it blends in because it is a flesh tone. It is very natural looking yet it provides a subtle glow and covers nail imperfections in a snap. It lasts a long time and is chip resistant."
1,Great product and I use daily.
0,"Pros:Good for blush or bronzorCons:ScratchyDidn't retain shape after washingDoesn't deposit enough foundationThis came in the starter kit I got as a gift and it sucks. I only use it for blush, which it actually distributes well. It distributes the power foundation terribly. The only reason why it got a 2 is because it actually got softer after I washed it so it wasn't nearly as scratchy, but it did lose some of its shape: it became more fanned out and less dense."
1,"I use rose water for many things, including my bath water, DIY makeup setting spray, as well as a mist to moisturizer and refresh my face thru a hot day! This is the first time I have purchased this version rose water and I must say out of all the ones I have bought this is my favorite. The scent is light and beautiful and it does everything a rose water should do! You will not be wasting your money with this product."
0,I like putting on face lotion before I put my makeup on. This lotion just doesn't feel like it even moisturizes your face ): stopped using after one use
1,"I have two of Nars' powder blushes (in Orgasm and Mata Hari) and love them.  I recently read a book with makeup tips for aging women (I'm 39), and it said to use cream blushes for a ""dewier"" and younger look.  I picked up a few cream blushes, including Nars' cream blush in Penny Lane, and really do notice that the cream blushes don't sink into my dry patches or accentuate my fine lines the way that powder blushes do.As with the Nars power blushes I own, this cream blush is exceptionally pigmented and so you only need to use a small amount.  (Since the price on this is high, it's nice to know that it will last a long time!) I just use my clean fingers to tap it on and blend into my cheeks.  Occasionally I'll blend it out a bit with a kabuki brush, but using just my fingers is quick and easy -- and still works perfectly!As for the color I picked, Penny Lane is a light, sheer color that can be built up for more color.  I'm fair (in MAC makeup, my skin color is NW20) and it imparts a light, lovely flush that is perfect for the office.  It also lasts all day.If you like cream blushes, I also recommend Illamasqua's blushes and Tarte's cheek stains.  All three products leave you looking glowy and lit-from-within, as opposed to looking cakey and powdery."
1,"Adding this to my facial routine changed my skin for the better. It further cleans my pores of anything my face wash may have missed, plus it contains aloe -- a humectant -- which leaves your skin moisturized.Not to mention, you can't go wrong with rose-scented things.I've tried the lavender and wasn't impressed. This scent is the way to go."
1,"Love this color! it's a very pretty dark red color, kinda different than what i expected, but i am loving the color of it right now!"
0,"I wanted to try this product because I was looking for a non-ammonia permanent product. I have tried Naturcolor and Tints of Nature; both of these have strengths and weaknesses I won't discuss here. Anyhow this brand seemed to have a loyal following that extended for years, so I thought I would try it. It contains monoethanolomine which is still an ammonia but without a smell; it's still a toxic substance. The product had another type of smell which was like wet wool and not very pleasant. The gray didn't cover and the color came out too warm."
1,"Love the color, the shadow lasts all day in this color i dont remember having to re apply but with the darker shade like rapture i did. But thats ok, these are great shadows, pracey but i really like them."
1,"I've used Suave hair shampoo for ages. Suave Ocean Breeze, a newer version of regular Suave hair shampoo, does a great job when I use it to wash my hair in the shower. It is inexpensive and it gets my hair clean and fresh smelling. There is a scent to this shampoo but it will not overwhelm you--and it fights against any natural body odor that can occur throughout anyone's day as well. The 22.5 fluid ounce bottle is easy to hold onto even in the shower; and Suave also helps to make my rapidly thinning hair to stay its fullest.It's easy enough to use: just wet your hair, pour some on and scrub! It feels great and your head feels cleaner for it. Just like they say, it rids your hair of dirt and oil. The Vitamin E and sea algae extract help to cleanse your hair and freshen it. You may want to shampoo your hair twice for extra super-duper cleanliness; that's up to you. Like any soap, of course, avoid getting Suave shampoo in your eyes. It'll sting! I speak from experience.Of course, if you are allergic to any scents I would recommend that you use an unscented version of Suave hair shampoo or another unscented shampoo altogether.If you have any other questions about this product, the manufacturer offers customers both a website and a toll free number. That's good customer relations!Overall, if you want an inexpensive shampoo that is guaranteed to do the trick, Suave ocean breeze is IT. It is cheap and it really does a great job. Pick some up and try it today!"
0,I am still breaking out. I keep using until I run out. Not sure why I even purchased this. Thumbs down PCA
1,"This facial scrub is quite refreshing at first. I don't really enjoy the way you have to use it though. It is kind of a hassle trying to pick the right amount out of the little jar and adding some water and getting it on to your face in a timely/not so messy manner. The smell is alright, but afterwards there always seems to be a little bit of a residue left on my face, no matter how much I rinse it off again. Maybe it's just me but I don't find myself 'excited' to use this product. I love burt's bees products normally and I was a bit disappointed with this one."
1,"I LOVE the smell of this bath bomb! My only regret is that I only ordered one :-( I will deffinately be ordering LOTS more! It leaves your skin silky smooth with a HEAVENLY scent that lasts & lasts & lasts! You won't be disapointed, I promise!!"
1,"I decided to try this because I wanted to be ""pro-active"" with the new lines on my forehead and between my eyes.I used it for every night for 30 days and now every other night and there are NO lines between eyes and faint lines on my forehead.I use it every other night now.It really does work, give it a month every night and you will see a difference too!"
1,"I love OPI products, but since the color is unusual, I love it even more! It is bright and summery in these wintery months!"
1,"I was told to start using SPF 30 so my skin will last beautifully another 30 years. I have to begin protecting from the sun, as I previously didn't do that. I had no idea what to get. This came in a double pack with a pump-nozzle. It gives just the right amount and I have them handy where I can get to them easy and fast. Really moisturizes and protects the skin, stops itching and dry skin and I feel like this was the right choice."
0,"It's very nice that this is chemical free and all that, but what good is it if it does not do what it is supposed to which is remove nail polish... rubbed and rubbed for about 10 minutes, even pre-soaked... horrible product!!!"
1,I found this perfume oil in a store called Success Express in NJ when I was visiting family one year.  I absolutely love it!! It's warm and soft with a light scent that isn't over powering or headache inducing.  I recently ran out and my Mom sent me a package with a bottle in it as a surprise.  I was so happy to have more...I've been milking my last bottle.  I highly recommend trying this product or any other auric blends product.  Very good quality for a good price.
1,"This toner has been really good to my skin so far! I am already noticing some improvement to my skin tone and that breakouts are healing faster. Witch hazel is very good for your skin, plus this stuff smells really nice! Very light scent but it's rosey and wonderful. I have never liked using toners because they always smell weird or they make my face feel like there's a film on it.. This stuff feels really clean and amazing!"
1,"I'd been searching for something I could use on my face to cut down the oil product. My nose and forehead areas get SO oily that it makes makeup impossible. I shine so brightly with or without makeup that it got to be a problem and I wanted to find a way to cut that down. I saw all the great reviews that were posted on amazon and I actually found it at my local drug store on sale. Score one for me!Yes, it cleans very well. It also makes my skin so smooth. I love the feeling after I've washed my face. The problem? Didn't cut down my oil production at all. I'm still just as shiny as I've ever been so this didn't help me one bit. I also noticed that when I began using it, I broke out. I guess my skin needed to get used to it so I continued for about 2 weeks and I was still getting new bumps just as fast as old ones went away. I stopped using it and went back to my old face wash, I cleared up, then went back to this and broke out again, except it wasn't as bad.I will try again in the future and hope for the best, but for now, I'm going back to my old face wash and will just pat the shiny areas dry as often as I can think about it."
1,"This moisturizes my skin well without making it oily or making me break out. But it's not heavy-duty, so I recommend having a more intensive moisturizer on hand to use once a week or so to really keep your skin from getting flaky."
1,"This stuff is like lip balm but for your cuticles. It comes in a small pot, but you only need the tiniest amount for your fingers. I have only had this for a week, but I am in love. It smells good, and is much cheaper than lemony flutter and they are basically the same thing. I feel like my cuticles are super moisturized and soft. I only apply this once a day, and they stay hydrated all day. I don't have to worry about reapplying like crazy (I will also use cuticle oil once a day to help prevent dryness). Overall, I am super happy and would definitely recommend. Especially if you like doing your nails a lot ( like me)."
1,"I have tried lots of cover/concealer products, some costing 20x (seriously) more.  I keep coming back to Maybelline cover sticks because they really cover and coneal without settling into wrinkles."
1,"I wanted to like this body wash. I really did. The price was right, and I thought the product would be natural enough for me. Apparently not.Immediately upon opening the box, I could smell the perfume. The bottles weren't leaking at all, either. So, very strong scent. Now, let's be clear: I AM mildly sensitive to chemicals and perfumes, but I can't recall ever sneezing uncontrollably to anything NATURAL. I use essential oils all the time (which have strong scents, though natural), as well as heavily scented natural products. Never a problem there. This made me sneeze like crazy when I used it. That's not a desirable effect in a shower, with hard surfaces to knock one's head on when you're flailing like, well, a person who is sneezing like crazy. It's especially not good for someone who recently had hip surgery (no, people, I'm actually only 27) because sneezing can make you nearly fall over in a slippery shower, especially when you're already unsteady. When I first got this (before surgery) it was still making me sneeze a week later. I thought *Hmm, that might fade. I might get acclimated to it. I'd better give it a good go, since I bought so much of it!* I bought this in November. It is now April. I have NOT acclimated to it. Still sneezing, and it's from this product. I know because I've made brief switches to other products (Burt's Bees, African Black bar soaps, castile soap) and haven't sneezed. Then I use this again. I shower, sneeze my brains out, hope I don't crack my head or fall, almost do, and kick myself for buying this. I'm not exaggerating; the sneezing fits are really quite extraordinary. I leave the door unlocked so my husband can rescue me in the event of a sneezing catastrophe. But, well... at least you know it lasts a long time!? I wish it didn't. Why am I still using it? ""Waste not, want not"", with a caveat: ""Hope you don't die in the shower.""There is definitely a chemical smell to this. Lavender? HA! One of my favorite essential oils to use is Lavender. This is NOT LAVENDER! It smells (to me) like a chemical re-creation of lavender. A very poor one.It does have its merits, however. What I can say for the wash is this: A couple of pumps does the job rather well, though I'm petite, so you may need a few more. It lathers well for a not-so-conventional, wants-to-be-""natural"" body wash. It makes you feel clean without drying, yet doesn't make you feel over-moisturized or coated in something like super-moisturizing washes do. It also hasn't caused any skin irritation, which is a miracle for me, considering my reaction to the scent, and sensitive skin. The product is a good value, if your body doesn't give you violent reactions to it. So, three stars. I'm trying to be fair.Given the cleansing performance of this product, some (curious or self-destructive) part of me is tempted to try the tea tree. I love tea tree almost as much as lavender. But since this smells like chemical NOT-lavender, I'm afraid of what the tea tree would smell like/do. Perhaps it will make my eyeballs bleed and fall out? Okay, I'm kidding about my eyeballs. But I wouldn't buy this product again. If there is an unscented version, I might try a sample to see if it makes me react. Otherwise, when I'm done with this, I shall steer clear of the body wash of doom."
1,"I have used this product for a couple years. It exfoliates without drying out the skin. One tube lasts a long time, too. It is far less expensive than department store brands and just as good."
1,I have always loved using Olay.  I have to be careful on what goes on my skin.  I have very sensitive skin.  I use this product and have for a long time.  It is very light on your skin and it doesn't break me out.  I would recommend it to anyone that is sensitive to beauty products.
1,"I dont know how i survived so long without this cream! I have combination skin (a very oily t-zone and dry cheeks) and Complex 15 balances everything out. It sinks right, and almost feels like I'm giving my face a drink of water...my oily t-zone is controlled and my entire face is baby soft. I still have bottles of expensive cream in my cabinet that I wont go near...I'll be a Complex 15 girl for life. TRY THIS STUFF!"
1,"As a homeschooling mom of young children and basically living on a farm, my naturally dry, calloused hands are constantly being washed or are in water.  This, of course, makes them even dryer.  In the winter, they are almost unbearable. I started using a pure, heavy shea butter with good results but I wanted to try something new.  After reading reviews, I settled on this stuff.  It takes time to work in and I feel like my hands are greasy for a little bit afterwards (hense the 4 stars and not 5, I would give a 4 1/2) so I just started using it before bed (without gloves).  When I wake up in the morning, my hands both look and feel like they've not worked in a week or more. Of course my day defies the results but I just add again at night and its worth the application.  I really appreciate this stuff and highly recommend it (negatives aside).  Because I work hard all day and my hands take the toll, Badger Balm really makes my hands soft at the end of the day and that makes me feel feminine.One more thing: because it has a mild mint smell (which my husband truly hates) I'm looking forward to using the unscented. I wouldn't expect anything but awesomeness."
1,"This product works wonders!, it revitilizes and re builds hair! I used a flat iron to activate the product. It turned my rough,parched and kinky hair into silk! Without any other product used! I highly recomend this wonder! Its magic!! Great seller! Shipped fast! A++"
1,"The easiest curler I have ever had, once got used to rod instead of clip to hold clamp I like it better I used to burn my thumb when in a hurry with small clip on clamps.  I am much safer with rod clamp.  Does a great job with big full curls"
0,"My hair type, very fine.  Was damaged after using this product.  It might work for others."
0,It kills my toes.  Had it on for about 30 seconds.  Waste of money.  Don't do it! Ugg Ugg Ugg
1,I has been using this mascara for years. It is very easy to apply and does not bother my eyes at all. Remove with a little baby oil It makes your eyes really big.  I have tried other mascaras but always come back to this one
1,"I love this mascara and have been using it for years. I try other brands and types and always go back to this natural looking mascara.Cons: Won't lengthen your lashes enough to look like falsies, and doesn't build up super thick.  If you have naturally longer lashes that simply fade away because they're too pale, this won't be a big deal.  If you have short lashes, this one won't give you much help.Pros: Darkens the lashes and thickens the thin tips so they're more noticeable, without any clumps and very little flaking. If you have weepy eyes or cry easily, you'll absolutely want the waterproof kind, since this version washes off super easy.  But, I've never had raccoon eyes from a little rain.This mascara doesn't clump up as quickly in the tube as other brands and types. It goes on as smoothly on day one as it does after 6 months when it's due for replacement.If you prefer your makeup more natural looking and less obvious, this mascara is a very good inexpensive choice.  The ""black-brown"" is so close to black that it's impossible to tell them apart on the lashes, so if one is cheaper, don't worry that it won't be dark enough."
1,"Moisturizes, heals the cracked cuticle, not mentioning the smell IT IS LEMON REFRESHING SCENT!!!!!!! it will make your nails and cuticle look healthy and beautiful and clean absolutely great product"
0,"I have thin, fine, very straight hair. I had hoped after reading some of the other reviews that this hairsetter would be helpful.What I discovered was this product is difficult to use and time consuming. I thought I could set my hair then do my make up while the rollers cooled.The rollers are easy enough, but the caps are a real bear to clip on the roller so that they actually hold. The clips do no fit on easily and the roller keep falling out.If I want to use this I must plan extra time---a LOT of extra time. The up side would be I'd be using steam to set my hair rather than a hot, dry curling iron and I liked that idea.Since I bought it and unwrapped it to use, I have it, so I'll try again. But, not excited about it."
1,"I normally use this product during the Summer,but was running low and needed to stock up ...Either Aveeno has changed their formula ormaybe because I've reached the age of 50, myskin has less oil on the surface, but I'm finding Idon't need to use much of this product duringthe Winter ...Twice a week is about all it takes,whereas during the Summer, every other day."
0,"Good 4 house hold ,but not for the skin.What u pay is what u get"
1,"this is the only body wash or soap i can use on my ""female parts"" without irritation. also it lathers very well, and does not dry out my skin. a bit expensive for me but worth it."
1,Good natural looking bronzer that blends well. Doesn't really have much shimmer to it but can really be spiced up with some good highlighter on top of it.
1,This fragrance is lusciously beautiful without being too overwhelmingly musky or floral. I wear this one often for work and never fail to get compliments. Just makes me feel classy and expensive. Amazon also offers a great price on this one.
1,"You know, I was watching GILMORE GIRLS the other night and really loved the way that Lorelei was wearing her hair.  I wondered how she did that.Well, I happened to be in CVS today and saw this triple barrel waving iron and I was thrilled.  I figured that it would achieve the look I was eager to try.I have already been completely amazed at the VS volumizing line of products for hair which accomplish what NO OTHER HAIR CARE SYSTEM OF ANY PRICE HAS BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH EVER.Well, let me tell you.  When you combine the VS volumizing line of products with this amazing iron, the results are nothing short of SPECTACULAR. (if you use the products, let the company know, they are thinking of discontinuing them, because of lousy advertising-hardly anyone knows how amazing they are)Baby fine hair is what I have.  After using the combination of the hair products and this three barrel waver iron, I look like I just got a perm and have thick hair.  And it stays like that all day, in fact so far up to three days without rewaving.The iron is easy to use.  Because it only does a single layer of hair at a time, you do not need to leave it in as long as a curling iron.  10-15 seconds and you are able to move on to another part of the hair.  To do my complete hair, it is 10 -15 minutes tops.There are two heat settings.  Either setting is fine.I can not rave about this iron enough, and the VS products which make it work especially well with thin fine hair."
1,"Mascara - I've tried them all. Expensive, cheap, special brush, thickening, lengthening.... And what I've discovered is  mascara is mascara. Maybelline Great Lash does the job as well as any other product. It lasts all day and washes off with soap and water only.  It's not too clumpy, and the price is right. I like this mascara, and it's a rare occurrence now that I'm ever tempted to buy any other brand."
1,"I love the smell, and it did make me fall asleep fast. I had trouble to fall asleep on time, and tried melatonin or sleeping water. But this one is the best! I just put some under my nose and on temples, it only took about half one hour to get me into sleep. The smell was very pleasant, and do not feel anything bad when get up."
1,"I was looking for an olive green and this was really close, maybe a slight bit off of what I had pictured but still a beautiful color"
1,Love love LOVE this soap. Smells amazing and it is truly a unique smell. I feel like this soap lasts longer than foam soap as well. I buy it by the case and frequently give away! I can't imagine ever not having this around the house!
0,dry skin... good for normal acne but not to severe acne people.... recommend to see doctor and have acutane pill..
1,"Not my fav but will continue to use. The bristles on this brush are just too short for the volume of my hair. I have tons of thick corse hair and this only gets to about 2/3 of it, I rarely reach my scalp w/ it unless I divide my hair in half. It is not too rough which I like but again I would not recommend for those out there w/ tons of hair like myself."
1,"I used to us BareMinerals Medium Beige for a long time and it did help lessen break outs and keep my skin looking clear. I then tried the new matte version of B.M. and disliked it. It made my face look chalky and rested in my fine lines. I then switched to Silk Naturals brand and I used it the past 2 years. I recently bought B.M. at Sephora to try again and I was dissatisfied.Pros: I like the packaging, ease of washing off makeup, hardly any residue, keeps my skin clear & blemish free, light airy feel, natural ingredientsCons: I makes my face look oily on T-zone after 5 hours, does nothing for redness on my noseOverall: Silk Naturals is better, I can customize my shade, covers better & reduces redness, is all natural and doesn't make my face look oily even after I wear it 10 hours! It is slightly harder to wash off but that is ok since it has everything else I'm looking for."
1,"My face feels softer than before but it's not a miracle worker like some reviews seem to gush. The first time you use it, you feel the difference more. Good prices on Amazon especially if you do the subscribe and save."
1,Leaves a cooling sensation after applied. I use it morning and night and no issues with contacts either. You use very little so it lasts a long time.
1,this smells good and is good for serious relaxation therapy but if you use too much it can be overwhelming
1,"Bought this to cover up the slight sparseness of the part in my hair,Have bought others, but this is the most natural looking, by far."
0,"Chalky,Not Pigmented,Wears off easily,Not a Coastal Scents Dupe,Too many highlighter colors,Does not show up on dark skinned women.I would not recommend.The coastal scents is currently on sale. It's worth the few extra bucks."
1,Well actually I don't use it. I buy if for my kids and my husband. And none of their hair looks greasy so I guess it cleans.... It smells good too!
1,I've used this product before and I like it cause it has a strengthener which I need for my nails.
1,"Love these blotting papers - they work amazingly well!  I've used a number of different brands (blotting papers are a must have for me, otherwise my face turns into a disco ball mid-day) and these are by far the best I've ever used.  I like that there's no transfer of residue, since powder coated blotting papers can make you're skin look blotchy, and that they really do pick up a ton of oil for a shine free look.  Make-up for the most part remains undisturbed so long as you 'pat' (don't rub).  The Top Care Brand is the other blotter sheets that I carry when I find them in stores and they're nearly identical in ingredients and packaging, except they run about a $1 less.Not that I've seen anyone complain about this on Amazon, but every now and then you'll find a review on Makeupalley where someone gets all in a tizzy over 'mineral oil' being one of the listed ingredients.  I'm quite certain that these sheets do not contain mineral oil in the sense that they've been 'coated' with oil.  The sheets themselves are polypropylene based (plastic) as opposed to traditional paper blotting papers and I believe the mineral oil is one of the ingredients in the manufacturing of these plastic sheets (just as oil is often used in the manufacturing of other 'plastics').  Just as one wouldn't worry about a plastic water bottle leaving an oily residue in their beverage, I wouldn't worry about the mineral oil used in making these sheets leeching out onto your skin.  These sheets have never caused me to break out - highly recommend!"
1,"I have oily skin in the summer and dry in the winter and this product is perfect for both! Cleanses without drying your skin out; you wont feel like you just had a face lift because your skin is so tight. I probably wouldnt recommend this product to someone with oily, teenage skin. May not be enough cleansing. Being 30, this has worked perfectly. My favorite thing about it is that it removes mascara (not waterproof mascara though)! One stop cleansing and make up removal!"
1,top of the line in company and in products for i always like to have some cosmetic products to help bring out my best attributes.
1,"I have type 3b/3c hair with high porosity.  It is fine, but I have a lot of it and it frizzes terribly without product.  I live in a humid climate (DC) and I need a gel that can really keep my hair looking nice.  I first started using this gel in 2000, when I grew out a relaxer.  It worked well for me, but always mixed with another gel to weigh my hair down a bit (I like to reduce curl, not enhance).  I stopped using Climate Control in 2006, when I decided to do a Japanese treatment to straighten my hair.  Beginning in 2009, I grew out the TR and finally cut off all my relaxed hair last month.  So I'm a long time user of Ouidad Climate Control who went back to it due to a return to curly hair.Ouidad Climate Control helps my hair handle humidity.  But I still get some frizz by the end of the day.  I find that it isn't a good stand alone gel, as it doesn't give me the definition I like.  I like to use it in conjunction with another gel so that I get well defined curls - these days, it's LA Looks Sport Gel.  So I will use a leave-in conditioner in the shower, seal with coconut, apply the Ouidad Climate Control and THEN apply the LA Looks for definition.  When I use the Ouidad on its own, I tend to get stringlets and they get really crunchy.  This way, I can use just enough gel for the humidity benefit but get my definition elsewhere.Overall, this is a good gel.  At least for me, it doesn't work on its own as a curl definer.  Also, if you follow the Curly Girl method, be aware that there is a non-water soluble silicone towards the bottom of the ingredient list (dimethicone).  I do follow Curly Girl, but I modify it by shampooing with a non-sulfate shampoo on occasion to avoide cone buildup.  For those who are protein sensitive, this gel isn't for you either.2013 UPDATE:  After some time using the Curly Girl method (no sulfates, no silicones) I am back to using this product.  Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition is no longer silicone free.  Ever since then, the Curly Girl method has been a flop.  I couldn't find another conditioner that gave me good results and I was struggling with frizz.  After a lot of experimenting, I decided to give Ouidad Gels another look.  I tried both the Climate Control and the Curl Quencher.  Climate Control is a great gel for me.  I find that 2 parts Climate Control and 1 part LA Looks Sports Gel is perfect for my tightly curled hair.  It really eliminates frizz, isn't too crunchy, and gives me great curl formation.  I also highly recommend the Ouidad Moisture Lock Leave-in Conditioner."
0,"PRODUCT HAS PARABEN IN IT. PARABENS ARE LINKED TO OPENING THE BODY TO CANCER, PER ONCOLOGISTS. DO NOT USE ANY PRODUCTS WITH PARABENS. SHAME ON NEUTROGENA FOR USING PARABENS!"
1,"I""ve been using this on my hair it seem to be working. The smell is heavenly. I bought the shampoo and conditioner so I would get the full effect but my hair deffinately seem to be getting stronger with continued use."
1,"This def gets your face clean and minimizes breakouts. You also get a lot of bang for your buck. It may leave your face a little dry but that's why you use moisturizer. Yes, the smell is strong when you're using it but it goes away after you rinse it off. It's not like your face will smell like tea tree oil all day. Great product."
1,"I love this lotion - it's the only kind that works well with my sensitive skin, and it doesn't cause any breakouts. I would definitely recommend this for people with acne."
1,I prefer the body buf-puf for my face as this is much gentler than what I had even though I'm sure dermatologists would recommend a much softer scrub.
1,"In my search for better hair I have purchased more and more expensive shampoos, conditioners and styling products.  God forbid the hairdressing shop have a new product in that I don't have also on my shelves.When my old hairdryer died I happily purchased another one from Amazon, this brush was a tag-a-long product and cost almost nothing.  What is another six dollars in the quest for good hair?  Well, I love this brush.  It does not tangle wet or dry hair, does not frizz my dry hair when I use it, and helps style when I blow dry.The best six dollar investment in styling tools that I have ever made.Also highly recommend my new dryerConair  225RX 1875 Watt Comfort Touch Tourmaline Ceramic Styling Dryer, BlackHappy Styling!"
1,I bought this because it is water-free and organic.  Water-free lotion is so much better.  You don't have to use as much and it lasts and doesn't evaporate like cheap water based lotions.  The smell is wonderful.  Highly recommend and will buy again.
0,"Ok, i love aveeno products but this is a total FAIL!! And a waste of $$ for that matter. I'm on a budget, and i was looking for something budget-friendly from a drug store. After all the hype about this product, i decided to give it a try. First of all, the scent was overbearing, too greasy, my skin is combination/oily, and this made it worse!! I was extremely oily all day even make-up didn't help. I also developed a rash on my T-zone. I'm a very patient person so i stuck with it for a month before dumping it! Started using St.ives and so happy with the results not to mention the price is 2 less for what i paid for this junk! Too bad i won't get my hard earned $$ back!"
1,"This is the first fragrance by Prada that I love, I think its perfect and I cant wait to see it in a gift set."
1,"wonderful, I can feel it working.  Rated #1 with consumer reports above all the high priced lotions & potions"
1,This worked very well for me.  I am so bummed that they stopped offering it.  I don't like the new formula as much.
1,"There is comfort in the scent of lemon. Perhaps it reminds us of summer days and lemon meringue pie or the simple pleasures of zesting a lemon. This formula also contains rosemary oil and eucalyptus.Ingredients: Sea salt, baking soda, lemon oil, rosemary oil, eucalyptus oil, vitamin E.This bath salt will help your body to release lactic acid that builds up when you exercise, so it is perfect for relaxation and for easing muscle aches. The essential oils penetrate to relieve soreness.Add the crystals when you start filling the tub so they have time to dissolve.~The Rebecca Review"
1,It helped made my pores smaller and make my face looked more clean. The mask does really dries out my face so I would have to use a good amount of moisturizer after. Another con is that it leaves a weird smell. It lingers for a couple of hours but you get use to it. I would recommend this mask to anyone who wants to have a clearer face and would use it maybe once per 1-2 weeks depending on how dry your skin easily gets. My skin is combination and once per week is enough for me. I don't really use it frequently as before now because it takes a while to squeeze it out of the tube and slather over your face evenly.
1,"This is a good over-the-counter balancing cream. I like that it's a bit more creamy than some of the other brands that I've tried. If you are needing a bit of hormone addition to stave off some of the symptoms of menopause this is a good product. As I had a hysterectomy, my doctor switched me over to a stronger dose made by a local compounding pharmacy. But this did work for me well when I was using it."
1,Lemon freshness I used this in oil burners and in my homemade soy candles and this worked very well smells real lemons
1,"A tiny bit of this stuff goes a long way, and it smells great. Comes packed in a very compact case, making it easy to store, as well. Definitely worthwhile to buy a case and not worry about it for a very long time."
1,"I've already have this product and ordered it in January. I decided to come online and write about how well its working and I plan to order more soon! I am a dark skinned african american women and have had discoloration on my face for years until I began to use this product. I only use this product, suncreen, along with carbolic soap and have seen a DRASTIC improvement. I was scared this would burn my skin or make me itch because I suffer from eczema and tend to have sensitive skin but no problems whatsoever! :)"
0,"While this may work on your skin issues, it will RUIN your towels and sheets that aren't white.  The benzol peroxide ingredient seeps into your skin and ruins towels, sheets, pillowcases, and clothes - left our gray towels blotched with pink and purple spots and ruined our sheets.Definitely recommend trying a product with salicylic acid instead - same results, no damage to your linens."
1,I have used this product for many years and it is excellent. The other reviews on this product do a much better job than I ever could of describing the good things about it but all I can say is -- it works!
1,"I love this color it's very feminine and sweet. Package arrived quickly. Just a tip though - if you do more than one coat be sure to let that coat dry really well otherwise you'll end up smudging it, however once it's dry, it dries completely."
1,"Totally awesome product.  It dries hard and you can see all the oils that it sucked out of your black heads.  But oh my goodness it is waaaaaaaaay overpriced here on Amazon.  I always assume that Amazon has it for the best price, and I just saw it at Wally World for a fraction of a fraction of the cost.  Come on Amazon, get with it!"
1,"Pros:1. Not damaging to the hair.  Unlike hot iron or hot curlers, this product use steam/moisture in the curler sponge to curl the hair, which is great for everyday use.2. Multiple sizes and sufficient number of curler for a wide variety of hairstyle.3. Create beautiful waves effectively.Cons:1. The shield leaves an unsightly straight dent on the hair.2. The curls do not actually stays for days if you don't use styling hair products to hold the look.3. The time instruction to put curlers on the steamer is very vague in the styling book.After consulting several YouTube tutorial videos, con #1 is resolved by replacing the plastic shield with the double thong clips.  For con #2, however, the curls do look great for 5-6 hours but will start to look tired later in the afternoon if I didn't apply any styling foam on my hair before I curl it.  I am still experimenting with issue #3.Anyway, I really like this product and I am using it every morning.  It only takes about 5 minutes to put the curlers on then I can go on to prepare breakfast among other chores.  I take them off right before I leave home and quickly style it with fingers.  Viola!"
1,I like it.  I definately love the smell of the mint.  You keep it on until it drys.  Use a washcloth to wipe it off.
1,"I love this shower gel, it smells so good when your showering with it. You feel real clean and refreshed when you finish showering. I plan to buy 2 more bottles, one for me and one for my daughter. If you like the scent of cinnamon, you can't go wrong buying this shower get."
0,"I've been using Clairol Natural Instincts hair coloring for years and years and years and have always loved it. Until now. The new formula smells awful, has a thick gloopy consistency that is so heavy it droops and drops everywhere and leaves stains on the counter/floor that are nearly impossible to get out. And for all that torture, the new formula takes twice as much to do the job and the color starts looking dull almost immediately after just a couple of washes. Plus it's terribly drying to my hair whereas the old formula and conditioner had a nice softening effect.I've always avoided having permanent hair coloring done at the salon because of the ammonia and damage it does to hair over time. But after just a few tries with the new Natural Instincts, I would rather do permanent coloring at the salon or even just go totally natural (i.e. gray). Either would be far far better than the torture and bad results from the new Natural Instincts. If anyone has suggestions for temporary hair color solutions to replace Natural Instincts, I would so appreciate a tip via the comments.Clairol, what were you thinking? You seriously need some help in both R&D; and QA. :-("
1,"I seen girls with this color and thought it was pretty, but when I got it I didn't really like the color. I'm really pale so I think that's why I don't like it. I honestly think it's kind of hard to see, on me at least. So if you're a bit pale I wouldn't recommend this color. But it is very pretty!"
1,"I first purchased this hand treatment from a garden center - what a favorite it has become. I really does help restore your hands after digging in the garden (or washing dishes in the sink, if you're old-fashioned like me). I have purchased many as gifts for others. This size (100g) is a generous tube and will last a long time. I gave it four stars only because it is more expensive here than at the Crabtree & Evelyn outlet store - or maybe I just got lucky when I visited that store last time. Truth is, I'll buy it wherever I can find it."
1,"It is an ok choice - there isn't any burning with this product, but I would buy it again.  probably"
1,"I applied this item as directed and it worked great everywhere -- except my cheeks, where it caused burning, irritation, and a very visible rash. My skin is not super sensitive and I've never once had a reaction to a moisturizer/sun screen before. I would STRONGLY suggest testing on a small area unless you're okay with risking walking around with a nasty rash for a couple of days. I have tried it again and it always burns in the same area but is fine everywhere else, not sure why.I understand that reactions vary by individuals, so I didn't think it would be fair to give this item one star. I don't believe it's the product's fault that my skin couldn't handle it, and like I said, it did work well everywhere else. I ordered other Olay products at the same time as this and have used them without incident."
1,"I can't tell you how much this product saved me from damaged hair and hundreds and hundreds of dollars and time going to the salon. I tried getting highlights at the salon but I could barely tell and my hair was fried, brittle and fell off.I have used Sun-In for 10 years and it is literally incredible. I have medium brown hair that looks like pencil led. With Sun-In all throughout my hair I have golden to platinum blonde hair and have had my whole life. My hair was blonde during childhood. During adolescents it got darker. Sun-In makes my hair shiner and the day after I use it, I have a GOOD hair day. It does take time to sit and use a hair dryer but beats going to the salon and paying $70!! In the summer it is super easy when you are out at the pool.This product is my favorite product of all time THANK YOU SUN-IN"
1,"Very dry skin causes me to itch. Lotion takes care of the body but conditioner on the hair or conditioner shampoo products still leave my scalp dry. Used this product and the sensation of an itch on my scalp went away by about 80%. After a week, my scalp does not itch. Using regular shampoo again brings back the itch after a few days and then I use the T-gel again. The only downside is that hair that has been colored will lose its color. The T-gel also makes the hair dry and you have to take care if your combing it damp. When the hair dries, it is very soft. My naturally curly hair is curlier after using T-gel. Not having an itchy head is worth any downside."
0,"not sure what i benefited from this product - i do not know what this product did for my hair, so i would not purchase again"
1,"I live down in Florida and the sun is scorching here so I need a suncreen for my sensitive skin that really does its job well without interfering with the skin's business.A friend recommended this product to me and I bought it at a drug store right away but I was a bit skeptical, knowing  that I haven't really found the perfect sunscreen even after trying nearly a dozen sunscreen brands.So after trying this product for a couple of weeks, here are my thoughts about it:Pros:> Adequate protection from sunburn.> Doesn't hurt the skin.> Doesn't clog pores.> The packaging is sleek and is small enough to be portable.Cons:> Greasy, doesn't have a matte finish.> Not that resistant to sweating, forms white rivulets with the sweat after a period of intense heat.> Gives a white sheen upon application that is eerily visible in certain lighting conditions. (I am a bit tan and I found it quite disturbing, its like I had ""wearing sunscreen"" written on my forehead.)All in all, I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone, despite the pros. I just didn't like it."
1,"This cream is light and non oily. It smells like an open lavender field and also it is very good for moisturization. The cream is simply divine and beautiful, using it makes your skin very pretty...Will order again when I am out"
0,Just average.  Nothing special about this product for me. But I guess at 52 I need to stop hoping for miracles.
1,My boss recommended this liner to me last year and I have used it religiously ever since. I work in the Spa/Salon industry and my outward appearance matters. I have really oily eyelids and have tried hundreds of different liners over the years- this one has the pigment and staying power I need.
1,but it is getting difficult to obtain.  my subscribe and save for this item has now been cancelled.  I get so many compliments on this color.
1,Been using this brush for a few months now and it works amazingly....it really gets out the tiny shed hair from my coily mane and distributes product amazingly....
1,I had a Revlon hairsetter just like this one for several years when it finally quit. I was very happy to find an exact match to the one I used to have on Amazon. I ordered it immediately and it's a keeper. Works great. Does the job.
1,"This is the best nude nail polish I have ever worn. I picked it out on a whim at the salon, and fell so much in love that I went and bought myself a bottle. I'm on my second bottle of Dulce de Leche now."
1,"I've tried using individual lashes a few times and these look the most natural because they are knot-free. If you have the time and patience to put on individual lashes, I would recommend these and a dark toned individual lash adhesive like Ardell."
0,"It's HUGE!  It was described as more of a travel dryer, but it's way too big to put in a suitcase, and too expensive for quality, cheap looking plastic."
0,"Let me start off this review by saying that I am basing my rating on how it works as a hairspray, not on how ""natural"" it is. I gave it two stars because it smells nice and it's probably a little better than using nothing, but I'm sitting here only 4 hours after curling my hair and I have almost completely straight strands.I live in a dry climate, so humidity wasn't the issue. My hair does lose curl pretty fast though. I'd say it's worth a try if your hair ""likes"" being styled/curled, but if you need something for stubborn hair, this isn't it."
1,"I mostly use this under eyes, and it has a weird kind of pasty/oily texture that has to be blended down, then it dries to a sheer film. It does stay put forever, tho, which is great, but I think it may be a tad too dry for undereyes. I have used it on bruises , and it covers pretty good.Also it is super concentrated, this little tube should last forever!"
1,"I've used this product for several years, and I love it. It smalles wonderful, it rinses clean, unlike some other body washes that I've used that leave residue. It's also not too drying, which is good, because my skin dries out really easily.During the summer, though, I tend to get blemishes on my shoulders and chest, and I've switched to the Neutrogena Body Scrub, which I find deals with acne a little better. It comes in an identical bottle to this, and has some exfoliating beads in it as well. If you don't have to wory about bodily acne, this is a great product."
1,"I'm really enjoying these unscented bars so far. Doesn't seem to be pore clogging, lathers well, cleans well and rinses well. No itching after."
0,"It's a bit much for a dog, I should think, for a shampoo to smell so, so much like perfume."
1,Best nail polish ever! I love this nail polish! It is the perfect nude shade and it is such a long lasting color!
1,This is a refreshing toner to use in the morning. Makes skin feel clear and bright. This toner does not make me break out or cause my skin to dry out.  And you only need a little to spread about your face. I like that the top is a squirt top so only a little comes out at a time. That way you can avoid accidentally spilling some. If you do need more you can just squeeze the bottle.The scent is unique and is not my favorite thing in the world. But it wears off quickly and is not that strong.I will make this a normal part of my skin care routine!
1,"This is a great product to use if you at all suffer from any dry skin or skin irritations. If you find yourself washing your hands all day, use this one and you won't feel like you're washing away all of your skin's natural protection. I've occasionally used it to wash my face, and it does a complete job of removing my make-up without leaving it red and irritated. Definitely worth a try if bar-soaps have disappointed you before!"
1,for a couple years i have been purchasing this oil of olay moisturizer for around 25 dollars at cvs and am amazed to find it at amazon for around 10 dollars...wow...now i can use it on my chest and hands in addition to my face and neck...
1,"I live in a very hot and humid area, and this hairspray works great for keeping my wavy hair from turning into a giant, frizzy mess. It has a pretty natural look and feel to it, and it just has a clean, herbal scent to it. I'm not incredibly picky about my hairspray, and I really don't use it a whole lot. It keeps my hair from frizzing up around my face when I wear it up, which is really the only thing I need it for."
1,"Can we say it all together: Heavenly!The color is fantastic, it reminds me a little to Kevin Aucoin's FIRA. A blend of orange and red. A little goes a long way and it glides beautifully on the skin.Higly recommend."
1,With two coats of this fun shimmer you get a nice pearl effect.  The nail is still transparent after the two coats but I quite like it.  I tried it over a few other favorite polishes and love the shimmer it added to those colors as well.  Endless possibilities!  Polish goes on nicely and evenly.  Love this OPI!
0,"I guess the coverage is ok, but I don't like the texture.  It doesn't feel creamy and glide on like I want it to.  It has a dry feel to it during application, but your skin doesn't look dry after you apply it.  As I'm applying it, it dries up too quickly, and then I have to get more from the bottle.  A little does not go a long way and I have to really rub to get it on.  It also looks streaky after I'm done.  It's hard to explain, but I just don't like it.  I prefer cover girl."
1,My only complaint was that the box looked like it came out of a salvage sale. I was worried that it was not new. It was taped up and the corners were worn. I presume it was a new product. Another point is that there is no change switch for the dual voltage. Does it automatically change when using it abroad? I bought separate clips as my hair is thin and the rollers seem heavy with the clips provided.
1,This is a fresh smelling cologne not over powering or too fruity but I would suggest this one for daytime use because of the lightness of its scent. It is fairly cheap so don't worry. It is not however a signature cologne that sharply stands out from the rest but due to its clean scent it will do. Step up your game without breaking your bank.
1,"Great product. I like that it doesn't have all the bad stuff in it. It's thick and creamy, good in the winter and in the summer. My skin stays moisturized all day. I won't use anything else."
0,"I am a BIG Earth Science fan and LOVE their facewash and moisturizers (been using them for years) but this scrub creme I DO NOT like.  It smells bad and it's just a thick, sticky, gooey, gross mess.  There is barely any materials in it to ""scrub"" -- I guess that is why it's called gentle -- but I don't notice any exfoliating results like I achieve with other exfoliating cleansers.  It's sticky on your face and is hard to wash off.  I highly recommend Earth Science but NOT this particular product!"
1,I gave this product four out of five stars because I haven't worn it yet. But it has a nice sheen in the bottle.
1,This brush left my hair sooo soft and silky I was in love!  Definitely made of fine material and worth the money.
1,"This tube will last me a lifetime considering that you need just a dab for the eye area. It feels pretty light and doesn't smell too strong, although I have not noticed any significant reduction of wrinkles and fine lines within a month that I've been using it. Or maybe I just don't have enough of them to see anything significant. Going through the ingredient list, I was impressed to see a lot of good anti aging ingredients, but Parabens have to go."
1,"After reading the instructions, I decided I needed to add the developer and go for up to 30 minutes, because I had used demi-permanent red color on a human hair wig and did not like it.  Being not very experienced, I was somewhat afraid to put this on the wig, so first I tried several other ways to remove the color, like washing with Dawn, and Tide, before I used ColorZap.  First of all the other ways only lightened the color a bit, and still made the hair feel very dry and damaged.  When I put ColorZap on, it had done the trick in about 5-10 minutes instead of the 30 I was expecting, and as far as I could tell the hair was no more damaged than before I used it.  I'd have been better off to have just used this to start with.  Now I am back to blonde I started with, if not a bit lighter.  But sadly, because of the Dawn and Tide drying the wig, and my extensive use of conditioner, the knots loosened and a lot of the hair came out before I used ColorZap.  Well, this has definitely been a learning experience.  Next time I'll just use ColorZap, and keep the conditioner off the knots.  It's a good thing I did not like that wig anyway."
1,"ok first of all, i didn't buy it on amazon. i messed up my hair at home - i have very bright blonde (professionally highlighted hair) and my roots are a boring mousy brown...i tried to lighten my roots a few shades so that i could extend the time between expensive salon trips. well the result was AWFUL orange-y/reddish roots!! it looked like my roots were glowing orange while the rest of my hair was a very pretty natural blonde. so came online and found this unred stuff and thought...""i can't wait a few days to get this in the mail, i need it NOW!"" so i went to sally beauty supply. sadly they didn't have a bottle like amazon does...they just sold the little one time use packets. so i bought a few. here's the part that my review may differ from others. i know you're supposed to mix it with your hair color but since i already screwed up my color i didn't have that option. so i took a very thick conditioner i have and put some in a bowl and mixed it with the unred. i used a highlighting brush and applied it to my roots. ((heads up...this stuff is full on black when you apply it to your hair...terrifying but normal)) i left the conditioner/unred mixture on for about 40 minutes and then rinsed. my roots are NOT glowing anymore and they are a much more normal shade. i'm extremely happy with this product..and i think in a week or so...i'll do it again. it is amazing the difference and i didn't even use it with hair color like they recommend. next time around when i do my roots between salon trips i'll add the unred and come back and update my review. for now..this stuff is a very cheap and great answer if you mess up your hair or need to tone down orange/red tones. :)"
1,"Never tried this brand before, I have super damaged hair from recently going from red to pink to platinum to black, this helps as a detangler,  though I don't think is actually doing anything to long term improve my damaged hair (I don't think any product would though). What I like most is it doesn't make my hair oily or greasy and I can still go 2 days between washings without getting the greasy look a lot of leave in products have over time. I give 3 stars because I'm just not wowed, still looking for something that will actually help repair my hair. As just a detangler it would be a 5 though."
1,I've been using this for about 6 months. Before I had been using Proactive. Proactive worked great for me for a while but eventually stopped clearing up my skin so I switched to Clean and Clear Continuous Control. My skin cleared right up and stays clear other than whiteheads. The only problem is that it's a little harsh on my skin. Usually irritates it if I leave it on but for a second. It also dries out my skin a lot. So I use it every other day. I get a couple pimples by using it every other day but it is still better than Proactive and AcneFree.
1,"I got a pedicure with this polish and loved the color but thought the pedicurist did a terrible job. I was left with visible streaks and poor coverage. I bought the polish so that I could use it myself.It turns out it wasn't the pedicurist's fault. This is a very thin polish that requires at least three coats for solid coverage. Two coats will leave visible streaks on your nails. The dry polish also dissolves easily under additional coats. So when you add a new coat, you have to be very careful not to disturb the existing/dry coats.However, the color is fantastic. It is a bright orange, perfect for summer. It instantly became one of my favorites for toes. Just be prepared to work a little harder than with some of the other OPI colors."
1,This is a great polish (wears a long time) and a great color for spring.. The pinkish blue polish is very feminine and goes with jeans as well. I wear this all spring/summer long.
1,"My first experience shopping in a Lush store was in Victoria, BC and it seemed a bit like a beauty bakery. You may go to Victoria to see the Butchart Gardens, but if you want to scent your world with floral and exotic scents, then this company has a lot to offer. You can truly surround yourself in natural bath bliss that is reminiscent of everything from freshly cut grass (the Jungle conditioning bar) to perfumes from the Mediterranean.The Bath Ballistic is an explosion of heavenly scented pink bubbles that float about like flowers and then seem to relax into little tropical islands floating in a pink sea. The color is rose, but the scents are a blend of Synthetic Musk, Jasmine, Clary Sage, and Ylang Ylang. The rice paper flower in the center opens up and drifts around in the water like white rose petals.After soaking for a while, you start to notice your skin being deeply moisturized and after your bath, you might notice you need to use half the lotion you normally would apply. If you try this at night, you will awaken the next morning warm, snuggly and still heavenly scented with essential oils. The wide range of feelings experienced after your bath may include everything from wishing to fall asleep in soft pink flannel pajamas to wanting a night of romance on the town (dimly lit restaurants with candles). Either way, you will be relaxed, happy and feel quite sexy.The softness of your skin may inspire you to wear silkier fabrics, cashmere robes or look for a pair of pink marabou slippers and a chiffon baby doll outfit.A small sampling of delicious products arrived with this purchase and the solid jungle bar conditioner was fun to use in the bath because it doesn't drip all over and really seems to adhere to each strand and by the end of your bath you will have silky skin and baby soft hair, reborn from a moisturizing treatment that includes ingredients like Cocoa Butter, Passion Fruit, Bananas, Kumquats, Ylang Ylang, Cypress and Vetivert.~The Rebecca ReviewP.S. I always add a little sea salt to the bath..."
1,"I bought it to use as tonic water for my face.  The smell is very rosy and lovely.  The water itself is very mild because my skin has no reaction at all unlike other tonic water.  Although I don't see the difference in my skin from using this tonic water, I like the smell and it's very pleasant to use."
0,"I have a ton of fine hair that has a natural wave.  It did not curl my hair and i left them in until they were completely cool.  Disappointment.  I gave it 2/5 stars because maybe it's my hair type that's the problem, not the product.  I just would not recommend it since I did not have success. :("
0,"I had one of these decades ago when I blow dryed my hair and used hot rollers -- I thought the towel was great.  I recently bought another, as my hair is very long and naturally curly (it has to air dry).  First of all, this towel will not stay twisted in a turban while I put on moisturizer, etc., and second, it soaks up so much moisture that my hair dries frizzy (even with product on it).  I'm dissappointed with my purchase, and would not recommend this to anyone with naturally curly hair that need to be air dried."
1,"This is a great little gadget.  And, yes, it is working.  I can't believe I got this as cheap as I did!"
1,This works great and I will definitely be buying the top coat. It looks great by itself and holds my regular nail polish for a long time. This product is amazing!
1,"This review is for the silver shatter only.....I wish Amazon would separate them so it was easier to find reviews that are for the shatter polish (the POTC colors are disgusting looking!). The effect is nice, the reason for the lower star rating is that this polish is very temperamental. It takes some practice, a bit of trial-and-error to get it right, but it does work! Here are some tips that I found helpful.1. Use a very highly contrasting color! A very bright (under the darker shatter) or dark (lighter shatter shades) color is best. A light/pale color can just make the end result look like weeks-old polish.2. Store the polish in a cool place.3. Make sure your base coat is COMPLETELY DRY!!! This is crucial!4. Roll the bottle between your hands to mix it up, don't shake it! (this goes for any polish!)5. Experiment with very thing/thicker coats. The effects are different. In my experience, a VERY thin coat will give you something closer to the advertised effects.6. You need to apply this polish QUICKLY! Re-dipping the brush to go back over the nail causes pulling/smudging.7. Use a top coat. A glossy top coat will help the base color show through more. The shatter dries to a matte finish, and looks more like dried/cracked paint instead of pretty polish."
1,"Since I have been using my face is really smooth and clear, I am 39 years old and I have noticed a big change!"
0,"I first tried this product 6 months ago to cover my greys which I don't have a lot of (5% of my hair) but since I have dark hair the greys are very noticeable.  The first time I tried it I left it on my hair for 30 minutes as indicated and after rinsing it I realized every single grey hair was still there! just as shiny and white as before.  I used this on virgin hair and I don't use hair products or even conditioner so I didn't have any build up that could interfere with coloring process.  I figured that maybe it was because I had bought tint and left it in my bathroom for 6 months before I used it - but it was still over a year away from expiration.I decided to give this tint a second try today, fresh bottle just bought 4 days ago, made sure hair was saturated, this time I left the tint on for 45 minutes like another review had suggested and after rinsing..still grey/white hair!!  not even a bit tinted.I was so looking forward to hiding my greys with a product free of most chemicals found in other tints but I was hugely dissapointed."
1,"Fast delivery. The cream is very nice, the skin is very delicate, the texture of the skin smoother. Almost no odor. I'm still happy. For wrinkles do not know, I use recently."
1,"If you like purple I bet you will love this color, it screams summer time. I already used it and I like It a lot, amazing to enlarge your nail polish collection."
1,wonderful milk cleanser for those suffering from dry skin even if you have combo skin. I read that it's best not to use harsh cleansers for the skin. cetaphil and this are  great.  It's great that this product has Co Q10.. But what use is it if it all goes down the drain? Maybe keeping on as a mask for a while? I still love it though!
1,"This Obagi line is supposedly really popular with a lot of people. Those that love it, really love it and those that don't think this line is the worst for your skin since it does dry out skin.  A couple years ago, my mom tried to get me to use the facial wash and toner and I found the toner pretty ok at exfoliating my skin without drying it out (after all, it's supposed to balance your skin pH out).  The face soap did make my skin feel really dry and since I heard that's not good, I stopped using everything.  Then lately, my skin started becoming really oily and I just happened to pick up using my mom's face wash again.  My skin was so greasy, oily, and sticky and after a good wash and dry, my face felt clean and pretty matte.  The one thing that bothered me is after lathering and I am trying to rinse the facial soap off, I feel like I cannot wash all the residue off.  The feeling is like an oily film on the face and I know I have tried by best rinsing all of the soap off.  Oh well, I don't know what that was about but it's worth using.  This is a popular line for spas and skin professionals so it's not a cheap product.  The price seems pretty decent, here, on Amazon."
1,"so here is my hair history: natural blonde to box blonde to box dark red/brown to 40 developer loreal highlights RED. Like Ronald mcdonald or rihanna. And I loved t and left it for about a month and a half. But I wanted to go blonde.Ok so I went to three salons asking them what they could do for my hair...... Basically I was told that t was hopeless or else it would be months before my hair went back to it's natural color.... Blonde!I had two strands tested with bleach and it barely turned the red pink..... I was starting to panic a little.This is a miracle product! Of course my hair didn't go straight to it's natural color, but it look away the red effortlessly! The processing cap helps a LOT though and make sure to buy gloves!My hair was blonde but still orangey ish and a couple red spots remained but it was pretty even.... And better yet, my fine blonde hair was in good condition and my roots were unharmed. I expected I have to bleach it or dye it lighter because let's face it, when you have dark or red hair you're going to have to face some consiquences.... But this saves me soo muh effort and money! Sure it smels a little funny but I've smelled a heck of a lot worse and honestly it wasn't too strong......Ten dollars for a working product to save my hair and get rid of RED on top of DARK BROwN? Yes please. I highly recommend his product for anyone that needs to striptheor hair of old product that is dark or red."
1,This product was recommended to me by a friend and I'm so glad they mentioned it.  I was never a fan of eye make-up removers until I tried Neutrogena.  I am currently overseas and ran out of my supply so I ended up buying a different brand that they had stocked in the PX and I regret it.  It worked about as good as straight water did.  So I found this on Amazon and ordered some.  I received it yesterday and my eyes are so happy!  One or two swipes and the makeup is off...even waterproof mascara.  I will never use another brand.
1,"I've been using Help Me for about a month.  I noticed results right away, within the first few days, and I'll never be without this product again.  It does what it claims to do. I've noticed the greatest results regarding pore size.  I have combination normal/oily skin, and I had enlarged pores in my T-zone.  Help Me has reduced their appearance.  I no longer use face primer before applying foundation, because my skin is smoother and the pores do not show like they did before.  I wish I could see more of a difference with fine lines around my eyes, but I have seen some improvement.  It can be drying, even if have oily skin, so you'll need to apply a moisturizer after using it.  I use Hope in a Jar and have used these two products together every night.  My skin is more clear, smooth, and younger-looking."
1,"I have used this every other summer or so for at least ten years.  It is reliable, smells nice, and lightly highlights. As the instructions say, if your hair is darker it will bring out red tones so don't be surprised.  I found that continuing to use it removes them and makes my hair blonder, but I need to use an anti-brassiness treatment.  Currently, I use it occasionally on my medium brown hair specifically to introduce some warm red highlights.  I no longer want to go blonder, but I like that it takes my mousy brown hair and introduces some dimension and color.  I have very thin, straight, fine hair which is medium dull brown naturally.  This looks more natural than other types of hair color which deposit color, although others might find results vary based on hair type.  Try a test on a small section of hidden hair to see what this will do to your hair before spraying all over your head - but I love what it does for me."
1,"I purchased this with the intent of using it on my upper arms for keratosis pilaris aka chicken skin. I had tiny white bumps on my upper arms that are similar to acne. For years it's been a huge embarrassment since it looked like acne, not to mention, I am naturally a ""Picker"" I pick at every little thing. I have been that way since I was a child. I have seen doctors, dermatologist, estheticians, you name it. I have tried all kinds of different things with no luck at all. Doctors told me it was just allergies. I have done tons of research on treating this condition. I found that gycolic acid helps with exfoliating the dead skin cells. This has cured my embarrassing ""chicken skin."" YAY!!! Not only did it make my arms smooth, it also cleared my face up. I have suffered with oily skin FOREVER. I have tried every product out there almost, from the cheapest to the most expensive. My face was combination skin. I had lots of break outs. I thought I needed face wash for ""oily"" skin considering the a mouth if oil my face produced, on top of the pimples is develop. It didn't help I constantly picked at the blemishes. I started to use this as my facial cleanser, since doing so I don't have blemishes. When I do it's every great now & then. My face is no longer oily. I finally have a beautiful even skin tone. I have used this for 2 years now without any problems. You can purchase this at CVS & Walgreens for almost twice the cost of what you can get it on amazon for. At least try it, you don't have anything to lose."
1,"Great go to product. Would benefit if formula was a little less heavy+lighter (there is a difference and this needs a reduction in both areas). The quality makes it worth the price, and fixing it a little bit would make sales soar. We buy this Aveeno, and it's ok. We just don't go back because even though the quality makes the price fair, it needs to do more to make the price payable."
1,"I love this stuff! It hydrates well, absorbs quickly and smells great. It has natural ingredients and is made in the USA, which I appreciate. I wasn't sure if I should try it but I am so glad that I did! The tube also has lasted longer than I anticipated it would, though I would personally prefer a pump-dispenser to a tube. I plan to purchase this again."
1,"I haven't had any lengthy experience with this product as today was the first time that I have used it.  The smell is why I gave if four stars. It is highly perfumed, and it is almost overwhelming, so I won't be able to use it everyday. The minute I put this on my skin it seemed to give great results, and my skin looks dewy, and the texture is really nice. It is not too greasy, and leaves a soft feel to your skin."
1,"My hair is fine and straight, but it still tangles easily. I use this after drying my hair after a shower and it doesn't snag at all. My hair doesn't get static-y from using this, which I love. 5 stars."
1,This is an awesome product. I use it all the time and and will continue to use it. Great service also
0,"I've been using this product almost daily for one month on my oily-combo skin. I'm prone to blackheads (forehead, cheeks), acne (forehead), and once a year cystic acne on the chin. I've had a small breakout because my stylist used coconut oil on my hair (my hair loves coconut oil but my face HATES it), and decided to use this with my face regimen. After 4 weeks this product has done nothing for me whatsoever. It is clear gel like substance (like hardened baby oil) and smells nice. That's about it. I'm going to use it up since I paid $7 for it but I definitely will not be repurchasing."
1,"When I tired of coloring my hair, I cut it short and bleached it blond to try to avoid the Cruella Deville look of growing out the gray.  I starting using Roux Silver Lining Mousse to blend the gray and give my hair body.  Now that my hair is fully grown out and turned out to be a great silver color -who knew--, I still use this mousse every day.  It brightens the silver, and keeps my natural curls and waves in place."
1,"This product contains retinol which is the most amazing acne fighting ingredient around.  I was noticing some fine lines around my mouth and forehead and I have been struggling with monthly hormonal breakouts on my cheeks and chin ever since I had my daughter three years ago.  Within the first week my skin cleared up and after about 6 weeks I am noticing those fine lines beginning to soften. All in all, my skin looks better.  Its clearer, smoother and the tone is even.  Do beware, this product contains AHA's which can wreak havoc on sensitive skin, if you notice redness stop using, you are having a reaction and your skin will not adjust (skin doesn't work like that)But if you respond well, this cream may be your new favorite, especially if you suffer from the occasional breakout."
1,"It's lovely! I have a ruddy skin tone (pale as paper, but with some redness and blotchy patches from eczema) and have a hard time finding the right colors to flatter my complexion. Didn't realize from the pic, but the color has an opal/pearl shimmer to it. At first, I admit I thought would be a little too juvenile. But after 2 coats and a top coat of Seche Vite, you can hardly see the pearly look. It just looks like a pretty pinky/purple kind of color. Hard to put into words, but I love it! Shipping was quick and I like that they wrapped it in bubble paper to protect it during shipping!"
1,"This stuff melts into my skin very well. I use it on my hands and feet. We also use it on my mom, who is bed ridden. It helps against bed sores on the bum and back. I would recommend this item to anyone looking to keep skin moisturized all day, whether hands, feet, back, or against diaper rash."
1,"Like many others, I try to use only natural products that don't have nasty chemical ingredients in them. I was looking for a new face wash because my face wasn't too happy with my last one, which was a natural creamy cleanser also. It never got my face completely clean and I always had dirt/makeup on my cotton ball when using toner right after washing. So, I decided to give this one a try based on the positive reviews on it and other products they make. I am so happy with it, and so is my face! No break outs since using this cleanser. I put it on (not using any water) and rub it in, letting it sit for at least 5 minutes before rinsing. It's so effective at removing dirt/makeup that there is nothing on my cotton ball when I use toner right after. It leaves my face so soft after using that I don't need to use moisturizer. I am so pleased with this product, I decided to buy pretty much their whole line of skin care. Everyone's skin is different, so I all I know is it works for me and I have weird skin- sensitive, and combination dry with a few oily spots, and break out super easy."
1,wow- it works great- well the first few times I have used it. biting nails is super hard to break. I am on the 3rd bottle (over like 5 yrs) so hopefully this time it will work for me (again). warning- don't touch anything with your hands after applying for like 24 hrs. especially not Thanksgiving Day biscuits everyone else would (have liked to) eat. It kind of gets over everything you touch and then put in your mouth. and unless you have some tolerance to it (like I do now...) then well it can be really unpleasant.I am sure it would be best to break your kid of the habit before they ruin dinner at a later age....
0,I tried this product for 2 months and i have to say it didnt do anything for my acne. I am the type that breaks out when my period is about to start and using this pill didn't change a thing. I broke out just as i normally would and this last month even while using the pill was nearly the worst i've had. I'm sure must just be a coincidence. I am not saying this is not a good product as we have to keep in mind one thing can't and won't work for everyone as we all have different skin types. This just isn't for me and i have discontinued using this product and cannot really recommend it.
1,I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and I really like it.  My skin feels softer.  I will continue to buy and hope it even does more in the long run.
1,This color is beautiful! I purchased this color over the popular color Orgasm because it didn't have a ton of sparkle. Deep throat is a pretty build able pink color with a small amount of shimmer. Love it!
1,"This is a great bath for getting off to sleep or just relaxing, but it isn't for the conservative bather! It releases a maelstrom of fizz and scent, and colors the water a rich blue color (I wish the ocean looked that blue!) and releases little seaweed pieces into the bath. It truly feels like an adventure to bathe in it, and is a huge hit with me.The seaweed is very slippery and doesn't stick to my skin, which is important, but you may like to get a little strainer for the drain if you are going to use a lot of Lush bath bombs!The bomb is moisturizing and highly scented, and the essential oils used are soothing and smell great. You really can get away with breaking these in half to use, but for the occasional special treat, try the whole shebang! It is lovely!"
1,i needed a blow dryer for college this was cheapest one i found and it has a cool setting works perfect for me
1,"As someone who is normally a big goofball when it comes to styling my hair, I was hesitant to get these after reading reviews. I've never even used hot rollers before and wasn't sure if this would be the right purchase for a beginner. Well I am happy I got these. They are insanely easy to use and heat up super fast. Actually they get a little too hot for me and I use a heat protecting glove when I use them so it's no biggy. Anyway, I'm just going to list pros and cons..pros:*none of the curlers are too big. it seems like way too many sets out there have massive curlers and that's a big turn off to me.*20 is more than enough to do my entire head. (but i have super thin, fine hair)*i am impatient and wanted something in the moment. these are sold at a lot of stores so picking up a pack is easy*these are super easy to use. maybe it's because my hair is so thin but i find that i dont really have a problem with the clips that everyone complains about. i do feel like they could have more grip but it's not a huge deal for me*these give me really soft, romantic curls. i feel like a disney princess when i style my hair with this. sooo pretty. honestly if i had had this set when i got married, i would have used it to style my own hair for the wedding.*it's all very fast. i love that i dont have to sleep on a wet head full of curlers or a sock bun to get the look that i want. this is the fastest way of styling my hair that i've found yet.*hair looks a lot more shiny after using these!cons:*ends are too hot on bare hands, im not sure how often i'd be using these without that glove.*the price is a bit nuts. it sells for even more on the official conair site than it does here or in store. i feel like for what it is, it costs too much. this set should be $19.99, MAYBE 25 bucks at the most.*the reason i feel it costs too much is that it's a very inconvenient little set. there is no place to store the 17 clips besides the 3 that stay on the burners. this unit is pretty massive and i feel like they should have included a drawer somewhere to hold the clips.*lid doesn't clasp shut, it just kind of rests on the unit. not a big deal but that bugs me. i like lids that close.*there's no way of storing the cord, not even a little cut out on the end of the plug like you get with vaccuum cleaner cords. you just have to wrap it awkwardly around the unit which looks dumb.i think that's pretty much all i can say about it. i am happy with it will use it a lot but it needs a lot of changes to be perfect!"
1,"so far, it doesn't help grow edges but patient is the key right?:) the smell isn't the best but its castor oil"
1,I have very acne prone skin and this stuff keeps the oil down and really keeps my face soft and moisturized. Love it.
1,"I have very dry skin and also psoriasis. Some areas of my face are too delicate for my prescribed psoriasis cream so I use this and it works like a dream. It is very creamy, does not make me break out (a lot of other products do) and keeps my skin in great condition. It scares me that I am having trouble finding this in stores now. Thankfully amazon has it. great price too!"
1,"I use this every day on my face to keep it nice and clear.  It is awesome stuff, keeps my acne under control with out drying out my face."
1,"Every November my hands begin to crack.  I found Burt's Bees hand salve about four years ago and have faithfully purchased a tin each fall because it is the only product that I have found that can assuage the discomfort and help my hands heal.The consistency is somewhat greasy but the product spreads easily over hands.  The product is absorbed within five minutes of application.  I typically apply at night and in the morning.  This routine keeps my hands moisturized and soft.I am very sensitive to perfumes.  This hand salve has a distinctive scent but one that is very herbal in nature.  The smell can fill a room or work office but I don't think the scent rises to the level of being obnoxious.  I regularly apply it at work and have had no complaints.  Typically, the scent dissipates in twenty minutes.  If you are worried about the stares of colleagues, try to apply it after a nighttime shower.A little bit of this product goes a long way and a three ounce tin typically takes me through winter and spring.  I like that Amazon offers the two pack so I can keep one at work and one at home.Overall, a fantastic product that is highly recommended."
1,I don't know what I would do without this stuff; it is a must-have for wardrobe malfunctions. I pop out of way less garments now that I have this.
1,"Hands down this is the most amazing Lotion Cream I have ever used! Softens even the roughest skin I recommend it highly! I have tried literally 100 mof lotions for dry skin this goes a long way not to much, if you have any rough areas buy it, you will never be sorry you bought 4."
1,I like the way this soap smells.  I live in New Mexico (the desert) and wish it was just a bit more moisturizing.  That seems to be a problem here with most soaps though.
0,"This is the second Better Living Classic Dispenser IV I've purchased in the last twelve months and these things suuuuuuck.  So why, you ask did I buy a second one???  Because one day recently as soon as I'd begun to lift the lid to check the level of soap in the bottles, one of them slipped out onto the shower floor and shattered into about 100 pieces.  I'd clearly seated it in properly the last time I took it out or else the lid wouldn't have closed in the first place.  Also, the unit was never bumped, jostled or anything else that would have caused the bottle to come loose.  So...manufacturing defect?  I think so.Anyway, I ended up contacting Better Living to ask about a replacement bottle and was hoping for a courteous, &#34;we'll send you one free of charge since it's our crappy product's fault.&#34;  Instead, I was directed to a link on their website where you can purchase replacement parts (this is likely where they make most of their money).  At over $5 for a cheap plastic bottle that I now know will shatter if dropped three feet, I was loath to buy one but basically had no choice.  I added it to my cart and during checkout found out that they don't ship to military APO addresses (which have California zip codes, BTW).  I contacted the company and told them about my dilemma and they basically told me to get lost.  Customer service really IS dead.So now here I am writing a glowing review of the entirely new dispenser I had to purchase just so that I could get a replacement bottle for my soap and have some spare ones for when the others inevitably break.  Do yourself a huge favor and avoid Better Living products altogether as there are many other &#34;better&#34; options out there."
1,"I bought Essie because I am falling in love with their nail polishes, since they are fast drying and long lasting. However, this one was a little too watery. While I was applying it, a few drops dripped onto the table. I have never experienced this with any other Essie nail polishes. Speaking of the color, its a cream white color, and its usually opaque in 2 coats. Its an okay polish, I wouldn't re-purchase."
1,"I love this stuff, and I wouldn't have known about how wonderful all the things in this product line were until I got Burt's Bees Head To Toe Kit!The best advertising in the world is to just proove how great your stuff is by letting people try it. Well, they can't go around giving away everything, but this wonderful sample kit is the next best thing.If you feel like buying yourself a gift, or giving someone a hint that you are due for a special reward, you'll never regret having these special products in your house.I just love them all!"
1,"This product is superb for the price as opposed to Department Store brands.  It works very well on my skin and shows improvements over night - at least in my case.  I could see the difference almost immediately.  I love the way it goes on your skin, and isn't drying as some other products can be in trying to achieve the same results.  I'm sold and have been on this product for over a year."
1,"This is my second flat iron, a replacement to a conair 3/4 $15 dollar iron. If you are worried about the cost, DON'T be; it's worth it. My hair has never looked better, and the best part is that it lasts until I wash my hair again. I no longer have to fear drizzle and humidity and rain or going to sleep and waking up with a mess on my head. I don't feel like I'm damaging my hair like with my old conair, and the results are far better. There is no fuzziness to my hair when I'm finished and all it takes is one swipe. When I was using the conair, I would have to go over it with my curling iron and the results would last, if I was lucky and the weather was perfect, two days. And my ends would also looked fried. With my Solia, my hair is straight, light, and shiny and it doesn't frizz or fuzz up. And my ends have yet to looked fried while using the Solia. ^_^ My hair also looks healthier than it ever has before."
1,My wife likes this mascara as it thickens and lengthens without clumping. She has a favorite mascara and this one is as good as it is. She also likes that it is washable and easily removed.She doesn't care for the brush as much as others she has tried but she can live with it. One issue that frustrates her though is that the brush is short and it cannot reach the bottom of the tube and she feels that you cannot use all of the mascara that is available.She rates this at 5 stars and would buy it again. I have posted a photo for your information.
0,"So I just received my blck coconut roll-on, and was so excited to try it because I LOVE all things coconut, and I'm disappointed to say the least. Its almost sickeningly sweet, and I really don't sense that much coconut. It almost smells syrupy. I put it on though because oils can smell different on the body then it does in the jar. 4 hours later and its still pretty sweet...not as bad as it was when I first put it on , but definitely smelling even less like coconut. I thought I would be getting a true tropical warm scent from the description... (pure coconut with a bit of spice) but, alas, I go right back to the bubble_gum scents of junior high when I smell this. Does anyone have any recommendations for a TRUE coconut scent? (Nutty,creamy, musky, and warm smelling) I'm willing to try anything! But id rather stick with the all natural oils for their longevity ."
1,"My mom loves the color pink and at her request I ordered Aphrodite's Pink Nightie.  It's a shiny pink color. Very feminine and bright. I usually don't go for pink nail polish, I prefer darker colors like Midnight in Moscow. But this color is so pretty I'd consider it. Looks beautiful on the hand."
1,This is one of my favorite adhesives.It has a strong hold yet comes off gentely!!!!AND NO REDIDUE!!!!However u dont need much so really last!!!!!
1,"This is a really great perfume. It's floral, but not overpoweringly so. It smells clean, too."
1,"This is my first wig brush for my first set of wigs and i have to say, it was a good choice. It doesn't snag on knots as i images other brushes would and the loops are pretty sturdy so it will hopefully last a long time."
1,"This is a bright, shiny pearl - white.  I used 2-3 coats on my nail tips (french style and it depended on how thick I'd coated it the first time if I needed 3 coats - if you're being careful you could do just 2) and used Pure Ice ""Oh Baby"" for the top coat (it's a clear polish with fine, tiny sparkles).  It looks amazing and has lasted over a week and still doesn't need touch ups (and I am really hard on my nails).  I did not need a UV light with this lacquer.  Just allow it enough time to dry and this should last you over a week!!The fumes weren't bad either for this color."
1,This gentle lotion with its pleasant aroma serves many purposes.  It is good for smoothing skin; acting as a stress buster and softening your skin.  It is ideal if you have corns and calluses.  Just use a little bit and it will treat your skin as gently as a well fitted glove.  Add to it is that it is reasonably priced and you will get your money's worth each time you use this.
1,"I have sensitive skin, plus have sun photosensitivity. I've been using this sunbloc for a number of years as a daily face lotion. To make it completely sunproof and long lasting, I use ColorScience sunbloc powder (colorless All Clear, which you can get on the internet) over it and know I am completely protected for an entire day of normal indoor/outdoor activities. (I wouldn't rely on it for waterbased activities or heavy duty sports activities.)Some reviewers have mentioned that it leaves a white film on their faces. It does, but that's not a negative and you shouldn't rub it in to eliminate the film for it is the film that protects you from harmful rays. I always get compliments on my complexion and questions about what makes my skin look so translucent and youthful. The secret is that white film which actually looks attractive if you put a dusting of Colorscience or any regular translucent powder, plus a little powder blush over it."
1,"Years ago a friend of mine bought this product at Macys for $125.  I thought she was crazy, but I saw what it did for her face and was amazed.  She had scaring from teenage acne that was pretty bad.  In about six months her skin was so smooth and the scars were barely noticeable.  I use this on my neck and find it has made my skin look smoother."
1,This is an awesome product- I have it in South Beach and Portofino.  It's so much better than powder blush-blends into your skin and looks glowing and smooth-beautiful finish.
1,"For $7.50, you can get a sample set of 5-6 colors plus a setting powder.  I highly recommend this, because I am surprised at how I normally buy a certain color in foundation, but it is not the color I need for Dermablend.  Also, my arms and legs need different colors of Dermablend, especially during the summer.  Now they have the creamier version of ""Leg and Body"" cover, which I feel has slightly different coloring so I bought the sample sets again and am glad I did.  I bought my sample sets from whatshebuys.com.  Your skin needs to be very well moisturized prior to using Dermablend, or you may not get good coverage.  As with regular foundation, it can settle into cracks/lines/etc, if not moisturized well.  And that doesn't mean slathering on some Vaseline immediately prior to applying Dermablend.  It means daily hydration as well as drinking water, which is best for your skin anyhow!  It may not cover well on dry skin conditions such as psoriasis/eczema.  Read the directions with the Dermablend, it needs a few minutes to dry, you may need to apply a second ""coat"" and blend well at the edges.  You will get the longest lasting coverage using the setting powder.  This is all just my opinion.  I have used Dermablend off and on for years, always want to use it, just couldn't always afford it."
1,My doctor recommended this when I started loosing my hair and I can honestly say I have seen a huge difference. I have regrown my receeding hairline and my hair loss has greatly slowed down. I use it everyday before bed and that's it. It's easy and relatively cheap compared to other products on the market. Since It is working well I do not use it twice a day. I did stop using it for awhile and I started loosing the hair I had regrown. You have to use this forever if you start so be prepared for that. To me it's worth it.
0,"I've been using the BB Orange Essence cleanser for a couple of years and had excellent results - fewer blemishes, less dryness and tightness after cleansing, and easy makeup removal.  However, I am going to have to discontinue use after the recent recipe change.  I'm not sure what my skin is reacting to, but it's causing me to develop peeling and swelling around my eyes.I didn't want to jump to conclusions about the product, so I attempted to give it as scientific of a go as I could.  I started using the new formula normally, just subbing it into my regular routine.  After a few days, the skin under my eyes swelled and began to peel.  I didn't immediately decide it was the BB, instead I stopped using all product on my face (including makeup) for about a week.  The swelling went away.  I then started using my usual moisturizer (ROC) again, and had no reaction.  I wore makeup again and didn't have any reaction.  Then I added the BB back into the routine and within two days my under-eye area was reacting again.  I'm going to have to toss this stuff, and I'm quite disappointed as it was a favorite."
1,"Ibought this thinking there was no way these things would work on my thick hair !  Surprise! They worked!  There isnt enough small-medium curlers for my hair and the clip holders cause splits, so I started using different clips----but other than that the steam actually does curl hair !"
1,"My new favorite product. Smells soooo good and has a calming, soothing effect on me. So, for the aromatherapy alone I give it 5 Stars. Now, if it's going to improve my skin too..wow! I just love love love this stuff! ~Heavenly~"
1,"I can't say enough how great this produce is! We had tried everything to get our son to stop sucking, his speech therapists and dentist were really stressing the negative impact of this habit. He had pretty much stopped during the day but still sucked to go to sleep and at night. We started talking about how thumbs start to taste bad when you get too big to suck, and that it's a sign your body gives you that you should stop sucking, a rite of passage of growing older like baby teeth falling out. We did this for about two weeks, and then started applying a TINY bit on his thumb after he fell asleep-- I thought doing it this way would make it less of a control issue between us and also thought the bedtime suck would be the hardest to fade so didn't want to start there. He woke up once the first night crying, and I went in and explained that he must be getting to be a bigger boy and congratulations! After this first night, he never woke crying again. We did this for three days and by day two he had stopped sucking altogether. We then did every other day for about two weeks and have stopped completely for ten days now. I think for our son he just needed to break the habit for 1-2 days, he has never looked back and is so proud of himself! We make a big deal each morning of using a pumice stone to get rid of the callus on his thumb. My only regret is not doing it a year earlier!"
1,"So I'm going to come right out and say it, I didn't want to use this mask because I'm a die hard fan of Queen Helena Mint Julep Mask. There, now the cat is out of the bag. I decided to give Freeman a chance because my best friend is always using this mask and swears by it. I'm so happy I finally gave it a chance, I could seriously see the dirt and oil coming out of my pores when the mask was drying. It was really easy to apply and was super smooth on my skin. I let it dry for about 10-20 minutes just to make sure it picked up as much as it possibly could and used a wash cloth to take it off. The after effects were great! My skin felt smooth, refreshed, and tight. I did feel a little dry, but some face moisturizer put that to rest almost immediately. I'm not sure if I'll leave Mint julep because I love that mask but I would definitely recommend this mask:]!!"
1,"I have combination normal/oily skin, and I have been using Philosophy skin care for about a month.  I wear make-up every day, and Purity Made Simple easily removes all my makeup (including mascara) and leaves my skin feeling clean.  With the product I was using before, I had to apply eye makeup remover and then use a cleanser.  This product gets rid of all of it and doesn't irritate my eyes.  (NOTE: I do not use waterproof mascara, so I'm not sure if it would remove that without irritation.)  I love the smell; it's very clean.  A little goes a long way.  You can really feel it dissolving your makeup, and  it leaves your skin oil-free."
1,"This toner does a decent job at moisturizing and soothing skin.  Having no alcohol means that my skin does not get irritated after using it, which is awesome.  The reason for 4 stars is that it is quite fragrant, which might be troublesome for those sensitive to fragrance.  I think I will try a different toner from this product line."
1,I feel like something is off with the consistency of the powder like they changed it somehow. It doesn't get the same coverage.
1,"The Duo lash adhesive works ok,i have used it several times. I am not sure that it works better then the eyelash adhesive i already had. I may buy again."
1,"This works as a lip gloss by itself, and as a way to tone down a garish lipstick. It is a nice, soft, pale pink that anyone of any skin color could wear."
1,"This stuff is nice and moisturizing yet doesn't feel heavy or greasy. I am acne prone and this has not broken me out. I use a glycolic acid peel and I use this as my moisturizer after for a few days. Keeps my skin nice and moist. Great price, will purchase again."
1,Great product for inbetween hair dyeing. I found that if you wet your hair the application is much easier than wetting the stick. Color goes on nice and easily and stays on well to hide any growth from your natural hair color. This is a great quick fix for me if I'm heading out and notice some roots or if I get too lazy to dye my hair it's great for the inbetween time frame.
1,I use this as my daily toner. Smells great! Works nice as a pre-lotion toner. I put it in a sprayer and mist it over my entire face and neck.
1,"I used a bootleg version of this for 4 years and I loved it. It worked at reducing my fine lines and uneven skin tone. I have ben using the real Strivectin for a few months now and I like it, it works for me. I use it every morning under my moisturizer, never had any issues."
1,I got this as a gift for my nephew. He loved it totally. Branded product for not so branded price.
1,This color matched my silver shoes perfectly.  Wore it throughout the holiday season.  People commented how great it looked peeping through silver shoes.
0,I bought several of the  Alpha Hydrox line  of products and there are a few I really won&#34;t buy again.  This is one of them I do not like the consistency of this product. The night replenishing cream is much better.
1,"I started using Free & Clear cleanser for sensitive skin about a month ago. I like the way it suds up, and the way it rinses off. Leaves my skin feelingsoft and my itching episodes have just about stopped happening. My dermatologist recommended this product and I am so glad she did!"
1,"First, you can never go wrong with Aveeno lotion.  Your skin will be silky smooth and not needing more in 5 mins!  I bough this kind for my mother who can not stand any perfumes or lotions with perfumes in them.  She is extremely sensitive to smells and she raved about this kind and begging me to buy her more!  She often complains about &#34;fragrance free&#34; still having some sort of smells.  Avveno lives up to its words!  Will be buying again"
1,"So far so good, but I didn't find too much of a difference between this and the mint masque--and the mint masque smells better! I would recommend either this or the mint."
1,"covers gray hair nicely and much longer than conventional hair dyes I've used by Revlon, Clairol, Nice & Easy, etc. There was no harsh smell. It is a little messy because no applicator bottle is included -buy one first! Also, the color is very dark. make sure you look at their website and go as light as you can because the color will be much darker than indicated."
1,I like how this product works.  I have very oily skin and prone to breakouts.  Used common sense when first starting this product and applied twice a week.  I now can apply it more when needed.  I did not have any drying of the skin.  I did use it in moderation.
1,"I've been using these patches consistently for almost a year.  I have good results for an hour or two after removing the patch, but as soon as I frown the furrows creep right back in.  I have deep furrows (I not-so-affectionately refer to them as ""frown ruts""  ;-).  I think that if you have shallow, fine lines you'll see better results."
1,"I have been using it for years and can be hard to find but  on Amazon it was easy to find and purchase.  It works great, sometimes within 2 days."
1,I needed to upgrade my 5 brushes to one &#34;great&#34; one and this is it!!! It helps to detangle and style which is just what I needed. What a great price too!!!
1,"These curlers work great for me! I use them mostly to ""calm"" my hair.  I have a mixture of textures of hair--a little straight, a little curly, a little wavy and I live in Florida so you can imagine the crazy look I get when I hit the humdity, lol! Despite the mixture my hair is it is pretty fine and soft and about 4 inches past my shoulder. The curlers leave my hair smooth and shiny and with big bouncy curls on the ends.  Because my hair is so fine, five curlers are exactly the right amount for me.  BTW, when I first tried the curlers, I was not impressed my hair didn't hold the curl but then through trial and error I found the right combination for my hair. I don't know if the same would work for any of you who are having trouble holding the curl but for me: I let the curlers heat about 10 minutes.  I MIST my hair with plain water right before applying the curlers (and also sometimes a VERY light shine spray if its very dry). I leave the curlers in AT LEAST 10 to 15 minutes before removing them.  Anyway, again works great for me! Hope it does for you!"
1,"I have very acne prone skin, so I thought if I used this it would help my skin.  Maybe it has and my skin would be much worse without it.  But, I use this everyday and I still have a decent amount of acne.  Maybe it is stress?  I don't know.  I use it on a loofa puff.  Maybe if you use it on a washcloth it would be better?  I don't know.  I usually have really good luck with Neutrogena items, so I am giving this three stars, assuming it will work better for other skin.  Plus I am 40, and my hormones are much different than a teenager that might be the target group for this item."
0,"I don't know how others have rated this so well, but I found it to apply and it just didn't cover the grey.  Nope."
1,"I have to say that I'm really bad at using hand lotion.  I never remember to put in on, even in the winter.  The only time I remember is after my hands are already red and cracked.  I came across this stuff a couple winters ago when my hands were in really bad shape.  After the first use, my hands were moisturized and no longer cracked.  What is also great about it is that it lasts through handwashing.  I use this once in the morning and it usually lasts the entire day. Great, great, great product."
1,"I am not going to explain why I know this works so well, but it does work.  And well.  Let's just leave it at that."
0,"It doesn't go very far, I need to use so much of it, It won't last long at all. It smells fine though."
1,i use this glue for lashes always (ardell demi 120) and it works last all day for me without and lifting from the corner problems plus its a great price i only buy the clear because the dark version is alittle off to me it doesnt dry black its more gray looking to it messes up my look so i save my time by sticking to white onelong story shorti use it ill buy it again always highly recommendhave any questions feel free to comment below
0,"Generally I love all things Philosophy makes.  This one, not so much.  The smell is awful.  The price for this tiny little bottle not much more than a sample is certainly a rip off.  I didn't even feel like it cleaned my face very well."
1,This would especially be good for winter months when it's cold and windy because it's a little heavier.  Love the smell of it!
1,I purchased this powder to use with my M.A.C. foundation. I use at as a finishing powder. It works perfectly! It blends easily and does not cake on my face. I just buff it all over and it give me that air brushed look... simply beautiful. It's a bonus that this comes in different shades. This jar is sure to last 6 months or more. Great value!
1,"So I have been a makeup artist for years and NARS blushes are the best blushes ever.  The pigments are so rich that you only need a little bit.  They last all day and all night.  They do not dry your skin, irritate, or fade.  I have them all.  I saw some negative reviews on the blush simply because it was not the right color choice.  You have to know what colors look good on you.  Not every color is for everyone :)  I happen to have very fair skin (I am Mont Blanc in NARS Sheer glow foundation) and this is actually my favorite blush color of all.  Beautiful...makes your skin glow, but not look too sparkly or highlighted.  I add a little on my eyes and cheeks and I am good to go. I am in love with NARS blushes!!!  You must try.  Find your colors and enjoy :)  PS...remember they are very pigmented so you do not need a lot.  That also means the blush lasts forever."
0,I've been using this product pretty steady for about 6 months or longer and haven't noticed any change in my complexion. Not really  much positive feedback I have for this product.
0,"Shouldn't really comment because I stopped using this after a week. it stung my face a little.  I started using Jan Marini's Bioglycolic face lotion, a little more expensive but great product."
1,"Hi,I'm not a ""review"" person, but when I read the existing reviews, I felt like doing this.I used this product for 2 months and I must tell you that it really WORKS!I'm hispanic-black woman (dominican) with relaxed fine hair and my hair grows normally, but only neck-chin lenght, no further than that. With this product I achieved a maximum growth rate and now my hair is leaving behind the accustomed lenght.I bought again the product to see how longer it can grows!!!I've been completely sincere with you...I'm not a staffer of this product company, I'm a real and very happy user!!!Hope this comment will be helpful for other women. I have only one last thing to say: Try it!!!! It worked for me..."
1,The cream feels great and makes your skin look wonderful.The only downfall is that the ingredients contain a paraben.
1,"I've only been using this moisturizer for a little over a week and I can already feel the difference in my skin.  My foundation goes on smoothly and my skin feels moisturized all day.  I have been using Aveeno for years but I like this moisturizer so much better.I work at a skilled nursing facility and the residents with the nicest skin ALL say that they've been using Oil of Olay for decades.  If that doesn't make you want to try it for yourself, I don't know what will."
1,"I bought this for my mom who loves the color. She wants me to get a couple more because she's wants backups.I tried it several times and I would say the formula is VERY good for a lipstick at this price point. It doesn't last amazingly long and isn't as AMAZING as some of the more expensive lipsticks I own (Estee Lauder, Mac). But the difference in price is HUGE. And if you're okay with several touch ups in the day, it makes a good every day lipstick."
1,"lightenes my choc brown hair like 4 - 5 shades to a light brown with shimmering golden hi lites doesn't look red. I love this stuff. don't want blonde but lighter brown as im over 40 and dark hair makes me look older. kinda got the color that Jacqueline Smith has ( ths spokeslady for kmart clothes, former charlies angels# her hair is lighter brown wth blonde hi lites. # not dark like when she was a charlies angell. I love this. ppl complimented on it. its my fav, normal color now. I don't go to the salon anymore and ppl think I do.! I have used other hair colors from a box that turned my hair red/ orange or auburn. this feria colors my dark hair to a light brown with hi lites, as I want. some people think I go to a salon and get it professionally done. I have gotten compliment. thanks  this is the only stuff I use now. (PS- I put saran wrap over my head to help with processing my dark brown hair and leave it on for 50 minutes, - about the same if I m doing roots, then do the ends for 5 mintues. then rinse) the saran wrap helps with getting a lighter color...I really like this they oughta make a version for great 100 percent grey coverage like excellence products from loreal. im 50 but luckily my family greys later in life. mom didn't get greys til age 60  .  but gotta switch over to excellence when I start getting greys."
1,"Just love this steam hair setter!!  Have used them for many years, does not dry my hair out nor cause split ends.Way fast for fixing hair style to start your day.  Try it, you won't be sorry!"
0,"I know I may be tarred and feathered for saying this considering the reviews for this product, but I really hated this stuff.  Out of all the foundations I have used in my life (revlon, lancome, avon, prescriptives, bobbi brown) this is, in my opinion, by far the worst for oily skin I have ever used... and many of the others aren't so great either so that's really saying something.  Its possible that if your skin is either dry or combination this foundation will work.  My skin is very oily.  In about 30 mins after applying this foundation, my skin looked drab and patchy.  It looked like I had powder caked on my skin and it felt awful.  Applying more of the foundation just made it worse... and after wearing this stuff for a whole day my skin looked like someone had splashed water and oil on my face (lol).I was so displeased that I gave it away.  Apparently, this makeup works for many many people and feels and looks great.  It did not work well for me and it is an expensive product.  I guess one never knows until one tries..."
1,"Absolutely love this cream.  I have combination skin with oily t-zone but my skin dries out near my cheeks, near my eyes and chin.  I use this cream twice a day--once at night after a shower and once in the morning after washing and cleaning my face.  A lesser moisturizer would result in dry skin by lunchtime but this cream really keeps my skin moist and soft.  Super safe around eyes and works into skin really well.  No added scents!  I've tried lots of different moisturizers and this one is by far the best."
1,"Powerful, and my hair looks good. No complaints on this hairdryer so far. I don't use any of the attachments though."
1,"After purchasing this product from the vitamin shoppe, I decided I would wait till the spring , but I decided to try it now. I have natural hair and its braided right now, I applied castor oil and the Aloe Vera Gelly and my hair is soft I also mixed this gelly with my dabur vatik coconut oil . this is a great product I should have order two."
0,I was under the impression that it'd be a good nude for me to wear but its too cool for my golden AA skintone. Its a good product but this color struck out with me.
1,This is the best I ever used. I like it very much. It makes my life full of good-hair day.
1,This smoothes your feet quite nicely. The handle bends just a little and it does feels like the handle will break but the handle does not break. I just used two fingers to brace the back of buffer and it does a WONDERFUL job. Feet smooth as a baby's bottom. This buffer #11 REALLY WORKS; I do not understand the negative reviews I saw.
1,"Philosophy's ""Help Me"" is by far the best retinol skin cream I've ever used (and I've tried quite a few different ones, in all price ranges)!  Originally I'd purchased Philosophy's ""On A Clear Day"", which is their retinol cream for acne-prone skin, thinking it would be better for me, as I have sensitive skin that tends to break out easily.  For some reason though, ""On A Clear Day"" actually contains MORE moisturizing ingredients than ""Help Me"" does (one of them being hyaluronic acid) which makes no sense, as it's for acne prone skin (which you'd think would need LESS moisturization)!  Anyways, the ""On A Clear Day"" made a horrible mess of my skin, I was broken out, oily, and gross.  I returned that cream and exchanged it for the ""Help Me"" (even though a part of me was thinking I should try a different product line altogether, due to my awful experience).  Let me tell you, it was the best thing I could've done!  From the moment I started using the ""Help Me"", my skin has been getting better and better.  It cleared up the break out I had going on and the overall look and clarity of my skin has improved dramatically.  I haven't noticed a huge difference when it comes to fading scarring or anything, but that would probably take more time to clear up.  I use this a few nights a week (without adding a moisturizer on top -I think that's a bit overkill, this lotion is enough to handle mild to moderate dryness) and have not had any redness, irritation, peeling, breakouts- nothing!  Just perfectly moisturized, glowy skin!  I haven't noticed any burning or discomfort when applying it either (some retinol creams can burn or sting upon application, especially if you have sensitive or freshly waxed/shaved skin or something) Unfortunately, you don't get a whole lot and it's a bit pricey, but a little does go a long way, so depending on how often you use it, it could last you for a while.  Plus, the product WORKS and works really well, which I think makes it worth the cost.  When I use up the tube I have, I plan to move on to a prescription-strength cream (Retin-A) that my doc prescribed for me, so I most likely won't repurchase the ""Help Me"", at least not for a while.  However, if I am unhappy with the results the Retin-A gives me or if it disagrees with my skin, I will absolutely go back to using the ""Help Me"" instead!  A great product that I completely recommend to anyone looking for a highly effective, yet gentle, retinol cream!  As a general rule though, you really can't go wrong with Philosophy products!  The facial moisturizer is great (though smells funny after application), as are the body washes (which smell great and can multitask!) and the body lotions (which leave you dewy, glowy, and smelling great)!  A great product from a great product line, 120% recommended!EDIT 10/20/11-  Okay, so I've finished my tube of ""Help Me"" and began using prescription Retin-A and I must say, I think I prefer the ""Help Me""!  It has a much better texture (the RX cream is quite thick and heavy), is gentle on your skin, but still delivers awesome results.  The RX cream is stronger so if you use it too frequently, you will peel and get irritated.  Plus it's much heavier and thicker so it would probably not be best for oilier skins.  So I think the ""Help Me"" is totally the better way to go, especially if you're sensitive or oily and looking for something gentler that will still deliver noticeable results!"
1,"I bought this because i broke a few ""teeth"" off of my older comb and it took me forever to decide what could possibly replace it since i was so use to it.This does the job just fine which is fantastic!! Its great and very easy to tease your hair but it is also great to make beautiful zic-zac's or get a perfectly tight ponytail..:)Yes its plastic but its very sturdy and i know it will last me a while."
1,with just 1 month of using this product my skin already feels so much smoother.  for people that wear makeup this is great for it soaks in very fast and doesn't just lay on top of the skin before you put your makeup on.  i have it delivered monthly and i use in the am and pm.  if it's been a very warm day i put it on again in the afternoon.  love that it has a sunscreen in it.  no such thing as using too much of this in the florida climate.  i highly recommend this.  i don't see however that it would work well for excessively dry skin.
1,"This was a fabulous purchase on my part. So glad I got it. The close up mirror is perfect for makeup application. I even find my husband using it to look at his face close-up! The chrome color is great. It was easy to attach to the wall. The only thing is with the constant turning of the mirror around and around, the little nobs on the two sides get loose, so just make sure to tighten them every once in a while."
0,I expected so much more from this because of its reviews. However im not impressed. My hair feels the same after using this.
1,"This product is to be used as part of the Acquarella system, and will not work with conventional nail polishes.  I adore this nail polish system:  it's easy and the results are beautiful.  As soon as I received them, I read the instructions on every product completely, followed all the instructions exactly, and I now always sport a gorgeous pedicure.  The polishes dry quickly and wear extremely well.  (I don't usually use polish on my fingernails, I use a simple two-sided nail buffer & shine block on my fingernails--anything more & my nails grow too fast [I'm a pianist] and I don't want to have to take the time to file my fingernails more than once a week.)The entire Acquarella system must be purchased and used in order for any & all of the products to work:  1) Buffer Kit, 2) Remover, 3) Conditioner, 4) the nail polishes are optional & you can use just the conditioner as your only polish.  I also bought four of the nail colors: French Kiss, Pink-a-Boo, Plasma, and Aristo--I prefer traditional colors in the creme opaque and translucent colors, and all of these are gorgeous.  I'm going to buy also Prissy and Brave.  Also, there are no obnoxious smell or fumes in any of the products.The colors come off easily when using the remover exactly as directed, the polishes apply easily & quickly because of the good brushes & polish consistency, and dry quickly.  I bought this system because I was looking for an organic/natural nail polish product, and I am so happy with it I'm not interested in using any other nail polish product of any type, organic or otherwise.  It is so much better than any other nail polish products I have ever used, conventional or otherwise.  Had I known how good this stuff is, I would have abandoned conventional nail polish years ago even before I started using all organic beauty & household products."
1,"I have been using bare minerals for years. It looks very natural when on, and I don't feel like it settles into all my pores. I am very pale, and go between this shade and the light shade. The different brushes for application really do make a difference in how it covers. If you have a store near you. I highly recommend going in with no make up on and having them make you over. It really looks so smooth and nice, and doesn't melt off your face in the summer."
1,"Does the trick, and I trust the brand.  I wish it had a push-open spout for drops but not a real minus."
1,"I think my skin is especially receptive to vitamin C creams-- I started with the Avalon Organics Vitamin C Renewal Creme and loved its fresh scent and hydrating properties, but without SPF, there's not much opportunity to use it. Since switching to this product I've been able to use it much more frequently and the little crow's feet starting to show under my eyes are disappearing (age 34). My skin has gotten softer too. I look at least 3 years younger after only a few weeks. Here's hoping this lasts! This is a rich cream so it's probably best in dry weather."
1,Love this mirror. So easy to install. Two sided w/one side magnified for close up. Very stylish looking hanging on the wall.
1,"I bought this at a local store for just 3 dollars,and I wanted to know what the hype was about.Typically, I use more expensive products on my face,believing that they will do the trick, but I was proven wrong.Despite the low price of this, it works very well, and there is agenerous amount of it in the package. I recommend it, it stingsa bit, but really does what it says! I do also feel a bit of tightnessfrom it, but other than that, this is a great product and has a priceyou really can't beat."
0,Very disappointed in this product. Didn't work for me at all.  The suction was not very powerful.
0,"I bought this product and thought i would be very happy with it, I was not, It snagged and quit and was overall a piece of crude. Very unhappy with this purchase."
1,"My experience with OPI nail polishes are limited to this color and Midnight in Moscow, neither of which come off anything like they look like in the bottle.  Both colors look dark and have no shimmer unless the light hits them just right.  However the quality is superior in the OPI polish in terms of wear.  They wear like steel even if you do housework while wearing them.  With minor use of my hands I could see these lasting a week.  I'm also not a fan of polishes that take many coats.  Mainly because it takes longer to do my nails and then there is more risk of the nail getting messed up during that longer process.  I'm only going to buy certain colors of OPI in the future since my cheaper brands are working out great (like wet and wild, revlon and sally hansen)."
1,"This stuff is great for anything you want to keep out of your kid's mouths.  My daughter would absent mindedly chew on her iPod headset cord.  A quick coating of this stuff, just on the section she put in her mouth, cured her of that potentially expensive habit."
1,It's hard to tell if a product is really natural or organic without checking the Environmental Working Group data. But I use this product anyway and it's very nice. It leaves my skin soft and clean without perfume.
1,"This review is from: Suave Naturals Shampoo, Daily Clarifying 15ozThis shampoo does clean the hair, but it leaves thinning hair blowzy and dry. It does not moisturize in the least. There is a scent to the shampoo, too, which, while slightly feminine isn't potent and clinging, surprises this consumer because this shampoo is advertised as hypo-allergenic. Scents do cause allergic reactions in certain people, as Amazon reviewers here attest. The scent doesn't cause me any allergic responses like headaches.What bothers me is that though this shampoo is for normal to oily hair, it strips the hair of all oil, leaving it clean but very dry.  Only a good conditioner can remedy the problem this shampoo causes. Also, this product contains the infamous lathering carcinogen, sodium laureate sulfate."
1,"First time I have used this make and product.  I was getting so tired of the brassy look with the other brand.  I loved the color.  It is a lighter brown but very natural looking.  Doesn't drip like the others when applying and didn't have that awful, eye burning smell like my old brand.  Will continue to use."
1,this stuff works noticeably well and very quickly. great bang for the buck. just a dab goes a long way.
1,"I've tried a few different face moisturizers and so far this one is my favorite. It's SPF 30, and lightweight. It absorbs quickly, has no fragrance and hasn't caused breakouts--a small miracle since I have very sensitive skin. It's very affordable, too. I think I paid a total of only $7 or $8 for two 4 ounce bottles."
1,"I have sensitive skin that tends to get red when I put any cream on my face. This 30SPF lotion leaves a white shiny film on my face and the skin looks a little pinker because of this. No, I don't use too much at once, actually not enough (I know that we should use one tablespoon for the face for perfect cover, I use less than a teaspoon). I used other SPF 30 creams and did not have the effect.The pro is that sensitive skin won't react bad. I had no burning or tingling from this product. Just won't use it because I don't want to look white/pink and shiny"
1,"A few years ago I began struggling with mild to moderate adult acne.  You can read some of my other reviews to get an idea of all the different lotions & potions I've tried to rid myself of it, if you so desire.I tried to use a dermatologist, but the prescribed cleansers dried out and irritated my skin. I ended up taking Doxycycline, a prescription antibiotic.  While the Rx helped, I still needed to promote healthy skin from the outside, obviously.I ended up buying a Clarisonic Mia 2,Clarisonic Mia(TM) Skin Cleansing System - Pinkwhich ended up significantly helping my acne.  I just needed to find the right cleanser to use with it.  Somehow I stumbled across PTR BHA wash on Sephora.com and even though the price made me raise an eyebrow, I decided to try based on the great reviews.Between the PTR cleanser, my Clarisonic, and the antibiotics, my skin started to look excellent! It's clean, fresh, soft and my acne is finally somewhat under control.Something to keep in mind with the price is, one bottle lasted me probably 4 months.  You only need a dime-sized amount; especially if using w/ the Clarisonic.When I finally did run out of the PTR BHA wash, I thought I'd try a different cleanser in a moment of frugality.  I tried the Clinique foam wash and was horribly disappointed by it; especially when my acne started rearing its ugly head. I returned the Clinique as soon as I realized the mistake I'd made and went running back to PTR.  And wouln't you know, the acne started to clear."
1,I used this product twice a day.  It did not always remove my makeup or just daily dirt.  Using a toner help to remove all the left on dirt and makeup this product did not remove.  I did leave face feeling moisturized.  I was not drying at all to my combination skin
1,"I've been using this mineral foundation for over five years because it is the best I've tried. I experimented with cheaper mineral products from a drug store, but I didn't get the same flawless coverage. The coverage is very natural looking. You can control the amount of coverage you are looking for by simply applying more or less of the product. Again, this stuff is the best, and it continues to receives high ratings in magazines for a reason!"
1,"I was disappointed some what in this product. The ingredients have changed, its differently not the same, the product used be thicker, and works were better in the past."
1,"I got the Essie polish on sale, for the price it looked worth a shot. From the first coat I was impressed, it goes on smoothly and evenly with little effort! No bubbling or streaking! Even with two coats, it was perfect!Two coats, a topcoat, and this polish lasted me two whole weeks. I work with my hands a lot and do a lot of typing, so this was pretty phenomenal. For the price point of this polish, I really didn't expect a whole lot.This color looks very red, very bright, in the bottle. I almost didn't get it, but decided what the heck. (Imagine my surprise to see the color name, I would hope you don't see this color after ..well...but anyway)I am very fair and red normally looks horrible on me for everyday wear, but this color really warmed up my skintone. It looked good on my shorter length nails, too. I expected it to draw attention to the fact that my nails were so short but this is a very rich, deep, living color. It has just enough metallic to not look flat and uninteresting, it gleams ever so slightly as you move your hands. So pretty!The plus side is that I didn't get any staining afterwards, and it was easy to remove. Even with a basecoat red seems to cause problems for my nails but this was easy on, easy off, and I loved it. Great product and I'm an Essie convert when I want regular polish! (You should try gel nails...but that's a different review!)"
1,"Since my thyroid was yanked out, my nails have become dry and brittle.  I tried biotin for a couple of years, and it did nothing to help.  I've tried various oils and nail &#34;treatments,&#34; with no success.  I tried Solaroil based on the very positive reviews, and while I'm sure it's a great product, it did nothing to improve my nails.  So far, the only thing that appears to work is Johnson's Baby Oil Gel.  I use it as a hand &#34;cream&#34; at least once a day, working it into my nails as well.  The downside is that it's oily and takes a few minutes to absorb, but it's the only remedy that works for me."
1,"This Olay Regenerist Serum is perfect for me.  I don't like to use makeup on my face.  This serum feels soft, smooth, and is not oily at all.  No makeup needed.  Just seven pumps of the container is all I need for my entire face and neck.  It feels great all day.  There is no fragrance to bother me.  It is a really good skin product."
0,"Buying this face lotion was not a good idea. Used just a pea-size amount & it sat right on top of my skin. No moisturizing - just whiteness. No, I will not recommend this product to family & friends; neither will I waste my money purchasing again."
1,"This is a lightweight, silky moisturizer that does not leave you greasy. I have noticed improvement in the skin... less wrinkles, less breakouts and not as dry."
0,"Didn't like the texture of this lotion. I was using it to remove my make up and didn't have any success. I would wash my face with it, then use Bioderma Sensibio H2O and I could see all the makeup I had left on my face. I gave it to a friend that uses it in the morning."
1,Does the job! Can't use with a very hot blow dryer the bristles will melt. But it does good with low heat styling tools.
1,"Beautiful color, so pigmented. I just can say that I love REVLON products and I will get more of their stuff."
1,"This mask is one of the best I've used. I even like it better than LUSH masks. The smell is very nice and mild, it smells almost like candy. Very sweet but not intrusive. The mask itself it easy to apply and dries very quickly. Remove it quickly or else it can get uncomfortable when it's completely dry. Other than that this will fix your acne. Great!!"
1,"I purchased these based on all the great reviews and they're really worth the price.  I specifically use them to remove my eye makeup given that the eye area is more sensitive and these are extremely durable, gentle and soft.  Will definitely be repurchasing in the future."
1,great stuff and great price!! i have to write 15 words so i am writing more and more. i hope this helps your purchase :-)
1,"The mask is refreshing and fun to peel off but I wouldn't say it'll do anything for your acne. If you're looking to clear out your pores, get a tough charcoal mask, if you're looking for something fun, get this."
1,"My lashes are long, thick but unfortunately straight  I only use the mascara to highlight them and keep them curled after using the curler on them.I have been using Estee Lauder&iexcl;s product for but a friend insisted this is just as good. Estee&iexcl;s mascara is $20+ for a new tube. I figured I have only $5 to lose if this works just as well.I&iexcl;m impressed. I really like this product. I now own both the regular and waterproof. No clumping or flaking.Cannot believe I&iexcl;ve been paying for Estee Lauder all these years when this works just as well for me. The only negative is I really dislike the tiny, hard brush and prefer Estee&iexcl;s brush but for this price I can definitely get past that."
1,"As you know, in most cases you get what you pay for.  This product line performs and you will notice a difference with daily use. Don't forget....any skin program is null and void if you don't use sunscreen 365 days a year. You're just wasting your money purchasing anything for your face if you don't use a broad spectrum sunscreen."
1,ive only used once so far so good we will see nice price I hate spending much on toners but I  do like this one so far too soon to tell ifi will use long term but we will see.
1,This product works well to hold garments in place. It does take a bit of scrubbing with soap & water to get it off the body afterwards but it wasn't bad. It works well.
1,"I love this facial cleanser. It is light and foamy and your face doesnt feel dry after using it. The only thing is when you first use it your face breaks out at first due to all the hidden dirt in your face, hence the four star. That only happens in the first week. After that, my skin was so smooth. It even smoothed out some of my eye wrinkles!"
1,"Have only used it for a week or so, but it seems to work ok.  I like the clean smell and the way it lathers."
1,"The RoC night cream effectively enhances the benefits of RoC's daytime moisturizer and sunscreen.  Some retinol is removed by sunscreen, so the night-time dose works unaffected all night while the skin restores itself.  If you have sensitive skin, you might want to build up to 24/7 retinol in a gradual fashion.  I'd suggest skipping a night or two of the night cream now and then until you build up to every evening.  RoC makes effective products!"
1,This cleanser is perfect for sensitive skin. I've used other products in the past that caused breakouts or dry skin. This one does neither because it's so gentle. It's also less expensive compared to the other other brand name products.
1,"Based upon the ingredient list alone with SLS as the fourth ingredient, I can't help but wonder why they call this ""skin relief"" and give this product 3 stars because Aveeno should know better.

0,"I am one of the dupes that sprung for this garbage.  The product is old time packing tape cut into odd shapes.. get some packing tape and make your own for about $2.00.  The tape would have more glue and they might even stay on.. these ""frownies"" wont stay on, no matter what hype the company says.. DONT BE A CHUMP like me. I blew  $20 with shipping for some slightly sticky packing paper"
1,"Have tried an awful lot of night and day moisturers.  So far, this one is working, especially since the air is so dry, with the heat on.  Would recommend this product, unlike other products, this one seems to sink in and make my skin glow."
1,"I LOVE this consealer! Infact, I love it so much that I use it as my foundation. It does it all. It's getting hard to find though. When it was discontinued at my Walgreens I panicked! Thank God for Amazon!"
1,I think this is a lovely product and I love the smell of coconut but it can be pricey so be careful what you pay for it.
1,"I ran out of Thursday Plantation tea tree/sulphur shampoo. I live overseas now, so I tried switching to this which I can find at the commissary.Thursday Plantation Tea Tree Deep Scalp Cleansing Shampoo (6.7 fl oz)My hair looks fine, but by the end of the day I have an entire layer of residue on my scalp and it itches like crazy. I'm tempted to throw it away."
1,"This moisturizer is perfect if you live in part of the country that has cold, dry winters and you have combo skin that tends to breakout. I may be close to 30 but I suffer from combo skin and the occasional breakout like a teenager. I formerly used products that contained salicylic acid because it claims to clear up/prevent breakouts. Not for me. So in my continuous search for a miracle product I decided I would give this a whirl - the packaging just looked clean and simple - yes, I was hoping the packaging was an indicator of what the product would do to my skin - make it look clean. And that it did! This moisturizer was perfect for the Midwest winter months and into spring and even fall. However, it was a little too moisturizer for the Midwest, soupy summers (my skin was a little too ""dewey"" by the end of the day).Be sure to try out the Purpose Facial Cleanser with this product! It is just as amazing for combo, breakout-prone skin. And it's super affordable!"
1,I've had clear nail polishes before that always are too thick or too thin. This is just perfect for a base coat and a top coat.It has a large brush to I only really need to sweep across my nails once and it gets the whole nail bed.I did notice though that I had to do 3 coats across my KB Shimmer Oh Splat! because it has large sparkles in it.But aside from that I love it!
0,"I purchased this product about 6 weeks ago. I'm in my late 20's and have severe environmental allergies with dry, sensitive, blemish prone skin. This product has not been effective in treating my mild acne. It's very drying and almost makes my skin worse!  It seems to exacerbate the area and cause more zits to form.  Plus, it's rather pricey for the amount of product you receive. It seems like a lot of great things are advertised on the packaging that are impossible to occur in the typical person's 8-hour night sleep.. Don't be fooled by the promises!"
1,"i am almost finished with the jar,it does moisturize my curly hair really well,i put it on at night and shampoo out,it doesnt smell that bad,a bit herbal,however i dint have any growth from using it,maybe it works for some people not all,but i would buy again simply as a good moisturizer or oil treatment."
1,"I am 32 and suffered my whole life (since 8 months old) from atopic dermatitis. The many skin and blood tests I did always turned out negative, but it is clear I am allergic to fine powders: as soon as I come in contact with dust, baby powder, cat dander, chalk, etc etc, I start scratching like crazy. Carpet in particular attracts so much dust, and it is in every single apartment (and I cannot afford a house). So that means (actually used to mean) constant itch for me.This lotion, along with the aveeno intense moisturizer that comes in jars, has been nothing short of a miracle for me. It creates a film on the skin that lasts for a whole day, and it is not greasy so it does not attract dust and fine powders. My chronic itch has stopped from the first day I have used it (few months ago). Since I started using it, I have not had a single episode of extended rash, while for my whole life I had to cover myself in cortisone not to have constant extended itch.I am SO grateful for this lotion. I had lost any hope to find a ""cure"" for my dermatitis, at least in my lifetime. I saw dozens of dermatologists over the decades, and I have been prescribed tons of different lotions. Yet none helped, before the aveeno moisturizers.Although this lotion is technically not a cure for atopic dermatitis, since atopic dermatitis is a genetic condition, it effectively stops all symptoms. My life is now normal. It is awesome to be able to spend days and nights without being tormented by unbearable itch.I just hope Aveeno does not stop making its moisturizers, and that they do not change the formula!"
1,"I like the way this goes on and the cooling sensation. The thing is, it takes WAY too long to dry. Like, almost an hour if not more, depending on how much you put on. I'd go with something else if you can."
1,"It felt a little waxy at first, but I had been using pure almond oil on my lips for a while. The almond oil seemed to dry out my lips a little using it on its own so I decided to try this chap stick. I got used to the feel and my lips are softer. It seems to seal in the moisture more than just the oil."
1,"This is one of my favourite lip balms.  It really is a very basic one, but it's soothing if they are a little sore, and it really does put moisture back into dry lips.  It's PABA free, and has a good sun block in it so it's great during summer time, but definately in winter when your lips might be dryer, it's a big help.  It goes on smoothly and doesn't clump up which is great.  The one thing I can't understand, is why it's so hard to find in drugstores because it's not discontinued, but just not in big supply.Give it a go if you've been allergic to other brands or if you find other brands too heavy.  This is so good and does a fantastic job.  I really love this one."
1,"Wonderful  specially for curly hair.  Gentle, I do not lose hair when combing with this. I brought more and gave as gifts."
1,3 weeks without chewing my nail. It is my new year resolution.Hopefully I can totally quit it. This is a very useful tool for people have years of chewing nails habit.
0,"Original Review:It goes on a little bit like sunscreen...same consistency and same smell minus most of the shine. My skin is generally a tiny bit shiny after applying , but not overly greasy. the shine fades away pretty quickly leaving a nice radiant effect. So far so good. I've been using it for about a week and a half and my skin is looking pretty good. It's not overly hydrating I've found, so if you're looking for more of a wet lotiony consistency, this might not be the moisturizer for you. It offers great protection for being in the sun, though.After Continued Use:I started to notice a very mild burny sensation after using this product. I never really payed much attention to it in the beginning, but I really started to notice it after continued use. I get tiny tiny red bumps on my cheeks also from using it and it gives me sort of a ruddy appearance. I love the Neutrogena sun screens. they do not have this burny effect on my face, but this for whatever reason does. I gave the rest of my moisturizer to my mom to use and it's just fine for her, but my skin is sensitive."

1,"Boyfriend bought this for me because he knows I like amber-based perfumes. This stuff has a slightly woody, earthy scent, but that fades a bit and leaves behind that lovely, sexy amber note. Boyfriend finds it irresistible. A little goes a long way, too."
1,"The zinc molecules are too large to absorb into your skin leaving the skin with a "" chalk "" like look.  Will without a doubt block the harmful UVA / UVB rays.If you're into protection 100 % this is for you. If you're vain.......don't complain."
1,~A great deal and super fast shipping. It's amazing how fast it heats up. And it gets very hot on high.
1,"I have only used this for the last couple of weeks.  I break out very easily, and was worried this would break me out, but it hasn't!! Yay!!I use this once a day in the morning under my makeup.  I love the sunscreen smell.  It is very light and feels good on my skin.  I am mainly using it to prevent wrinkles. I don't have any yet, so I can't comment on this making them less noticeable.  I think my skin looks only better, though.  I have had a male co-worker say I look ""fresh"" just out of the blue.  It makes my skin look real healthy and dewy.  No acne and just really nice looking skin.  So I am very happy."
0,"I bought this product coz of the rating... Now I hear that the reviews are spoof..Check this ""15 of these 5-star reviews are spoofs"", April 25, 2011 By 42bunny""It may look like this product has a high number of positive reviews, but looking closer you'll see that 15 of the 5-star reviews (all posted on Nov 30, 2010) are comedic, or rather, attempts at comedy. ""Hmmmm....Update 29th Aug 2012 - I heard from two separate friends that my lower face looks swollen."
1,These are not the cutest headbands but they do keep you from getting a headache. The design stop short of the ends and looks a little funny but if you style your hair to cover the ends it looks fine. Wouldn't wear with a pony tail though. It would look a little funny. Like that they match with almost anything and don't make my head hurt.
1,Great product. I get little to almost no wear on the tips of my nails. I put a coat on them everyday for the first 3 days and then every other day. I also use the rejuvacoat as a base coat which is also great!!
1,"I am particular about my hair and have to carefully find the correct brush.  This brush is unlike the picture. This is a mini brush  and must be designed for very small children. The measurements indicates a brush that is almost 7"" but the brush I received is only about 4""....don't buy this if you're wanting a full size hair brush. I am giving it four stars on the basis that they sent the wrong brush."
1,This brush does what it says it will do. The only negative is that it is hard to get stray hairs out.
1,Love it!!!! Very bright and summerish.
0,"I didn't read the Ingredients  and found this product contain Mineral oil which can clog your pores. The Vitimin E it claims to have is 18th on the list.. my bad for not reading this first. Mineral oil is basically a petro oil, which is something that can make your car run in certain forms. It does not allow your skin to breath.."
1,"This brush works fine and feels nice, but isn't super special. I have a lot of hair and it would be nice if the brush head was bigger so I could cover more surface area."
0,"I didn't care for this at all.  Not only did I not notice any difference in the thickness of my hair, I didn't care for the way it cleaned my hair either."
0,There are many Aveeno products I love and work very well. This is a decent scrub minus the brightening. Aveeno needs to toss this one because the results (zero) make you feel like you are either not sure what brighter skin means or lied to.
1,"This is a good product - if you can find it for a discounted price. I used it for a while. It certainly won't clog your pores, and I'll wager that it is excellent for people with extra sensitive skin. I 'll vote that it works very well for younger women who want to start a firming treatment. (You can never start too early.) Great news: There are several new products in the Regenerist line that I like even better.&#34;A word to the wise, moisturize!&#34;"
1,"This smells exactly like cotton candy but not too sweet. I sometimes spray it at my office, just a few squirts. Everyone loves the scent and wonders where it comes from! I use it more as a room freshener rather than a body spray but I do spray into my hair every once in a while. Lasts a pretty long time. I bought two of these sprays and when they run out will be purchasing more!"
0,"After reading some of the reviews about OPI nail polish, I became obsessed with the brand. I went to get a manicure and on the SAME DAY (I'm not exaggerating) it chipped from one nail. The manicure did not last me a week (3 days tops). Very disappointing, waste of money. FYI: When I use Duri or Essie nail polish, it ALWAYS last for more than 5 days!"
1,silky texture and fragrance-free. packaging with pump will keep the ingredients stable during use. olay always provides good products with good prices.
1,"At first I was skeptical on how easy this would be to apply to my hair but it is actually really simple. After you rub it on your hair a bit it feels just like regular shampoo and you can easily clean your hair with it in the same way. You can feel that your hair is clean but it doesn't feel dry. My hair looks and feels so much more healthy after using this product. Instead of having dry, damaged hair it's nourished and silky. It's not every day you find natural products for an affordable price. Will definitely be purchasing again."
1,"I am 31 years old with extremely acne prone skin and cystic acne. The oils in this product are 100% noncomedogenic and this product does not cause me to break out.  I tried this product because I want something natural to help with acne marks and fine lines. I jumped straight to the 10% based on these reviews. The first time I used this I was breaking out terribly and so upset. I woke up in the morning and all of my acne was flat (no longer inflamed) and the redness reduced. I thought it was a miracle. So I kept using it every night (which was too often!) and had bad results until I figured out how to balance my usage. If you use it too often without adjusting to it, your skin will almost get a thin, hard, dry, red layer on top and no surprise, this will cause you to break out (which is why the company recommends starting at the 5% level). If you take a day or two off the red/dryness goes away and you can start over (I never peeled, but did have dry flakey skin from overusage until I found my balance). I found that from the start I could do 2 nights on, 1 night off. Now I am up to using every night and that has been the perfect balance for me. I would recommend starting with every other night if you haven't used the 5% version first. This product dries up pimples and gives your skin a nice glow. It hasn't 100% stopped my acne, but I have had severe acne and it is MUCH improved. I would compare the ""miracle"" effect to the effect you get from a slight sunburn on acne, it flattens acne and makes your skin look great (people with acne you probably know what I mean), however unlike a sunburn this is not damaging to your skin. As long as I do not overdo the usage and use a good moisturizer, it is great for my skin. I definitely recommend it."
1,I originally found this color in a nail salon while getting a pedicure.  I haven't been able to find it anywhere else but here.  The color is absolutely beautiful and I definitely recommend it!
1,"I have loved this lotion for years and was so sad when a local store stopped carrying it. The scent is light and feminine and goes well as a fragrance alone or many feminine perfumes, such as Tatiana. It is not greasy feeling, and absorbs immediately and truly makes your skin feel silky and smell beautiful. Seller was prompt ith delivery and the price is a great bargain. I will buy this again from this person!"
1,"Other Suave lines have worked better for me. This line isn't terrible, but it's just your average shampoo. At least that's how it was for me. It's worth trying since it's much cheaper than other brands. I did notice it slightly dried my  already-dry hair out. I didn't find it very moisturizing, hence the 3 star rating."
1,I love love love this sauna. It is very relaxing w/some tranquil music playing before you wash/moisturize your face. thanks
0,"Of all the Aubrey organics I have tried, this is the worst! It has a nice, creamy consistency and doesn't smell too badly, but it left my hair and scalp terribly oily. I suffered acne break-outs all over my forehead, behind my ears and on my neck where my hair touched my skin. Unless you live in a dry climate or have damaged hair, I strongly recommend you DO NOT use this product. Aubrey has plenty of other conditioners to choose from--my favorite of which is the Honeysuckle Rose formula."
1,This dryer works well with a round brush. I almost don't need to straighten it. It takes and extra few minutes but saves flat iron time.It's not too heavy but it feels well put together.
1,"I used this to wash my hands at a restaurant once and after smelling the clean, faint scent of geraniums for hours afterwards,  I came on Amazon and purchased it.  It is a very clean scent, but could be a little strong for anyone sensitive to fragrance.  For those that love Mrs. Meyer&#8217;s hand soap products, this is another to add to your rotation.  I switch between this scent, Honeysuckle and Basil."
1,This is my second perfume oil I have the love auric blends this is very lovely sent great seller fast shipping black opium is very different from what I normally wear iam more like fruity type perfume light sents kind of girl but iam very surprised with this and these perfume oil last all day long and great for trips and travel.Found a new perfume I like great job once again amazon you never seem to amaze me I can all ways find something on here.The perfume looks just like the picture did a great job with the shipping will deal with this seller again.
0,"I purchased this product because I was so impressed with the Alpha Hydroxy Face Lotion, as it leaves my skin bright and clear and I have minimal break outs, so I figured the facial wash would do the same.. So I stopped using my normal face wash and I used this product instead for about a month and I noticed more irritation if anything... It wasn't really stopping my breakouts just leaving my skin red with more bumps than normal. I thought using the both in conjunction would just work best but I'm starting to think my skin is too sensitive and cannot take too much of the same thing? I am not quite sure... but I'm going back to my old facial wash and sticking to the alpha hydroxy face lotion. Another thing is that facial washes really do not exfoliate your skin.. They just tone it.. and I think I need more exfoliation or I wish they had exfoliation beads in this product.. Maybe it would've worked better? Idk.."
1,"Yeah, fluffy. Texture and claims, both.It's fine. I'm a little on the drier side, so I'm not inclined to use this without a serum. By the same token, though it's not too moist feeling, I don't find myself thinking I'm dry.I feel like I'm going through my jar more quickly than I go through other things.It's an absolutely serviceable moisturizing cream that I would use again, but there's so many other things out there that have wowed me more.The name amuses me because years ago that's exactly the phrase I would use in explaining that I sold beauty products. I should have copyrighted before philosophy did."
1,"I could go on forever touting the praises of Witch Hazel for your skin.  I have used it after cleansing my face for more years than I can remember. I do remember using it when I was a very young girl. And I never had a blemish, even when I was a teenager. I have always had great skin.  I do think that Witch Hazel keeps my skin ph balanced. I am going to be 73 soon and I get compliments on my skin all the time. I do not have any wrinkles and I do not wear any makeup. I do use Alpha Hydrox lotion too. And Ponds cold cream under my eyes.  Getting two bottles here on Amazon for the price I paid is a great deal. I hope they never quit selling it.  A bottle lasts a long time.  I stick with the stuff that works and believe me, you cannot go wrong using Witch Hazel, Google it and see all the wonderful things it can do for your skin"
1,This si great its not too sheer really looks natural but gives an even color.  Good quality polish. I will buy again once I am out
1,"I have had one tube of this for a couple of years now and JUST ran out. I am feeling very yucky without it.I only gave it 4 stars because the consistency could be a SMIDGE more creamy, but it has decent staying power.For those who say that it doesn't cover the dark circles under the eyes, you will need to 1st use a concealer that is a shade lighter than your face's skin color first (or closer to a salmon color) and then lightly add this to the top. Watch some videos on YouTube about 'highlighting' and you will find that this color is perfect for those highlighting areas on top of your base/ foundation and normal concealer.Maybe there are better versions of this in the 'fancier' brands, but I am returning to buy this one because I know it works and takes off 10 years when used under my eyes."
1,"I can't believe that I find an acne cream that actually works!! I don't even remember how many creams, lotions etc.  I tried over the years until now for adult acne. This is the first time I really see some result and I even don't use it regularly. If you put it on at night you'll see the effect the next morning. Even if the blemishes don't completely go away the next day, they reduce down in size. It helps with the redness and the pain. I have a very sensitive skin and this doesn't dry out my skin. The only minor issue is that I don't think it is completely vanishing. Some white residue still stays but it is manageable. Overall very gentle yet powerful cream. Definitely recommended."
1,"I dance ballet on pointe a lot, and this spacer has been very helpful in not getting bunion formations on my feet. It's like it's not even there!"
1,"I first started using this Natural Progesterone Cream for my PCOS (Polycistic Ovarian Syndrome) in August.  As per the recommendations of Dr. John Lee.  I use it for two weeks on and then I'm off of it for two weeks and then I repeat the cycle over again, making allowances for my period when needed.  So far I have been most pleased.  It seems to be working exactly by the text book.  The first month my acne started clearing up.  The second month my acne was so clear my skin had a natural glow, to the point where I quit using the mounds of makeup I had been using.  By the fourth month, lo and behold, my period was regular and I had no signs of PMS.  (According to the natural health doctors PMS is all a sign of hormone imbalances.  We women aren't supposed to go through the torture conventional medicine has us believing is normal.)  My period was regular again by the fifth month.  (That has never happened to me before in my entire life, since I started at thirteen and a half.)  And now that the end of the fifth month is approaching, I'm starting to lose weight.  All of this is exactly as the natural Progesterone Cream treatment for PCOS is stated to work.  Therefore, I think those that call this the ""Cinderella"" hormone, are right.  It is absolutely marvelous.  When I first used it, I did gain about three or four pounds.  Which alarmed me, but I decided to heed the medical advice and follow the process.  Much to my delight.  As anyone who has PCOS knows, due to our hormone imbalances we have a lot of inner turmoil.  However, with this cream I feel such peace and tranquility inside.  So much so, that I'm at ease with both myself and others.  Incidentally, I'm also a singer.  And I've noticed that the quality of my singing voice has improved with this as well.  (The first month I did struggle some vocally with this cream, but it soon passed.)  I'll post more updates as I keep using it.  But for now, suffice it to say, this cream is my lifesaver.  And I am currently using it and intend to keep on using it.  Definitely five stars out of five."
1,"Just as you are going to bed, apply this lotion to your hands and feet. It is just bliss. Lavender is known for its ability to promote relaxation. This is the bottle I keep next to my bed for an evening treat. This helps to nourish your hands and feet while you sleep.This contains certified organic floral water and it retains all the original energetic and therapeutic qualities of the original plant. This is the key ingredient in the Avalon Organics Botanical Line that is simply delicious.Contains emollient rich moisturizers, plant oils (borage, flaxseed, jojoba, sunflower, sweet almond) and vitamins to nourish your skin. Some of the ingredients include: Extracts of calendula, green tea, camomile and sea kelp. Also contains beeswax, vitamin C, Vitamin A and Vitamin E.The scent is like a walk through a lavender field andthe essential oils might even sweeten your dreams.~The Rebecca Review"
1,I love these very quick heating rollers.  I only wish there was at least one more roller in the set to do my whole head of hair at one time.
1,"For the last 20+ years I have been looking to fill a void in my life. Well, look no further. This is actual &#34;HOPE&#34; in this jar. Me and my wife's skin is not only super soft, it's more vibrant and we fight off that cracked winter skin like the plague (we win by the way). Buy it, you won't regret it. It's not too thick, and blends in smooth and nice."
1,I used it for a few days and then stopped. It was drying my skin. I would not use it again. I did not get any positive results from this serum.
1,"After ordering this I received the ""Alba Even Advanced,"" so I assume this is the updated version. While the old one smelled like something crawled out of the sea and died on your face, this one smells like a bordello died on your face. I was willing to overcome the old smell since this product is wonderfully moisturizing and the smell dissipated rather quickly, but I don't know if I can smell like a cheap hooker all day..."
0,This is like using a waxy crayon on your roots.  It smears and it looks fake as heck on the hair.  I tossed this.
1,"On the first day I notice my hair was softer, smells amazing and you get a lot of product. After that I didn't notice a different but I'm guessing it's protecting my hair, since when i straighten steam comes up from the product burning instead of my hair"
1,"You know how they say the only thing you should stick in your ear is your elbow? Well, I have never followed that advice. :-)  I use Q-tips to get water out of my ears when I get out of the shower. Other cotton swabs don't have the cotton as tightly wound and cheaper discount brands have left little strands of the stuff behind - whether in my ears or when using for a craft project or other purpose.Also very handy for cleaning the grooves in your outer ear, Q-tips brand are the most comfortable. I have used other brands, but they feel like you're dragging a tree branch around your outer-ear, not smooth cotton.Good for cleaning your dog's or cat's ears as well (just don't put them in too far!) - and just a good product for about a million uses. I've even used them to get shoe polish into hard-to-reach groves in dress shoes - and Q-tips brand doesn't leave fiber strands behind like the others do!"
1,"This product is great for the price. It clears away most of my makeup (Minus all of the eyeliner) and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean without overdrying it. It doesn't deep clean or remove acne, but I wasn't expecting it to do any of that. I just use this is conjunction with a weekly mask + spot treatments for blemishes, and I'm good to go."
1,"I have very fine hair, but a great deal of it, and needed something for the shower to comb through conditioner. There are a lot of these on the market, but many of them break, and do not do a great job of making this an pain and snag free task. This one is sturdy and made for comfort."
1,i purchased it from sallys beauty supply. My hair is naturally dark blonde but ive been bleaching it since im 15 which means 5 years of bleaching my hair.. i decided to do my hair half black ... it faded pretty fast and it just doesnt look good on me since im really white..bleachng wasnt really an option for me because my hair is that damaged ... so when i did it yesterday i put half of the bottles in a bowl and put it on the hair thats brown.. left it on for more than an our and it turned red really light brown but not what i needed so i decided to do it again .. didnt do anything ... but i gotta say my hair is 0 damaged (if my hair could be getting any worse ?lol) it made it feel pretty nice actually...im gonna go ahead today and still bleach my hair but with less developer (?) so instead of using 30 or 40 i will be using 25 and some bleach and afterwards a toner to get the blonde i want..it smells reall disgusting.. im not sensitive with smells but that even made me sick ..it was all over the house . the best thing is probably to do it in the summer outside.. and just wash it out outside...I did not use Number 3 ..the lotion but i used a hairmask instead (thats what they also told me in sallys)..I would recommend this product but dont expect a miracle to happen..
1,"I HATE using sunscreem.  Positively hate it!  It feels and smells gross and makes my skin break out, but I absolutely had to start using it recently because of another skin product I began using, so I decided to give the Eucerin Protective Lotion a whirl.The Eucerin is by far the best sunscreen/-block I have found. I've tried Neutrogena and countless other mineral/sensitive skin sunscreens, and hated them all, but the Eucerin disappears on my skin better than most mineral sunblocks, has very little odor, and has caused no break outs, even during exercise.  I think it does a decent job of moisturizing when used on its own, but I do usually mix it with my  day cream, which probably reduces its SPF a bit, but it's not been a problem, and I'm really happy with the product."
1,"Ok, ok...I'll admit it. I'm a convert. Looking back I am able to see how silly I was - but at the time, purchasing Badger Balm just seemed...unnecessary. Like a luxury. Why pay for Badger Balm when I can use olive oil to work with metal clay (PMC) and use lotion to condition my skin the rest of the time? I would rather spend those bucks on more PMC!Or so I thought until I took the plunge and bought some Badger Balm. In my defense, olive oil is cheap. And readily available. And easy to use. And natural, so it's safe for kids and those with allergies. And a little goes a long way. But...BUT...those things said, there just isn't any comparison with Badger Balm. Talk about a little going a long way? Hello! Badger Balm has that covered. The smell? A light, fresh scent - nothing overpowering or stinky. It isn't greasy. Don't get me wrong - it does kind of ""coat"" your hands, but it doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy - or like you're helpless. You can still open jars with Badger Balm on...not so easy with regular lotion, impossible with olive oil slathered all over your digits!Badger Balm easily coats your PMC tools and work surface - without leaving everything ""slickery"", if ya know what I mean. It also seems to be a good skin conditioner in general - I finally remembered to put some on my feet when I went to bed - and it helped to soften the skin. I can see how using it on a regular basis could easily eliminate dry, cracked heels. (Not that mine were that bad, mind you.) This is the perfect moisturizer to throw in your purse.So here's the low down: I would buy this again. Especially since it seems the 2 oz pot I bought will last a very long time. I like this much better than olive oil for use with PMC. I'm not sure how it stacks up against regular lotion - since I live in a very dry climate, I'm a lotionaholic. Badger Balm takes up less space, won't spill if you're traveling, and like I previously said, doesn't leave your hands all lotiony. Or perfumey. (I'm using a lot of my own words...sorry!) However, I have a hard time remembering to use it instead of lotion. The price seems reasonable - especially since it lasts for so long. I think it's a good thing to keep around - which is definitely true for those needing a good release agent for PMC...however, I don't see it replacing my lotion anytime soon. To be totally honest, I'm not sure I see a huge difference between Badger Balm and Bag Balm - except the Badger Balm seems to be lighter. I would love it if someone would please explain why Badger Balm is better than Bag Balm (for use with PMC) - and how it's different. (I don't believe either is water soluble.) Anyway, you now have the skinny on Badger Balm and how it relates to olive oil, PMC and lotion...and even a bonus question about Badger Balm vs Bag Balm. Try it - I think you'll like it."
1,"I am very satisfied with this mosturizer. I am a big fan of Clean & Clear products. It feels light on the face and works well on combination skin types. It also has a nice, clean smell to it. You don't have to apply a whole lot of it on. I definitely recommend it."
1,"If I could only buy one beauty product for the rest of my life, it would be this cleanser.  It doesn't claim to do anything fancy. It gets your face clean.  Combine this with the Clarisonic and your face is so deeply cleansed.  I ran out and used some other cleanser for a week and my face broke out terribly, so evidently it keeps my face clear as well.  I LOVE IT!  I wish they'd take the parabens out, though.  :(  The parabens are there for shelf life, however, and that's good because a 16 ounce will last me a year and a half.  The 8 ounce container lasted nearly a year.  I love this cleanser!  Can't say it enough!"
0,THOUGHT THIS COLOR WOULD BE A PERFECT CHOICE FOR ME BUT IT PALED ME OUT.IT WORKED A LONG TIME AGO - BUT NOT NOW. :)
1,"I haven't been using this product long, but I feel like I am seeing an improvement in my skin after just a couple of weeks.  I can tell it's working because I get a mild burning sensation shortly after I apply it, but it's not bothersome and goes away after a short time.  The price is beyond reasonable."
1,"Aphogee has done it yet, again! The Aphogee Pro-vitamin Leave-In is outstanding! Whether you have hair that is bleached, damaged or otherwise chemically treated, this is the leave-in for you. It is water-weightless and can be layered under heavier leave-ins if/as needed. Praise isn't enough to describe this product's virtues. But, hopefully an A++ will suffice!"
1,This is a very interesting fall color that goes on supple and feels like silk on the lips. I like that it has just enough moisture so it doesn't dry out your lips. The only thing I advise you to do is exfoliate your lips with a little brown sugar and olive oil before applying to avoid any cake build up. I can't stress how relaxed and vamp this color is I just love revlon.
1,My one year old has had a bad case of ezema over the winter months and this is the best thing I have found for keeping it in check. We have to put it on her morning and night but it works wonders and she no longer has that scaly feeling or dry marks all over her skin. Definitely recommend!
1,without a doubt the best facial moisturizer I have ever used!  Tried hundreds and this one is the best!
1,"These are perfect for what I wanted them for, nail clean up! The tips aren't soft which makes that even easier."
0,"There was not much scent to the oil I received, and what little scent there was reminded me of Play-Doh.  I used the entire roll-on over the course of a couple of months with no improvement in the product's performance. (I had read that exposure to air helped release the fragrance.  Nope.)If this worked for you, I'm glad, but it did nothing for me.  Not recommended."
1,"My boyfriend purchased this for my birthday (my idea, thank goodness).  I say it's interesting because of how utterly ridiculous it looks when you're using it.  You have to make sure that your upper teeth are completely covered by your upper lip and that your mouth remains in an oval shape.  The device is cradled between the corners of your mouth, and you squeeze the device inward.  You might drool.  Needless to say, I'll be doing my facial workouts in private.  ;)Like many users, at first I was skeptical, especially for the price.  The cost seems a bit high, and I felt guilty that he paid so much.  I wanted this particular kit for the instructional DVD, which wasn't necessary.  There are a variety of videos on a popular tube site if one is interested in looking them up under ""Facial Flex Ultra"".  It's a simple gadget and comes with an instructional booklet.  I've only had it for a few days so I can't speak for it's efficacy, but I can definitely feel those muscles working, particularly in my cheeks and jawline.  I have no doubt that I will see results.  My main objective with this device is to tone my neck muscles.  The instructions say to lean slightly forward and keep your chin level to benefit this area, but I was feeling very little flexing there.  I felt much, much more neck muscle action when I tilted my head completely back (and less salivation).  I do as many repetitions as I can in 2 sets.I read the reviews before I added this item to my wish list, and I noted one from someone who complained that the cream was spoiled.  I can confirm this by saying that the cream smells very spoiled and I won't be using it (hence 4 stars).  The cream has a dense, waxy texture and has a light brown, bubbly appearance (according to images from the DVD, it should simply look pinkish in color and creamy).  This item was sold by Pro Therapy Supplies and fulfilled by Amazon.  It comes with a small supply of both 6 oz and 8 oz resistance bands (20 each) which need to be replaced weekly per instructions.  I found that I needed to double up on the 8 oz bands.  Replacement bands can be found both on Amazon and eBay.If you wish to forgo the DVD and cream, you can purchase this item at a lower cost here:Facial Flex Ultra."
1,I am sure it works well... but I always forget to use it daily.  So it is my fault that I don't know its results. It is very easy to apply though.(:
1,"I use this stuff with the Clarisonic Mia, which is perfect - you really have to leave this stuff on your face for at least 1 minute to get the most benefit from it.  It leaves a slightly greasy feel to your face after you wash it off.  Not in a bad or pore-clogging way, just in a pleasant ""not squeaky clean, not tight"" way.  I can even get away with skipping the moisturizer at night in the summer."
1,"This hand soap works great, and is nice and foamy so your hands just feel clean. No tryclosan so its not harmful to you or the environment!"
1,"This is one of the best face wash ever!!! I had used many brands, many just leave your face with""too much""... slippery...or dry. My skin is combination, dry to normal, this is perfect for me. The smell is wonderful, nice. This product leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. Love it and highly recommend it. The seller is one of the fastest on delivery service, received my product in matter of 2 or 3 days, on standard shipping!!! Got an excellent product."
1,"This doesn't produce as shiny a top coat as I like to see, therefore I withheld one star.  I cannot comment on the long term benefit of the nail strengthening portion since I haven't used it that long.  It seemed to perform pretty well as a base coat since the polish glided over it OK."
0,"When I curled my hair, by the time I got to the other side of my head, the first half of curls had already fallen out. Doesn't hold the curl at all. Hairspray didn't help. Returned the product and the hunt continues."
1,"Aveeno bath products are amazing.  They leave your skin soft and smelling wonderful.  This Lavender mix will help sooth you while in the shower or in the tub.  We have hard water but when using this, I don't have to put on lotion!"
1,"After reading that alternating cleansers was better for your skin than using the same one every day, I decided to try this one for every-other-day use. How I use it: Put about a nickle sized dollop on my fingertips and rub it into my face, then gently rinse by wiping off with a warm soft washcloth. I often put my face under the shower faucet for a brief 2-3 second rinse after that, too, which I know many skincare professionals discourage, but I find I get a better rinse that way, especially in the area where my face meets my hair.Basis is a thinnish gel consistency which feels great to the touch, and has a wonderful scent. It cleans well, though I found it wasn't very good at taking off makeup. For days when I don't wear makeup, it's just fine, but when trying to take off the usual foundation and powder, some was always left behind and I had to grab a second cleanser. For the usual oil, dust, etc., though, it's good.There's a slick feeling to the skin after you use it, which doesn't come off no matter how much you rinse. I wasn't fond of that at first but have come to get used to it. That alone was enough to make me decide not to buy a second bottle.But the biggest problem was for the more delicate skin under and around my eyes. I'm 42 so my under-eye skin has definitely had changes since I was younger, and it's much less able to take a strong cleanser. Basis left red patches in the under-eye area near the nose, and though moisturizer helped, there were dry flakes left behind. Even if it looked okay at a glance, when I put makeup on it was very noticeable. I avoid that area now and it's all good -- my forehead, chin and nose were the oiliest parts anyway -- but unless your entire face is oily, this may not be the cleanser for you.I'm a little disappointed because the price, the consistency and the scent are perfect, but there are just too many cons for me to buy a second time."
0,"The prongs on this comb are cheap machine made plastic that is actually too sharp and scratchy to the touch to put through hair. Always test a new comb on your hand, and if it scratches your hand then it will cut at your hair strands damaging them. If you have short hair this would be fine because the sharpness is high up in the comb, but for mid back length heavy hair these teeth will absolutely ravage your hair. Sometimes you truly do get what you pay for so I suggest the wenn shower comb instead - it's excellent for thick or fine hair alike and it's extremely well made."
1,This is considered a drugstore mascara and it works beautifully. I wouldn't spend money on a high end mascara for clients when I can get the same results with a drugstore brand that is only a fraction of the cost and does just as good if not better. Great volumnizing and lengthening mascara.
1,"This is a pretty, professional color for work. I would like a jazzier color for off work time, but this is perfect when you need to look a little more demure."
1,"The Eucerin is a good product, but doesn't have any of the retinoids that CeraVe has.  I've used both, and come to the conclusion that I like the CeraVe better."
1,I have always loved Rainbath. It smells great and feels so soft on my skin. Neutrogena has a real winner in this product!
1,A little bit goes a long way and I love using this right after I wash my curly hair. It's not too heavy or light which I love.
1,"I can't say that I noticed any difference  with thickening between this conditioner and any other that I used, but it's a good conditioner.  It has a good texture and consistency and does moisturize and make the hair feel stronger.  However, I can't say that I noticed any thickening.  My four stars is based solely on the fact that it's a good conditioner and not that it created extra thickness."
1,"The NOW brand is reputable and this lemon essential oil is the genuine thing from what I can tell. It has the aroma of fresh lemon citrus, and the label has it at 100% pure. It should be used with caution as it is genuine essential oil. I use it for my hair scalp treatments (dandruff and sebum production regulation) and for soothing my cramps (when used as a blend). Works great!"
1,"This cloth is very tin and long.  I like that I can grab both ends and pull it back and forth to scratch my back like a bear.  When I recently had a self-tanning-fiasco (was told that it looked like I had been out climbing trees) this towel was my savior and removed almost all of the orange smears and the tops of me feet and ankles where it really looked like I had stepped in something nasty.  The cloth rinses clean easily and goes into the washing machine with no issue.  Also, the times I have forgotten to wash it for a while, I have never had it sour in the shower like washcloths can.  So I guess it is somehow anti-microbial, or at least resistant to getting stinky."
1,"I tried this because of the Amazon reviews.  I usually use gel polish, but the colors are so limited, and I had some new OPI polish to try.  I used the cnd base coat, then two coats of OPI, and then a top coat.  It lasted quite nicely for over a week.  I'm pretty hard on my hands (I'm a radiologic technologist), so for me, a week is good.  If your job isn't too demanding on your nails, it might last even longer."
1,"*Description from essie.com: ""a dusty dark pink. ""I was actually expecting something darker than this is. To me this is more of a peachy-pink. It is saturated enough that you don't need a lot of coats, but I wouldn't call it ""dark"" by any stretch of the imagination. I think I was expecting something more mauve. When I wore it on my fingers, I felt like it was really similar to my skin color (I'm quite pale, with a lot of red/pink. It really is a nice color though and I even gave a bottle of it to my sister and she told me she loves it. I think it's just not ""my thing"" right now, but who knows? It may grow on me."
1,"As my title says, it smells really nice and can't beat the price so I'm really happy with my purchase and will recommend to others."
1,"This really works & fast cured a heat rash in a hurry , now it's a must to have on hand"
1,This toner has eliminated my break outs.  I took a couple weeks off of it after it ran out last time and broke out like before I started using it.  I will make sure to order ahead next time!
1,This product makes my skin look smooth but I have to use it sparingly.  It can dry your skin so I use it every two days.  I like to use it under other products to enhance their benefits.  This is a good investment.
0,"I purchased this system at a ""Bed, Bath, and Beyond"" store. I used it, and I really did like the whole Facial Sauna System. However, not too long after using the system, problems did occur. The moisturizing sponge attachment wore down & eventually fell apart...And there's really no way to order a replacement. The other problem was that the actual Facial Tool eventually stopped working. I thought perhaps I needed to replace the batteries, although when I put new batteries in, it still did not work. So the only thing left that still works is the Facial Steamer."
1,"I started using this product about 4-5 months ago and I must say, I love this scrub! Its better than most scrubs I've used. Its gentle on skin, beads are very fine and it doesnt irritate my skin, smells heavenly and best of all, it doesn't make my skin break out nor makes it more oily. I've always had acne and had mild to moderate amount of acne scars on my face as well, with daily use for several months, I've started to notice that the scars are fading away, not completely gone but much less visible than before. Will definitely repurchase this! Also, price is great and a lasts a good while."
1,I mix with Now almond oil for skin care that is natural and products are not tested on animals.  Also skin has improved.
0,"Review about ""Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess"" by DayDream..When I smell this perfume oil product, I like smell, it's light and stay about 4hours on my body but on 4th day when I open this bottle and I don't get any scent smell. I thought I got cold but I asked my family members ""did you guys smell this??"" any scent smell is there? my family members laugh on me so badly, and we realized no more scent smell and it's ""just oil now""!! above half of the bottle still remains... I trashed it straight away..don't purchase this product by Day Dream.Yes I got Black opium from vendor name ""Xtremek"", that perfume oil still nice smell. I am more purchasing from Xtremek Black opium. but do not buy this ""Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess"" from ""DayDream"" this is the my bad experience of this product.... I tried similar products in India called ""Attar from Ratlam Aerochem is company name"" its nice one but bad luck that I don't get online so, I am trying this products now...don't waste money on this ""Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess"" by DayDream.Smell gone after couple of days or within 4days. Just think if you plan to gift someone this product after 4days???? ugghghhhhh???No smell.. No smell..- Thanks : HP"
0,this hot brush is not good as the brand name. it's not curl your hair and made from cheap material. I used it just only one time and put it in the closet.
1,"I used this product to take off eye makeup regularly, it works well.  It is light and fragrance free.  I will order it again"
1,"I love the smell of this toner!  Yes, it's roses, but a subtle rose instead of a fake perfume rose.  I also like the moisturizing qualities.  I do still experience breakouts using this toner, but I usually have to follow with a mild acne cream regardless of what toner I use.  I'd rather use this toner any day over the acne toners that dry my sensitive skin.  I took one star off because I find it leaves a mild film and slight shine on my skin, but since I use it at night it's not a big issue."
1,"Holy BA-GEE-ZUZ. I can honestly write a whole article on how amazing this product is, but I don't want to bore anyone.This product is simply amazing. Have oily skin? Use this. Oh, but is your skin dry as well? Use this. I just need a spot treatment though. Use this."
1,"I purchased this skin brush after learning about a technique called &#34;dry brushing&#34; (google it). It is supposed to increase blood flow, lymph drainage and help remove dead skin cells. If nothing else, it sure feels great! After reading the reviews, I chose to purchase this brush. It was just supposed to be my brush, but after seeing how good it felt, my whole family wants to use it (including my 2 year old). The bristles are coarse, but you are no supposed to use a lot of pressure. I was always told to only use the amount of pressure it would take to move a coin across the table. You just brush 2 minutes per day before showering and brush toward the heart (don't brush the face) using long gentle strokes. It feels great. I did see some reviews about the handle not staying on. The wood handle needs to be turned over and inserted that way, which is opposite from the way that you would expect the wood to slide in to the back of the brush. I made that same mistake when I got the brush, but turned the handle over and slid it on that way and it has never fallen off the brush since. The company should really put that on the instructions because I had initially thought that mine was useless as well. I would definately recommend this brush if you are looking for a skin brush. The price is reasonable. The handle is long enough to reach the back. The bristles are made from tampico fiber, which is the unbleached stem of the agave plant. The instructions say to clean the brush periodically with soap and water. Happy brushing!"
1,"I love the formula for the Revlon Super Lustrous Lipsticks - I own a handful of different shades and this was an excellent addition.  The lipstick is creamy but not sticky and doesn't bleed even without lip liner.  The shade is very opaque and gets good color on one swipe, but I find it has better staying power after a dab with some tissue and then reapplication.  The color itself is perfectly neutral for my lips, evens the color out slightly and adds the barest natural pink to my lips.  Not sure how that'll help other people, but I've got lightly tanned/olive skin tone for some perspective.  10/10 would buy again."
1,"I simply love this whole fragrance line. It's one of my favorites. I ""layer with this "" starting with the shower gel, then the body lotion, then the perfume. I get many, many compliments on it. It has a clean, just showered fragrance that lasts all day!!"
1,works just as it says it does. Makeup stays on all day and does not make the makeup smear. I like it alot.
1,"Okay, so I'm a guy... but yes, once a week I scrub my face with St Ives Swiss Formula Apricot Scrub.  I have gone through this ritual for about 20 years now.  I'm not crazy about the new scent, but this brand name item is the best out there.  (I've used the generic).  I'm 45 years old while writing this review... but I look at least 10 years younger.  Is it because of St Ives or is it genetic?  I'll never know... but I'm going to continue to use this product until I die.  Keeps my face smooth (makes it easier to shave with an electric) and keeps my pores open.  That's about all I ever wanted to use this for and I believe it serves it's purpose."
1,"I suffer from dry hands... My own fault - I hate to wear rubber gloves when I do things. This lotion is a saver. It has NO water whatsoever and all the good stuff. So, a good sugar scrub and an application of this later, my hands look like I've never done any housework in my life. Highly recommended. I know it's a body lotion, but the rest of me is not dry enough to waste this on... It is rich, so if your legs are dry from shaving, it will probably save them too."
1,Very nice color . I like this color and I can say that it complements every skin tone. And because the color is so intense a little is enough.
0,"I regret buying this. I'm 25 years old and notices I'm starting to get worry lines on my forehead, so I bought these hoping to do some proactive damage control. I don't want them to get worse. While these did relax my worry lines, I still think these things are terrible and a waste of money. Here's why:When you wake up, you'll have new lines from where your skin was pushed up against the edge of the frownies. Yes, they fade away after 20 mins, but this is how wrinkles form, over time you keep your skin in the same position and eventually it becomes a wrinkle. I don't want to use these products and then over time get NEW lines!They are hard to stick on and feel uncomfortable. The first few times you remove them, it's going to take hair with it, and it hurts.I wish I knew what the adhesive was made out of. You will feel a tingle and numbing sensation the first hour is is on. This worries me because idk what the glue is made of.Finally, these things aren't cheap. I was planning on using these daily to prevent further wrinkles, but they aren't cheap and they aren't good.I found another product that works better and it's cheaper! Medical tape. I use 3 pieces on my forehead every night. I don't wake up with new lines and it sticks easily without coming off or pulling my skin when I remove it. It's cheap, and I don't have to worry about what glue they use. I don't even feel them when I'm going to bed. Seriously, just go to the store where the first aid kits are, find the medical tape and have fun."
1,"This is a thick and creamy, lightly orange scented cream for face, neck or hands.  Very nice.Update...had to stop using this on my face. It makes my eyes burn and my sinuses close off.  I'll try it on my hands."
1,I use this product because you can change the color of the lipstick with the lip pencil that you use and because it is a nude lipstick it can be used on mostly any skin type.
1,"REALLY LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND KEEP RE-ORDERING.  IT DOES A SUPER JOB WITH OR WITHOUT MY CLARISONIC, YOU DON'T USE MUCH SO IT LASTS.  MAYBE A BIT EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH EVERY PENNY."
1,"I have moderately curly medium-length hair that's cut into a bob. Curly is okay, but with the front of my hair being longer, it is really fun to scrunch up my curls in the back and then relax the front into a soft page-boy look - and this is the PERFECT tool to do that. I've tried ironing my hair before, but the result is too stick-straight for me, but this makes my hair straight without making it too straight, if you know what I mean. This brush works the best if I take the time to dry my hair entirely using the brush, but it also works if I partially blast my hair dry and then use the brush, as long as I don't get it too dry. The untangle feature works great. I've accidentally gotten my hair twisted up in the brush a couple times, but with the touch of a button the brush was instantly and painlessly detangled with no damage to my hair. I highly recommend this product!"
1,Love this shampoo- my dog smelled absolutely amazing after his bath.  I think I found  &#34;gold&#34;- will be buying many more of this product.
1,"I bought a bottle of this years ago and just started using it again and fell in love with it all over again. I didn't remember wear I got it, nor did I know if they still made it. I found it here by accident and bought more. YAY! The great thing about this oil is that a little goes a long way and it smells delicious. Expensive perfumes just don't have this staying power. How can this be so good but so inexpensive? This has a casual, flirty scent that I love for every day."
1,"I have used this Aussie product for years. I have dry hair that tends to get frizzy, especially in the humid weather of the South. This product keeps your hair soft and smooth. I love the smell of all the Aussie products and buying this through Amazon's subscribe and save program, you get this at a great savings. I would recommend this product to anyone!!"
1,"This lovely shade of light pink is a new favorite for me. I'm glad I purchased it, and I've been wearing it quite often since. I will definitely repurchase. Like most shades of OPI that I've tried, it seems to be a color that would go well with most skin tones. My skin is a... medium brown I guess, and I get tons of compliments on this polish, especially in the summer."
0,"I was exited about getting this mascara because I had heard in some magazines that women all over loved it, but I was kinda annoyed when I saw that the brush was tiny and it really didnt do anything for my lashes, I recomend Milani Runway lashes mascara for about the same price but a much better product!"
1,"I read many reviews of many many hot rollers before deciding on this one. I'm very pleased with this--it heats up quickly, it's easy to use (no hot poles to burn your hand on as you reach for more rollers), it's compact and it works. I leave the rollers in for about 7 minutes and the curls turn out great. The clips are easy to use and they don't leave clip marks or dents. I would buy this exact same one if I had it to do over again."
1,I love Palmer's products. They keep your skin so soft and smell GREAT! They got this to me super quick. I use it all the time.
1,"I have very sensitive skin, especially in the winter.  I love this facewash!  Very subtle smell, if anything.  My face feels clean, but it does not dry out my face.  I definitely recommend it."
1,"My Dermatologist told me to start using this when I was 25 since i had a bad scaly patch and just could never ever get a grip on my dry skin. I have super dry skin and had been trying all kinds of stuff, even vasoline and olive oil. My skin is so dry it hurts after I take a shower. Anyway I've used this, and only this plus the other night one in the pump - and my skin looks awesome and I'm almost 40 now. I stopped when I was pregnant, and when I had the baby as these creams may not be good for pregnant ladies or infants (they don't know but it's a lot of vitamin A so play it safe). I just used coconut oil (straight) during those times. EVERYONE has always told me they CANNOT believe my age, I look way way young for my age. I can show you a photo if you want."
1,I HAD MY GALLBLADDER REMOVED AND SINCE ALWAYS HAD TROUBLE EATING.  NOW I TAKE ONE OF THESE BEFORE MEALS AND NO MORE BLOATING OR CONSTIPATION PROBLEMS.
1,"I love this soap -- it has fresh, clean scent that isn't too feminine or too flowery to be used as a kitchen soap.  I buy the large refill and use it to refill a decorative dispenser that I use at my kitchen sink."
1,"This does have the extra ingredients that some people on here are unhappy about, but it does not sting or burn me whatsoever. It feels very mild and nice on my face. Everybody was raving about the smell, so I was surprised when I opened it and realized that the smell is kind of like a grandmother's perfume. It's not a bad smell at all, though. The cream takes my make-up off nicely, even tough liquid liner. I was really surprised by how small the jar actually is, but after using it I realized that this stuff will last me forever. You only need a very small amount to do the trick. Overall, I'd recommend this to anybody!"
1,"Using Olay products, especially Regenerist has been life changing. First, I am 38 years old.  But whenever I meet someone new, either at work or with my friends, people always assume that I'm the ""young"" one of the group - even when I'm not.  When my 16 year old daughter and I are out, people think we're friends, not mother and daughter!  There is definitely something to be said for lifestyle: I don't go out in the sun, I don't smoke, I drink lots of water, and (funny as it sounds) I trained myself to sleep on my back - never the face.  Those things make a difference, but Olay products contribute so much to the anti-aging process.  I've used Olay as long as I've known my own mother to use it.  She has been using Olay forever. She is 67 years old but most poeple think she is in her early 50's or younger! She says they changed their formula many years back and she didn't like that, but she continued to use Olay anyway.In a nutshell, if you start with Olay young, you will continue to look young.  But you're never too old to start Olay.  Botox, chemical peels and facelifts are becoming more of the 'norm' but it doesn't make them any less expensive or less painful.  Olay is an easy way to keep your youthful appearance!"
1,"I first used this 11 years ago and have used it ever since. I would use nothing else. Back then I ordered it online from a online store in Australia and could buy the 8.75oz bottle, including shipping to the US, for just over $10. I bought it for last several years from Amazon but this year it had risen in price to a ridiculous amount. Will be checking out the Australian store again."
1,"Omg! I'm in heaven when I discovered this ""Brush On"" glue from DUO. I like it because #1 it's FORMALDEHYDE FREE (Causes Cancer). The other Duo Glue (Blue & White) I bought from sephora contained the formaldehyde which I did not know at the time.  But this Glue is Great for these reasons: No Smell, It's not gooey when you apply, it does not dry up immediately but can be applied right away & still sticks to eyelid, It's white so you can see where you applied too much, It dries clear, Lasting power is amazing! I fell asleep with the fake lashes on & it was still on overnight, & lastly - you never have to re-apply because it stays on all day without false lash coming off.I tried the Ardell brush on in clear & so disappointed because it  Stings, Smells bad like toxic,dries up fast & looses it's stickiness, lashes comes off after a few hours, need to re-apply. When it gets in your eye - it hurts bad. You can't really tell where the clear glue is that's why it gets in your eye. Totally opposite of the Duo.Duo Brush On - Love Love this Product!"
1,"More women have asked me what color lipstick I am wearing when I use this #225 from Revlon.  It is a medium boldness with hints of coral and pinks, which means you can wear it with almost all colors."
1,Shipping was fast. Does what it is supposed to do. Works well and gets the polish off quick depending on how many layers of nail polish I have on. I have also noticed more strength in my natural nails. Will purchase again whenever I don't feel like going to the store to buy it.
1,A perfect green for the holidays! Especially for Christmas Tree nail art. The formula is great too. A thin layer is plenty
1,I would definitely recommend this works well had no problems shipped and got here in time love the way it paints
1,Anything I every purchase by revlon was cheap and works great as high pricey products. Packaging was great as if it was just light books were inside and delivery was perfect timing for me.  If you haven't tried anything by revlon then I really recommend all there products and purchasing them from this seller when needed to. It's really worth every cent you worked for and heats up in seconds when your on the go. I really have to complete the whole entire set by getting the other size barrels by revlon that works wonders on any type of hair.Thanks!
1,"This product is fantastic. My advice is to use your daily moisturizer, wait till its absorbed (around 5 min), apply sunblock it you wish (I use shiseido spf36 stick) apply your under eye concealer, then use a transluscent loose powder before applying this foundation. The loose powder smoothens your skin very lightly so the product will not cake on your moisturized/sunblocked/eyeconcealed skin. Believe me, just try it and you'll see how flawless the result will be. Hope this helps some of you out there..."
1,"After i use the cleanser, i use the serum, and then the night cream. I can really tell a difference in my skin, and the lines. It feels healthier, and my make up goes on really nicely in the morning."
1,"I ordered my choice from a seller called ""House of Accessory"" and explain later in the review why I made that decision.  The color is true to the website color and adheres well.  Personally, I don't think it's even necessary to use a top and base coat with this product.  Beautiful shade of pink/beige with a hint of tan.  PLEASE NOTE:  While searching out the OPI range, I was puzzled by the variance in reviews, ranging in excellent to very poor.  Finally noticed the sellers can be varied, even if you're on the same product page, scrolling through the available colors.  Noticed ""House of Accessory"" actually had highest overall ratings and chose them to order from and packaging and delivery was well-done and rapid."
1,"Have bought these q-tips for years. I have noticed they aren't as fluffy as they used to be. The quality of a lot of products have suffered over the years, just a sign of the times I suppose. We do use these a lot though. Besides ears they get used for make up and even little craft projects. Not really much you can say about q-tips."
1,I have used this moisturizer for two years.  My skin is combination with oily t zones and dry cheeks. This moisturizer works to even my skin out. The dark spots that I have from acne fade a lot quicker when I I use this also. I love that it has some level of sun protection but not enough to look white.  The rough spots on my skin have also become smoother and my skin looks plumper when I let it soak in. Definitely a must in my skincare routine.
1,"I tried this when it first came out and was impressed. I have used it ever since. It does seem to even out skin tone and keep facial lines to a minimum. My face also seems soft yet firmer and &#34;hitting 50&#34; (latter part of last month) wasn't as bad as I thought it would be at 30. With the help of this product I don't even think I'm ready for the next step in the Olay treatment line; Pro-X I believe it is. Maybe in a few years &#60;grin&#62;. I use twice a day, in the morning then once again after washing my face in the evening, and I am very pleased with the results. Amazon service is just wonderful and the price beats Costco and any other retail store I have seen. Thanks to Olay for a great product and Amazon for the on time, always in perfect condition delivery."
1,This is a good product and you can just use a little bit to hae a good result.  The sellers were good for they packaged well and shipped fast.
1,This product seems to work really well.  I often use it in lieu of shaving gel and it fels even better than when I use the Gel.
1,"I've used this Serum for a very long time and it does work.  It's smooth, absorbs easily and works great under foundations. I've tried going without it and my skin starts looking dry again.  I'll be 60 this year and my skin is more like someone 45.  Love this stuff."
1,Part of my regiment family.  Obagi is part of my daily and nightly routine which keeps my skin smooth and glowing.
1,great color. NARS lipstick is my favorite.
1,"This machine will produce copious amounts of steam instantly (more steam than you can get from a pot of tap water at a rolling boil!). The key to it is adding salt. If you don't add salt, you will have to wait a while 5-10 minutes for a small amount of steam. I think most of the negative reviews here are from people that did not read the directions and did not add salt. If you follow the directions and add the salt, you can have more steam than you can handle.The other thing I love about this steamer is the little compartment for adding steaming herbs. As the steam exits the machine, it blows right over the herbs and you get a complete aroma therapy / herbal steam experience. Some herbs really help open up the pores and encourage the cells to purge impurities. I have been using herbs for the last 4-5 steam sessions and it makes noticeable difference over just steaming with water (and salt) alone. Most facial steam herbs can be found in your own kitchen cabinet. Mint, Chamomile & Rosemary are herbs I commonly use, but a Google search for ""facial stem herbs"" will bring up a bevy of recipes tailored for different skin types.Lastly, I love this steamer so much more than the fancy steamers they use for facials at spas. Unless they get several of them blowing on your face at one, you only get small areas of your face getting steamed at any one time. I have yet to experience a spa steamer that covers my entire face at once. The unsteamed (but wet) parts of your face get cold while the area getting steamed gets warm and they keep moving it around so no one area ever gets steamed for more than a few minutes, etc. This Kaz steamer has a nice wide ""bowl"" and produces enough steam to generously cover you entire face! You won't need to keep rotating your face to get the different parts steamed like you do with those fancy ""steam blowers"". I don't have time for long steam sessions so I really appreciate this aspect of the Kaz steamer. I steam 2-3 time per month and have noticed a significant overall improvement in the texture and pore size of my skin.Here is my routine:-hair in pony tail-wash skin-add about 2 tablespoons of salt to water tank-fill with water to about 1/2 full-add steaming facial herbs after placing heating unit in water tank-grab a towel-intense steam for 10 minutes (under towel, this may be too intense for some)-gently exfoliate with soft towel-follow with normal moisturizer (or occasional facial mask or acid peel)-unplug and rinse all parts of unit-I kept the box that the Steamer came in (fold in the top box flaps) and just loosely place all (wet) parts back in the box and store under the sink. The parts dry just fine in the open box as long as the steamer is unassembled.Enjoy beautiful fresh skin!"
1,"I don't know why it took me so long to try this lotion. I have sensitive, oily and mature skin. I know it is supposed to be for dry skin, but it really doesn't make my skin any oilier than any other lotion. I've been using it a week and have noticed brighter, smoother facial skin. Fine lines seem to be disappearing. I am very pleased with this product and plan to continue using it."
1,"This stuff does an okay job of clearing up your skin but it takes a few days. It's not a one-time-use miracle cream. (see: Benzoyl Peroxide) and it smells AWFUL. I get self conscious whenever I wear the stuff because I'm afraid someone might be able to smell it on me, that's how bad it is.I'd say this is good for if you're skin is starting to flare up and you're going to be spending the day at home and want to treat it."
1,"The almond scented Dr. Bronnes is amazing and i purchased the 32oz bottle which will last me for a very long time. I originally bought it to be used as a shampoo but because I have so much I am now using it for many other things such as body wash, to brush my teeth, to spot clean clothes, to clean appliances, you name it. This stuff smells great and will go a long way if you dilute it with water. I've bought a few empty spray bottles and put a little bit and mixed it with water and its still potent enough to get the job done. I'm going to collect all of the scents now because I am so satisfied with my first purchase of the Magic Soap by Dr. Bronner's."
1,I purchased this cleanser and am quite pleased with the results. The item is now one of my regular purchases. Thick cream and if you put it in the fridge it is great to put on cold and then wash off or wipe off after it warms to regular temperature. This little trick also keeps the product shelf life longer and is so soothing after a hard day.
1,"This is by far my favorite perfume, I usually get sick of something after a bottle, but not this. This is very feminine and soft. I have always had great compliments on this perfume and will continue to purchase even as new perfumes come out, this is a keeper. Shop around for prices, but beware of fakes. Also, it's good to layer this perfume with the lotion and wash, as one down fall is that it doesn't seem to last though out the day. Or keep a handy mini bottle in your purse to freshen up."
1,"For what it's worth the polish corrector pen is not so bad. I typically don't use color on my nails, I just coat them clear. I did however use color on my nails a while ago and used this pen for a few mistakes I made, the pen cleaned the mistakes up with no problem. Note: It is not a pen filled with remover, I fill a tin with some polish remover and dip the pen as I need it."
1,"This has been my significant other's favorite cologne for years and years.  We purchased this directly through Amazon (NOT a reseller) and received the legit product.  Contrary to other reviews, he has not noticed any change in the product's scent or strength.  The price can't be beat and after checking various online options (like Sephora), I was not able to find the legitimate product for a lower price."
1,"My face was horrible and I was starting to notice that I wasn't looking as vibrant as I needed to for someone as young as I am. (I bought this product when I was 24 and I am now 26). My skin is horribly acne prone and incredibly sensitive. I have trouble with clogged pores and I really thought since I already have such heavily oily skin that adding more moisture or oil would just send my skin into overload.I couldn't be more wrong. After a month or two of using the product I noticed that my skin had a healthy glow, I noticed that I wasn't as oily. I also noticed that in combination with using my acne treatments that my outbreaks weren't as bad, but were getting better over time. It has helped with the elasticity of my eyes and a little of the product goes a long way. I have had the same bottle for over two years and I just cannot seem to finish the product. It is an amazing little moisturizer. I really like how the SPF 15 is enough for my skin to counter the sun, but become a little darker over time. I really enjoy this product and when fall comes around again, I will definitely be getting another bottle of it."
1,"I found this to be an excellent moisturizer/balancing cream for my oily, acne-prone skin. I only stopped using it because I could no longer afford this line, but I do recommend this highly.."
0,"I did not notice any results from this product.  In fact, it seems to wear off and chip rather easily."
1,"I've been using Neutrogena glycerine soap since I was a teenager in the 1970s.  I really like the soap and its fragrance, and it leaves my face feeing clean and fresh.  Unfortunately, this product is no longer available for subscription order."
1,"I get extremely dry, itchy skin since I live in New England and am often outside in harsh weather. I have all kinds of lotion, and for some reason never tried Cetaphil. I bought this and it's now the only thing I use--it's that good! In addition to dry, my skin is very sensitive and allergy prone as well. I've used Aveeno with some success, since it's unscented, as is this. I found the main advantage in this as opposed to Aveeno is it's extremely moisturizing. I smooth it on in the morning and find that at the end of the day my skin is still very soft and not at all dry. It's the longest-lasting lotion I've ever tried. It's not at all too heavy though, or sticky and it absorbs well. It's nice because I can use it all the time without getting tired of an overpowering scent. I would highly recommend this to anyone, from people who just want good lotion to those with skin conditions (e.g. psoriasis, eczema).These little tubes are great since I can toss them in my bag for dry hands."
0,"If I could give this no stars, I would do it without hesitation. To start off with, this stuff is disgustingly OVERPRICED, considering how many damaging ingredients there are in this product. While I might get comments in response to this 'My skin feels fine', 'this doesn't irritate my skin' this doesn't change the fact that this stuff is able to penetrate the skin membrane and damage your collagen (what makes your skin supple). Personally, when I first used this product I massaged it on my face without problem, but when I rinsed it off my skin felt tight and dry!Isn't purity indicative of being gentle? Apparently not.Just to give you more in depth criticism of this product is... IT HAS FREAKING BLACK PEPPER IN IT.As if all of the other oils filling in this junk product weren't irritating enough.If you want to damage your skin from the inside out, go ahead and buy this product."
1,This deodorant can be hard to find in stores but I definitely recommend it over the other name brands.  Does not cause any skin irritation or rash the way some of the others do .
1,"I have been having acne issues since i was 13 and im now 23. Nothing ever seem to work for the acne scar. I am usually skeptical about people reviews but I heard that AHA could help and i gave it a try. My goodness! Its only been 2 weeks and i am already seeing great improvements in the texture, tone and the overall health of my face. The price is just right and the quantity is definitely worth the bang for your buck. Don't be scared when you get a burning sensation, thats normal and proof that it is working. Out of all the products i have used to treat my acne marks, this is by far the best and the price is a bonus! This will have your skin looking so young, fresh and alive. You will glow! Im so happy and slowly regaining confidence. i can't wait to see future results."
0,I have very sensitive skin. When I tried this product I had a feeling it was going to make me break out. I went a head and tried it.i had heard and read so many great reviews on it. I ended up breaking out with it so I never got a chance to see if it works? I am going to look for this in Sensitive skin. I know ROC has products for sensitive skin but I don't think they have this exact one?
1,"Nice base coat. My nails chip very quickly, so I'm always looking for the best base coat I can to help remedy that. Although it wasn't a miracle cure to my nail chipping (I'm not sure if anything will ever be), it did help in preventing major chips. For anybody who isn't hard on their nails, this would probably work much better for them."
1,"I have extremely sensitive eczema prone skin. Vanicream provides the soothing, hydrating my skin needs without any allergic reactions . I have been using it and the sunscreen product for more than a year with great results ."
1,This brush allowes the air to flow through nicely.  It is light and very easy to handle.  One of my favorite brushes
1,"Great hot brush! My sister bought 1 of these years ago and then it died a few weeks ago. She looked everywhere and couldn't find one like it. I looked on Amazon and there it was! Needless to say I bought her 2 of them, 1 to take home and 1 to leave at my home. She was so surprised and both work perfectly. It's so nice to be able to find something like this at Amazon. If you use this size brush for curling this is a great little tool. Highly recommend it."
1,I've used this product for several years and it helps to smooth out some of my small wrinkles.....sure beats paying outrageous prices for &#34;designer&#34; brands in the department stores!
1,"I read the reviews and decided to try this. I'm not into the whole oils thing but it can't hurt. Right? Right!! This stuff is great. It cleared up my teenage childs acne, It makes my face feel so soft and smooth after I use it. My complexion is really looking good. We use it on burns, cuts, scrapes. You can look up all kinds of ways to use it!"
1,"I love this product for how it temporarily firms up my sagging jawline quite well. I get occasional breakouts around my mouth and it works well on drying those up. However, I would use this no more than once a week because it does seem to dry out the skin."
1,"This moisturizer is so light it soaks in immediately. It smells like Heaven, or at least reminds you of that beach where you felt like you were in Heaven!I have extremely dry skin and this is the best moisturizer I have found. I live in a harsh climate with very cold moisture sucking winters and hot dry summers. In the summer I leave a bottle in the refrigerator and always have one in my cooler for long days on the boat. Nothing feels better than cold Skin Trip on a sunburn!I get compliments daily on how good I smell!"
0,"Ok, this used to be the best brand.  Everytime I find a color that is not too red, they change up the formula and RUIN my hair !  Your after color crap is horrific, it turns hair black and leaves a disgusting cheap tint, no one wants that stuff.  Secondly, some instructions will say to dampen hair others say to apply to dry hair, confusing the customer.  Someone at BI should be fired for constantly playing with the product, ruining millions of womens hair int he process !  When you have a good thing , leave it alone !  &#34;NEW AND IMPROVED&#34; my ass!"
1,Excellent Brush that does not rip out your hair.
1,"Super oil, super value. I use this all over after a shower and have even added some to my facial cleansing oil. It is good and runny, no smell and a little goes a long way."
1,"Perfect. dark, easy to remove, great quality, cheap. One of the best adhesives I've used so far. Also, it came pretty fast."
1,The dermablend cover creme works really well for any type of coverup needed. It really works well for deep scars and blemishes. The creme stays on forever. I would suggest to anyone who has had burnt skin with scarring to use this product. This creme is also waterproof. You can go swimming or take a shower and the creme doesnt wash off. Great product for those who needs a reliable concealer.....
1,"Love, love this product! Big improvement in my skin, only need to use a little at a time, no harsh smell or drying my skin. Face feels clean and refreshed."
0,"I've read the pros and cons on this site.  The pros outweighed the cons for me.  For me the size was just right.  However, this brush generated lots of static in my hair.  Before and after I went to the salon.  So, I thought it was just me.  I gave the brush to my friend, and she experienced the same problem.  STATIC.Great massaging brush though, but can't get past the static."
1,"Inspite of the overwhelming positive reviews and ratings, I found this shampoo to be just average.  II have a pekingese whom I bathe about 2x per month.  HIs fur is around 2"" long. Usually I bathe him with an oatmeal shampoo then followed by the four paws magic coat oatmeal conditioner.  I love the magic coat conditioner but it's time consuming and tedious work to rub it in and rinse it out because it takes about 4-5 x of repeated rinsing to ensure the conditioner is entirely out of the fur. But the result is the brush just glides thru the fur with zero snags.To save time, I decided to try this product which touts itself as 2 in 1. Well, the buddy wash frangrance is nice, left the fur soft and didnt' seem to irritate my dog's skin. However i did not feel the effects of the conditioner part from this product.  So, if you are someone that only shampoos and does not condition, then you will love this product. If you are someone that shampoos AND CONDITIONS, then you will be disappointed as the outcome is no where near comparison."
1,"I love this, my mom purchased it for my birthday. I use it when I want to give my face special treatment. It also help to open up my sinuses, it's nice to have this on hand!"
1,Wanted to firm up some spots and this did it with out a problem. Use at night after face was washed.
1,I love this product. Please note do not use too much or its too heavy and greasy. Just a small dime size for hair longer than shoulder length. Then it leaves your hair not frizzy and can style better.
1,"We love Burt's Bees products! I could do without the honey-based lip glosses or lip balms that taste slightly funny, but that's my only real complaint about their products. The foot cream is absolutely amazing, a light mint/menthol scent to them. The vanilla skin balm is amazing and smells wonderful. The coconut cream for hands and cuticles feels amazing!This head-to-toe starter kit is amazing, because it gives you a nice mini-sized introduction to the most popular Burt's Bees products at a reasonable price, so you can sample a variety or products and see which ones you like the best before putting a lot of money into the full-sized products. Their products are all natural and that's a big plus if you're looking to remove chemicals and such from your life.This also makes a great gift pack for a friend or holiday/birthday gift too!"
1,"I have other colors of the Lipslicks and I love that they are slightly tinted but also have a balmy feel. This color is more white than I would have thought, pearl I suppose. I mixed it with the Hipster shade & it matched my pinky skin tone better."
1,"Runs a little thin, but gets the job done,"
1,My husband and I both use this as toner after cleansing.  It smells lovely and provides good nourishment for our skin care regiment.
1,"This face wash is great! It's super gentle and doesn't give my skin the tight feeling at all and works wonders getting makeup off. I've used at least 10 bottles of this and will continue to use it as long as it's produced. Great product, no crazy scents, doesn't hurt my face, and helps with acne control!"
1,"Makes my nail polish stick better and the drying time is fast. I do 1 coat of this, 2 coats of my polish, 1 more coat of this and then finish it off with China Glaze's Good to Go topcoat. It last for 7-9 days!"
0,The lipstick is a ok color.. but definitely not Certainly red. It comes off so easily even with liner and blotting. I wouldn't buy it again..
0,"this doesnt do anything....it might help nourish lashes but i bought this for brows- pointless buy, has no effect for me."
1,"There's no way this remover works on regular conventional polish, but it DOES work with Aquarella polish, and the reason I use it is because it is healthy and chemical free; I'm using natural products on my hands, and my hands reflect it.  We often expect quick and easy, but sometimes it takes chemicals to get that kind of response, and my eyes and allergies can't handle that.  It takes more of an investment of time to use natural products, but in the end, I'm spending no more time on a manicure than I would be in a salon where they pile on the layers of chemical-based nail polish.  Once I had acrylic nails done and the woman buffed, with an electric machine, so far down into my nail, around the cuticle, that I thought it was going to lift up out of the bed and fall off.  There was almost nothing left of it, and she attached acrylic nails to it! It took a LOT longer for that nail to grow out than it does for me to care for my skin and health with this product. And I'm very lucky that nail didn't get infected."
1,NARS makes beautiful blushes and this one is no exception.  A great powder for those of us with rosacea since there is no pink or orange in this blush.
1,"I'm on my 2nd bottle of this stuff.  Love the smell, especially after a long hot shower.  Lathers well and my skin feels clean.  Highly recommend this product."
1,amazing product great price can be used as a toner or setting spray smells great doesn't over dry or get irritated makes my skin look healthy will be buying more as long as they make it only issue my top was cracked when it arrived but no product leaked and I just poured some in a bottle of my own and put Suran wrap over the original to keep fresh
1,"This cover stick is very useful to set the makeup, but does not completely cover blemishes, imperfections understand that it takes another kind and color of concealer according to the problem, but are very good products Maybelline"
1,I love this product because it gives your lashes great length and thickness. I've used this once and I was extremely happy with the result. It lasts all day and will keep your lashes looking beautiful for hours.
1,My skin is so soft using this moisturizer.  I love this stuff and use it all the time.  I will order more through this company.
1,"I am a hormonally challenged female and have been suffering from bacne lately, though it isn't typical. I decided to go ahead and try this body wash to see if it would help. What do you know -- just a day later and it was working quite well! I still have little blackheads, but no more big, really noticeable zits. I combined it with a really great exfoliating loofah and the skin on my back has gotten much better. It does smell pretty gross though - my husband thought he smelled something rank this morning in the shower, but I told him it was probably the body wash and when he sniffed it he confirmed. If you can deal with the smelliness while you're washing then it's worth it. I don't find that it leaves a residual smell at all."
0,"READ INGREDIENTS. THE HIGHER THE ZINC, THE MORE PROTECTION.Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin's DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.I make my own sunscreen as well as I purchase sunscreen for times when I do not have time to make any since I need to surf. For that reason, when I purchase a sunscreen mix, I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, I bump the zinc. Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection. The more zinc, the more protection but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to EVCO.Blue Lizard Baby- SPF 30+- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection- Chemical-Free- Paraben-Free- Fragrance-Free- 10% Zinc Oxide; 5% Titanium DioxideBlue Lizard Face- SPF 30+- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection- Paraben-Free- Fragrance-Free- Oil-Free- 8% Zinc OxideBlue Lizard Sensitive- SPF 30+- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection- Chemical-Free- Paraben-Free- Fragrance-Free- 10% Zinc Oxide; 5% Titanium DioxideBlue Lizard Sport- SPF 30+- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection- Very Water Resistant- 6% Zinc OxideBlue Lizard Regular- SPF 30+- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection- Very Water Resistant- 6% Zinc OxideNot a Paraben Free formula. The inactive ingredients are extensive in Blue Lizard, check their Internet site but more importantly compare the cost of any sunscreen to better brands with hardly any ingredients except few organic and a very high amount of zinc like 18% zinc not 5% or 10% zinc. Blue Lizard's ingredients vary so much from their Face mix to the Original mix to the Baby mix since they offer more additives, less zinc with noticeable price fluctuation. Cancer does not differentiate face skin or leg skin, it is all the same so why apply anything that has less protection to different part of the body. Ingredients get soaked in regardless of the skin location so compare ingredients since it is like consuming those ingredients when applied to the skin. A good organic 3oz 18% zinc mix should not cost more than $13 and for less when on sale. I get lots more when I make my own, much, much more and I get to control the zinc percentage in the mix as well."
1,I bought this because the nail polish reminded me of the color Michelle Obama wore at the 2012 DNC. I blog recommend this color as what Michelle wore. It looks great against my skin.  Who knew how many shades of gray there were. :D
1,"I've used Alba See Moss Moisturizer daily religiously for over a year - no problems and you can't beat the price. I apply after morning wash, before applying foundation. I don't use the coordinating wash all the time. Most of Alba's products have impressed me for the price, this line is formulated especially for malasma, which is what drew me to it in the first place. I use the Alba Sea Moss night cream also with a hyaluronic acid gel from Reviva Labs to help with tone and discoloration. My skin looks great and I always get compliments on how nice my skin looks. Definitely recommend for women who are 35+ and have skin discoloration from too much sun or hormonal changes. So until this causes problems or Alba discontinues it, I'll keep doing what I'm doing."
0,"I let a coworker talk me into trying Bare Escentuals. In theory I like it--I don't like applying heavy, oily feeling foundations to my face so the thought of a powder was intriguing. I found it covered well, but no matter what color or tint I used, it made my skin color look off. The sales person said this sometimes happens and suggested I try a similar mineral foundation from another company which worked much better with my skin tones. What I found hard to believe though was that none of their hues that matched my skin tone managed to look natural."
1,"Can't stand perfume and its in everything. ( Perfumed toilet paper is just strange!) This is great for me,doesn't take forever to be absorbed. I have it on auto ship. Sent to me every other month cause I have my husband use it too. He's had a lot of skin cancer on his face and this spf 15 is just enough for regular daily use. I use this in the morning and a heavier one at night. The dermatologist says my 65 year old skin looks great even with her magnifying glass. Lets keep it that way!"
1,This is a pretty good product. I have allergies and one of the causes my scalp to get itchy and flaky. This shampoo has helped relieve the itchiness and flakes.
1,"Lasts long, doesn't dry out my face. The smell isn't overwhelming and it clears up my skin! Good face wash."
1,I have coily hair that becomes hard to detangle when wet. This comb is a God-send. It is wide and sturdy.
1,"After reading reviews and watching tutorials, I purchased this product.  Its decent for my first time wearing false lashes. I did have to learn to let it almost dry before placing it on my lid."
1,"Just like it.  It dries out a little faster than others, but that's ok.  I use a cleaned used mascara wand to separate lashes if necessary, when it gets a little older and dries up.  It's easy to remove without heavy creams or a lot of scrubbing, and that's what I REALLY like."
1,I have been using L'Oreal for several years now and I have to say that it has been much superior to the other brands.  It seems to hold the color longer and gives you a healthy shine.
1,"This is one of my favorites. The color I'm really not a Waitress is a dark red maroon color with a little shimmer/glitter to it. Opi nail polishes go on smooth and easy. Sometimes, depending on the color I have found I can get by with using only one coat. They dry relatively quick, certainly not longer than any other kind of polish. I never use a top coat with Opi nail polishes because they dry bright and shiny. I really like Opi nail polishes. The mini sizes are just the right size to try and not have a lot left over if you don't like it or rarely paint your nails.Well worth their money.enjoy."
1,"I started using Aveeno Active Naturals Creamy Moisturizing Oil last winter after my skin dried out. I tried several lotions, but nothing seemed to help. I tried this one and was amazed by how much softer my skin felt. It kept it from drying out and took care of the peeling I was experiencing. I also love the scent. I continued to use it all year long, even in the summer. I have a feeling the dry winter air won't bother my skin this year as long as I keep using this lotion. It's definitely my favorite lotion. I also recommended it to my own mother, and she loves it as well."
1,Wow this is truly amazing I can feel it starting to work already and its only been a few days but my skin is definitely more smooth than before so I say this is an excellent product
1,"I can't really say that this has been helping with my insomnia, but it does have a pleasant scent.  I enjoy using it as a lip balm or on my cuticles.  My only complaint is that I have to rub my fingers in it quite a bit to get any product.  It seems to have a rather high melting point."
1,We gave these as gifts and everyone that received this screamed after they put it on.  Talk about happy campers.  This stuff is great!!!
1,"This lash package is GREAT. It comes with long, medium, and short and there are definitely no knots at the end. These lashes are very natural, which was the look that I was going for. I have only used medium (corners to mid) and short (mid to corner). I'm saving the long for hot dates! Perfect!"
1,"The name says it all.. Nars Multiple Orgasm..It give my skin that ""after glow"". Nice little blush with a hint of dewy glow. If you can't make this is the best way to fake it. :)"
1,"This tie case is very nice.  Though it's inexpensive, it still works great.  It holds plenty of ties and has a little spot for cufflinks as well.  A great alternative if you need to travel with multiple ties."
1,"I have used Maybelline's great lash mascara for years. It lasts all day, and does not smear. The quality is far better than any of the more expense brands I have tried. I think this is the best mascara you can buy."
1,"By accident, I found this apricot oil stops itch from mosquito bites.  I had so many mosquito bites on my ankles couple of days ago while working in the yard.  It itch so bad, I scratched to the point it bled and inflamed. I was going crazy!  But scratch over the itching skin did not help at all. I used topical ointment to stop itching, but did not work either.  After shower, I apply this oil on my face and body, I noticed mosquito bite area did not itch anymore.  Apricot oil is naturally good for inflammation, but I didn't think it would work on bug bites. It actually start to heal my open skin where I had scratch so bad. This oil also makes skin feels soft. No particular smell to the oil.Awesome product and highly recommended."
1,I works. Really. On hand AND FOOD AND EVERYWEHRE!!!!!!!but it's kind of annoying when it leaves your palms oily and eventually i wipe it on my shirt... but it works so good i cannot resist putting it on
1,"After the first week, my 7-year was still sucking his thumb and being stubborn.  However, shortly after application two, I noticed his hand was no longer in his mouth as he slept.  Still working on my nail-biting 11-year old, but he hates the taste so he'll stop soon.  This stuff tastes as awful as advertised, which is great in this case."
1,OPI is the best nail polish. I dont know if its the polish or the brush but it always goes on smooth and easy and dries nice and even. Love the product and the colors. Good product all around
1,I love the soft sponge material  they used on these rollers. I order these rollers for sponges since i already have many different color rollers. Most of old rollers have these rough porous sponges around them.  Now I wish the manufacturer also sells 1. just sponges only 2.plstic rollers with shorter shaft
1,always great for acne
1,"10/01/12: Despite my initial disappointment outlined below, continued used of the product is yielding desired results. After almost a month of use my nails truly are less brittle, more supple, and not so painfully ""thin"" feeling. The splits and cracks are fewer and farther between. Still the only product of any help with the thumbnail that splits down the middle is super glue. Even so, perhaps with continued use, maybe this too will turn around. This leaves me eating crow from my critique of the initial experience, but it doesn't taste bitter considering the product benefit.Unfortunately despite continued use, my experience with the other two Barielle products remains unchanged-the nail hardener 'top coat' style product is rubbery, peels easily, and is gone after shower, the cuticle oil pools on the skin without being absorbed.-----------------------------I so wanted this product to work but after two weeks it just flat out doesn't. Not for me anyway. I purchased 3 Barielle products at the same time. This nail strengthener to reduce splits and peels, and nail hardener that goes on like a top coat that is supposed to strengthen nails and keep them from splitting as well, and an oil that is to condition the cuticle bed.From the moment it arrived I began using per directions with high hopes. Nothing. No noticeable change at all. The excess didn't even serve as a skin softener.The reason I write this now, is that I have one nail that splits down the middle and I just snagged it once again, rather painful. I have worn acrylics as a protective barrier for years because my nails are so thin, brittle, and split. I fully expected to see some sort of improvement at this point. - At least something.I'll post comments on the other two related products but the Barielle top coat style nail hardener goes on kind of rubbery, peels off very easily, and doesn't prevent splitting or cracking in my experience.Nothing. What a disappointment. Now it's back to acrylics as at least my nails won't be snagging and ripping off simply as I walk around."
1,"I use this as a base coat and WOW what a difference. My Mom has been using this stuff for years and her nails are long, strong and beautiful. I just started using this about 3 months ago and I can tell the difference. I usually order directly from Nailtiques and it takes a few days. I found this item cheaper on Amazon so I decided to give a chance. My estimated arrival was for 5/30, the nail protein arrived 5/31. I suppose that's not too bad but I would have preferred the estimated arrival day. Being that I tracked the package and it didn't move until the week of. Nonetheless, it was worth the wait."
1,I started using this product about 9  months ago.  Love the way it feels when appliedto my face and neck.  Love that is SPF 15 for daily use. No heavy scent a plus.
1,I am Indian and convinced my genes have left me with dry skin. Living in the northeast makes it no better. I have been using this oil for years throughout the winter. Got my dad hooked on it too. Bought 5 bottles at once to make sure I don't run out !
1,"I've used a lot of different mascaras, mainly for price/availability reasons. I'm returning to this one for a couple of reasons.1. It's cheap!2. Doesn't irritate my eyes at all (and I wear contacts).3. Makes your eyelashes look good, but not super intense. I'm blonde so I don't want to go too crazy.The brush is tiny, which is kind of strange at first, but you get used to it. Highly recommend!"
1,"I've had this for 5 months and, though I do not straighten my naturally curly (thick, coarse) hair often, this made easy work of it! I am African-American with natural (relaxer-free) long hair; mid-back length. It took over an hour in small sections, but WOW! My hair was sleek with curls and waves where I wanted them! I didn't even use the highest heat setting! I also used this on my son's 7&#34; afro, which is VERY CURL RESISTANT when using flat irons, and it straightened HIS hair (I do this so I can trim his hair since he doesn't trust barbers after a bad experience cutting his &#34;bodacious fro&#34; lol). I have lots of heated irons, but this did straighten AND curl my hair very well. Therefore, I have NO hesitation recommending this product!"
1,"Let me just say that every sunscreen breaks my sensitive skin out, but I love this product. It does not break me out in hives, rash or acne like all other SPF products. The fairly light is good for my very light skin. I thought I would need the lightest (fair) one, but the sales rep told me it would be too light (surprising), but she was right. If I had bought lighter I would look like a ghost. So, great for pale skin.It covers up my red cheeks. It is soft and smooth and my skin just feels great. It stays on most of the day (unlike the concealer, which wears off much more quickly on me). It is great to finally find an spf product that my skin loves! My next trial will be their spf powder sunscreen."
1,It's ok.  It's nice to pamper yourself a little and it feels great going on.  But results - I'm not so sure.
1,This color really makes your fingers look like you have rose petals on them. It is a great hearty pink color.  I think this color will work for all skin tones.  I find myself gravitating towards it all the time.
1,"I purchased StriVectin-SD in a kit that contained the cream, the eye cream and the serum.  It was recommended by the skin care specialist at my local Sephora, when I asked for something to tighten my skin.  I really like the serum; I can actually see a difference.  I'm not talking ""Oh my stars I look 20 years younger"" different, but it really does diminish the look of lines around my eyes.But what really amazed me....and this is true so help me....is that I've received a few compliments in the past couple of weeks about my skin!  I had dinner with some friends last week and one of them (a man) said ""Don't you ever age?  You look like you did 20 years ago.""  Then last night I attended a party, and an acquaintance who is about 25 years younger than I am said ""What do you do for your skin?  You look incredible.""  I attribute some of this to good make up (I use Bare Minerals), but I've used that for a couple of years and never got compliments like that before.I don't work for this, or any other, cosmetic company nor do I own stock in them!  Just an average 50+ working woman raising a family.  But I have to say....so far I think I spent my money wisely."
1,I love the quality of this product.  My hair felt so soft after I used it.  I do think it was a bit ashy for my taste.  It almost looks like grey hair.  I will go for natural blonde next time but I will stick with Loreal.
1,"Suave Naturals Shampoo, Tropical Coconut - 22.5oz. I have used this product many times and I love it. It cleans well and smells so good. I would recommend this product to anyone."
1,I use this with the Alba papaya peel and it work really well. The steam along with a peel helps my skin look and feel younger. The exfoliating brush is just meh though
1,Love this..it's a great moisturizer with no smell. I'm highly sensitive to smells so this works great for me. I use it twice a day.
1,"This product is a miracle ! I suffer from Cystic Acne and when I feel one coming on, I place a small amount on the pimple and by the next day it has either reduced or never made it's way out. The size for the price is great. It does tingle a bit when you first apply it but goes away after a few seconds."
1,"My dermatologist recommended Cetaphil. I tried the lotion and the face wash and honestly nothing special. Then I saw this in Costco while looking for my daughter's cream (she has ezcema) and thought ""why not try this"". I fell in love with this cream after the first try. This is woooonnnderful!It has a non greasy feel, doesnt leave skin sticky, lathers and absorbs really nicely and quick enough for my toddler to get her clothes on post bath time. I also love it for myself on my arms and shoulders (i dont use this for my face though). I find that this doesnt clog my pores, since I have acne prone skin on my chest, back and shoulders I was worried it would be a problem there. Nope not at all. I live in a very cold climate and with the drying heat always being on, I get dry patches of skin, this will eliminate them 90% overnight and totally by the next day. Im so happy I finally found something that works well with my sensitive skin and acne. :)"
1,This product is wondderfuum designed. Creamy and moist. It radiates the skin and keeps it glowing. You will love the results.
1,"This adhesive is excellent... except for the smell. It does go away once it dries. However, it's a product that works and it's very affordable. I own this, the dark adhesive and the Duo brush-on. Each version has something unique about it. You can use this clear one on top of the lashes if you feel like the ends are not really sticking to your eyelids."
1,This is the first time that I used the Olay Regenerist Lotion. I am really satisfied for this product does not leave a greasy after effect and it moisturizes my skin. I love Olay Products because their products help me keep my youthful glow.
1,Nail polish no longer stains my nails and is much easier to remove when I am ready.  I love it!
1,I was a little disappointed with this purchase. The curl does not hold and the rollers are not easy to set. I was expecting more moisture to smooth out my dry ends but this product actually creates more frizz for my hair.
1,"First off this item seems great, but while using it the first time I couldn't help being a little fearful that the water would somehow shoot up and burn my face/eyes.  Then I just read a review saying it did just that to someone and conair did nothing to recall the item, help pay hospital bills and treatment, which I hate to hear.  Anyway, if you're willing to risk it I'd say this seems to be an affective device.  It clears out my pores and seems to them look smaller as well as some acne cyst I have due to a medical condition I have.  I also pat the sweat off then add a facial mask to my opened pores. It seems to leave my skin super super soft and glowy.  Like many others have said the cone is a bit too small for your full face, but putting a towl over your head to conceal the steam does help that alittle.  The brush it comes with works great too and really cleans out my pores.  One other thing is even with eye cream on it really really dries out my eye (and causes redness to where it looks like I'm on drugs)to the point where they feel like they're burning and it makes me wonder if it could be causing damage to them.  Now after reading that awful review and having the burning feeling of my eyes (btw they were closed the whole time and my face wasn't directly fully inside the cone) I'm not so sure I'll be using this anymore.  I mean is it really worth damaging me eye sight? or getting my face burned? I may go back to boiling water in a pot it's seems safer and more controlled. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE I CAN BUY REPLACEMENT HEADS LIKE THE BRUSH FOR THE FACIAL TOOL IT COMES WITH??"
1,"My skin is finally happy.  I really like this moisturizer.  It goes on smoothly, soaks in quickly, and seems to be working well!"
1,"My hair is very layered, so wanted this to do the longer strands. I have a smaller one for the top of my hair style. It heats quickly, love the different heat settings. Feels very comfortable in my arthritic hands."
1,"I have had ridges on my thumbnails as long as I can remember, but this product makes them smooth! Also, it seems to be almost impossible to remove. The girl doing my next manicure had to soak in polish remover for 10 minutes to get it off, but it lasted for weeks!"
1,"I ordered the Egyptian Goddess roll on perfume from Amazon just based solely off of reviews.  I'm really picky with scents but I decided..what the heck, it's a great price and I can't go wrong.  I'm glad I did, because I absolutely love the scent.  I was curious about the other scents they have, so I went to the Auric Blends website.  They have tons of awesome sounding fragrances!  There are so many to choose from!  They make them all sound so tempting, so I splurged and ordered $50 worth of samples.  I know, that is kinda crazy and extreme, but a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do.  I'm so glad my husband ""gets"" me. :)  It was so much fun opening up all of the samples and trying them on.  I can't say enough good things about this company and their quality natural perfume oils!  Even though I love Egyptian Goddess, I like all of the other scents too just depending on my mood.  Hey, it's a girl thing!  I have to say that the Water Lily fragrance is my second favorite!"
1,"I have dry skin.  The type where you drag your nail across your skin and it leaves scratchy, dry patches.  I use a very thin film of this after bathing or washing my hands.  After first it you think it may be heavy, but it quickly sinks into your skin and leaves a soft, dewy sheen.  My dry cuticles in the Winter weather instantly respond to this lotion.  The pleasent fragrance reminds me of the end of a Summer day at the beach.  Very nice.  I've used many other more expensive formulas I've bought and received as part of a gift set, but this lotion really does it for me.  I'll always come back to this one."
1,"This item didn't really heat up hot enough for me to get a good curl.  I have use many hot rollers and these are the first ones that just don't do it for me.  Very compact and would travel well, but I would get the other clips if you keep this hot roller set."
1,I have used this periodically over the years and really like it.  This particular purchase was for a male friend who told me he swears by it and uses it everyday.
1,this is not what I expected; thought it would blow air out through the wand but it just gets hot; works well but it's just ok.
1,"My mother use to keep Dickinson Witch Hazel on hand for cuts, bruises, etc.  I had forgotten until I saw the product.  Now I am keeping it on hand especially for use as an astringent.  Does a great job on my face, arms and legs, etc. I use it as an additional cleanser everywhere but in my ""lady parts"".  Just like alcohol, do not use on delicate areas of ones body."
1,"Works great.  Wish it had 6dispensers then I and my hubbycould use it with all our products.Probably will just add the 2 chamberone also. We stuck this one on withthe enclosed caulk and left it 24hours before filling. Stuck on great.I put soap, lotion, shampoo, andconditioner in. It primed easy, and isa solid piece...and I'm picky....Great!!"
1,"This is just ok. For one, I found this in a store for almost half the price as what I paid on Amazon, so really I would not purchase it on here again. It is somewhat refreshing but I do not think it does anything worthy of noting to my skin. My skin appears soft after but other than that,  it's not really an amazing product."
1,Super fast shipping and great price.It Works amazing for my little spaDays and Everything was just whatI thought they would be.
1,"AT LAST! A mascara that, when applied per direction, stays on all day with no flakes, no smudges, no fading, and no ""spiky"", spindly little lashes.Yay! This mascara leaves the lashes with a smooth and fresh, clean look. Despite the number of coats applied I have not experienced a clumpy or heavy-cheap look that can sometimes happen.As a bonus, removal is as advertised - easy! I just use a disposable makeup removal wipe and all comes off with no scrubbing, damage to the lashes, or residue.Using the primer is a good idea. As an overnight conditioner my lashes feel stronger and healthier. As an under coat for the mascara it delivers thicker, more lush lashes without without leaving overly thick, clumpy lashes.As others have pointed out, this product is very picky about timing. If a coat of the mascara dries completely, attempts to apply other coats will cause the ""tubes"" of mascara surrounding the lashes to become unstable and start coming off. When this happens it's best just to start over and pay more attention to getting the coats on before the product dries completely.Note that the black is truly jet black. Although I have very fair skin, sometimes black mascara works well. Not so here. Blinc's BLACK is extremely BLACK. The first time I put it on my husband said I had a goth look around the eyes because they were so dark. FORTUNATELY, the dark brown is really a nice color for day or night and is the one I would recommend for others with fair skin."
0,This foundation brush is just not for me. When the representative at Macy's put the foundation on my face with this brush my face felt itchy and I didn't know why. So I bought the $60 starter kit for my sister for Christmas and I tried the brush on my fce without foundation and it just isn't as soft as I want and it made my face itch. It's fine for my sister who I bought it for. Idk maybe I just have sensitive skin and need really soft stuff. I use ecotools and they r uber soft and don't bother my skin.
1,its light and not oily - takes even the heaviest mascara off gently.  i would make sure you rinse your eyes after using this though.
1,"I've used this product for about 2 years, but after running out and having to borrow my sister's (Eucerin Everyday Protection/SPF 30) for a week or so, my breakouts all but disappeared! I didn't change anything else in my routine or lifestyle habits - it had to be this moisturizer making me break out. If you look closely in the mirror after applying, you'll notice little glitter flecks. In my opinion, it's completely unnecessary and just contributing to the amount of crap available to clog pores! It has a tendency to leave my skin still thirsty for moisture too, also contributing to breakouts. Overall, it's ok, but after trying another product (that's also less expensive!), I found this wasn't what I assumed was as good at it got."
1,An excellent product for relieving Eczema! I highly recommend it and will use it on a regular basis! It is a great skin calmer!
1,I really liked this product and I like the reddish color it gave me.. It was a little messy to use. I would buy again. It leaves hair shiny and colorful natural...
1,"I have long, curly hair and use this brush to detangle / brush my hair when wet. It's a good quality brush."
1,"This shampoo really makes my hair shine when using it & leaves my scalp feeling clean and refreshed.I follow up with Aubrey Honey suckle Rose conditioner and my cousin who is a hair dresser even commented how shiny and nice my hair is!In the past I've used many different brands of cleansers and conditioners in hopes of finding at least one that would make my hair stop thinning and not be so dry.  Before using this I was using the cleanser and conditioner from 100% Pure, and then Aubrey Organics Honey suckle Rose cleanser and conditioner.  The Honeysuckle Rose cleanser doesn't get all the buildup out sometimes so I wanted something that would and tried this one. Aubrey and 100% pure are all natural products so I didn't want more chemicals in my hair and am so happy that this cleanser is also chemical free. I think it was the chemicals in the past that were drying out my hair and making it thin.  Now my hair is soft, silky and healthy.I've used this on a family member who has very thin, baby fine hair that is super oily and after just 2 shampoos and a few minutes of conditioner her hair was so shiny, soft and oil free.. it stayed that way a couple days until she cleansed again too."
1,"Bought this for my 2 yr old daughter. She loves brushing her teeth at the same time i do mine. She was not too sure about the taste of this toothpaste. The previous gel we used was kind of sweet, she got used to it. She thought this was different and was cautious for the first few times. The gel is minty to taste and leave nice minty breath. It is child safe as it doesn't have harmful stuff like fluoride. Surely worth a try if you're looking for a new tooth gel for your little ones."
1,"I think this works wonders. It's the only face wash I feel comfortable rubbing roughly over my eyes to remove my eye make-up, which it does wonderfully. It's extremely gentle and reminds me of the highly dermatologist recommended Cetaphil formula. It's a one-stop shop for cleaning my skin and make-up off at the end of the night."
0,"The number 2 ingredient in this toner is SD Alcohol which does a great job of immediately degreasing your skin, but in the long run, it will cause your oil glands to produce more oil to make up for the drying effect of the alcohol. I like that it has AHA and beta hydroxy acids, but looking for another toner without alcohol. Any suggestions? I've tried the Neutrogena alcohol free toner and need something a little stronger for my slightly oily, more acne prone skin."
1,"I have pretty clear but dry skin. I wanted something light and easy to apply that wouldn't dry out my skin. I decided to take a chance on this one since I generally like Aveeno. I'm really pale so I did like that it added a tiny bit of color to my face and that I could just rub it like any moisturizer.Aside from that, I didn't like the sparkles in it. I can't tell you how hard it is for me to find a foundation or tinted moisturizer that doesn't have sparkles in it. I prefer my makeup to look like I'm not wearing any, the sparkles take away from that illusion.This is just a preference though, because apparently there are people who do like all that glitter in their makeup but if you're like me and prefer a more natural look, try a Korean BB cream instead like Skin79."
0,"Very incense like, but also powdery and a bit musty. Reminds me of slipcovers and drawer liners. Not what I was expecting at all. Kinda sticky too. Scent doesn't last very long either. All in all, not so great.(Egyptian Goddess scent)"
1,This is the ONLY brush in my huge collection of brushes that plays well with bare mineral products.  It ensures even application everytime and allows me to build more or less coverage as needed.  I appreciate that I don't have to switch brushes to use the mineral veil after the foundation.
1,"I have been using these for several years and have virtually no frown lines (I'm 46). They do take commitment, I use them every night (my husband calls it taping up my eyebrows lol). If you have sensitive skin they may irritate it and you should dampen them before you remove them in the morning if you don't want the pore strip type removal feeling. It takes a bit to get used to sleeping in them but if you keep using them you get used to the feeling and the results are worth it."
1,"I've read too many articles by doctors who say that high-priced creams are useless, and I agree, so this product is great for me. It's thick and creamy and truly fragrance free. I use it at night and use the SPF 30 lotion by day. I haven't noticed visible changes, but then again I'm not expecting anything dramatic. But for a good, sensitive skin night cream, this does the trick. No reason to pay more."
0,"Did nothing for my acne...Used it for 2 months,The pills are surger pills..Don't wast your money on this itemDo your homework first..."
