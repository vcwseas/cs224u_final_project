1,"Also works the best for heat rash in hot, humid weather!  Works for me!I wish I had known about No-Rinse Body Bath when my Father was confined to his bed in a nursing home.My Father was in a wonderful, caring nursing home, so I called the Registered Nurse and recommended this wonderful  product.!"
1,"Overall, this is a great brush for applying mineral makeup. I have Bare Minerals, and it works great for putting it on my face. I have used other kabuki brushes, and it seems as though this one is more precise and doesn't put too much makeup in one place like some of the other brushes seemed to. Other people have mentioned in reviews that this brush loses bristles...of course it does, it's a brush! However, I only notice a bristle or two coming out once in a while, it's not a huge problem.I would recommend this brush, and I'm glad I bought it."
1,"After what was supposed to be a medium brown dye job turned into black I went looking for something that might correct the unfortunate mistake. My friend suggested to me that I try the One n' Only ColorFix (which is also available at Sally's for about $13). It worked like a charm! It left my hair a medium auburn brown after one application. The ColorFix can be used up to 3 times safely and at my hair length (shoulder-length), one box would have provided those three applications. Best of all it didn't leave my hair dry or damaged at all! The only thing that prevented me from rating this product 5 stars is the smell. I joke that it smells like death but if you're looking for more clarification it smells a lot like sulfer or rotten eggs. That smell will resurface for the first several days that you wet your hair to shampoo it. However, the end result is worth it. Highly recommend."
1,"I love different types of colognes and rotate between about 4 or 5 on a daily basis. I picked up 'ck One' the other day and immediately fell in love with the scent. It is a unique smell that cannot be compared to any other cologne I have come across. It is very fresh, but somewhat spicy; subtle, yet compliment-inducing. This is a fine product that is neither overpowered nor underpowered, but definitely noticeable enough to get some nice words to come your way from others. I may have trouble rotating between all my other colognes now that I found this gem. Highly recommended.Also: It appears that some of the reviews here are calling the product counterfeit when sold by Amazon and claim it smells like nothing but alcohol. For clarification purposes, I'd like to mention that I bought my bottle from a department store and it smells like the intended fragrance."
0,"I bought these for the mild acne on my chin and for convenience sake I mean, cleanser and exfoliater in one pad, plus great reviews AND a decent price, sounded great. Well, I used these at night for one week and these evil little pads ruined my face. I had and still have little red bumps all over my forehead and cheeks like my skin was burned off! I haven't used the pads in 2 days now, but my skin is still very dry, even peeling in some spots and the bumps are still there. Oh and my acne is still there too.No, I haven't changed anything else in my skincare routine either.I've NEVER had skin problems before, besides the above mentioned mild acne on my chin, so seeing red bumps all over my face was a little frightening. Hopefully they'll go away soon..I like Aveeno, I really do, so this is very disappointing, if I could give this zero stars I would."
1,* The shampoo works fine and I did like it better than the Almond and Shea Shampoo.* A great find for the price.
1,"This product is relatively good in the sense that it prevents breakouts. I usually put it on troubled areas every other night, and I've had few breakouts since I started to use this. Even though there are several creams that are more effective prescribed by the doctor (Aberela is extremely effective and my favorite for sure), this Neutrogena cream is the most effective I've had without having a prescription. It does make your skin dry"
1,"Worked well for my 2 long haired dogs. Their hair requires alot of product, but it made their hair very clean and shiny looking after."
1,"Received in timely fashion.  Price is less than the store, item is the same."
1,"I bought this to apply to my four post surgery incisions. Not straight away of course, but once the skin has knitted together, this oil works well for softening the skin and I think it helps with the healing process too."
1,Smells so fresh and clean... not too over powering... very natural Geranium aroma.... use it for shower soap also : )
1,this product doesn't feel heavy but is a bit greasy. but I love the coverage and it does last a long time. very little goes a long way. I will use this again.
1,"I ordered this product to combat acne both for my face and body (arms shoulders etc) So far it has worked wonderfully and I am pleased with the decrease in breakouts and how quickly existing acne is fading. I am not using three times a day as reccomended as I have extremely sensitive skin and tend to be conserative with any new creams, but so far so good no irritation!"
1,"I've used plenty of lotions that soften and hydrate, but don't remove the dry flaky skin. This lotion removes the flaky skin and leaves the hands smooth.  So far it the best lotion I've found to do this. I think it would be good for people with psoriasis on their hands."
1,"I picked up this dryer when I was staying some nights at my fiancee's apartment, so I could stash it out of his way when I wasn't there. It folds in half and the cord retracts into the handle, making it very small. I was immediately impressed with the power, I have pretty thick hair but I could completely dry it in just a few minutes. When we got married and bought a house it has stayed on with me, becoming my primary hair dryer. I have used it daily for about 3 years now and it has not faltered, definitely worth it!"
1,"I've been using this product for over 2 months now and am really pleased with how effective it is. I use it on any big problem pimples I get on my face, and by the next day the pimple will be much smaller! For me, this product dries out the pimple and ""purges"" it, making it come to a head very quickly, so it goes away quicker. If you have dry skin, be prepared for a little bit of peeling around the area you put the product. (I have extremely dry skin, but this doesn't cause excessive drying or anything uncomfortable, just peeling.) I'll definitely rebuy this product!"
1,This may work for some but not for me so I am still searching. for a moisturizer that will work for my skin.
1,"It does it's job, heats up quickly, and creates beautiful curls/waves. Definitely recommend it, especially given its wonderful price. I have average hair and use the iron at heat setting 17."
1,"I used the product because my skin was in bad shape. I love it, it had brightened my complextion and helped clear up all my skin problmes. My skin feels relaxed and clean with out the tight dry feeling. It also doubles and a makeup remover and it does a great job."
1,"I use this gel for everything skin (it moisturizes and soothes) and hair (its all natural feels good on the scalp and gives it a healthy shine. I read in a book about its great effects on hair).Also unlike with other brands Lily of the Valley is certified organic 99% Aloe Vera, while most other brands contain mostly water and only small traces of Aloe Vera. This is an absolutely great product."
1,"I added this oil to my bath.  It smells great, slightly of lemon and mint.  It separated out on the surface of my bath (not surprising since it is an oil).  It did leave my skin very soft.It kind of clings to the bath tub though and it was tough to get it cleaned off of the surface of the tub.  Left the tub very greasy.  It might work better as a massage oil or as something you apply directly to your skin."
0,"I have oily, oily, oily skin.  I would wash my face with this scrub, go to bed and then wake-up and my face would be extremely oily.  It's like my oily glands went into overdrive.  I didn't notice any of the skin brightening claims.  The only thing I love about this product is the smell.  I love the smell and that's it!"
1,I chose this soap because it doesn't have the chemicals that regular soaps have.  It lathers up nice and washes away without any film on my skin.  The smell is very pleasant as well.  I would recommend this to others.
1,I've used this moisturizer for a couple of years.  Great daytime moisturizing product.  Not at all greasy.  Easily absorbed and does a great job.  With Subscribe and Save the price and convenience only make this better!
1,"Moisturizing beads turn an ordinary bath into something luxurious.  The water feels wonderful on your skin, and the fragrance just hightens the sense of being pampered.The bonus?  You'll get out of the tub with skin that's velvety and moist, rather than taut and dehydrated."
1,I have coarse hair and this brush gets the job done. I'm really happy that I made this purchase and I would recommend this product to anybody with long hair.
1,"I use Lorraine Massey's ""Curly Girl"" method to take care of my kinky-curly 4a hair and adapted her conditioner washes (or washing with conditioner in place of shampoo). The theory is that shampoo has too many drying surfactants. Conditioner, on the other hand is not so drying, and still has the ability to cleanse.)Suave's Tropical Coconut conditioner is wonderful for many purposes. Add amla, maka, kalpi tone or other ayurvedic powders to Suave Tropical Moisture, and leave it on overnight for a really good deep conditioning.This conditioner also helps to detangle my hair when I comb it under a stream of water during my showers. It smells sweet, like coconuts (which probably comes from the fragrance and coconut extract). The consistency of this conditioner is a medium-thick consistency. It leaves my hair soft, moisturized and with a slight sheen after use.This conditioner is not ""natural"" but it has humectants like cetyl alcohol, glycerin and honey. It also contains silk proteins (to strengthen hair). Rosemary and nettle are included to promote scalp health and hair growth. Good conditioner for a low price.Note, just because it works for my hair, it may not work for you. Please do a test to see if this one works for you.Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Cetyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Distearyldimonium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, 2-Bromo-2-Nitropropane-1,3-Diol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Propylene Glycol,Trocopheryl Acetate [Vitamin E Acetate], Silk Amino Acids, Honey, Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Extract"
1,it doesn't wear well under make-up. It's just a little oily. Other than that...I love this product. I use it mainly on my neck and chest (and on my face on my days off) and it has evened out my skin tone and faded my sun-spots ALOT. Especially on my chest...HUGE difference from a few years ago! It really is a great All-in-One Product- I've been using it for years and haven't found a better one yet. I'll keep on buying it!
1,This is a very preety color that works for a variety of skin tones. I am a blk woman about Whtiney Houstan's completion btw and this color looks wonderful on me.
1,"If you have PUPPs, I am so sorry. I've been there. So bad that when my husband was putting steroid cream on me, I turned around and he was actually crying. My midwife at one checkup called the doctor and didn't realize she left the door open a crack and I heard her say, ""I've never seen it this bad! Ever!"" So yeah. Bad. And it can last for a few weeks after you deliver (mine did) which I didn't know until my doula told me -- so in the end I'm glad I didn't get induced early, but I certainly considered it. A lot. The oral steroids which I held off until week 38 (I wasn't sleeping much by then so there was not much choice) did help a ton, but before then this soap helped (although it was terribly drying so use a very rich bath oil and cream afterwards). And to sleep a few hours I actually would take a hot bath scrubbing with a brush and this soap -- which would make the itch worse (the theory is, when that much histamine is released all at once, your body then fights it for a few hours at least) and that is how I was able to sleep. But I don't recommend it unless you're about to lose your tentative grip on reality. The steroid cream really did nothing (but make my husband cry lol). The oral steroids were amazing and I'm glad I waited so long because my DD has no ill effects. I also have NO scarring despite my itching in my sleep wherever I could reach. So it will not last and you will barely remember it a year or more down the road. And even though mine lingered in a few areas after delivery, it was nowhere near as bad as week 35-38! Hang in there, Momma! Try this. And try to remember, it does get better!"
1,"Great stuff.  If you have blemishes, this works and clears in a month with twice a day application.  In day time I use as smashbox. spf 20 over top of it."
0,"I used to really love Bare Minerals..... until I found out about the ingredient Bismuth Oxychloride. At first my face LOVED this stuff. But after a few months of using it I noticed that when I wore it my face would be itchier then usual. I also started breaking out a LOT more then usual. It wasn't until I did some investigative work that I found out about that Bismuth ingredient and how heavy it is on your face. The whole reason you have to BUFF the makeup on is because the Bismuth Oxychloride is so heavy that it needs to be PUSHED into your skin. I noticed that my makeup felt and eventually looked like it slid off my face BECAUSE of how heavy it really is (you wouldn't think it was a heavy makeup being that it's mineral powder!)I stopped using this stuff and IMMEDIATELY saw a difference in my face. It went from being ruddy looking to clean and clear and glowing. I switched my makeup to Alima Mineral makeup and WHAT a difference! For one thing you don't have to BUFF the stuff onto your face, and I feel you get SO much more powder for the price (Which is about the same as Bare Minerals!) The whole reason it feels like you get so much more is because you use a lot LESS! I LOVE Alima Mineral Makeup!"
1,"I normally don't like acne medications - they dry out your skin and then your face is a flaky mess.  With this stuff, you just apply a little dab to each pimple and it starts to work within 24 hrs - no flaking or irritation.  For a small pimple, applying it once a day is plenty; for something more severe, I usually apply 2-3 times per day.  Either way, the pimple completely clears up within a few days (hurray!)."
1,I keep coming back to the EO products for my showering needs. The scents are not strong but just enough Aroma-Escape therapy. Its a quality *alternative to shampooing & no'poo. Would like to see larger sizes.
1,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE AND SHE LOVED. RETINOL CORREXION WORK'S GREAT. IT IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT.THANK YOU AGAIN.
1,"If you want something soothing, something that makes you feel very clean, and something that can take all your makeup off without any residue.... you'll like this."
1,This is a great and natural product for oily skin. Just make sure to dilute it in water to avoid a skin burn.
1,I always seem to get pimples on my chin when I stress out. Well this has always gotten rid of them for me. I don't use it continuously but when I do the pimples go away. I love it!I compared it to other products and this is the only product that contains 10-percent benzoyl peroxide. Other acne products usually contain .5 - 2% Salicylic acid which for me doesn't get rid of pimples.
1,"such awesome moisture spray, spray a few times after washing face, dont even need a moisturizer of lotion, this keeps my face very soft and quenched."
1,"I tried several other types of cotton rounds/squares, but these won hands down.  And you get a TON of squares, so economical as well as functional.  I order two packages at a time and used them for everything from cleansing to applying makeup.  There are 165 squares in each package."
1,I love this product. unequivocally think this is the best eye makeup remover there. I recommend it! Now some of my friends have asked and are equal to or more happy than me for the purchase.
1,Absorbs into skin within 5 minutes (just &#34;work it&#34; into the skin a bit).  I especially love oils during the winter months since skin can become dry due to indoor heating.  I love to use this just after showering.
1,"It does work on my skin! Skin is soft, looks a little bit younger too :)"
1,"Of course it stinks and takes forever, but so far, the perm has lasted for a couple of months on my daughter's very long hair. I'm impressed."
1,"My hair is completely damage because of I straightened way too much! I started using Aveeno and OH BOY! what a difference it was!, my hair has gone back to it's black, soft, natural, and beautiful look! A MUST HAVE PRODUCT!I use the body wash and conditioner as well, and OMG!"
1,"This product is lovely for winter skin. It is thick though, so I mixed it into my favorite lotion to add even more moisture. I have eczema on my feet that has really cleared up since I've added this to my lotion. For the price, it is definitely worth a try if you are experiencing a puzzling skin issue."
0,"I applied the cream correctly every time, and it soothes effectively and provides a protective barrier for the skin, BUT does not deliver moisture to the skin The product doesn't have much moisture in it in the first place because it is ""concentrated"" apparently but i need moisture!! WHY ELSE WOULD I BUY HAND CREAM? obviously i want to moisturize my dry hands.The texture is grainy, I'm guessing it's the concentrated bits of dried cream or something, but it's very unpleasant feeling. It smells like plastic even though it's fragrance free."
1,This is a well constructed brush that gives the sensation of a head massage with every stroke. Seems like it will last for forever.
1,"Love, love, love these headbands. They DO NOT hurt anywhere on my head and they stay put!!  So easy to put on and never any need to readjust them."
1,"I do not use the Obagi line, however, I did years ago. The line I currently use (for four years) does not have a toner and I wanted to include in my daily skin routine.  After reading all the reviews and ingredients I thought I try Obagi.  The scent is pleasant and it felt good on my skin.  Unfortunately, after one full day of use (morning & night) it made my skin too dry due to the witch hazel. I was hoping with aloe vera in the ingredients it would've helped but it didn't.  I'm bummed!  I still believe Obagi is a good line -- it's just didn't work for me."
1,I have used witch hazel on my face for years now and when I saw this one with the rose in it I was really excited.  While I have oily skin this will clear it up and last for a little while but I notice my skin going back to really oily more so than I did with the Dickinson's original Witch Hazel.  The smell is great but I don't think my skin likes this one.
1,This is not easy to find in drug stores.  Fragrance free.  No nonsense.  All their fragrance free stuff is excellent.  I think the quality is better than Curel.
1,"Bought this for my sister as a gift for her birthday since she is in love with this scent and she was very happy, price was perfect and was shipped fast."
1,this soap smell so good;i wish I had ordered more; definetly make your body feel smooth and silky; great buy
1,"This is an ok moisturizing lotion, but Neutrogena has others, that are even better. Their oil-free moisture lotion seems to go on too thick (compared to other products) and gives my skin a greasy, shiny, look when worn under makeup. I use it instead as a nighttime moisturizing cr&egrave;me before bed (because of it's thick consistency and shine).There are times when my skin gets especially dry and the moisture provided here, would not be enough. I would have to keep re-applying and re-applying on my especially dry skin, sometimes many times throughout the day. (I would need a more intense moisturizing product during those times). The moisture provided from this product isn't always enough.Neutrogena has a lot of very excellent skin moisturizing products. I also use their ""Healthy Defense daily moisturizer"" with tint, to use underneath makeup and add a touch of color to the face. That one goes on a little thick too, but it's worth it to have a natural glow. And it is more of a matte finish, without the oil or shine.My favorite is the ""Neutrogena Visibly Even moisturizer"" which I am able to apply both day and night, as it goes on very smooth, thin, and light. I find it most excellent for daytime use and it even provides a nice healthy glow. The ""visibly even""  Neutrogena product has added essential soy's and extra moisturizing ingredients to deal with even the driest of skins. It contains just the right amount of moisturizers to help my skin on the most driest of days, without being too thick and creamy, or greasy. It also covers skin blotches and dark spots as well.Before purchasing this facial moisturizer for the first time, I would take a look at some others that are out there. Do some comparasing and get the product that is right for you. There are so many out there to choose from, and Neutrogena, in particular, offers a wide array of skin products, for practically any skin type. This model is just their most basic one."
1,"I have used this perfume since I have 17 and I never tire of it, is really great ... and I will continue buying it at this store because they have an excellent service! Thanks very grateful!"
1,"I am a woman of color who has single-handedly managed to ruin her hair over a number of years. My hair was so damaged from heat styling, relaxers and weaves that I ran out of ideas. I decided to eliminate the problems one at a time. I quit relaxing, then I gave myself a break from all the weaving and eased off on the heat styling. My hair started to grow healthily but I was lacking a great shampoo to go with my new regime. I tried this shampoo not expecting too much because I have wasted a lot of money before and never had the results I needed but I have got to tell you. I am so glad I did because after a few washes I noticed my hair texture was softer and there was little to no shedding! I am now addicted to Aphogee products, I decided to invest in a whole range of other products from them and I couldn't be happier!"
1,"I have been using it to create soft waves or curls on my whole head. I had to turn the heat down otherwise the curls are too tight. But I feel that whatever your needs are, this would do it. I have hair just past my shoulder blades & it works very well on it."
1,"It suds up, has a weak scent that does not last  at all. I am sorry I spent money on it.It is overpriced. I will never order from this brand line again."
1,"I LOVE this polish!  Its classic and pretty for the spring/summer, but I also wear it all year round. It's my go-to color! And perfect for every occasion!  Looks great with shorter nails!"
1,This is one of my favorite PRT products. I use it every morning as part of my skin care regimen. It helps keep my skin clear and fresh. Just an all around great BHA product! Will definitely buy another bottle when I run out.
1,"I have fine hair and already own a Sonia Kashuk paddle brush that has a mixture of boar and nylon bristles, so I figured this brush would work great too.  The boar bristles in this brush are great for distributing oils and the nylon bristles are great for grabbing onto my hair (which is thick even though it's fine).  I also like that this brush does not cause static flyaways or pull and tug at my hair.  This is a great, affordable brush that makes blowouts so much easier.Important notes: brushes with natural bristles are recommended for all hair types as they do less damage to hair.  Also, if you were wondering what size to get, the smaller the diameter of the brush, the more lift and volume it provides."
1,"I was pleasantly surprised with this one. Feels very light and I think it really did make my skin look better. Just try it. With the prices here on Amazon, you can't afford not to. Go on just try it."
1,"This is one of the best ones I have used, It really works and I have used it now for over 4 yearsTracie Bobb, Philadelphia, Pa."
1,"For things like BB cream, it works okay.But if you wear eye makeup and lipstick, specially the red ones, use makeup remover."
1,This is the best pore cleaner.  Look who makes it.  All there products are wonderful and will not ever change.  I would recommend.
1,This product really takes the gunk off my face.  I have been wearing Liquid eyeliner and that new gel liner in black a lot and when I use other cleansers for my face I still look like a raccoon under my eyes and residual makeup stays...but not with this product.I love to wear makeup and I must admit I dont normally take it off at night because Im too tired-but this product make its so easy to take my makeup off easily and with little effort.It is a foam pump but it comes out with a slightly creamy consistency which works very well.the only gripe I have with this product is that it doesnt feel refreshing after you clean your face-it just does the job I think it would be nice if it had a cooling effect to it.
0,"I bought this thinking it would be as fragrant as other oils that I have used.  Not so.  I put a small amount of this on right after I got it, which was fast, and you could smell it for a few minutes.  Then nothing.  I thought maybe I didn't put enough on, so I reapplied.  Same thing happened, even though I used more the second time.  I emailed the company to see if it was possible to get an out dated or bad batch.  They wrote back and told me that their oils aren't like other ones and you need to apply it 4-5 times to get the fragrance to last.  Does anyone else see something wrong with that?!  Seems ridiculous to me.  Anyway, I'm not going to send it back so I guess I'll just use it when I want to smell it for a few minutes.  Wish I would have known because I wouldn't have gotten it or done business with this company."
1,I installed this mirror to make it easier for me to braid my hair.  I love it.  It doesn't seem like the most sturdy construction but has already lasted a year with regular use and no problems.
1,I am glad I found this product. It's very refreshing and cleanses my face really well and it doesn't dry up the skin. I used to have so many pimples in my forehead but they are gone now. I use it in the morning or night before going to bed. It also smells great... like roses!
1,"I got a packet of this in a product sample box and thought I'd give it a go. I had a small whitehead forming that was painful and red. By the time the product had dried on my skin, it had drained, and the next morning it was healing. I've never had a blemish with such a short lifespan!This product draws oil out of your pores like nothing else I've tried. My skin is left soft and supple. I usually throw on alpha hydroxy moisturizer right after, and haven't noticed any adverse affects from that. The morning after I use this on any blemishes, they are greatly improved and healing at a much quicker pace than without.I didn't have any irritation or redness when I used it, but my husband tried it on a spot and did have redness afterward. he said he did have a bit of tingling, which I've never had.This is the best clay mask I've ever used, and the price is just an unexpected bonus.If I'm in a hurry, I'll throw it on my problem areas and jump in the tub and wipe it off when it dries. It does a good job of evening out my oiliness, and keeping any blemishes at bay."
0,"I purchased this at a local store and since I absolutely love lime and lemon scents, I figured this was going to be very special.  Unfortunately, my bottle has zero scent. It doesn't smell like anything at all.  I really wish I had pulled the tab before purchase and smelled.  It bubbles up just like all philosophy 3-in-1 gels and leaves you feeling soft and moisturized.  There just is no scent and lets face it that is what draws most of us to the philosophy line is that great smell.  All this being said, from the other reviews I gather I am in the minority and have to figure that the bottle I received was defective.  Most of the time if I purchase a philosophy scent that I don't love I will pass it along to one of my daughters but this one I simply threw out."
1,Very moisturizing and great protection against the elements at a reasonable price. I have sensitive skin that irritates easily and this has always been kind to it.
0,You cannot use this under make up you can not use this at all. Now I sound like Dr. Suess lol. It peels off as you rub it in I was not happy w/ this at all
1,This instant heat hot brush heats up almost instantly! In less than 30 seconds I would say. Keeps my hair curly. Recommend!
1,"I discovered this color on what was my never ending search for the perfect bright copper red hair color. I found it once at  Target, then when I went back to get more, they were sold out. I went to every drugstore in the area for months and no one ever has it in stock. Finally I did an internet search and have been ordering it on automatic delivery ever since. The color is not for the faint of heart-it definitely gets noticed. I love it. I am stopped regularly by men-and women and complimented. There is no comparable product out there. I even went to a beauty outlet and worked with a sales person but the color came out more pink than copper. This is so much easier."
1,"I first stumbled into the world of essential oils back in 1990 when I needed a part-time job and there was an opening for ""Weekends Only"" at a tiny Aromatherapy store in Lincoln Park, Chicago. Back in those days, very few people had even heard of the word and thought FRAGRANCE oils to be synonymous with ESSENTIAL OILS.  It was an invaluable experience working in that store and it changed my life in regards to taking charge of my PERSONAL wellness through the use of Essential Oils.NO DRUG IS A PANACEA OR MAGIC BULLET FOR EVERYONE!!!! I state this clearly because of the few negative reviews that all the various company's that sell Tea Tree Oil have received. For instance, I'm allergic to Peroxide. The pills Asprin and Tylenol have zero effect on me. So, if you have NEVER used Tea Tree Oil, BUY THE SMALLEST BOTTLE YOU CAN FIND AND TRY IT OUT ON YOURSELF! If you're as lucky as I am, it will be your Go-To Treatment for 99% of ""What Ails You.""I've tried many a company's Tea Tree Oil and have finally settled on THIS brand. Why? The reasons I list work for ME; they may not work for YOU:1) It's in a CLEAR bottle! I know, I know: having E.O.'s in blue/amber bottles protects them from the light, but so does storing them in a dark place. I like being able to SEE how much is used so I know when to buy more.2) It does NOT have a calibrated ""Rain Drop"" apeture in the top, meaning that you can POUR the oil out or use these micro measuring spoons when creating hair or bath products.Norpro 3080 Mini Measuring Spoons, 5 Piece Set3) PRICE!!!!! Compared to other company's with fancier labels and prettier bottles, this product is several dollars LESS expensive than the other brands, without losing a bit of effectiveness.4) Availability!!!! Since this product does NOT ship through Amazon Prime, there's no cost savings to me. Both my local Whole Foods and Trader Joe's sell this brand, so I am no more than a 10 minute drive in any direction when I am running low.Okay, those are the reasons why I buy THIS brand. Now, HOW do I use it and HOW has it helped me?1) For my body, Tea Tree Oil is Magical!!! Every single thing that you can find online with HOW this oil works, it responds that well in MY body! YOUR results may vary. Since discovering the sheer effectiveness on my system, I keep no less than SIX bottles in our lives: in my purse; in our first aid kits; and in every medicine cabinet. My family has been taught by me that Tea Tree Oil is thee FIRST response to ANYTHING that breaks the skin and it's kept our medical bills down to ZERO. Yes, ZERO!!!, in regards to the common things you go to the doctor for.2) I have had chronic and debilitating ear infections my entire life. As a child, I've spent weeks in hospital with infections that threatened my life. Countless surgeries on my ears have done NOTHING to stop the infections, which can come on in an hour. Now, as soon as I feel the Tell-Tale tingling in my ear, I grab my bottle of Tea Tree Oil and swipe it down the entire side of my face. I repeat this process every single hour until the tingling stops. Results? NO MORE EAR INFECTIONS AND NO MORE HOSPITALIZATIONS OR DOCTOR VISITS!!!3) When my family and I have a scratchy throat or have been subjected to anyone with a severe cold or the flu, we place a couple of drops on a cotton pad and then deeply inhale the vapors and hold it in our lungs for the count of five, then exhale and repeat the process. Since doing this, NO ONE in my family has had a cold or the flu in 8 years!!!! NO ONE!4) We have a Summer Cottage near a lake which means ticks, chiggers and mosquitoe bites. One drop of this oil on ANY of the following solves the itch, the pain and the resulting infections. We've seen ticks actually back out of the skin when a drop of this oil is placed on their backs!5) Tooth infections! I had four Wisdom Teeth extracted. After it was okay to rinse my mouth, I placed a drop of Tea Tree Oil in warm water and would rinse out my mouth when directed. When I went in for my check up, my dentist was SHOCKED at the healing of my gums and was suspicious as to WHY they had healed so well and so fast! Seriously, Dr.? Shouldn't you have just been HAPPY for me? LOL6) And for me, directly, the use of Tea Tree Oil in my daily job is a God Send! I'm a Landscape Architect with a staff of 17 men. Every single day, we get injured; it comes with the job. Whether it's a deep penetration of a thorn, a complete scraping of skin from a tree you're climbing, a deep knick when you're sharpening a pruner, or a massive sliver that got jammed into a palm, we have daily injuries. Since we can't stop work when this happens, we normally would just rinse the area off with a hose and continue working. More than half of the time, these injuries would get worse, with either the employee or myself loosing productivity or hours, because we couldn't use that hand or arm.Now, I've taught every one of my guys to come to me for treatment and they hold out their injury to receive some drops of Tea Tree Oil. At first, they were skeptical; now, some are SO convinced, they've had me buy bottles for their own homes. And for home use, this oil is amazing! I've had deep knife cuts from a knife slipping out of my hands while washing; I've had deep scratches from our dogs and cats when we've tried to corral them for the vet; and 100% of these injuries NEVER get infected nor turn pink or swollen if treated immediately with this oil. Healing time is 3-5 times faster than when left untreated.We've used this oil for acne, cold sores, tooth aches, ear infections, athlete's foot, insect bites and all manner of skin breaks. For whatever reasons, our DNA works with this oil. That's why I'm giving it such glowing reviews. YOUR results may NOT be the same.In closing, I'd recommend that you buy the smallest bottle possible, to keep it fresh and pure. In my home and purse, I buy the .05 ounce size and when it's half full, I buy a replacement bottle and store it in the frig. Remember, NOTHING that you put to the opening is sterile (cotton balls, swabs or your fingers!), so with each touch of the oil, you are contaminating it. So, buying a large 2 ounce bottle just allows the oil to become less and less effective. The one exception for me, is that for work I buy the 2 ounce bottle, simply because we go through one of those bottles at least once a month and it's more cost effective.Also, if you want to learn about more health benefits of essential oils, THIS book is the BEST there is!Aromatherapy: A Complete Guide to the Healing ArtI've been using this book since it was first published in 1995 and use it as my ""Betty Crocker"" default for healing common injuries and problems within my family. It's NEVER failed me in 18 years of use."
1,"This has been my goto color for more than 10 years.  I love it!  I hint of red, without overdoing it and looking fake.  Fake is fine, but not at my age!"
1,"I really like this mascara. I have to admit I was hoping for a brighter blue, but honestly this probably looks better than a really bright blue. It's subtle enough that you could wear it to the office and only those who were really paying attention would notice. It is what it says it is - a royal blue. But I think it does accentuate my blue eyes. And it's a lot more fun than plain old black or brown mascara!"
1,"I have waist length hair and this is the best comb I have found to prevent snarls after showering. What was a wrestling match with other combs is effortless with this one. It is easy on my head, doesn't pull any hair out. Great price. I highly recommend it!"
1,This works!! However my hair is long and down to my waist and I only got 2 uses out of it.
1,"This oil had a stronger odor than I expected.  I expected it to be more on the light side, but to me, it is a bit on the heavy side.  However, I used it in my office which is rather small.  Maybe it would be better in a larger room.so the odor can disperse more."
0,"The first time I used Avalon's Vitamin C eye cream, my eyes began to sting so badly that I was uncomfortable for 24 hours.  I thought that maybe I had used too much, so I tried again several days later with only a tiny amount, being careful to keep it away from my lashes.  My eyes still became uncomfortable. This is the exact opposite of what an eye cream should do.  The whole point of eye cream is to be thick enough not to melt and get into your eyes and, if it does, it should not sting. That's why eye cream is different than face cream. This one fails. I won't be using it again."
1,"As another reviewer mentioned, this is not a miracle worker - but it sure makes a difference between using it and not using it.I'm early 60's and have been using it about 6 years.  No, it doesn't make me look 45.  But it is wonderful at clarifying my skin and smoothing the texture of my face.  Not greasy or oily, and if you want more hydration, simply layer a moisturizer for that purpose over it.  I use it every day and love its light, velvety finish.  Plus, it beats the heck out of department store brand prices for products very similar in quality."
1,"As far as drugstore mascaras go, I have loved Full N Soft for years. Drugstore mascara is inexpensive, so I have often experimented with other brands/formulas - Maybelline, Revlon, L'Oreal, etc., but Full N Soft is the one I come back to. It is great in a single coat and also builds well. If building, I recommend using a clean mascara brush to separate between coats. If during the day your lashes get bent (this happens to me with sun and prescription glasses), use your finger to apply pressure and curve lashes back in place. The flexible formula will re-mold. No flakes, no mess.The brownish-black is natural and minky-coloured. The super black is dramatically black!"
1,"I have acne prone, oily and sensitive skin. I've used this product for a couple of months. It's not a very light product. It leaves a residue  and is absorbed very slowly. It could leave a greasy feeling all day long. Over time, I noticed my skin got softer but I didn't notice any other claimed benefits.At least it didn't cause acne. It could be a little bit better than regular moisturizers if you have a normal to dry skin."
1,We were using coconut oil until my mom introduced us to the apricot kernel oil. It is wonderful! Much lighter and doesn't have a strong smell. Will keep using for all moisturizing needs...
1,"Out of my two favourite brands, Opi comes on top over China Glaze. In particular, my favourites from Opi are Russian Navy and Jade is the New Black. The jade colour is rich and highly pigmented, and will last quite a while if used correctly and a base and top coat are applied to the nail. The only thing I don't like about Opi products is that some of the names that are meant to be cleverly humourous aren't hitting the target (like their German collection. Some of the names were worthy of a sigh and and a roll of the eyes). But eh, each to their own."
1,"Neutrogena Fresh foaming cleanser is amazing. It Removes make up easily,even waterproof, and it doesn't sting if it gets in your eyes. It also clears you skin of dirt and oil which would have caused blemishes. This is not an acne fighting product it just cleans your skin and removes makeup. Since i started using this my face is noticeably smoother and softer. I love Neutrogena!"
1,"I own a few of NARS' lipsticks: Barbarella, Heat Wave, Funny Face, Roman Holiday... Heat Wave and Funny Face are wonderful for a bold lip, Barbarella and Roman Holiday are perfect for an everyday face. Barbarella is very shear and I feel that the swatch is very dark and off putting on the browser, in real life it's a very soft peachy color. Roman Holiday is my go it, it gives a beautiful shear finish that give my already pink lips a little lift."
1,"I'm rather lazy at washing my face, so this product is great at removing makeup at the end of the day when I'm too tired to wash it.  After using it for a while, I think it actually is doing a better job at cleaning my face than soap and water.  Super fast, super easy."
1,I like this because it does not cause an allergic reaction to my eyes as most other products do.  Also I love how I can wash it off with water and soap. It does not come off . It stay on . I live in humid Florida. I can be outside all day and it stays on until I wash it off.
0,"I picked up this concealer to cover up acne, blemishes, pimples, the works.  I was trying to decided between this one and the light one but decided to go with this one as the green is supposed to cancel out the redness.  This stick concealer is near impossible to blend to a nice finish and it leaves a sticky and waxy residue on your skin. As to no surprise, the packaging is just as flawed as the product itself.  Within a week of using this product the concealer stuck to the top of the tube and I couldn't get it out.  Ick!"
1,I couldn't believe it but after five short days i noticed the difference. Now I am going to look for a Roc brand eye cream and I can get rid of the high dollar creams I've been using. Give it a try!
1,"When you're a grown up and you take a bubble bath it's more for stress relief than for bubbles. This doesn't foam up too terribly, and dissipates enough after 20 minutes or so (shorter if you splash around more) so you can use the water for an actual bath like you can't always do with a really foamy bubble bath."
1,It has a nice fragrance but I was hoping it would help to make my hair less frizzy than if I didn't use it.  My hair was soft but still frizzy.
1,"I have the NARS duo eyeshadow in Brumes. The product is velvety smooth, easily blendable, and highly pigmented. NARS has a large variety of colors to choose from. While some of them are neutral, most of them are vivid and bold, so if you're not a fan of intense eye makeup, you should probably look elsewhere. However, you can have a lot of fun playing with these colors. The Brumes shades are a deep charcoal gray and a dark, shimmery grayish-blue. I love them, but they're super dramatic, so consider yourself warned."
1,I'm fair with warm coloring.  This is a great red as it's not too cool.  Perfect blend of red.  It's shimmer in a lovely way.  Good for day wear and perfect for night !
1,"I've used this color for years, sometimes mixing with another Clairol Natural Instincts to give more red, and have always been completely satisfied.  Have had many compliments on my hair."
1,I use this to help with the tangles ....it smells like the beach ! Coconuts ! I thought the price was for 1 but was very happy to get 3 bottles of this !! SO a great value ! You spray in and leave it ...my hair is soft and shiny...it does not weigh it down at all. I put one bottle in my beach bag !
1,"This is no secret, but Nars Orgasm blushers are the best!!  And who would think by looking at the shade?  It looks way too bright and peachy/pinky/orangey!  But, nope, it actually ends up looking quite natural.  I use it on my cheeks, then dab a bit on my lips.  And on little makeup days I use it as eyeshadow as well."
1,"polish stays on longer than with a regular base coat, and it seems to smooth out the ridges in my nails, too."
1,I love love love this soap for my excema-sensitive babies.  It is perfect and gentle for them and doesn't cause any rashes or itching.
0,"Olay Age Defying Classic Eye Gel.  This popularly-priced product by Olay claims that it is a soothing, cooling gel that will revitalize and moisturize the eye area to minimize the appearance of signs of aging, and that it will work on normal, dry, combination/oily, oily skin.  It will, the manufacturers state, replenish moisture in the eye area, helping to minimize the look of fine lines and wrinkles, or puffy areas.  It contains a rather odd list of ingredients, old-fashioned witch hazel, cucumber extract,, fruit extract and flower oil, as well as variations on glycol/glycerine,B Vitamins, and some more advanced ingredients.  The makers advise that it should be dotted around the eye area and smoothed in until absorbed.I know it has nothing to do with the important issues of the day, but I have gone through years of problems in my eye area: redness, swelling, tearing up, sparse lashes, and have tried most eye creams out there, I think, from drug store price to department store price to cosmoceutical.  I actually tried two bottles of this product, and found its effects to be odd indeed.  On the one hand it did feel comfortingly cool.  But it did not feel rich and emollient enough; and it further upset the sensitive skin of my eye area.  Not recommended."
0,"This is the first time I bought this from this seller and it looks exactly the same, is in the exact same jar as the product I bought directly from bare minerals but it doesn't cover my skin flaws at all.  The stuff I bought directly from bare minerals was much more expensive but covered flaws and lasted all day.  This was a waste of money."
0,"It may have cleaned my hands well, I don't know because I disliked the smell so much I had to throw it away."
1,I love that Calvin Klein makes one fragrance for either a man or a woman!  Okay... I admit sometimes I LIKE the MENs fragrances even more than the WOMENs!!  That being said you can definitely tell this is a combination of both a man's and woman's fragrance.  You can pick up hints of each in this cologne. It's spicy yet very clean smelling. I think &#8220;clean&#8221; would be the optimal word to describe this cologne though.  Not overpowering and lasts the day.  Price point is exceptional for this size and it's a prime product!!!
1,"I have oily/acne prone skin and this toner is just wonderful.Its gentle and very refreshing. It will not leave your skin oily, or with a residue.Its alcohol free, and doesnt contain any harmful chemicals, etc.Feels great on your skin and helps prepare skin for your moisturizer.Rids skin of dirt, makeup, and impurities.Sometimes even after I wash my face I will have traces of my makeup lingering on my skin, but with swiping this toner with a cotton pad across my face and neck, it removes any leftover makeup.I am very pleased with this toner and will buy again and again!"
0,I didn't see any real results after using this entire product.  Others may find it works for them but it did nothing for my acne.  I used it every day and night regularly.
1,"My favorite moisturizer. doesn't leave my face oily, absorbs quickly, and leaves my face looking fresh and lovely. Will buy again"
1,"My husband gets severely chapped hands during the winter. When our doctor saw his hands, he recommended the Aveeno. We have been very pleased with its effectiveness.One of the better lotions out there."
1,"Let me start my ""story"" by saying I""m a black woman, age 47 and have always had great skin. . most people think I""m 35. So I decided to ""invest"" in my skin now that I""m getting older by trying a product that helps preserve your youthful looks.  I read all the reviews on this before I ordered it as I do with most things I order from Amazon, and was overall impressed.  So, when this arrived I couldn't wait to try it to see if I noticed any difference.  Within a week I did but not before my skin had it's little reaction to it.  Yes it stung, yes I had a few little bumps pop up, couple red blotches, . .perhaps it was some ""junk"" working its way out -- because after that my skin looked more even, more radiant, little lines were less noticeable. . I really like this and will be sticking with it."
1,My must have. Great for under eye circles. My top secret weapon that I need to buy every other month at least.
1,"The black opium scent was not a favorite upon opening it (though the sandalwood vanilla I received last week WAS).  It has a musky, dark smell to it.  I've never been a perfum fan so I can't compare it to any name brand scent on the market currently.  I was fairly impartial to the scent to begin with, but I dabbed some on.  It did not give me a headache as I thought it might, so I put a second dab on a little while later.  I was able to catch whiffs of it all day, the scent has staying power, and it grew on me throughout the day.  It won't be a fave, but it was good enough for me not to label it a dud.  I'm sure I'll try a third and probbaly fourth scent from them in the future, just not this one again."
1,"Scent wasn't what I had hoped for &#9829; Was hoping it would have been more musky, on a personal note nice scent, just not for me to wear during the day, more of a night time smell &#9829;"
1,"This lipstick really stays on for a full day and probably longer if you don't take it off at night before sleeping. It also stays on coffee cups, spoons, etc. through a dishwasher cycle so check carefully when unloading the dishes to be put away or your house will look like a bad restaurant. I use Neutrogena eye make-up remover to remove it at night and I have read that some people use baby oil. If you want to go all day without worrying about your lipstick, this is the product for you. Sometimes I wonder what exactly is in it to make it stay on so long, but it's probably better for my peace of mind not to know."
1,I use this product every night on my face after washing it and I have seen some wonderful results and will order it again soon.
1,My dermatologist recommended vanicream years ago and I still use it daily. I have found no product that I like better for moisturizing my skin.
1,"Very high quality. I bought this for my teen, but the scent is something I would consider for an elderly woman. Very good quality product though!"
0,I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS THING.IT IS NOT STICKY AT ALL. I TRIED ON MY FINGER IT FEELS LESS STICKY THAN COOKIE DOUGH. I MEAN SERIOUSLY!
0,"This is much smaller than I imagined. Also, the light is so faint that it doesn't make a difference whether its on or off. I wouldn't recommend it. Mine is getting donated."
1,"After using Olay Regerist Serum I could tell the difference in the tone and texture of my skin.  This product makes the skin feel smooth, silky, and does not leave a greasy feel.  I highly recommend this product for any woman who is not ashamed to reveal her age; especially after the use of this product."
1,The smell is a bit overpowering and I think it's okay.  It's probably for someone with more curly hair vs. wavy.
1,"Love their products!This company is in Rochester , MN home of the Mayo Clinic.This is a very good product you can feel good about using."
1,"I love this soap, it smells so fresh and clean and fruity! I have noticed it seems not to dry my hands out like other soaps."
1,"I don't go anywhere without this mask. I've had great success with it improving the overall condition of my skin. Any existing whiteheads that you have will be drawn to the surface, pores will be minimized, and oily skin will be cleaneed. It's so affordable and the amount they give you lasts forever. Virtually perfect!"
1,This  dish soap works better and the suds lasts longer than most of the earth-UNfriendly brands we're familiar with.  I love the smell of basil and this product replicates it very well.
1,"I chose this color because I saw a picture on instagram of stiletto nails with this polish and it looked absolutely stunning.  i tried it on as soon as i receive it and it was perfection.  OPI is my all time favorite brand, and I would definitely recommend this color.  It is not streaky at all and its the perfect red.It also arrived very quickly."
1,"Never before had used false eyelashes, but I've been watching some videos of makeup (ByCamilaCoelho) she is a beauty guru from Brazil and thousands of followers. She uses the eyelash glue so that motivates me to ask and so far I'm happy. My last hour tabs intact. is a wonderful glue."
1,"I am totally devoted to this product! A 32oz pump bottle of Neutrogena Light Sesame Body Oil sits on the ledge of my bath tub right next to my other very favorite bath/shower product.....Vitabath Moisturizing Bath & Shower Gelee, Original Spring Green. When used together, my skin stays soft and smooth even during the coldest winters.I first learned of Neutrogena Light Sesame Body Oil from an article in a magazine about the personal favorite products of beauty profesionals. The oil was mentioned several times as a tried and true after-bath or shower moisturizer for even the driest or most problematic skins.The oil is meant to be applied to the body immediately after bathing or showering but before toweling dry. The oil is quickly absorbed into the skin, almost nothing is left on the towel used to dry yourself. Once dry, your skin is silky smooth but not oily. The fragrance is delicate and clean and not cloying.I then apply a good moisturizer like(Olay Quench Body Lotion Extra Dry Skin - 20.2 Oz)to my hands, feet, elbows and any other area that I think could use a little more softening and smoothing.The oil and the moisturizer combine to form a moisture barrier on the skin that lasts and lasts. It's surprising to see how quickly the oil works! And how much more effective it is to use the after-bath oil than just an moisturizer by itself.This product is a good investment in your skin's health and appearance!"
1,It's really hars to find good lash glue for some reason. This is great for lighter strip lashes but if your lookinnfor dramtic lashes or long wear glue look elsewhere.
1,"Very strong smelling soap.  It smells good to me, but it is very strong.  It is a bit sweeter than I would expect rhubarb to smell.Like that it does not have chemicals.  Gets my hands nice and clean."
1,After reading all the reviews on this face powder I was a bit let down.  I have been using it for about a week now and it does not to seem to control the shine any better than all the other face powders I have tried.  I put my makeup on around 7:30 and around 9 am the shine is already coming through on my T-zone.  If I apply it every hour I suppose it would keep the shine down but the whole purpose was something I did not have to keep applying.  Also I got Golden and it is a bit light.  It is a nice feeling powder and I do like the case and the puff unfortunately it does not control the shine like I hoped.
1,It is so gentle and wonderful to the skin. Makes you skin so soft.  I have sensitive skin and don't break out from this!
1,"I received this product in a few days it was packaged well. I am transitioning to natural and was in need of a leave-in detangler. This product was ok as a leave-in, after i washed my hair and deep conditioned  i sprayed a generous amount on my hair and on the ends. I then tried to clear out my 4A african american hair. The product did not give much slip, however once i sprayed my hair a few more times I was then  able to detangle.  I used this product for four weeks, I usually wash my hair every Sunday.  I like this leave-in it was not bad i like the vitamins in the product but there was just not enough slip to detangle real easy then roller set,,, I would recommend this to a person with curly hair and not so much as a detangler.."
1,My favorite powder EVER! SPF 15 is hard to find too!
1,FusionBeauty LipFusion Micro-injected Collagen Lip Plump Gloss should be an essential part of your beauty routine... Why? Because it actually works!
1,This bottle will last a long time. It has a pleasant scent and I typically reserve it for putting on in the evening since it does not contain sunscreen. I love to put it on before I go to bed as I really think it helps me get to sleep and I tend to think of it as a luxury product.
1,"I love this.  My dermatologist has always told me to use cetaphil because I have acne.  I was actually using the cetaphil facial moisturizer for a while until I tried this.  I like it a lot better because it moisturizes my face a lot better than the other.I use it on my face and neck every time I wash my face (morning and night).  It doesn't feel too thick, but it helps moisturize.  It Doesn't feel greasy, oily, or sticky either.  Another plus is that it lasts forever if you use it for mainly your face.  I'm guilty for using in on the dry patches on my arms though!"
1,"Ladies or Gentlemen:  I have been reading some of your reviews and I had wanted to get into doing nails (just for myself).  Since retirement, I figured I have time to go and get my nails done.  But after going and spending $35.00 plus tip, I said this is too much to spend a month.  Well, I then tried OPI Nail Lacquer and have been hooked ever since.  Lacquer is thicker and longer lasting than just plain nail polish.  I was wearing gloves to wash dishes and after 3 days, nail polish had chips, bubbles and smudges.  So I started looking for nail supply stores that lets the public shop also.  The owner told me to use OPI Bonded Aid, then OPI Base Coat, Opi Nail Lacquer (two coats) and then use Seche Vite as top coat dryer and nail shine.  My nails now last 2 weeks if I use gloves and 10 days without.Just be careful with these products that you use them in a ventilated area, they do have side effects (dizzy, hallucinations in your dreams).  So I make sure a fan is blowing from behind me, so I am not breathing chemicals.So there you go! You now have no excuse to say I don't have time.  You can do it on a Sunday night watching Desperate Housewives or any other series you might be hooked on.  I have even tried some of the ""High End Nail Lacquers"" which are ""London Butter"" and ""Tom Ford Lacquers"" .  Check around for who has these products at a lower price, but they are worth the money.  You can even have a manicure party and charge $10.00 to get some of your money back (LOL)."
1,"I usually try and stay with gentle face washes, this seems to work just fine though. Even the GF likes it."
1,"If you have severe seborrheic dermatitis or scalp psoriasis than this product is not nearly strong enough to satisfy and calm the scalp (get the extra- strength), but if you just have some dandruff problems or less severe scalp dermatitis or psoriasis this should work very well."
1,"This is the first BB cream bottle i have bought and I like it. When I picked it up at the store, I tried on this Aveeno one on one side of my face and the Revlon Photoready BB cream on my other cheek. I believe the Revlon offered a bit more coverage but it also looked and felt a bit more heavy on my face (and heavy makeup isn't really too practical for me). I would recommend the Aveeno BB cream if you are not looking for too much coverage, a more natural look with some good SPF 30. It looks good on my face all day and so far I've kept it on for up to 12 hours straight.Like someone had mentioned before, yes, I did notice my fingers were covered with tiny specks of glitter after applying this bb cream but its barely noticeable on your face so that was nice to see and i noticed it really did help even out my skin."
1,"This type of iron is hard to find in stores. Glad I found it at Amazon.I have no big gripes about this iron, except that it needs improvement on thewarm up time (takes about 10 minutes to get hot). My hair is fairly short and fine,and the 1-1/2"" barrel gives it enough body, without curls."
1,"You see so many products that claim to be the 1 that makes your skin flawless, but nothing compares to Olay.I have been using this exact product for almost 3 years and my skin glows, My skin is healthy and no wrinkles at the age of 40.I know good jeans have a lot to do with it and my family does have good jeans but most my family had some wrinkles by time they hit 40 & I have nothing and I know it Is from the use of Olay 2x's a day (morning & night). I highly recommend this product to everyone. I get compliments all the time on my skin glowing and also everyone thinks I am in my mid 20's. IT WORKS!!!!"
1,"Price:-Around $45 on Amazon and other retailers/online vendors - I have yet to see this product on sale anywhere-Can get cheaper if you get it in a package skin care set with other Philosophy productsHow to use:-Apply at night-Use a small amount-Start off using this product only a few times a week - gradually increasing usage if you see no bad side effects-Make sure you use with a lotion as it's very drying on the skinHow it works:-This product is basically a 'gentle' chemical peel that sloughs off the outermost layer of your skinResults:-You can definitely see an improvement in your overall skin tone with this product - it makes sense that your skin looks better because it chemically removes the outer layer which of course a newer, fresher layer of skin will be less pigmented than old skin and look more ""vibrant""Warnings:-USE SPARINGLY at first - even if you don't see any negative side effects the first night you use it and your face doesn't feel dry, STILL start out using this slowly.  I made the mistake of applying every night when I first purchased this product because I wasn't having any dry skin problems or irritation - well after about a week my skin all of the sudden was VERY dry and VERY PEELY.  No matter how much lotion I applied my skin was just peeling off like crazy, as if I had a gotten a terrible sunburn.  This makes make-up application very difficult and uneven, plus it can be a little embarrassing-I would not recommend using this product in combination with self-tanners, especially when you first start using HelpMe.  Due to the effect of peeling skin, even when you use in combination with a lotion this can create very uneven skin texture as some of the 'tanned' skin will peel off before other partsRecommend to a friend?-For sure!  Just be careful, gradually increase application and don't use in combination with self tanner"
1,"Great for a quick cover up. I have dark brown hair and this product covers up most of my greys and lasts thru out my work out, until I shower."
1,"I bought this creme blindly at the Grocery store for about $11 so I wish I would have waited until I looked it up on Amazon because its cheaper here. I was impressed with the reviews though.I have pretty bad skin. I'm prone to black heads on my nose, have large pores and am constantly broken out on my chin. For these reasons I usually stay away from ""creme"" lotions as they are usually too thick and oily. This stuff is thick and oily BUT after applying it just seems to disappear into my skin. I can't figure it out but the results so far have been promising. My skin is often dry and I've always wanted a nice moisturizer and have tried many but most make me breakout. After four days and no problems so far I'm excited about this product. My face even seems less oily at the end of the day and some ance scabs have seemed to heal much quicker than usual.Yes, the stuff doesn't smell great but honestly it isn't the worst thing I've ever smelled and it wears off quickly. I'd rather have a face that looks good than smells great.4oz should last a long time if only applied to the face. I'm expecting to use this once or twice daily and I think it will last at least 2 months.If you have acne and are interested in more natural products which aren't too drying I also use:Desert Essence's Thoroughly Clean face wash which also has tea tree oil.Desert Essence - Thoroughly Clean Face Wash, 32 fl oz liquidOnce per week I use a betonite powder clay mixed with apple cider vinegar to use as a mask.Aztec Secret - Bentonite Clay - Indian Healing Clay 2#and I often use witch hazel astringent pads.Witch Hazel Pads - 60 - PadAll of which can be found on Amazon much cheaper than in stores."
1,"Great shipping, and the product speaks for itslef after each and every use. Its the cheapest bar of emu soap they have and it does wonders to my skin, moisture, gets rid of any bumps, or rashes, my skin always get complimented on how silky if feels and how wonderful it looks and thats the only product i use on my body. Face, different story!"
1,I purchased this drying lotion since it was cheaper than another product at Nordstroms - it does help with those huge pimples that seem to pop up right when you have an important event to attend. Hopefully your significant other doesn't mind seeing you with pink dots on your face at bedtime.
1,"I was VERY skeptical at first, I was completely convinced that the product itself was simply drying and turning into those little crumbs as you rub it on your face and that it wasn't actually exfoliating anything.  I tested a few times and confirmed that after you rubbed all the crumbs off of one area of skin, you couldn't make the product ""crumb up"" again on that spot, but I wasn't totally sure it was because it had taken all the dead skin off or if it was some other aspect.Anyway - I've since become enlightened to the dry skin crumbing/rolling truth - because of buying the Baiden Mitten, which (without any other product added except water) rubs all the dry skin off your entire body in the same way.  Since the Baiden Mitten works on my face (just have to rub more gently) I will not be continuing to use this InstantPeel product, but if I didn't already have the Baiden Mitten now, the InstantPeel is a good product and it definitely DOES do what it claims, that really is your dead dry skin layer that is crumbing up and rolling off when you use it.  And getting it off really does make your skin so much better, a baby smooth layer is revealed underneath that has no more flaking, dull dry scaley etc. - I'm now an exfoliation believer."
1,I always have good result with Aveeno products.  This fragrance free body wash is great for my skin.  I feel that it keeps me moist and soft and prevent from drying out too fast.  The price is good as always on Amazon.com
0,"It smells bad, doesn't work, smells like the worst cheap perfume ever, and I just can't get over the smell. IT made me wanna puke."
1,Wanted a curling iron with all the features offered by this one.  Am very pleased with it and would buy another.
0,I have only used it twice in the past year. When I used it it did nothing for my hair and also there was black stuff coming out in my hair.  I think it was melted plastic...
1,I have not tried the product yet but i hope it as good as saying if so i will keep ordering more you i love when product work
1,"I have not owned a blow dryer since 197?. However, after seeing so many products for curly blow dried hair  in Ulta, Target etc I thought maybe I should reconsider the blow dryer. I went on youtube to see what the latest info was on blow dryers. After watching lots of vids on youtube and reading amazon reviews I bought this from my local drug store. I thought if it didn't work for me I could keep it on hand for folks with straight hair when they stayed over at my house. I tried it and love the result.  I have coarse curly hair and it took less than 20 min to dry. The button placement was a bit odd, but it is an easy thing to learn. Additionally, it is not very noisy and my bathroom doesn't smell like burnt hair. I could nit pick and give this product 3 or 4 stars but I think with operator practice and a phenomenal price point it warrants 5 stars."
1,This is another Christmas gift for friends in Thailand.  I cant believe how expensive this is there. So great gift.
1,love this stuff smells wonderful I have it in every thing they make. Toilet bowl cleaner household dish liquid and hand soap
1,"I was looking for an organic face cream that also had spf 15.  When I saw this, I bought it even though I figured it would make me break out, because most face lotions do.  I decided to give it a chance anyway.  The cream is a little heavier than most, and my skin is oily, so this was also a red flag for me.  But I was wrong!  The cream absorbs quickly and is moisturizing, yet does not make me break out.  In fact, I believe that it has helped clear my skin.  This is an excellent cream, and not something to pass up.This particular seller is Mother Nature, shipping is free after $25, so I enjoy buying from this seller.  Other products that I use with this lotion is:  Dessert Essence face wash, Nelson's acne gel and Home Health Acne lotion (it's more like a toner).  You can get them all from Mother Nature."
1,"It's the best brush I've ever had. It glides through my hair so well that it doesn't snap my hair, and I can brush my hair so much quicker. It's a sturdy brush too, it hasn't fallen apart and I have really thick tangle prone hair. It really is the best."
1,"Neutrogena Body Clear body wash cleared up my back acne in just a few weeks.For years I've been fighting the occasional breakout on my back.  The incidents were never particularly bad, but every once in a while I would get small clusters of about 5-10 small pimples on my back.  In the winter my skin would be dry and they would occur on my shoulders, and in summer they would occur on the sides of my back when I sweat a little.  I've been using Persa-Gel 10 on them, and while it helped a little it would take a long time for them to clear up completely.So on a whim I decided to try this body wash and I'm glad I did.  The Neutrogena Body Clear got rid of all of my back acne within about three weeks time.  My back looks great, and I don't see any new pimples forming.  The thing that surprised me most about this body wash is that it does not dry out my sensitive skin at all.  In fact, when rinsing it off in the shower, I feel like my skin gets softer.  The body wash has a very slight fragrance, which to me smells like baby shampoo.  The bottle is smaller than regular body wash, but a little bit goes a long way, and lathers up very nicely.  I apply it with a plastic mesh sponge poof.All in all... I'm very happy I gave it a try; it was just what I needed for my mild back acne."
0,"I have combination skin and have been using this daily for the past 2 weeks. However, there hasn't been any noticeable difference on my skin. I still break out, and my dark spots don't seem to be going anywhere soon. It moisturizes okay (nothing special), but in terms of treating pimples, this dual-action product leaves its promise unfulfilled."
1,"This was my first NARS lipgloss, and definitely my most expensive lipgloss I have purchased to date! This is one of those products that I have heard people rave about over the last few years, and just had to try it for myself! Overall I really like the consistency of this gloss. It is extremely smooth and creamy. It definitely feels like a higher end lipgloss. I don't notice a smell when I use it all (I know a few people who claim these stink horribly.) The color is the only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars. It is a very light, kind of milky pink color. It just looks different then I had imagined it to look, even though I had viewed swatches of it and seen people wear it in blogs and stuff. I am still experimenting with which lipsticks/lipliners it looks best with to find something I might love it with. Overall, I love the consistency, even though I am not crazy about the color, and will definitely purchase another NARS lipgloss in the future!"
1,This really helped add moisture to my skin. it is light a weightless. A little but goes a long way and I usually only have to apply it once a day to keep my skin smooth and supple.
1,"This works! SPF 30 protects my face well. I like to go riding this is used on my face and neck. No irritation on my skin. My skin gets fairly oily throughout the day but this will last throughout the day unless wiped/washed off. I have tried zinc type face sun protection on my face, I believe this works as good considering the price. BTW, Amazon has the best price!"
0,I did not notice the tightening feeling that other users described.  I use this in conjunction with my Olay recommended regimen.  I did not have any noticeable reduction in fine lines.  My pores were not refined.It gets one star for keeping my face more moisturized than not using it.It gets another star for not making my face break out like the daily moisturizer my regimen wanted me to use four times a day.
1,"I bought this for my husband to use when we travel.  It holds all his grooming essentials with some room left over.  Though not the highest quality, it is made well enough to serve the purpose and meet his needs."
1,"All 3  arrived in great condition, and I use quite a lot of this product in the Summer time. I have tried so many other costly sunscreen products, and found them all to be rather sticky.  I am handicapped and like to sit outside in good weather. I used to freckle up so much, even though many sunscreens say up to 30 minutes.  But with this light formula I don't have to use very much, and I don't look like our Dalmatian.  This is sort of funny, but when I used other sunscreen products my sweet dog didn't like the smell and she wouldn't sit real close to me out  side.  Animals are very sensitive to smells.  It is a very nice product, and I'm sure that other customers will enjoy it also as the moisturizer keeps the skin so nice and soft."
1,"I wasn't aware that bare minerals made two different types of brushes until I was in an ULTA store a few months ago. I commented on the associates full coverage of her face and I told her I wasn't getting that with my make up. She asked what type of brush I was using and I told her the one with the small handle. She said that was a sheer coverage brush. So, I came home and bought this off amazon. It was cheaper then in the store by far! Amazon usually always has the best prices ;) Anyhow, it came the very next day. Super fast shipping and it works great. I now have the full coverage I have desired all of these years. It's a very full bristled brush and it works great. Nice and soft too."
1,Didn't think the Frownies would really work but I was wrong.  Love them and would reccomend them to anyone.  If you have a wrinkle between your eyes try the Frownies.  It works!!
0,"I purchased this product because it was suggested to me. Unfortunately, I saw absolutely no difference in the condition of my relaxed hair after using it. I actually gave it away after two uses to my friend. I'm not sure if she finished the bottle but I know that she wasn't compelled to buy another. If you can try it for free, go for it. I just found that it wasn't worth the money I spent on it."
1,"This stuff is amazing, you can eat it put on your body ( for cuts bruises etc or body lotion) , hair(shampoo), face ( like an astringent) lubricant ( use your imagination)."
1,This color eyeshadow looks great when it is applied wet. Nice color and I like the fact that there are no irritants like talc.
1,My mom always used this mascara as a base because it helps separate your lashes. It's never clumpy and lasts a long time. You can tell it's good since it's been around for awhile.
0,"Well this blush is 1% minerals and 99% glitter I dont likeat all the color is minimum but your entire face is completelyshine , waste of money never buy again"
0,I have medium volume straight long hair so I though the 3/4 inch will work better.  How wrong I was.  The spikes on this brush are so short that they can barely grasp my hair.  Very hard to use and does not curl hair effectively.  I get better curls with a flat hot iron then this product.  Not recommended.
1,"The first time I saw this, I was like what?  Udder cream?  Really?But, all kidding aside, this is a very good lotion and I have bought it and used it for years and also given it as a gift.  Its actually pretty funny to give to someone who has never heard of it and then watch their double-take when they see the name.I prefer this size so that I can take it with me on trips and keep some in my purse.It doesn't go on as thick as some lotions, but works into your skin really well and keeps it moisturized.  Really great for the winter or if you work with paper or someplace where you have to wash your hands a lot."
1,"Why I have bought this curling iron twice now.  I broke my first the other day trying to cool it off fast with water.  This curling iron is awesome because it has a long shaft so you can fit a good amount of hair in it if you want, it's got a big enough tip so that your fingers don't get burned, the heat setting can be as hot as hot can be for a quick curl, IT's PURPLE, it will turn off automaticly if left on by accident, but not so soon that you find yourself with a cold rod, it comes with a heat resistant cover so that if you must leave it cool, you can cover it so it won't burn anything, lastly my hair NEVER gets caught in the handle like it will with some others  The ONLY complaint, which isn't that big of a deal, I wish the cord was a little bit longer. =) This is a great buy!!!"
1,"This was exactly what I wanted, at an unbeatable price.I was looking for a sinus solution (Neti Pots work great, but sometimes I want something more soothing). I looked at all the different facial saunas/steamers, and the Conair was the best value (at $22/free shipping), with the two attachments, and some extras.This works great for me - just put in a couple ounces of water, wait about 60 seconds, and it pumps out steam.I've used the facial attachment, and also the sinus attachment - and have had nice, soft pores this winter!Just inhale deeply for about 3-5 minutes, then blow your nose gently, and all those irritants and particles will come out. Repeat if you still feel some ""junk"" up in your sinus passages. It even works when you're stopped up - the steam will definitely work its way through your sinus passages and loosen any mucus. For me, the sinus pressure almost always goes away within a few minutes.One more note - I'm not necessarily loyal to the Conair brand. This just seemed like the best value, and it's worked well. It seems to be a durable machine, and has performed flawlessly. But whatever you do, please consider using steam, neti pot, saline sprays, or something other than chemicals and prescription drugs to deal with sinus pressure. Be kind to your body! One family member developed permanent health problems from over-reliance on things like prescription drugs & Tylenol Sinus, when natural options like this are faster, safer, and cheaper.As I said, the Conair also works great as a facial spa/sauna, though my family uses it primarily to clean sinuses. Hope this helps in your purchasing decision!"
0,I thought this product would work for my 2 1/2 year old son. My son keeps sucking his tumb and I have tried everything. This was my last thing I have not tried. I have tried several nail polish stoppers and just like the rest this did not work. Save your money and just use baby orgel.
1,"I love Elizabeth Arden deodorants. I've bought 3 scents now: Blue Grass, Green Tea, and Eau Fraiche. Love them all! They glide on very smoothly, do not irritate my skin, and they really work!"
1,"When I saw this product I liked it so, I read the instructions about type of skin and so on. For some reason, if I don't rub on, immediately a skin cream, this product stretches the skin and forms wrinkles on my face, I can feel the sensation of the skin been pulled, but in the area closed to the nose (more sensitive) looks as if the out skin has been peeled. It cleans very well, thou, after I've washed the face with the cleanser cream.  Sometimes, I wander around after cleaning with the refreshing cleansing gel when I notice the pulling of the skin -very weird! Perhaps it is not appropriate for my type of skin, even though, usually my skin doesn't care about types of creams."
1,I used  Burt's Bees Lemon and Vitamin E bath and Body Oil after shower as moisturizer. I like the light zesty scent when putting it on and like it even more when it disappear so it doesn't linger for too long! I also put it in my aromatherapy bath with some lavender oil.  It beats rubbing lotion on dry skin and added benefits of all things natural on my body. I recommend it!
1,"This is a keeper. Goes on like silk . Feels awesome(no I dont drive for nascar) color has gorgeous pigment, blends beautifully. Wish I could buy every color. Ladies you cant go wrong with this one. A suggestion, dont push stick up too high not neccessary, and will only increase chance of breakage. Treat it good and it will last forever. Trust me girls, I know makeup and I want you all to look your beautiful best."
1,"I am 31 years old with normal skin but this is the BEST moisturizer for me.  It says for mature skin, which I would usually assume to mean 40's or older, but I've been using it since I was 26 with awesome results.  I constantly get compliments on my complexion, and the one time I ran out of this day creme I saw my skin begin to dull and dry within just a week or so.  Gotta have it...I stockpile this stuff!"
1,This is a great product but it is not what I would call a hand &#34;cream.&#34;  The formula is a yellowish almost clear oil/petroleum-like based formula.  It does absorb into the skin but not completely.I would not use this during the day to avoid leaving greasy prints on things.  This is a great product to use at night because it does absorb somewhat into hands and the residue creates a &#34;mask&#34; soaking completely into the skin after a few hours.  It leaves hands very soft and well moisturized; perfect for night treatments.If you have severely chapped dry hands this is a great product because it will not cause a burning sensation that most hand lotions will.  The formula is extremely gentle and would work on most cases of dry cracked skin.
1,"We call this the &#34;minty&#34; lotion in my house. You can smell the tea tree upon applying, but the scent does dissipate. It has a slightly cooling effect, which is nice for hot days."
1,"I love this power!!! I am 32, have had adult acne on and off for about 12 years now ad have tried a LOT of skincare and makeup brands for it. I came across this product because the divine and ever talented Lisa Eldridge used it on one of her videos ( [...] ). I live in Costa Rica so the weather is often hot and humid, and products can look well for a little while but start melting and moving around as the day goes by. Not this one! This is a very good and almost invisible setting powder, I really like the fat that it is colorless, so as log as you have a good match on your foundation tone, you needn't worry the the powder will change the color. I could go on and on the size is great for the price, specially compared to Tarte amazonian clay that doesn't perform as well and is half the size for almost the same amount. Very recommended."
1,"gorgeous colour, fast-drying, and long lasting. i get acrylic nails and this polish is incredible. i love essie so much, even better than the bigger brands like opi or china glaze. if i ever need new polish, essie is my go-to brand."
1,"I always have a difficult time finding the right color (either white-out or orange). This is wonderful on my pinky-fair skin tone. It provides enough coverage to sort out the nightmare under my eyes (circles so bad that I look like a victim of domestic violence),yet blends well. I have issues with hormonal skin... oily AND dry patches, so I always set this with mineral powder (faerie organics)to keep it from landing in the wrinkles around my eyes."
1,"I am 24 years old and was using this at night and lightly in the morning. I don't have any wrinkles or fine lines and was just using this for prevention. I loved the consistency and the fact that it has no smell. It helped to clear up some dry patches I had in the winter around my eyes and didn't break me out on the parts of my face near my eye area where this product touched. However, I had to discontinue use because I noticed that my vision was becoming blurred. I could still see, but I felt like I had a film over my eye that I couldn't get to clear. Once discontinuing, the problem went away. It is unfortunate because I really did like using this."
0,Caused break-outs after first use. Applies very thick and sticky. Will not be purchasing again. Makes a good body moisturizer though.
0,At first the product worked great. Then over time the water started turning cloudy and had a funny smell. Would not repurchase and would definitely not recommend.
0,"They have changed the packaging..... and the formula.  I used to love this stuff.  If ordering this product, you will receive the new product in it's new packaging. Amazon needs to update the photo. This new formula includes a wide spectrum sunscreen. That sounds really good, but this new formula is so oily. I mean it's just downright greasy on the face. I wouldn't even recommend for someone with dry skin. Dry skin needs moisture not grease.Further, it doesn't cover imperfections and dark circles as well as the old formula. I used to use this one product as a foundation and under eye concealer. It did a great job.  If wanting to cover darkness from scars and really dark circles, this formula won't do it. It will lighten, but not cover. It also transfers very easily. What a waste of my 31 bucks.  A disappointment too, because now I have to find a new foundation...and concealer."
1,"Sick of wasting money on hoity-toity lines that only managed to make my oily skin oiler or worse yet scaly (!) I decided to find a cheaper, more effective option.  I've been using my bottle of &quot;Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser&quot; for months now and though the big clunky bottle isn't pretty, I can easily stuff it in my closet away from all but the most nosiest guests.  My nose has been spoiled by the fruity stuff I've tried in the past and this cleanser is a bit stinky, a little chemically, but this stuff does the job!  It's a clear, liquid soap-like formulation that doesn't foam or even bubble up all that much but it does a great job of removing makeup excepting, of course, that pesky waterproof stuff that requires days of scrubbing to remove all remnants.  My skin doesn't feel tight after washing only exceptionally clean.  My oiliness is about the same as it's always been but it takes more than a cleanser to cure that particular problem.  I will buy this as long as the company continues to make it but I'll probably buy a nice decanter to dump it into ;)"
0,"It was too thick and did not spread well. The &#34;touch of foundation&#34; was more heavily colored than some of the regular foundations I have used in the past AND it just seemed to sit on top of the skin. As a result, the color would rub off in spot and look blotchy. Also, it started making my skin peel after a few uses in a row. In other words, it was terrible.  I did give it a second star, though. The reason is that it did seem to make my skin look and feel a little nicer after you would wash it off. I am only 30 years old, but I noticed a slight discoloration around my eyes from years of the sun starting to show through. I also have a bit more discoloration from previous acne as well. Overall, I would say my skin is average. Not too bad, but not exceptional.If you want an AMAZING cream (although no foundation), see my review of the L'Oreal Ideal Moisture Even Tone cream. I really love it. http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P4OWBH1VSBUF/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B00AYWN8OY"
0,"I bought some sort of protein treatment from this company years ago and it made my hair hard. But it's been like 20 years! So I thought I'd give this product a try as I'm always looking for leave-in keratin based treatments for my hair. This was not it.I sprayed it in my damp hair, styled as usual (braid-out), and my hair was crunchy for the rest of the week. Can't imagine how it acts when you heat style your hair. I definitely do not recommend."
1,It does not dry my hair very well at all. It is more useful to put it up when I am not ready to dry it yet. On that point it is very secure.
0,"it took too long to dry, waste of money, i want something that isnt as watery as this one. #ew"
1,"I love the smell and the texture of it. This conditioner really make my hair soft, I use this as my daily conditioner. Once a while when I need extra nourishment, I would pack on hair mask on my hair in stead of this conditioner. I would recommended this All Soft Conditioner to those who has normal to dry hair."
1,"This solid shampoo smells just like Lush's Karma fragrance- orange and patchouli.  I find the patchouli to be a bit heavier in the shampoo than in some other Lush products.  The bar makes a nice lather and lasts a really long time.  The bar is also bright green, which is nice.The downsides are: first, that this is a love or hate fragrance.  I happen to like it, but it's not to everyone's taste.  Second, this is a strongly scented shampoo, and it's hard to find a complementary conditioner."
1,"If you have a dremmel type tool to grind off about half the points that stick into the sides of your head, then indeed these can become &#34;No Headache&#34; headbands.  But if you can't alter them then rate them a 1 or 2 star product unless you have a much smaller head than do I."
1,better than the high priced serums...I can feel it working. Rated #1 on consumer reports
1,"Nicely fragranced, good large size for a soap bar, and it is real soap.It is REAL SOAP, which some people find drying to their skin.Still gets you clean and leaves a light scent."
1,"The brown is rather light. Maybe good for blondes, and in the day time.For the night time, it does not show much.I do not know about being waterproof... It seems to come off very easily, or maybe I have oily eye lids..."
1,This is the best at removing Mascara/coverup makeup. Not oily at all and does'nt irritate the eyes. That's important because I wear contacts!
1,"I'm 57, grew up on the beach and spent most of my life outdoors so have been fighting sun damage for several years. I've tried a lot of different anti-aging products, but nothing works as well for me as this 30% glycolic acid - the highest strength glycolic acid product I've found.  I also use Retin-A every other day, and TCA or lactic acid chemical peels at home, so my skin is pretty tough.  Just ordered my 5th bottle of this facial cream III, highly recommend it."
1,"....what you now use is bar soap. Both clean, this just cleans better. The scrubbing ingredients are particularly useful if your life style creates dirt or oil on your skin. The strength of agents to remove that in a regular bar of soap would damage the skin whereas the scrubbing elements present here do the same thing without causing harm to the skin. Just as easy to use in the shower as with a sink, it applies easily and rinses off just as easily. (I think it's better used in a shower but that's personal preference.) One thing to remember is that there is a certain amount of grit in this that can get in your eyes. It's easily washed out but if you're not expecting it, there may be another surprize. Also when using this, I'd take out any lenses so that the cleansing agents can't get under them.  (Another reason I prefer it in the shower, eyes can easily and quickly be cleaned.) Unlike some products whose efficacy is seen over time, this works the first time. Black heads are gone, skin smooths, pores open and all that in under a very few minutes. This isn't a mask to be left on, it's a replacement for soap. I use my hand to apply it and my finger tips to really get into the depressions around my nose and those cavities that develop as we age. And, by the way, using this adds flexibility that relaxes the furrows of age.This is a product specific made for men and addresses issues germane to men. What more can I say? Buy it. Try it. You won't be disappointed."
1,It's good quality and feels soft on your skin but I'm sad that my face doesn't feel anymore clean than it does without it. I was hoping for a deep clean feeling.
1,"This has a good aroma, with a slightly gritty texture. To me, it's more of a vanilla amber than just an uncut amber. A piece of the inside rim had cracked off, but Amazon customer service resolved the issue in minutes. I don't know whether or not it cracked in transit, though, since it was on the inside. Once I cleaned out the little splinters and bits, I put some on my wrist to test it out. There's also a little smokiness to it, which I like. BUT, boy is it rich. After having it on for about 20 minutes I wish I had only applied it to my wrists instead of my wrists and the inside of my elbows. Considering it's so potent, this small container will last a long time. The container itself is just beautiful, too."
1,"I wanted to love this product- I really did- because I love this company- and it got such great reviews- but DMAE is just not for me I guess. I did not see the instant firming some people speak of, and it caused a slight breakout. I'll stick to my glycolic acid regime."
1,Great color with the quality you expect from OPI. I was in search for a light green color. It's lovely.
1,"I was looking for an SLS free organic soap bar and came across this one! There is no scent to it, but it suds up very well and leaves your skin squeaky clean. I think this bar would be great for young children with sensitive skin. I bought a scented bar later, but I think this is still a good buy."
1,This soap is great for bathing and as a facial soap! The smell is of almond scent and it is just heavenly ! Delivery was prompt !! Love this soap!
1,"A little pricey, but you really don't need that much to cover your entire face. Really does fade fine lines (at least it did on me). The beginnings of crow's feet around my eyes faded completely away."
1,"I just started using this stuff and its pretty basic mascara without any bells & whistles which is nice and refreshing, gets the job done."
1,Noticed a difference in my skin the very next day. A lil drying so will only use every other day but super effective!
1,"I've gotten about halfway through my bottle, so I figure now's as good a time as any to leave a review.I never used a toner before, but apparently there's a bit of debate as to whether or not they're even worth it.  The basic premise is that they can help clean out those last lingering bits of dirt and oil after cleansing your face (some people going so far as to argue that it ""restores the pH balance of your skin"" but I'm not so sure on that).After each cleansing, I dampen a cotton ball with this and pat/rub it on my face and neck.  Sometimes it's a little tingly, but usually it's very refreshing!  I'm a big fan of witch hazel, so I really like that this product is witch hazel based instead of alcohol.I don't have any miraculous claims about this product working wonders on my skin, but I don't really have any huge skin issues to begin with.  I don't feel quite so oily, and I admit I like the cleansing feeling.However, I did have a nasty batch of ingrown hairs on my legs--the really awful sort with red, painful bumps and whatnot.  On a whim I put a bit of this toner on, and while they weren't GONE, they were drastically reduced the next morning."
1,"I love this cleanser. My dermatologist recommended it because it is safe even for sensitive or problem skin. After it arrived and I read the directions, I realized that it can be used even without water...just tissue it off. It is so gentle in fact that the directions recommend that when using water, you do not rinse completely, but instead leave some of it, which then acts as a moisturizer."
0,Didn't realize it would be so strong. Tried it once but didn't keep the box so I am stuck with it. Wouldn't recommend to any one.
1,I love love love this gel. I had ordered and then my austrailan lab accidentely wrapped it's leash round me while at play & took three months to heal. However I used the gel and it was healing without a scar. Then went off on vacation and forgot it. When I left a scar appeared in the portion I didn't treat with this gel. I was amazed. I am home again and apply it daily and will be using on my body now to see if it helps skin. I love this and am  starting to read reviews to make sure I use in every way possible. I did mix very high grade lavender in the gel for my wound.  I will be ordering this forever and for my kids ay college etc.as they will eventually need this. I am from a family that grows aloe so was surprised aloe in a jar worked so well. Don't sit on the fence with this. It's a miracle gel. Has a nice application and isn't sticky. Really great find for me.
1,"I love this perfume. It smells wonderful. It is a very sweet scent, but kind of suttle at the same time."
0,"I had high hopes for this product since I am looking for a safer alternative to traditional deodorant, however it did not mask the odor even a little bit. I am glad to hear it works for some, but not for me."
1,"I am so glad I tried this conditioner and the shampoo. It leaves your hair soft, supple, shiny with lots of body.The shampoo does not strip the hair at all yet it's clean and bouncy with no frizzies. Really good. Wish I would've known about it years ago. Since it doesn't strip the hair, because it has moisturizing benefits, you don't have  brittleness or breakage. Perfect for long hair and to keep long, lustrous and full bodied. This will make your hair prettier and fuller then it's ever been before, really truly happy."
1,"I've tried so many different mascaras, but always come back to this one. I love the narrow brush, which deposits lots of mascara. Plus, since I like to get the mascara right down to the very roots of my eyelashes, the narrow brush doesn't smudge it all over my eyelids in the process."
1,"They work!  These things stick to your face and tell your facial muscles to relax.  I use them at night, taking them off in the morning, and the effect lasts all day. The major line between my eyebrows is hardly noticeable any more!"
1,"I tend to agonize over purchases, reading and re-reading every review written. All will be well and I will almost be convinced....and then comes along the one person with a complaint, and that does it, this one sounded to good to be true, and you know what they say, but I took the plunge and ordered. I was VERY pleasantly suprised!!!It is all it says and more. I am passed middle aged and finding make up that looks natural and helps any flaws (why else do we wear it?)has been increasingly hard to find. Not so with this mascara, here is what it does. Makes lashes that have been curled with a eyelash curler, stayed curled, all day, keeps lashes soft feeling and looking natural, no clumps in sight, and no dull chalky color. it is wonderful. For every day wear, one coat is fine, for going out at night, I will use three to four coats and at the risk of repeating myself, NO clumps in sight, no brittleness, and no spider looking lashes.If there would be one drawback the brush is a little short and fat for my taste, but it's worth it, and makes my lashes look wonderful! Don't hesitate a moment longer order this product!!! OH and did I mention it's waterproof WOW!!!!"
1,"I purchased the lash growth accelerator not the treatment gel (theres treatment gel and standard) well, they sent me the treatment gel which is this but my package was black. Anyway, I kept it and Ive been using a week 1/2 and I can say it produces positive results. I brush it on my eyebrows and eyelashes and night. On my eyelashes i stroke it on like mascara wiggle it around eyelid then I apply it over top of lashes like a coating of paint.I try to get the gel on my eyelid where hair grows. I can honestly say I have growth forming on area where there was a gap. I think i see longer as well. I apply it on eyebrows but see no growth but they look better. Gaps seem fuller. What I did was bought 1 off ebay verses buying a 3 pack to see if worked. Now I wonder if the original works as good as treatment gel. I cant compare to latisse and dont plan on ever trying it, to expensive but this is something I'd buy again and recommend for sure!FINAL REVIEW 2013 -  This product is effective but if you use it wrong its like taking 1 step forward and 5 steps back. I used this nightly applying to all eyelashes and getting close to base. It did grow a hair where there was a gap but also I notice losing other lashes in other places. My advice is buy it but only apply to gap areas DO NOT APPLY WHERE LASHES EXIST. Hope ive helped."
1,"I received the product about 5 days before the expected arrival date. I love the polish. This was my first time using Essie and now I am completely obsessed. The polish lasted throughout the entire week. The price is amazing , anywhere else an Essie polish runs from 7-9 dollars so to get it delivered to my home for less than it is just great. I'd definitely recommend this product and this seller ! :)"
1,"If you want to be noticed, wear this nail polish!  It's such a beautiful deep red."
1,"This is the best hand grease I've found so far. Here what I've tried, btw:- Vitamin E oil from drugstore: OK; too greasy; also it somehow reacts with anything ferrous you happen to handle to produce a rancid smell of some uncategoriseable sort (both on your hands and on the object handled; very unpleasant). Can be used (with caution) but not the first choice (nor the second). A lot of E in it (30,000 units per 2 oz) is good though, and it's not very expensive during a two-for-one sale we have now and then.- cold cream, like Pond's or generic: OK but too chemical, scary;- coconut oil: good (I'm planning to mix in some pure vitamin E and try that)- Colonial Dames' Vitamin E cream: really good but costly and smelly and has parabens and alcohol- Jason Vitamin E cream: no parabens, but less E, less greasy; overall good- Burt's Bee hand salve: OK, persistent, but too costly and initially too smelly, obnoxious, can't be used in public (OK for home though)- Shea butter from the same maker (NOW): very good, not too greasy, fairly persistent, no smell at all; comes second best after this one.- Pure lanolin from the same maker (NOW): good moisturising effect, persistent, a bit too thick (hard to spread); would be OK but it stinks so foul you can't use it unless you like to smell like barnyard. You will certainly be removed from the premises if you go around like that.- THIS GREASE HERE: best. It does have a smell, rather noticeable, but the smell is nice (smells like chocolate, wonder if you can eat it?) and it doesn't last. The strongest part of the product is how persistent it is: I've washed my hands five times and still didn't need the towel: water doesn't stick, it gathers up in a few globules on the surface of the skin that you can simply shake off, w/o towel-drying; so, obviously, some grease remains on the skin even after several washes. Not too greasy at the same time, go figure. For me this is god-sent 'cause I wash hands a lot and the skin is really parched because of that.Bottom line: this one takes the prize; five stars. Shea butter from the same maker is a close second, shared by the two vitamin E creams; Burt's Bee slave a distant third. Recommended.Added on 10/28/2011: Just to share: I finished my researches into moisturisers, and the results are somewhat anticlimatic: the best moisturiser for face is L'Oreal's aftershave; the best all-around moisturiser is Cetaphil (both lotion and cream; I like the cream better but both are fine). Everything else I've tried isn't quite as good (even though it was all two-to-four times more expensive). Go figure. L'Oreal has all the usual crap including parabens in it; Cetaphil is pretty harmless (no parabens, no fragrances, no grease: a pretty neutral product), but not too natural either. Yet these two are the best: not greasy at all and with good humectant properties; neither one clogs pores. This is just for your info; it in no way affects what I say above about the NOW cocoa-buttur creme."
0,The first time I used this fragrance it made me nauseous. It had an old lady smell to it. I didn't smell any sandalwood at all. Very disappointed. I threw it away!
1,"I purchased the CND Stickey Base, along with their tip coat and have been very happy with my purchase.  It goes on smoothly and makes my polish last.  A little goes a long way!"
1,I switch between the apple sugar and the cotton candy. Both scents mix well with my own chemistry. Neither are overpowering. A joy to wear!
1,"This cleanser by philosophy is THE BOMB DOT COM! I love using it when removing my makeup at the end of the day! It removes all my makeup but I always make sure that I use makeup removing facial wipes, for instance; the Neutrogena Makeup Removing Cleansing Towlettes to remove any left over foundation/makeup from my face. But anyways it leaves my face feeling soft, clean and fresh after!"
1,"Works well on my nails so far, but we will see in the long run. Tiny jar for the price though."
1,"I think if you want a gentle steaming this is ok, but I think just boiling a pot of water is better.  I was glad that it came with some accessories that I ended up having a use for.  Its cheaper than the spa so I mean it pays for itself but I don't see this as a regular treatment for me."
1,"I love retinol , seems to be something that really works for fine lines and wrinkles . This was not too harsh ."
1,"I didn't like it in the beginning. When I first started using it 2 months ago, my hair felt too dry, like all the oil was washed off my this shampoo. I live in Colorado, and you don't want to make your hair any drier than this State already makes it be. BUT: 2 months later I actually started seeing the change in my overall hair health. I haven't changed my diet or anything, while my hair started looking better and better after every wash. Having extremely fine and thin hair, this shampoo makes it look thicker. Seriously, once I washed my hair with my bf's shampoo, and my ponytail was thinner than my pinkie. The next day I washed it with this shampoo, and the size of my ponytail grew to the size of my thumb:) Believe me, it's a BIG change for me. I can actually see the difference."
1,Love Love Love this serum! I use it faithfully twice a day. It goes on silky and adds enough moisture for my sensitive skin so that i don't need a moisturizing cream.
1,So far my experience with T/Sal has been really good.  I alternate it with T/Gel.  Between the two it really drops the banhammer on dandruff.  I had such bad dandruff that I could not even wear a black shirt.  Now I can and will only see one or two flakes here and there.  That is pretty impressive.I've found it to be ineffective on my seborrheic dermatitis.  i need to use something else for that.  But for dandruff...awesome.
1,I love Olay - I try other more expensive products and I go back to Olay.
1,"Pros: some hold, great smell (you can definitely smell the difference between this one and the chemical hairsprays)Cons: doesn't hold as well and weighs hair down a bit when you first spray itI now use it at night to hold the curls and will try the extra hold version. Update: Extra holds MUCH MUCH better."
1,"I'm not sure that I notice any difference between this and regular witch hazel, but I am happy with it overall. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think I will try the lavender version the next time I buy. The rose scent is a bit too ""old lady"" for me, but that is just my personal preference. It's a light enough scent that I can handle it for now."
1,I love OPI because it goes on in one coat.  I did not like the color of this polish.  It looks more on the red/pink side in the picture.  The color is more of an orange shade.  The actual color did not match the color in the picture.
1,"I am a no fuss type of female that doesn't like the time (or expense) some products take to get r done.  The time and expense that some skin care lines require makes me not want to take the time to do it...but this little bottle does it all and I LOVE it.  You only need a little dab so it lasts a long long time and it does what it promises to do with just one step. I want my face clean, soft and fresh looking and this does it.  I am 61 and do not expect it to make me look 20...it is pure and simple and I have not had one blemish, not one since I started using this and I use to get them all the time on forehead and nose...it does this without the redness and irritation of some skin care products that claim to help with blemishes.  A great product for what I want it for."
1,"Revlon RV440C 1200 Watt Ionic Hot Air Dryer and Styler, BlueThanks to this Revlon hair dryer, I can blow dry my hair again.  I have Osteoarthritis and cannot hold a regular hair dryer. It was easy to use and did a terrific job of drying my thick hair.  Before my hair was completely dry, I added the smaller brush to style/smooth my hair. My hair looked great! This is a great hair dryer for everyone--disabled or not! I am thrilled that I found this dryer on Amazon, my favorite place to shop."
1,"I have acne prone skin.....at 45.  I find it takes a combination of things to keep my skin on track, and this will be helpful.  It feels a little tingly when it first goes on, but then my skin gets nice and soft."
1,I bought it and I like it and I would buy it again. Goes on a little strong but after dry down it starts to mellow out and smells nice.
1,"Tried it light, tried to spread it well, tried to cover it with foundation.  My nose is still red.  I am a Rudolf this Christmas (and every Christmas before that)"
1,"I read the detailed report on wrinkle creams done by Consumer Reports.  They tested out all the top wrinkle creams out there.  The result: None produced significant results, but Olay Regenerist was the best.  If you have fine lines and unevenness due to dry skin, then this will help, no doubt, BUT it will not undo your wrinkles.  It's a great moisturizer, but I am concerned about all the synthetic chemical ingredients in this product.  After using this product, I'm switching over to something safer, more natural."
1,"It's okay, I don't really like the scent, it smells kind of mature. I'm in my 20's and it seems to have a powdery scent to it. I actually like Dickenson's Witch Hazel better as it feels like it leaves less residue on my skin."
1,"I used this hair thickener for two years and thought it was the best out there. However, over time I started noticing that my hair was looking a little dry, less shiny, and I began to see more breakage. I realized it must be the Toppik and stopped using it. My hair improved a great deal after I stopped. Since then, I have found better options that give me just as much volume, but without sacrificing the shine and without drying my hair out as much. I currently use John Frieda Luxurious Volume Building Mousse, which is much more gentle for daily use."
1,"I hate lotion. It's sticky when you put it on, takes forever to dry (if it dries at all), and many times smell strange, even if it's supposed to be unscented. This oil is a perfect alternative for someone like me who needs to have their skin moisturized, but don't want to deal with all the negatives of lotion. I can barely smell this oil, which is great for my allergies, and it feels like liquid silk going on. I wipe excess water from my skin, then apply this oil, pat dry with a towel and spritz some Yes to Carrots Body Mist all over. My skin simply glows, and it's more moisturized than when I was using lotion. I would recommend this to anyone. You'll be hooked!"
1,"Fiji is a lovely, perfect, pale pink. It's an excellent, 2 coat, formula. Smooth. I like to use this as a base coat and then I add other colors to the nail. I am a fan of Essie colors."
0,I honestly felt like I was just putting water on my acne. I didn't notice any changes at all and would gladly return it if it cost me more and if I still had the box.
1,"Over the past year, I had gel french nails done bi-weekly in a salon, unfortunately, after about 1 year, my nails were burning, which I know is due to filing/sanding. I did tons of research and came up with a non-salon regimen that works for me. I use Hoofmaker Hand and Nail lotion, Nailtiques Plus 2, Zeva Crystal file, and Zeva Nail Brite. Finally, I use 2 different cuticle cream a few x's per day - Barielle cuticle cream. Barielle's cuticle cream dries nicely. All of this together has made a huge difference. I never thought it was possible to have natural nails that actually looked nice."
1,"This is a very nice shimmer polish.  It's a cherry fuschia color and not very purple at all.  Two coats are all I needed for my manicure.  I always use a basecoat and top coat with my polish.  I had some minor tip chips after 3 days, touched up with another coat as I typically do."
1,I use it once a week as my basic skin care after steaming my face or while steaming my face.  The rechargable buttery is still good after 2 years.  The suction head is 2 way.  I can you smaller side or bigger side.  I don't use the mist because I always use facial steamer whenever I use this.
1,"Once a week I strip my hair of buildup using Neutrogena's anti-residue shampoo, and then condition with this.  Keeps my hair sleek and shiny.  Best deep conditioner I've used and great price."
1,This stuff is like magic in a bottle.  It is wonderful for a itchy scalp and works fast.  I just wish it wasn't so expensive!
1,"I was surprised to see how quickly the winter dryness had affect my hands -- and only my hands. The Neutrogena lotion showed up at exactly the right time! I was even more surprised to see how fast it worked. The thick and greasy formula is obviously for when your skin needs emergency attention, and it took no more than two days for my skin to look and feel better. You'd have no idea my skin was dry and flaky just last week!The Norwegian formula, as I mentioned, it quite thick. It looks like a translucent gel in the bottle. It stays exactly where you put it and turns white as you rub it into your skin. You definitely need to rub it in well, and a little goes a long way. If you use too much, your skin might feel a little sticky after.I wouldn't recommend it for every day use if you're not experiencing rather dry skin, but it's great for cracked and dry hands and feet, too!I'd definitely buy this again if the dry skin returns."
1,Love this fall color polish. Just like the one I buy in target. Love it.
1,"I love this thing and I wish I had bought one sooner...I would have eliminated so much styling frustration! I recently got my hair cut into an A line bob and getting the hang of styling it has been a feat. Juggling a blow dryer and different sized round brushes while trying to style the shortest lengths of my hair has been a misery. This stand cuts back on so much styling time and makes styling more enjoyable and efficient. It does take some getting used to to get the right angle, but once you do, styling is a piece of cake.The base is weighted and I haven't had any trouble with it falling over (and I have the bars full extended so my blow dryer points downward to eliminate frizz). The blow dryer sits pretty securely in the clip with the double-sided Velcro tape wrapped around the handle. My Helix by Hot Tools blow dryer is pretty lightweight though, so if you have a dryer that's on the heavier side or has a long nozzle, or if you use attachments...you might have some issues with maintaining the right angle with the bending arm."
1,"I am 39 years old and have very sensitive skin, and because of that I had been using fragrance-free products by Clinique. I always thought I looked pretty young until I saw a picture of myself at 29. My skin was so much better looking! After doing some research I decided to give this a try based upon the favorable reviews, low cost and the fact that it's fragrance free. (Perfumed lotions make me sneeze).After one use, I noticed a few things. My skin did tingle slightly for a couple of hours, but it wasn't painful; just mildly annoying. But there was no rash or irritation. My cheeks looked a bit red, however it appeared more like a natural tint. The second thing I noticed is that my skin almost immediately looked better! I know that sounds crazy. I also didn't need to put on any blush because of the tint I mentioned. As the day wore on, the tingling went away. (I also started using Neutrogena Light Night Cream for a moisturizer- it's fragrance-free, and doesn't have sunscreen which I don't need every day.)I applied it the next morning again and noticed the same things. I decided  to try it every other day and have to say I REALLY notice a difference! My skin looks almost as good as my pic from ten years ago.I think the minor discomfort I mentioned is due to my sensitivity to most products, but because I am so pleased with the results I'm sticking with it.Update: After using this for a week I no longer have any sensitivity and my skin is incredibly soft and luminous!Update 11/2013: I'm going to be turning 46 and still use and love this item!"
1,"I was intrigued by the reviews, but I actually wouldn't bother to order this again.It's too light.  It absorbs well, but I'd prefer something more effective."
1,For some reason I couldn't find this in any nearby stores when my old one ran out so I got it here on amazon--I love it because after I wash my face it is a little dry and this stuff is perfect not feeling oily and gives you a bit of shimmer for radiance without looking like a stripper rubbed her face on you.  It also as SPF so that's a plus!
1,I use this every morning before my make up application and it makes my make up goes on very smooth
0,My nails chipped and broke just as fast if not faster using this product. I even bought a China Glaze color to go with it. No dice.
1,"I LOVE this stuff and here's why:I'm an acne sufferer with sensitive/oily skin. I DO NOT have deep acne scars anymore since I have gotten laser treatment done on my skin almost a year ago. Therefore I cannot comment on how well the product applies over scarring. But, I occasionally do still break out. The one thing I hate the most is when I buy $50 makeup that looks flawless but then the red dots start to resurface after so many hours of wear. I decided to purchase Dermablend after watching a YouTube tutorial on it. I figured why not. I've been using it for roughly a month and it's been good to me. 1). It doesnt make me break out. 2). When I apply it over a break out it DOESNT make it worse! 3). It doesnt slide off like average makeup (this is definitely all day wear kinda stuff). 4). The coverage is absolutely phenomenal. I've never in my life been complimented for having pretty skin but I am now! 5). Many foundations are notorious for having that &#34;I can feel my makeup clogging my pores&#34; sensation. I don't have that issue with dermablend which is good news for me because my oily skin hates everything.Here's my advice if you're planning on buying:1. This is pretty heavy duty stuff so I wouldn't apply it every day. It might irritate your skin because it's pretty thick2. Only use it as a concealer. I know many of us hate our skin but not letting it breathe isn't helping anyone3. Blend Blend Blend! This isn't like your average concealer where you dab twice and done. You really have to blend it nicely or else it will look cakey. Beauty takes time ladies.4. A little goes a very very long way. This stuff might seem sad because it comes in a very small container but trust me. It's amazing how well it spreads. A tiny tip of the finger amount was enough to cover my whole face! So, you're definitely getting your money's worth.5. If you are planning on using it as a full face foundation the little spatula thing that comes with it is great. If you're just planning on using it as a concealer a tiny makeup brush to apply it works better.In the long run, I'd recommend this stuff to anyone. If you're curious about how it might look over acne scars do some research. I've read some reviews that say it accentuates their acne scars but I personally think it may be due to a lack of blending. This is also a possible reason why some people may think it looks cakey. Remember to blend and take your time."
1,This stuff helps my skin and doesn't break me out. It is more like a lotion than a cream. I like how it has sunscreen in it to protect my face.
1,"I researched this cream for months before I purchased it. I have to do this now because as I age, my skin is more sensitive. MAN!!!! I am so glad my research paid off. This cream is light yet powerful. It smoothes your pores and fades brown marks (I'm a pimple popper picker). It's the new addition to my &#34;Age Gracefully&#34; skin care regime."
1,"Good remover but my hands and cuticles are a bit dry afterwards, since I change my polish regularly. Good value/quality ratio though."
1,This stuff is great! It keeps your hands hydrated and a bottle is so small but will last forever! You really just need a dab and your hands will be silky smooth. Perfect for the winter!
1,I am taking medications that make my skin extremely dry.  Lotion wasn't helping until I starting using this product along with the Aveeno lotion companion.  It resolved my problems.  I use this product for my daughter who has eczema and thought I would try it too.  I'm glad I did.  Aveeno products are great and they don't contain parabens which I avoid.
1,Is it just me or is it nearly impossible to pump any lotion out of the bottle? The lotion itself is very very good.....but it takes about 10 to 20 pumps to get any lotion out....I think the tube needs to be thicker. If that issue were fixed I would give it 5 stars.
1,"This bomb turns a bath into a beautiful tropical ocean.  The deep blue color penetrates the water, turning it a dark and tranquil blue.  The fresh scent is mellow and calming.  The bath bomb softens the water and with tons of fragrance, you feel as though you're surrounded by luxury.  This bath bomb is an experience- for those who like color, scent, aromatherapy in their baths, this is a don't-miss."
0,Was really looking forward to this hair roller set. It is much harder to use. Takes longer to set. Curls did not last longer. Very disappointed. I'm going right back to my jumbo revlon heated rollers.
1,Good product!
1,"high price for a brush but is worth it,works great for my fine hair, does not get tangled,also have the larger size to.money well spent"
1,This works great as a base coat for nail art but is too runny to work great as french tips. You have to be super careful while applying as french tips because this nail polish likes to go all over the place. Still great cream white to draw over and dries really fast in true Essie style!
1,"Since I have baby fine hair that is kind of hard to curl, I purchased the 3/4 inch model of this Instant Heat Brush. What amazes me about this brush is that it heats up so quickly but does not overheat.So far, I have not forgotten to turn it off, yet I am so glad to know that it has an auto turnoff.One more thing I want to add: This does not tangle up in my hair and gives my hair softness and curl. And this brush is easy to clean also."
1,I use this on my curly haired daughter. It does a good job of refreshing her curls. It also doesn't have a strong smell.
1,"These are great lipsticks!  They are creamy, non drying, and have amazing staying power!  I have used these lipsticks for years and will continue to use these lipsticks as long as they are for sale!  Love these lipsticks!"
1,"I had these years ago, but when they died I replaced them with Conair hot rollers. Lately my hair has been so dry and hasn't held a curl, so I tried these again. They are great! My curls have lasted and lasted. I love the variety of roller sizes for different looks.My only complaint is the slant of the top. It's difficult to balance the clip on top. I know the last time I had the curlers, I got in a pretty quick rhythm with rolling them and heating the clips. I am sure I will get it to work better with more tries, but so far I have had a lot of falling clips and have burned myself on the steam (nothing serious-- just slightly painful). A flatter top would make it easier and faster."
1,"I mix this product with sweet almond oil to moisturize out of the shower.  Feels and smells great!!!  (If you do mix it, you have to shake it before use since it is oil and water mixed).  The rose smell is perfect and quite enjoyable."
0,"For some reason Amazon only has a handful of detangler comb/brush choices so I decided to go ahead and order this one because it seemed to be the best choice at the time.When I was younger I remember having several &#34;detangler&#34; combs in our bathroom drawer because my younger sister and I have always had very long straight hair that tangled up, especially after bath time so instead of my mom having to chase us around to brush our hair and then we would scream like someone is trying to kill us she always used a brush and detangler combination and it worked fine!I don't remember what age I was when my hair seemed as though it stopped getting tangled all the time but for a long time I remember not having that issue and life was GREAT.About a year ago though my hair started to frizz-up and tangle and all sorts of other weird stuff so my search started with hair treatment products, new shampoos, etc. While I was trying to figure out what was going on I decided I would also buy new brushes and unbelievably so after so many years find a detangler brush as well....:(For starters the detangler combs we had when I was young were tiny compared to this cumbersome thing, they were made out of different resin/plastic and the bristles were also completely different.None the less I still decided to give it a try because as all things in life you can no longer get all the awesome things we all grew up with and miss dearly almost on a daily basis!My two sense about this comb is that because its gigantic, the bristles are way too thick, the material used to make it is very cheap, and the alignment of the bristles is way off because they are so big instead of it actually detangling your hair it in fact tangles it even more than when you first started.The only reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1 is because I like the design and tortoise pattern.I would never buy this again or recommend it!PS: If you want an INCREDIBLE detangler and brush invest in one of: The Wet Brush and you won't regret it! For those interested after using the brush for several months I finally reviewed it on 11/25/2012 its the black J&D; Beauty B830W."
1,"It's not my favorite of the scents but the products are identical in quality- my skin is silky soft and I smell delightful. I live in Alaska which is REALLY dry, especially in the winter; this product is a great addition to my evening bath. Husband has also started using it for the same purpose."
1,I've been using this product for years.  I like it.It protects my skin  and it doesn't feel greasy.It's not real expensive either.  I recommend it.
1,"I am really liking this brand of nail polish lately, and they have a nice selection of colors. This is a great color; will buy again."
0,I didn't care for this.  It doesn't make your skin break out but it really didn't work for wrinkles.  Spend your money on something better.
0,there are a lot of plastic bristles in this brush.  cant really recommend it.  wouldnt get another one.  read description carefully.
1,"not only does it do a great job cleaning, it makes puppy soooo soft and smell so good! We use it weekly."
1,"I had purchase a small tube of this a couple yrs back at &#34;Whole Foods&#34;. The 2oz tube was much more expensive THERE than this 4oz.!! I used it on & off then just forgot about it. After moving, I found the tube amount my things & decided to try it again. I am in my early 40's ( though I never admit it!)  & let's just say I'm noticing the affects of AGE on my body , lol. My &#34;monthly&#34; is all whacked out, it's either very heavy & lasts for 7-8 days, or spotty for just a few days! I get twice some months, oh what a joy.... ;(  So, figuring these symptoms, I thought maybe using this cream may help? Since we lose estrogen as we age, why not replace it, maybe it will reverse some of the issues of LOW estrogen! Well, I started using what I had left of my 2oz tube. Within about 2weeks I notice a weird feeling in my breast. Not only were they a lot more sensitive , as they were in my 20's, but they were..uummm... Bigger?? They had a feeling of fullness, I remembered them feeling like this in my teens & thru 20's just before I'd get my &#34;monthly&#34;. But I had not had that happen in a LONG time, especially after having my daughter 10 yrs ago. I had a full D cup, when I couldn't breast feed her, they quickly DEFLATED! I cried for only a few months, .. Now left with still a D cup yet instead of a FULL, I was now a LONG!! ;(  My only recourse has been the PUSH ( way) UP bra. I sleep in them! Well, anyway, this cream somehow was giving me a bit of my lost fullness back. Don't know how, why, don't care.. I quickly bought this 4oz tube off Amazon at a much cheaper price, as I have almost always found with everything- Go Amazon!  So,I put this on my...ummm.. Well, Breasts! Why put it on my arm or leg & wait for it to work it's way to the area I want it it affect?!  So alittle tweaking on my part w/directions- I use it 2x a day ( if I remember!) & apply it directly on my breasts. If it keeps doing what it's doing ( sensitive &full) I'll buy STOCK in the company!  Yea, I recommend it... ;)"
1,"I had high hopes for this. With hair down to my mid-back, blow drying takes far too long for my liking. After reading reviews I thought this would cut out some time, but it doesn't. I like the secure turban versus wrapping my head in a towel, but that's where the benefits end. Any suggestions as to what would work better??"
1,"I love Oil of Olay and have been using it for a number of years (the daily moisturizer). I got this night cream because I am now in my 40's and am noticing my skin is changing and becoming dryer. I used this cream and it instantly made my face feel softer throughout the day. Also, true to Oil of Olay, I don't have any adverse reactions such as blemishes. It is light and feels really good on my skin."
1,My son has Psoriasis and this is the only product he can use and he swears by it5 Stars all the way1
0,I found this product made my hair sticky.  Very little thickening.  I didn't like this at all.  I know you are only supposed to use a tiny amount but still did not like the feel of it in my hair.
1,Love love this color!True bottle color can get away with 1 coat or 2 love it my nails look like a easter egg. Prefect for the spring!
1,"It Essie nail polish, it's white, it's expensive but somehow better than the cheap guys. I like it just fine..."
1,"I have to start out by saying that I am really not a fan of Neutrogena products. This is one of the exceptions. Three days after starting Accutane, I ran out of my expensive moisturizer (Physiodermie - Oily Skin Cream - 50ml) and had to run to the drugstore to buy moisturizer. I had a meltdown because they didn't have Olay in stock and bought Aveeno, Cetaphil, and this. This is the best, by a long shot. It feels nearly as good as my expensive one, but it doesn't sink into the skin quite as fast. The only downside is the smell, which is of clay. I don't mind it, since that proves it is fragrance free-- I just wish it was a little less strong.My favorite drugstore moisturizer is stillOlay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream, 1.7-Fluid Ounce, but I would definitely repurchase this neutrogena moisturizer!"
1,"I first bought this product from my manicurist, just to be polite. She insisted. My nails would chip and she politely insisted that I try this product. OK, OK, I tried them all from the drugstores and was skeptical about this one too. I'd use it as clear nail polish, or so I thought. The effects of this stuff blew me away -- it really, really, really, really works. Really. I noticed my nails looked a lot better -- I was shocked. I usually don't wear polish, and the looks of wearing this alone looked great -- it sort of ""wears off"" or gets absorbed, so you never have to remove it -- just reapply. I'm active, athletic, and this stuff is awesome."
1,"Sand beige, online it looked medium fair, but its dark..really dark.  I have to return it and hope they are nice about it.But this is the first time, since I order most make up online, that there is such a descrepancy between the color shown,and the color that arrived.  I want to add, the make up and bottle is nice, but the color is so dark, I cannot use it.  That has nothing to do with the fact however, that the make up would be fine I'm sure for someone else. I did not use it, I saw it, opened the lid, and clealy using it would be foolish.  It really is too dark for me.  It arrived in a timely manner, I should add that, it also is in fine condition, the label, the bottle etc.  I wish there was a way to really tell a bit closer what color it really is.  Thats what Im discourage about.  I have bought make up online before, so again, this time, it was so light in appearance online that I felt it would work.  Thanks for getting the product to me right away, it was a bargain  at 4.01, but unfortunately color is not a match for me.  It has to go back. I also wish they would put some sort of packaging on the bottle, so the lid would not be loose as well, perhaps some plastic to keep it closed, and tight knowing that it was not tampered with either.  I wss also sent an email to not place this reviews and only allowed to review the seller and packaging? I see reviews on products all the time, the color on this was dark, not just a bit off, but a lot so beward."
1,"I originally bought this product from my dermatologist office, and later found it on Amazon for a better price. This is the best facial wash I've ever used. It leaves oily skin clean and smooth without over drying. I will never look for a new product again! I'm very pleased with Obagi products.*update* I still use this wash and love it, but I've given up on the Obagi eye creams. They are nice, but I can't justify the price because they only moisturize my skin, as opposed to the other things they claim to do. But this wash is the best -- time to order more!"
1,"I love this product, unfortunately it's not always sold in every store. Thankfully i can get it from Amazon! It smells good and is not a harsh product. I plan to try the lavendar one when i'm done with this bottle."
1,This liquid liner is the best liner for a smokey eye. It will give your that sexy kitten eye look.
1,"I like it, my children too, I am just not sure if the fluoride contained is high or it is just fine, check that before"
1,The color of OPI cotton candy is nearly colorless but bright.It's very nature and applicable to a variety of occasions. I always use it in my office but not so publicity
1,Not much one can say about polish remover. It does the job.  You can't go wrong with Sally Hansen products.  I've used other brands but I find this one works best.
1,A lot of deep conditioners unfortunately leave a nasty residue after use. They might make your hair look fabulous but you absolutely can't let anyone touch your beautiful tresses because they feel totally disgusting.Thats why I love this hair mask! Its perfect in so many ways.... During the summer I use it once every 3 weeks (or more frequently if I've been using a lot of heat and styling products) and during the winter about every 9 days.My favorite part is the winter static prevention.My thin hair is incredibly prone to become static and on some days I look electrocuted by mid afternoon.I'm so glad thats under control now because of this.
1,"This stuff isn't very moisturizing at all. It has SPF 30 which automatically makes it thicker, plus the tint, this is just as moisterizing as foundation. I don't use foundation so I like that this is a very light foundation substitute, and that's what I would call it, not a moisterizer. I mix mine with grapeseed or emu oil so that it goes on slick and not cakey. When combined with my facial oil, I love the stuff..... But by itself? No good.Also I have moderate acne which I try VERY hard to keep under control, and this product does NOT make me break out."
1,"It works well enough. It turned my hair a blondeish orange color. It didnt really matter  to me as I was just trying to remove the hair dye out my hair (it was red) and dye my hair jet black. I would recommend that if you have long, thick hair like I do that you get more than one bottle. I didnt have quite enough to do all my hair. Also I would recommend that when you shake the bottle up (to mix the stuff) to be really careful when opening it. It exploded everywhere when I opened it xD also Dont let it get on your skin as it will bleach your skin and anything else it gets on."
1,"I love this thing!  It heats up in seconds yet its gentle to hair, it gives it shine and smooths the follicles, gives texture, bounce, and shape to lifeless hair.  This thing is the bomb.com!  I must have crawled under a rock because I have never seen this tool before and I sure wish I had!  It would saved me from one too many bad haircuts!  I love it and it came earlier than expected too! I was like a kid in Christmas opening up a special gift!"
1,"I've been using Q-tips for years, the condensed cotton makes it much more easy to clean without coming apart - which I hate about other brands. I don't think I would use any other brand."
1,"These wipes are a great find. As many have mentioned, they are not easy to find in stores and you cannot beat the price on Amazon. I use them as an adult, just recently, for nights. I am too lazy to wash my face and these wipes have been a great help in clearing up my dull skin. I find they are gentl and non-drying. They have a light, pleasant smell to them as well. My only wish is that they come in a subscribe and save option."
1,"This is a great price compared to what I have seen at local stores. The bottle is small but a little goes a long way. Works great on my skin to help reduce pores and also dry up any occasional acne. Havent noticed it helping with age spots or wrinkles,  but I really bought it to shrink my pores anyway."
1,"I love love love these pads! I have purchased them several times and will continue to do so. They help me with break outs that I have as well as the ever unsightly Bacne! That's right, I said it! They smell amazingly wonderful. I've even got my boyfriend in to using them. He loves them too! They do not burn my skin when I use them and i love that they are not overly saturated when I take them out the container. I tried using a different cheaper brand but the pads were so small and thin I ended up using 3 or 4 just to get the same coverage I get with 1 of these. I will stick with these!"
1,yay! it didn't cure my acne but it did help (with regular use). it does work upside down and i like to use it right out of the shower.
1,"This shampoo and its accompanying conditioner are the best.No more dry unhealthy looking hair.My fine relaxed hair just ends up looking great.I have no complaints.It lathers well,smells fantastic,makes you want a bigger bottle.It's pricey,but for salon hair...I have no complaints.Buy this you won't be sorry."
1,"This is great. I wanted the mirror shine, and this is pretty close. It's not quite as reflective as I was hoping for, like I have seen in photos on Pinterest, but close enough! I am finding all of China Glaze's products to be completely satisfactory."
1,This is the best shower gel I have ever owned. It smells great and it makes my skin so moist and it stays that way until I shower or bathe the next day. This is also a great buy for a 32 ounce size. It should last  a long time. I would recommend this product to anyone.
1,"Classic color that looks great on my nails no matter what their length. And this color goes well with casual clothing or the dressiest evening wear. With the right top coat (like the one I get in he 99cent store, really!), it lasts for a few days without need of a touch up."
0,"Unless you have very fair skin, this concealer is to light for Asian color skin. It doesn't blend very well with your foundation and looks caky on your face."
1,Good-Smells greatHelps to clear acneGoes a long wayBad-Does dry out skinI would recommend using it maybe every other day
1,this coverstick is white and it comes out good but it doesin't really cover anything up it just covers it and makes it white and its not a good undereye concealer because it doesin't coverup undereye circles that well its good for blemishes but not undereyes.
1,"I like the applicator, like the way I can perfectly line my eyes.  Love the colors, too.  The gold color and the plum color both make green eyes stand out.  The only problem is that it doesn't last all day."
1,"This is the only mask I use, mainly because I don't have time to take amazing care of my skin, having a whole 15 minute routine day and night. I use this about once a week and since I've started using this (having bought it about 5 more times from my local Walgreens) and my skin feels SO fresh after using this. It dries into a hard consistency, kind of like what it feels like to have dried egg whites on your skin, but it's not unpleasant. I take it off with just water and a dark colored washcloth, being gentle and I feel so fresh and clean after. It does help a little to clear my skin, but no drastic change. I really like the feeling and look it gives my skin. Just try not to get it into your eyes (duh) because it is a mint mask, it STINGS. But that shouldn't be a problem for most people.PROS:-Great feeling: fresh, clean, extremely rejuvenated and awake-Lovely smell-Relaxing-Helps to clear skin, tones down redness-Definitely reasonably priced. WHY pay $50 + for the same type of mask. This one is great.CONS:-Sometimes it separates and liquid comes out before the mask. It's not really a problem though."
0,"Normally, I love Avalon's products, and their commitment to using lots of organic and sustainable ingredients. But they have to work well, and this just doesn't.This shampoo smells great, but left my hair incredibly dry. With my fine, oily hair, that is a problem that I've never had before. I never use conditioners, because I've just never needed them before, but with this shampoo, you'd better have some handy!"
0,"If you want to add red to your hair or better yet, turn your hair red then this is the product for you.  It didn't cover any of my gray hair, turned a lot of my hair red and left some of it brown....so I looked like a ridiculous rainbow.  I had to dye it all over again with something else!"
0,"I really wanted to like this product, though I did read some negative reviews from Amazon. While I'm fine with the heavier coverage/thicker consistency of this moisturizer, I made my skin break out. Therefore, I had to stop using it for now. May give it one more chance a little later."
1,"I use this product on my natural african american hair and it is great. It adds much needed moisture to my hair.The scent of this product is not good. It smells like really cheap perfume and like someone has sprayed A LOT of it.My only other critique is that this bottle is very poorly made. When you spritz it goes everywhere, so I have to pour this product into another (effective) spritz bottle."
1,"I LOVE THIS STUFF! I am now on my third bottle and it has become a staple in my shower.This is the ONLY body wash I have ever used that doesn't dry my skin out or cause irritation. I have used everything from commercial drugstore products to high end, organic, natural, whatever and I always come back to this one because it works the best.This wash has a rich lather and leaves my skin feeling silky, soft, and smooth. I get compliments on how great my skin feels! Baby soft! It is unscented but if you really smell it you can pick up a naturally fresh pleasant scent.The only thing I wish I could change about this product is it isn't completely all natural. But its a Gem!"
1,"This isn't your everyday gel that flakes and turns your hair into a helmet. Fantasia gel is thick like pudding and has a citrusy fragrance. I have thick, curly hair that's unmanageable at times, but all I have to do is put this gel on my wet hair, put a scarf on, and then I'm done. No frizzies and no hairs sticking up. My waves and curls are even defined. I'm recommending this gel because I have been using it for 3 years and it WORKS. The most important thing to remember is to apply it to your hair when it's wet/damp."
1,This is a good cleanser to clean my face. It is gentle and smells good. My face feels really clean after i use it. But most importantly it doesn't break me out.
1,Some pimples it clears up within a day or two...others not so much. But this certainly helps keep the redness/swelling/size of the pimple down.
1,"This is good if you have very dry and not acne prone skin. I only use it every once in a while with my clairsonic, never use it alone. It smells kinda bad, kinda like salt!!"
1,"The secret is out...  I dye my hair.I was going to Sally's beauty to get hair dye but their solutions are toxic.  And buying everything separately adds up.My friend introduced me to Naturtint.  I bought my first couple packages at Whole Foods but now buy them on Amazon because it's cheaper.  And they are Prime eligible.The great thing is that everything is included in the packet: hair dye, solution, gloves, shampoo & conditioner.Use an old towel to dry your hair for the first couple of weeks.  My white towel turned brownish."
1,"Before you take your shower, moisten your body with warm water and then rub the salt/oil mixture all over your body. I'd avoid the face and neck. If the granules feel uncomfortable on your hands, you can wear a pair of latex gloves. This is also helpful when using the salt scrub to exfoliate your feet.If you want an even more aromatic experience, you can mix some of this oil with your favorite essential oils.This product should be used with a sense of caution. Put a towel down on the floor of you shower or bath before using this product. When you are dealing with oil in the shower, this is a good precaution and the towel is easily wrung out later and thrown in the wash. It is worth thinking about; otherwise you can risk falling in the shower.You will also want to consider washing out the shower floor with a good scrub cleaner before stepping in again. I found this out the hard way after sitting in the shower and rubbing an oil and salt mixture all over. I could not get out of the tub and fortunately, my husband was kind enough to bring me a towel.While humorous, I think caution is advised with this product.A luxurious spa experience that will make your skin feel amazingly smooth and nourished. Especially wonderful in the winter!~The Rebecca Review"
1,"I like the brand because it is well known, but I also like it because it has an spf rating on it to protect your skin which is very important so that you don't get a sunburn"
1,"I've tried all types of mascaras and it doesn't matter what kind of brush, claim to fame, or marketing ploy they never work as good as old faithful Great Lash!!! Period."
1,"I was hoping this would eliminate the need to blow-with-a-brush my thick short hair.  But unfortunately it  doesn't provide enough control to replace that.  It's good for touch ups, but when I used it on my hair that I didn't blow dry, it didn't give enough control.  My hair stayed frizzy and lost its shape quickly.  I don't like using a curling iron, but with the clip it does provide more control and has more effect on the hair.Based on the other reviews it does replace that process for many users, but didn't for me.Pros:Easy to useAdjustable heat settingsGood for touch upsProbably not damaging to hairCons:Doesn't provide enough control for thick, coarse hairDoes not seal the cuticle, hence doesn't stop the frizzies"
1,"This stuff is awesome.  I use it in the morning, as part of my ""beauty"" treatment.  It is super soft cream.  Feels almost like putting whipped cream on your face. I love it.  Afterward, my face just looks so radiant.  Have been using it for about 2 weeks now and I just love the way it makes my face look.I have been using the Olay products since about July 2006 and am very pleased. I use the Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment at night on my whole face and neck, after washing with Dove Regenerating Calming Night Soap (liquid, navy colored bottle) and I use Olay Smooth Skin Exfoliating Scrub about once or twice a week at night. In the morning, I use Avon ANew Eye Lift Cream around my eyes and then Olay Total Effects 7x Visible Anti-Aging Vitamin Complex Cream on my entire face and neck. I think this combo, particularly the Olay Regenerist products and Total Effects, have made me look YEARS younger--with the grace of God, of course. I added the Regenerist Night Recovery about 2 months ago, and it made a difference for me. Lots of people at work tell me I look younger, too. My skin feels great! It's firm and velvet soft. And wait till I tell you, I have lost 53 pounds in the last 10 months! Why do you care? Well, my face should be sagging all over the place with that kind of a weight loss, especially since I carried that weight for years and my skin was well-stretched. I should need a crane just to hold the wrinkles up! Guess what??? It's firm and velvet soft. I won't say I don't own a wrinkle, but they are very very minimal. I've had people tell me I don't have wrinkles, too, but there are little tiny ones there hiding in the makeup. Oh, I'm 58, too--so don't think I'm 25 and telling you I don't have wrinkles like they tell you in those adds on TV.Dec 2007:  Still using it.  It's like giving your face a drink in the morning.Guys:  YOU can use this stuff too, if you want your face to look softer and firmer.  (Just don't tell the women. Most of them will talk about you like a dog.  Not me, though.  What the heck. I know there are some guys out there that actually care what they look like.)I am mighty pleased with these Olay products, BUT, use them awhile. Nuthin' happens overnight, Hon! (We call everybody Hon in Balmer, Merlin) (That translates to Baltimore, Maryland--sorry, I have an accent.)Nov 2008--still using this in morning, in combination with other Olay and Victoria Principal products."
1,"I have been using Mabelline mascara for many years!  I have tried many other mascaras, but always come back to Mabelline!"
1,"It was amazing to see my hormonal acne around my mouth disappear. It feels like I've tried everything to get rid of it, even taking pills before. Nothing seemed to work until I decided to give this a try. It hasn't worked for the acne in my tzone, but I'll be buying Nature's Cure acne system to see if that helps."
1,I love it.. its very gentle.. I use this after I wash my face.. and it gives my face a glow...I've had it for a few weeks and I see difference in my face.. clear and fresh looking.. my expectations were meet... this will be apart of my face regimen... very happy with this product..
1,I love Avalon organics product line!!! This if my favorite cleansing gel for the shower. I bought it originally for my face but it was to harsh for my face so now I use it for my entire body and it leave my skin squeaky clean without overdrying. Thank you Avalon organics for your Vegan & organic product line!!!
1,I use the obagi system for years now.  This cleanser is the product of choice for me and works great
1,I love all Dr. Bronners soaps especially this one. It's great for sensitive and oily skin. It doesn't over dry your skin since it's made with oils and it dissolves the dirt as well the oil. All Dr. Bronners soaps will leave you feeling refreshed and clean. I LOVE THEM! Definitely will recommend this product.
1,I have full of acne on my back .don't know how is that works .seem not works on my case .so -so
1,"Perfect for sensitive skin, truly fragrance and dye free. Great for those of us with sensitive skin who still like a bar soap. Leaves the skin clean but not flakey or tight feeling. Reasonable priced and better than a lot of pricy cleansers for sensitive skin."
1,"I am a male and I have adult acne.  The acne meds dry out my skin.  I needed a moisturizer that wouldn't make my acne worse, and preferably, would help prevent acne.  This product fits the bill.  It is light, cooling, and doesn't clog my pores.  It's gentle enough that I can put it on my face right after shaving, and it doesn't sting or burn.  (It actually works really well as an after-shave conditioner; seems to help prevent red bumps and ingrown hairs!)  The only way this product could be better would be if they added sun protection to it.  I hope someday they make a version of this with SPF 15; if they do, I will give it 5 stars."
1,"Nailtiques Protein Formul #2Plus.  Long, strong nails do not just happen, warn the makers of this historically popular product: even naturally hard nails need constant care, and the makers of Nailtique products believe that their formulas will provide it.  They state that nails that are inclined to peel, break or split particularly need their help; that their blend of ingredients will help bond the nails together, as well as preventing them from becoming dry and rigid, and thereby promote natural nail growth.The makers suggest careful treatment on a regular basis, and believe that after a few weeks, nails, cuticles and hands will show improvement.  They direct the user to turn the bottle upside down, roll between the palms of your hands to blend ingredients: this should prevent air bubbles that might cause nail protein not to adhere properly.  (You've surely seen manicurists shake the bottle this way in nail salons.) Then the makers recommend that you apply one thin coat of nail protein. For best results, of course, you should first wash nails with soap and water to assure the nail is free from any substances (oil, cream, etc.) which might prevent your nail protein from adhering properly. Then, they suggest you allow your hands to lay flat for 30 seconds to allow the protein to set. (Once again, any woman who has ever been to a nail salon is familiar with the stiff way in which women just manicured hold their fingers out to dry.)Nailtiques Protein Formulas, the makers state, were created for different nail conditions. They believe their salon tested formulations offer special combinations of ingredients, including hydrolyzed keratin, and protein in combination with gelatin and calcium that will bond the nail layers together to build a strong nail foundation.  I however, look at the list of ingredients, and see a lot of items historically much-used in nail products that have been identified as possibly dangerous to bodily health.  So I would prefer to no longer see these ingredients in any product I use.  And perhaps they are absent in newer formulations.  However, I do believe this product keeps its promises: I did notice improvement in the state of my -pathetic--nails with regular use.  And I was pleased with the product's added bonus: when used on bare nails, the product did seem to offer some protection to the nails; furthermore, it left nails with a nice sheen, as if I were wearing a colorless topcoat. A cautious recommendation."
1,"I love this mascara! I have used it for several years and when I try other mascaras, I am never happy with them and I always come back to this one. I don't like waterproof mascara because it is so hard to get off and I feel like I pull eyelashes out when I try to get it off. This if perfect; it is truly a thickening mascara and makes your eyelashes look great! And it doesn't have to be black; even the brown looks great! I like that it's also hypoallergenic and that it conditions my lashes with aloe and vitamin B5. And even with the shipping the cost was less than if I bought it in a store...and it's delivered right to my door!"
1,"I like using this shampoo after I've been in a pool with clorine or when I've used hairspray or other gel products on my hair.  This really seems to do the job of cleaning my hair and leaving it soft and manageable.I used to spend a fortune on salon brand shampoos and conditioners, thinking they were much better for my hair than the ""grocery store"" brands. Then when traveling and not being able to find my shampoo in an ""under 4 oz."" size that I could carry on the plane I decided to wait until I reached my destination to buy some. I bought this one because I was traveling in a smoggy area and could almost feel the smog in my hair, but also because it was cheap and I wouldn't feel bad about leaving a good portion of it behind at the end of the trip. (I gave the remaining shampoo to the person at the hotel front desk).I was so surprised to find that this shampoo left my fine, flyaway hair just as clean and soft as as the more expensive brands. I couldn't tell the difference between this shampoo and my much more expensive salon brand! Still, I thought maybe it was just the difference in water or the weather at the place I was staying on the trip. I bought the shampoo again at home when I ran out of my salon brand and found that it performed just as well with the local water, weather, etc. That was 4 years ago and I have been using Suave shampoos and conditioners ever since. I haven't found a single one that I don't like and I've saved a bundle on shampoos and conditioners. Two thumbs up for this product!"
1,"Mata Hari is a wonderful pinkish shade that copliments my complexion much better than the fan favorite, Orgasm did. I have dark brown hair and eyes, and a medium-light complexion. I wanted to love Orgasm, but I didn't feel the peachy shade did anything for me. I was scared to try Mata Hari as it looked too bright in the photo, but in person, it is truly fantastic shade. NARS blushes are highly pigmented, so a little bit with the right application is all you need."
1,"This brush dryer is a good idea. However, I have not been as successful as I want in executing a great hairdo.  Perhaps my hair is too long.  I have heard that people with short hair love this brush/dryer.  I find it somewhat lacking."
1,"I like the color of this polish.  It will go with pretty much anything.  Not too blue, not too gray.  Also, it was a pleasant surprise receiving it seeing that it does have a little bit of shimmer in it, but not enough to be that hard to remove glitter.  Very nice shade to be trendy, yet still a little conservative and safe."
1,"First of all, I always buy the unscented body oil because I use a dropper and squirt some of my favorite aromatherapy essential oils into it before I use it. It takes no more than one dropper full to completely scent the entire bottle of body oil. Impressive, and with heavier oils like sweet almond it takes alot more than just one dropper to carry the scent.I use this after my shower, and just a few drops on my hand can cover an entire body area (lower leg, upper leg, arm, ect). I find the moisture to be helpful, but not enough for my legs, so I use lotion there, too. But it helps, definitely. Plus it adds a sexy sheen (as in shine, not Charlie).It's also great for suntanning, though suntanning is bad for skin anyway...this at least helps keep the skin moist and isn't so heavy that it makes me feel sticky afterwards."
1,"I've noticed that most reviews are from those with fine hair so i didn't have very good reviews to go by. My hair is very thick and kinda corse and being that i dye it (too much grey not to), it's corser then it used to be. This product is no better and maybe even inferior to the conditioners that come with drugstore boxed hair dyes. My hair is shoulder-length and i used about a Tablespoon-full of it, so not a tiny bit as others indicate for their fine hair. It left my hair nice but not nearly as good as some salon brands leave it. It's okay, that's all. Worth the price if you bought it at the local drug store and didn't have to pay the shipping. I don't know if i'll get it again, maybe since there isn't much out there that doesn't have an extra zero in the price...  I give it 3-1/2 Stars"
1,"I tried to take dyed hair from a natural color to white/platinum blonde with Slpat bleach. Then I wanted to add their purple for a streak in the front.. My goodness what a horrible experience. Their stuff hurt and one application left my hair so fried I thought it'd fall out!! Their purple was not purple and bled even after careful dying. The bleach just ruined my hair, it was this horrible mush. I hated it but bleached the purple out, oh my poor hair.Now I have bleached before with the blue tub of bleach by l'oreal. That stuff was awesome, still dried out my hair but not as bad as Splat!Anyway this Platinum was a little weird as it expanded and erupted out of the bottle but I just needed my roots done. I was terrified because I'd been using Everto every super duper conditioner I could find but my hair was a mess. Wow it actually made my hair feel stronger! I don't understand how but it repaired my hair! My roots are not platinum but after one shot of this stuff they are a very light golden blonde. NOTHING will in one shot take a medium brown hair to pure white in one application with frying your hair to mush! If I had used this instead of splat, maybe would have taken two or three applications but my hair would not have been this damaged and I'd still have reached platinum.If you want white or platinum, either do it professionally for fast results that might not fry.. or get enough of this stuff for 2 -3 applications (i.e. 4 bottles if you need 2 just to get all of your hair) and avoid frying your hair! Believe me I won't make that mistake again."
1,"this is my HG cleanser, i rarely use anything else. its not irritating and seems to smooth the skin somewhat. my skin is acne prone very sensitive, uneven and flushes easily, very combination. also the cleanser lasts me a long time :D loveee"
1,"I have extremely sensitive eyes. Mascara, eyeliner and even eyeshadow can cause extreme irritation and itching and little white bumps on my waterline. I searched for a mascara I could wear that wouldn't leave me in pain and wanting to take my eye makeup off immediately. This product was recommended to me and I took a chance. I am very happy with the results. Not only did it not irritate my eyes the mascara itself was great!  Will be purchasing again."
1,"This mascara is fantastic, especially because it is waterproof (actually 2X waterproof).  I got the proof of that from one day after I cried, it did NOT run.The white side helps nourish and add length to your lashes so when you go over them again with the actual colour, it goes over it and gives them even MORE length.  Stay in place all day (and longer if you don't take it off - tested that out as well-LOL!!)"
1,"I've purchased this product falling for the ""Alpha hydrox"" name thinking that there is AHA in it for gentle resurfacing. And I was dissapointed to see only Citric acid in it out of all array of AHAs. Unfortunately I didn't notice all the ingredients listed. Oh well. It's a good cleanser, foams up well and takes off all the makeup. I just wish it didn't have Parabens and Urea. I am not too fond of those."
1,"I don't use this often but when I do it feels great to my skin.  It cleans well, removes oil and dirt.  I like how does not cause that overdrying feeling once it dries.  It also seems to have a cooling aid too so if I happen to clean to harshly I won't tell.  For those who wear makeup from my understanding it's a good at removing it before bedtime.  This does cost a few bucks more than its competition Noxzema -- I don't see a big difference besides you paying for the name.  Nevertheless pretty good facial cleaner."
1,"This powder has a wonderful, fine, silky consistency and a pleasant smell that doesn't linger. It goes on smoothly with the included puff and controls shine for a long time--maybe not all day, but for several hours, at least. I have mostly normal/combination skin, with a forehead that can get oily and cheeks that tend toward dryness; this controlled shine all over without making any part of my face dry or itchy. It didn't reveal flaky patches or make the thin skin under my eyes look wrinkly. It's difficult to evaluate the finish because it doesn't really match my skin tone. I would expect a powder that only comes in light or medium to be more neutral, but this has a noticeable yellow tone."
1,"I almost never had acne when I was in my teens. Mine didn't start until I was in my early/mid twenties. I went to the dermatologist then and my dermatologist recommended this lotion along with a soap with Salicylic Acid in it to help keep my skin clear. I've used both now for 20+ years and I rarely have break outs.I have oily skin for the most part so I almost never experience any drying from this lotion and since I'm now in my forties, I use something else around my eyes and for my neck but this works great for my face. I use it after showering, allow it to sink into my skin for about 10-15 minutes and then apply a base, then foundation.This seems like it keeps my skin bright as well as clear so my complexion doesn't get dull and it doesn't add shiny-ness to my face. In the winter, I sometimes supplement this lotion with something a bit more moisturizing but this is my primary face lotion for the rest of the year. It doesn't make me greasy and leaves my skin soft. I don't know what I would do without it because I've tried switching to more expensive brands but either they don't work as well or eventually my skin begins to break out again.A bottle of this lasts me a long time too so it's very inexpensive to use. It's a must have in my beauty routine. So long as they keep making it, I'm going to keep buying.One last thing: If you get breakouts on your back or shoulders or chest, this works great for those areas as well. Apply it, let it ""soak in"" for 10-15 minutes then apply a good sunscreen if you're going to be out in the sun for any length of time."
1,"I use this toner every night after I wash my face.  I've been using it for several months now and I see such a difference in my skin.  My pores look smaller and my skin even looks a little less red!  My skin is clearer and just looks brighter. My skin is more on the dry side and I don't find this toner drying at all.  I always moisturize after the toner had completely soaked into my skin and it's worked well for me.  My skin is also on the sensitive side and this hasn't irritated my skin at all.  As soon as I run out, I will purchase this product again, because I love it so much!"
1,"i haven't been too impressed. it's too waxy for my face, and the color is WAY too pink. i won't repurchase..."
1,"Yeah, so I randomly started breaking out on my chin and under my nose after not having to worry about acne for the last 10+ years.  Still don't know what is going on - but I think I have been using this cream and taking the pill (chewing it, as it suggests) for 4 days now, and the acne I had is gone or totally &#34;dried out&#34; and on it's way to being gone. And when I say dried out, I do not mean my skin is dry... the zits are just shrunken down. No new break-outs.To help you decide if this is for you:-I am 28, had acne as a teenager, and barely any since (until now for some reason).-I have an only T-zone (combination skin).-The amount of acne that diminished within the last 4-5 days was mild/moderate; I would say I had a tiny cluster of zits, one big one, and a few other random tiny ones in my lower T-zone area.-My skin has not been dry or oily from the cream.-The pill is chewable and doesn't really taste like anything; has the consistency of Tums (chalky) but much smaller.-The pill is to be taken twice daily.-I have not been using anything but face wash in combination with the cream (I use Earth Science gentle exfoliating scrub).I am always skeptical of things that get good reviews because for some reason they always end up not being as awesome as people say - but I am very pleased with this product. I will continue to buy as long as my skin is being a pain in the butt."
1,My esthetician recommended this product. Love how it makes my skin so soft. I apply it before my moisturizer every morning. Its amazing how different my face feels after using this product.
1,This nail polish remover works very well but I found it very weird that the picture has a free 2ounce polish remover on top of the big container and it does not even come with that. Looks like false advertisement lol.
1,"I used this facewash for a couple years and found it to be very nice for skin and with cleansing, took off makeup pretty well and was a nice mild scent. I only really stopped to switch to the oil cleanse method of face washing."
1,"I love this mascara.  I have been using it ever since Sarah-Michelle Gellar first hocked in 2000(?).  A friend of mine was in to Buffy the Vampire Slayer and soon, so was I.  I think Gellar is gorgeous, even though she's got an odd nose, and while she was Maybelline's spokesmodel, I tried just about anything she modeled.  This was the one product that has been faithful.  It goes on nicely, builds well, doesn't clump or make my lashes feel crispy.  I have tried many higher end mascaras (via Sephora's trial-sized mascara kit) and always come back to this.  I hope they never discontinue it or &#34;improve&#34; the formula."
1,"I've used this for the past few years and it's perfect.I've tried other drug store creams that do fancy things like anti-aging or helps with sun damage, tightening, brightening, etc.  They all irritated my skin or had little effect.  This cream moisturizes and gives me a very clean glow.  I don't feel greasy, there is no stinging, tingling or itching.  It's just moisturizer doing its thing.My skin type is pretty oily too, and I live in a hot, humid area.  Despite the weather and all that, this doesn't leave my face like an oil slick in the morning and I still feel clean and moisturized.  So if you have dry skin and you want to use this, just adjust the amount of cream you use accordingly.The lack of extras in this cream may be considered a negative to some people - look at it as an opportunity to use more intense products like serums on targeted areas.  Right now I'm just using some acne spot-treatment cream and a simple eye cream for hydration, and this clean cream allows those things to do their work without having conflicting chemicals.  I like it, I'm sure other people like that too.Totally recommend this product!"
1,"reminds me of the mid 90's for sure, when I first wore this in college, but still so glad it's being manufactured now so I can have a dose of summer year round. Love this fresh clean crisp summery scent."
1,"ok so first of all it has a VERY Strong odor. its not going to fade so don't worry about that.  when I first got it the smell was actually a little overwhelming but it has calmed down a little over the months.  this is a great product to relax with, this is not a good product to try to sleep with as it slides all over the place.  I am sure some people who sleep on their backs would love this but I sleep on my side so I am constantly doing a balancing act with it until I fall asleep.  For headaches or just general relaxation when you are laying on your back I highly advise!"
1,"This past New England winter has killed my hair! Frizz, breakage, it's tired of cold weather and dry heat blowing.This stuff has broughten it's life back! It's smooth again and my ends look better than ever! It's barely breaking even though the winter hasn't let up yet, but this stuff has made my hair better than before! ....and it smells amazing too!"
1,"I'd read a review about the anchors being strange, and indeed they are. But I was drilling directly into a stud, so I thought no problem.Then after I had the screws about 75% of the way in, one screw head actually twisted off! Never had that happen to me before. The metal was that soft. I thought it was a fluke and that one nail into the stud would be sufficient but the same thing happened with the other screw. I tried drilling them out with no success, screwing a regular screw into the top of the large hole with a washer to help anchor it, but then the mirror mount wouldn't fit on top with that in place. So I then hammered the top busted screw upwards and the lower one downwards, and hammered in a couple of small nails at the top of the big holes and I'm hoping for the best.The actual mirror is a large sizer than I've seen in hotel rooms - 8"" I believe - and is nice and clear. I am already enjoying it.Just use your own screws to enjoy a 5-minute install instead of a 45-minute one!"
1,I have very sensitive skin that is prone to redness and dryness. I've been using this as part of a skin care regime and so far it seems to be helping. It has a very light smell to it but its pleasant. Very light to wear and isn't greasy.
1,"I have the NARS duo eyeshadow in Kalahari.  The color on the left is described as a bronze pearl, while the right is a milk chocolate shimmer.  I use the left color all over, and *sometimes* I'll use the right color in the crease.  These colors are especially pretty over a golden eyeshadow primer.  No, they're not exciting ""WOW!"" colors, but I have big blue/green eyes that are my best feature, so using bright colors distracts away from the natural beauty of my eyes.  I can't pull off bright colors no matter how hard I try.  But the bronze pearl color in Kalahari enhance my eyes ever so nicely.  I've been using this compact for 5 months or so?  Hitting pan on the bronze pearl, and it looks like I've barely scratched the surface of the milk chocolate color.The eye shadow formula in the duo is different than what NARS uses in their single eyeshadows... the single eyeshadows are more powdery (eh, not thrilled), while the duo eyeshadows are silky.  So, I stick with buying NARS shadows in the duo compacts.  This eyeshadow glides onto my eyelid easily and never looks blotchy.  I don't get fallout or flakes coming off under my eyes, and minimal creasing, though I always use primer, makes the color of shadows show true on my (often red and irritated) eyelids.If there's a negative, it's that this eyeshadow formula only comes in the duo and I don't find myself using the milk chocolate color much at all.  I can't get that bronze pearl color in the Kalahari duo as a single e/s, I even asked NARS to be sure.  There isn't a matching color in the singles, and the singles aren't as silky.**Update**  I've been playing with Urban Decay's eyeshadows.... they have that silky texture I'm looking for, a joy to apply and blend with great color payoff.  In the pan, I thought Blaze was a close match to the NARS Kalahari bronze pearl, but Blaze is actually a touch more coppery when I apply it.  Still love Blaze though, goes great with my blue eyes.  Also have UD's Toasted, and that is a match for the NARS Kalahari bronze pearl, in my opinion.  Yeah!"
1,This is a nice moisturizing lotion but the smell is a little overwhelming. It triggered a migraine for me. I would not suggest this lotion to anyone who is sensitive to strong scents. Other than that I liked the lotion. May even buy again. I have to use it at night when my body will be under the covers to tone down the scent a little.
1,"This comb was not only reasonably priced, it delivered on it's claim; it's a great detangler. My daughter has very long hair that tangles easily and this is her go-to comb."
1,I used to break out in boils and get rashes underneath my breasts due to the hot humid weather in Florida.  I use this tea tree creme daily underneath my breasts and it helps keep my skin free from rashes and boils.  I used to have a reoccurring chronic problem with boils and the prescription medicines never completely cured my boil problem.  I started using this creme and I now have been boil free for over a year due to this product.  I highly recommend this product for boils and rashes.
1,"I discovered this at a local health foods store about six months ago, and I am so glad I did! It takes my makeup off perfectly, leaving none of it behind while also not stripping my face of natural oils. My skin doesn't feel tight and gross after I wash with this. This soap bar is also so perfect for washing makeup brushes! I get my brushes wet and swirl them around on the bar. It cleans them right up, and doesn't take forever either. This is definitely an item that I do not want to be without!"
1,"came in perfect condition at a very good price.  Would definitely recommend!  Mirror wasn't cracked, applicator was brand new.  And powder wasn't cracked."
1,"I like to try different hair treatment product, and it is my first time to try Neutrogena's hair product, and it is a good experience, good product, I think I will continue purchasing it."
0,"I generally do pretty well with Eucerin products, but unfortunately, this just wasn't it. When I first put it on, I noticed the smell, exactly like sunscreen, and my face (which is already pale) looked like a ghost. It turned my skin white! And I reeked of sunscreen.The biggest disappointment from this product was one of its ingredients: sulfate. If you are sensitive to sulfates in the smallest way, this product will definitely dry out your skin. My skin started flaking off after two weeks of using this lotion, and definitely improved when I stopped. Instead of moisturizing it like it claims to do, it did the complete opposite.Overall, this was disappointing. My skin looked flaky, white, and smelled like sunscreen. There are definitely better moisturizers out on the market."
1,"I like this mask a lot. I wanted something a little less drying than my purifying mint mask and since this has avocado in it I thought it would be a nice alternative. It's very nice and applies easily and my skin feels softer after I use it without feeling like it's stripped me of all moisture. Don't get me wrong, it's not the same effect as using a moisturizer or anything - you're still going to lose some moisture - but it's not nearly as drying as some masks I've used before."
1,"Great hair towel for curly-headed gals. I bought three of them and plan to get more! I highly recommend these over the deva towels and turbie towels, they are much larger and of a finer quality."
1,"I got this color in hope that I would FINALLY find a good dark blue that was just straight one color. Yoga-ta get this blue is FANTASTIC. it has great coverate, awesoeme durability, and it looks great. no ""hints"" of other colors. I am just so pleased with it. After I wore it for the first time, 5 of my friends have gone and purchased it as well."
1,"I used this soap and it left my skin very soft.  But it did make my skin dry and flakey.  I know this sounds odd, but that is what happened. It is a nice soap, but I wanted something a bit more moisturizing."
1,"After even a quick wash, my hair feels too squeaky and crispy. On one hand it can be an indication of the shampoo doing a good job cleansing the hair. On the other hand, it feels like it washes off all the oils that my scalp needs. When I dry my hair it looks too lifeless and just sticks up because it lacks any weight... I've never had my hair thinner. And yes, I use the conditioner of the same brand after every wash, but it doesn't help."
1,"I love this stuff, and have sworn by it for years now.  It's seriously the perfect deodorant in my opinion.  It keeps you dry and odor-free, the product is truly fragrance free, and does not leave residue on your clothing.  I can't think of any way to improve this product, it's perfect.  I'm sad that Walmart and Target stopped carrying it but so glad I can still find it on Amazon and at one local drugstore."
1,"The best non-toxic products by far, the honeysuckle fragrance is not available in the stores, it minimizes the chore of doing dishes.  My husband enjoys washing the dishes, because he likes the smell.  We're in the process of demolishing our kitchen, so a dishwasher won't be installed soon enough, but this liquid dish soap cleans, cuts grease, foams well with small drops, plus gives aromatherapy in the kitchen.  Meyer's cost more, but the concentrated product goes a very long way, great value."
1,I love this stuffI think it does soften some of my finer wrinkles and makes my skin supply but isn't a cure allThis is my second time buying this!
1,"My baby has mild eczema so I bath her with Cetaphil, followed by Aveeno bath oil, and then slather on Cetaphil cream.  The bath oil is on the runny side so it doesn't take much volume to cover her body while wet. The instructions say to lightly rinse off the excess oil after applying. I scoop water into my hand and gently pour it over her but it still feels like most of it is gone after the rinse.  I can't say I see a remarkable difference in whether I use this as part of her bath ritual or not. It certainly does not replace the need to slather on lotion after bathing. Regardless, it smells really pleasant and does seem to leave her skin a bit softer afterward so I will keep using it."
1,You gotta love Olay products. I always love Oil of Olay I just wish the pro x products were a little be cheaper.
1,This cream works great for wrinkles!  This is 10% potency which is what I use now but I started out using 5% first since it can make your skin 'tingle' if you aren't acclimated to it.
1,"*****I have three of these Nail-Tek Crystal files and really like each one of them. Of all of the various sizes, I like this long nail file the best. I prefer making longer strokes when I file my nails. This long one is 5 inches and the shorter one 3 inches (it's called a ""mini"" in some places). Both are useful. My actual favorite is the long one with the crystals as it is really fun and bling-y (but it costs more, too). All are nail files you'd enjoy using; it's just what you'd prefer.I love that these nail files, unlike many inexpensive glass/crystal nail files, have nice traction and are rough enough to actually file your nails instead of slip all over the place. They have a patented design specifically for natural nails; their web site says that the ""special patented surface seals and protects the free edge as you file and shape the nail."" They are gentle enough though so that your nails won't shred or split or peel or flake. I really like the case too, as it is hard and sturdy and will be easy to find in purses and bags, plus keep the file from breaking.They are easy to clean too--just run the file under a faucet as water will not damage it. It can be sterilized with heat (up to 483F), boiling water, alcohol and UVB lighting. They can even be put in the dishwasher to sterilize it.You just have to be careful not to drop them on a hard surface (like the floor), as they are glass and it could break. I did drop one once on a hardwood floor and it didn't break, but I think I was just lucky.They have a Lifetime Replacement Guarantee. The double-sided abrasive service never wears out. Who could ask for more than this?Highly recommended.*****"
1,I've tried most (including Perricone) and thisOlay moisturizer tops them all. The way it goeson and sinks into one's skin without beinggreasy is great.I have sensitive fair skin and it worksbeautifully for me.
1,"The mascara is okay, but this is a con.  I am not sure why it was listed as six.  I thought that it must have been a certain seller.  Well, do not order from A&G Cosmetics because the amounts of their products are not correct.  They knowingly use these ads, but they never intend to send the listed amounts.  I have had problems with them with more than one item."
1,"I loooooooove these pads!!! They changed my life!!! My skin has never looked better. I'm 30 yrs old with acne prone skin, these pads make my skin glow! I dont have a single pimple on my face not even when that time of the month rolls around. Will never be without it as long as PTR makes them!!!"
0,This does not do what it promises to do.  I did not notice anything when I applied the serum.  I am still on the search for a true firming and lifting cream or serum.
1,"this blush is the most amazing I've ever used.. it makes your cheeks look naturaly blushed, very good quality, long lasting"
1,So far so good! I'm happy with the results. My skin is not really oily since I've used this. Like this product
1,i have scleroderma so my cuticles dry out easily.  this keeps them soft and easy to manicure.  it's the best cuticle oil i've found and does not irritate as some have.  definitely recommended.
1,"I am a few years post menopausal.  I had been struggling with poor sleep, night sweats and hot flashes for years.  I was hoping to 'wait them out'  However I finally decided to try this cream and the results have been fantastic.  I've been using the cream for 3 months.  I do not have hot flashes any more.  I do not have night sweats. My sleep has improved dramatically - in other words, I sleep as well as I did prior to menopause, which would normally be between 6-9 hours a night.  Unfortunately the cream does not alleviate stress  :).  I find the product very easy to use with no adverse side effects.  I feel 'normal'  again.  If you are wondering if this product will work for you, buy a tube and give it a try.  It's inexpensive enough that it won't be a big loss if it doesn't.  I buy the 4 oz tube which lasts about 2 months."
1,Great curling iron!  It heats up very fast and can heat up very hot.  You can't beat it for the price.Wish the cord was a little longer but that's easily fixed with an extension cord.Just as good if not better then the expensive one I previously had.
1,"I really like this color, I was looking for the &#34;in&#34; color for the season and this is a very nice one. Looks good! I recommend it."
1,"Love bare Minerals foundation and will use nothing else but this brush loses its softness and gets saturated with product in a short time, and when cleaned the bristles start falling out. I use several other brushes including my fave a Japanese kabuki but BM RECOMMENDS using this brush so I have replaced about every 3 months probably for the best to avoid bacteria transfer like mascara.Reason for my review: This Amazon add on is a fantastic deal :)"
1,"this is too pigmented. it corrects the redness well, and i top it with yellow concealor, but the GREEN SHOWS THROUGH. it looks alien-ish."
1,"I have been using Purity Made Simple in conjunction with other Philosophy products such as Hope in a Jar and Microdelivery Peel for years, gosh over a decade.  I have strayed a few times but always come back. Nothing else cleans the makeup off my face but still keeps it soft.  It is gentle and moisturizing.  I always get compliments on my ""glowing"" :) skin. I hardly ever get any blemishes. If I do its because of something I ate (dairy, or red meat). It might be genetics but I definitely think these products don't hurt either."
1,"everytime i wear this, i get compliments throughout the day.  long after i've stopped smelling the aroma, others around me still do. it's not a strong scent, it's just enough.  i've had so many inquiries as to ""what are you wearing?"".  i love that it takes on a slightly different smell to whomever is wearing it. makes me feel a bit unique."
1,"I had this remover a few years ago and after trying many kinds, I had to repurchase this. It works so well and doesn't sting my eyes. It's the only thing I've tried that actually takes off mascara (besides olive oil)"
1,"I love this powder.  I use the derma blend cover creme in a beige shade, and I use the original (white) powder, which is supposed to be used on all colors as a translucent powder. It does work like that!I love it, because it gives a ""glow"" like I am lit up on the inside of my flawless face (a.k.a. imperceptible cover creme mask).  Even if I wasn't using cover creme, I'd use this powder.Keeps it matte and aglow all day for 16 hours, and prevents rub off and wear off.You gotta dust off the excess powder with a brush after 2 minutes or it will be noticeable in some areas.Won't break you out; won't dry you out; absorbs oil; you look just as good at the end of the day as you did when just applied it.Great price for quality product & amount - lasts a few months.I used to use the BareMinerals line before I broke out with a severe case of cystic acne (due to a hormonal imbalance, not the makeup).  Now I have high contrast hyper pigmentation and scars, so I switched to the Dermablend line for serious coverage.  People used to say my skin ""glowed"" with BareMinerals Mineral Veil, but with the Dermablend setting powder the glow is better, more luminous, more long lasting - fabulous (when applied properly).1 drawback - I love the puff that it comes with, and want a new puff, but I can't find the same powder puff.  Wish they'd offer that in their derma blend makeup applicator line."
1,"This is a heavenly, clean smell that I will continue to use forever -  and it's true, a little touch of it is all you need and it lasts all day!"
1,"I live in a very sunny desert area, and this lotion has worked great as my daily UV protection.  Does not make your face look greasy, and has no scent, so folks cannot even tell I have it on.  When I used it in a more humid environment, however, it did sweat off into my eyes fairly readily. So not recommended as your primary protection for sports or swimming, and be ready for it to sweat off and sting your eyes in more hot and humid climes.  But for drier areas, works great."
0,"I wanted to love Auric Blends, based on everything I had read and accidently stumbling onto their perfume oils here I decided to order three different scents, based on their website descriptions. This scent, Black Opium is decent, I suppose but only by comparison with the others that were horrible failures Majik, and Egyptian Goddess. This is the only scent that actually smells okay and stays on you for a few hours. I had hopes of ordering 5-6 others but based on these three, I will not be buying anymore Auric Blends."
1,"The smell is so good the lemon fragrance change my mood in a second, so I knew this will be a great addition to my  ingredients for my hair proud  line ask well my lotion.I recommend it."
0,"the expensive one I purchased at Sally's fell apart after several years so I had to replace it.  This looked similar but it is NOT like the one I purchased a few years ago.  This is made of very cheap thin aluminum and I can't get the pieces together.  It comes with 2 screws but the holes are not large enough to screw in so maybe Heman can come and put this together for me.  it's a cheap piece of crap lol.  All of that could be forgiven BUT when I put my hair dryer in it, the whole thing tips over.  It's not the base that is the problem it's the &#34;flexible hose&#34; part is not strong enough ...I REALLY need to start reading these reviews...."
0,"This is a nice lotion but I think it is a little heavy for the face.  I do like it on my neck and shoulders.  As I get older, lotions with SPF sometimes don't absorb the way I hope they will.  I'm sure many others will love this."
1,"When this is applied, it is a beautiful light mauve, not the purple it looks in the bottle. I have gotten several compliments on it. It's a great cool colored neutral to wear with anything from casual to dressy. It is also a very romantic color, and would be great for summer (although I would not hesitate to wear it year round.) It also would be perfect for prom. It goes on evenly, doesn't clump up, and dries to a nice gloss. I will reorder more of this color while it is still available. Do a search on the internet of this color name and you can see multiple examples under images of how this looks on the nails. It is not a color just for young girls, but is very pretty on mature hands as well. Beautiful!"
1,I am a natural girl and i LOVEEE using this on my wet hair to detangle and smooth out my ends. I would of course never use it on dry or even lightly dampened curly curly hair. But it does wonders and really allows each curl to be defined and curled. it's sturdy and feels like it will never break ever...CONS: the denman gold lettering has began to smudge off :( i liked that little added decoration. haha
1,"I love this polish. Usually I hate polish from Essie & their brushes are too skinny. This nude was easy to apply, didn't streak, & I only used two coats. Beautiful. So far I'm on day 2/3 & no chipping has occured. This is a must buy. "")"
1,"I bough it because my main problem was a itchy legs after taking a shower. I searched on the web and lot of people have same problem and lots of them put baby oil after a shower. What I do is this: I take a shower, when finished I close the water and I apply oil all over my body, including under arm, between legs, tummy, butt... And with a touching movements with my towel I remove the excess of water. I don't rub on my to keep the oil on. I get dress as normal. I do this with my 2 years old toddler. One massage persontold me is better to apply oil on our body after a shower/bath because our bodies are warm and lotion is cold, so is better to apply oil which is not cold as lotion. Recommended.... :) As a prime mom I get 20% off when subscribed to 5 or more items to receive every month. I get diapers, wipes, organic chia seeds, deodorant, this oil, toilet paper and I get 20% off.... what a good deal."
1,"I've been using this for acne for about 7 years, it is great. It makes all my acne go away and it is completely inexpensive. The only bad thing is that it bleaches some of my clothes and pillow cases so I only wear it when I'm at home and have something white on or something that I don't mind if it gets stained. But overall it works great!"
1,I wont ever be without this again! I'm 28 and just starting my anti-aging regime. i love how moisturizing this is on my dry skin. Not to mention that it has diminished most of the dark spots i have from acne outbreaks. I love it. I also use it under my eyes because it doesnt sting like other products might.
0,This came off in about an hour. Added another coat. Same story. Don't bother with this. Save your money honey.
1,"I read other reviews that this was a nice product and crossed my fingers -- am I glad I did! I just received it and used for the first time, but I must say, it feels great, and the fragrance is absolutely unbelievable. It's not strong, but it's like I just brought in a bouquet of fresh lilacs from the lilac bush outside! Beautiful. No powdery undertones, no greasy feeling on the hands -- just perfect. It's February, but my hands smell like Spring! (And they feel better!) I highly recommend -- it's only been on my hands for about an hour, but the fragrance is still there, not overpowering, and really, really perfect. Will update review if necessary. But for now, all thumbs up! (I guess that should be &#34;both&#34; thumbs up...)"
1,"The color is more salmon than it looked on screen. Would be perfect if it was a little more pink. Of course it's impossible to find the perfect shade online, but my local stores are never well stocked.It's matte, like a satin finish with no hint of sparkle, shine or gloss without a top coat. It looks a little juvenile, like taffy.Like many Essie colors, it's opaque in one coat. Dries Fast. Amazing.ONE COAT is all is takes, but if that isn't enough for you, it won't take more than two which is all you need for a good manicure. I did not get a single streak, it is not lumpy, just be sure you put it on fast and don't hesitate. Like I said, it dries fast."
0,"I have very long hair, well past mid-back but not quite to my waist. So, the majority of you with shorter hair will likely have different results that I did. But, this brush immediately tangled for me. And my hair got so entwined and stuck in this brush it took about three minutes for me to untangle it and free myself from the brush. The bristles weren't the main driver, it was the small seam between the plastic handle and plastic tip, and the metal body. Very surprising that these aren't sealed better to prevent this. Once my hair got tangled in those gaps, it inevitably got tangled in the bristles too. Maybe I just got a bad one, but really can't recommend this for those with long hair :("
1,"All my life I've heard about how horrible mineral oil is so I've just avoided it. It turns out my skin loves the stuff. I started washing my face with this after using a cream wash overseas that I could not find in the US. I had noticed that some eczema which I could not get to clear up started getting better after using cleansing cream as my face wash. I was put out by the heavy rose geranium scent (though if they use rose geranium oil it's probably not so bad for the skin), but I find this does a great job of dissolving makeup and grease while leaving my skin soft.I've tried the oil cleansing method before with a lot of success so I understand how oil can clean the skin well. However, I found the oil cleansing method to much trouble to keep up with. Cleansing cream dissolves just a little faster and easier and requires less heat on my face, which is good.I find just rubbing this in is pleasant, and then washing it off with a warm rag is good enough to leave my skin very clean but soft.I have not seen any increase in breakouts after using this, myself. I'm very happy with the product and see why it's been around so long."
1,"I love this treatment. It works so well with my hair, and it always feels so moisturized and soft after I use it. What a difference! It's a conditioning and a protein treatment all in one! LOVE!"
1,"I think this product is much better than metamucil, but I just can't make myself use it consistently.  I don't like to spoil something like o.j. by putting it in that, even tho it is tasteless.  Drinking it with water is just beyond my ability to do consistently...maybe I'll keep trying, as this is a big container, and I do need the fiber."
1,I got the smaller size and we went through it quick! we loved it so we got the bigger size. it is liquidy but it is effective. I don't have dryness or oiliness...I love that its all natural. I have actually switched all my products to natural and my skin has improved very much.
0,"DEFINITELY READ ALL THE BAD REVIEWS FIRST BEFORE GETTING TRICKED INTO BUYING THIS OILWish I did because I had the exact same problems after getting mine. I usually do always read a couple bad reviews before buying to check out the pros and cons but I ordered this one half asleep.The actual jojoba oil shown on this page is a great oil for your skin but the Jojoba oil I ordered from one of the sellers on here named Livamed sent the oil a lot later after the 1st was lost in the mail plus the oil WAS NOT ORGANIC and PROBABLY not jojoba, or completely jojoba, it smelled like it had been mixed with cocoa butter or something else. Real joboba oil hardly has any smell at all to it this bottle had a strong nutty smell, plus there was no safety seal on it.I went shopping for ORGANIC jojoba oil (not NATURAL jojoba but organic- there's a huge difference) just like the page is showing it's supposed to be, with the organic seal shown on the bottle in the picture at the top of this page. The bottle sent by Livamed does not have an organic seal on it at all which means it was not organic. I doubt it was even pure jojoba oil. There was no seal on the top of the bottle so anyone could've added something else to it to fill up the 4 ounces.  That's false advertising. I threw the bottle out since I dont know whats really in it.If you read the rest of the 1 and 2 star reviews on here they all had the exact same problem. One reviewer who had the same problem, called the company, gave the batch number and found out that not only is the oil not organic but Amazon is not even authorized to sell it."
1,This is definitely my favorite lotion.I apply this at night after I shower and my skin is still silky smooth the entire next day.Does not feel greasy or oily.Recommended!
1,If you like synthetic cotton candy and pink sugar this is for you! You can use as body spray or room spray. The bottle is huge and I love the pink.
1,"I have mature sensitive skin and  was a bit hesitant about trying this product. No problems . . . I use a gentle foam type cleanser and splash rinse with cool water. Gently pat dry and apply cream ( do not use around eyes). Place a small (little finger tip size) amount in palm of hand and gently finger tap into skin. This is a new addition to my skin care routine and it can be used under your usual night time moisturizer.I use Freeman Cucumber Peel Mask and Pomegranate Peel Mask in the morning (alternate every other day) and a 'Smoothies' for what was that deep crease between the brow line (no possibility of getting anything in my eyes).The great thing is that all the products are available with Amazon prime . . . even the body cleanser and lotions. I admit it! I do not enjoy 'real' shopping.As with any new skin care product, be sure to read the directions and do a 'patch test.' Retinol can cause irritation. Certainly worth trying![68 years old and daily time total for skin care is 20 minutes or less.]"
0,Alot of hairdressers claim that loreal is one of the harshest dyes to use on your hair. Evidence of that was in my family when both my brother and sister with continued use of this started having major hair loss. They stopped using it and there hair loss stopped also. you be the judge.
1,"As compared to other brands, the amount of scrub is less.  This one has only 4.2 oz, as compared to others that are at least 5 oz.  Feels oily, even though states ""Oil-free"".  Smell is ok, but Clean & Clear Morning Burst is a bit more exciting."
1,"it covers really well n feels smooth i set it with powder and it lasts all day :)but i think it was used because the bottle was kinda dirty with the foundation its self. And it has stickers that said ""new"" and they were like half way peeled off soo that was a downside :("
1,this product was just what was required it met all my needs and i would happily recommend this item to any of my friends. Thank you for a great item
1,"The color is perfect, not too light not too strong. Just some definition with a hint of gold sparkle. My skin tone is fair w/ light freckles and warm chocolate brown hair."
1,"I love this so much!This mask is everything I was looking for: thick, not too pungent, great ingredients, and best of all, IT WORKS!I use this mask whenever I've had a long day and I know the oil/dirt buildup on my skin is a lot or if I fell asleep the night before and was too lazy and tired to wash my face.You simply apply it, let it dry, rinse, then continue to wash your face with you normal cleanse.I paired this mask along with the Freeman Pineapple Enzyme mask (which smells amazing might I add!) and with my normal Neutrogena cleanser/toner and together they have brought my skin (which was blemished and damaged) back to life.I truly love this and recommend this to anyone whose skin easily gets oily just like mine."
1,this def. helped my shedding with the two step protein treatment and a little really does go a long way so maybe its a keeper we'll see if it stops my shedding all together
1,I do add a couple drops of tea tree oil to mine because I have oily acne prone skin. This really helps to keep my skin clear. I'm on my second bottle.
1,This polish lasts forever compared to other brands. I love it. I will definately stay with this brand. This is a great color forany season.
1,"I am not sure if it works or going to work.  The only problem I have with the product is I don't like taking vitamins all day.  I prefer to take vitamins and supplements in the morning and be done with it.  This product requires you take it morning, noon, and evening a no go in my book, all because I have a bad habit of forgetting to take them or just don't feel like so it is best that I go back to my original hair vitamins.  I will finish the bottle because I bought it but afterwards I will go back to my other hair vitamins that has worked for me.  If you want to try it go for it if it works stick with it.  I give it 4 stars because I do believe when I finish the bottle I will see results and that is what you look for when you buy products is results so if you are okay with 3 vitamins a day and are more committed to the direction buy this product and enjoy."
1,Arrived on time but the color was a little darker than I thought it would be.I will try again in a lighter color.
1,"This brush is nicely balanced. I like that it has the metal under the bristles that will hold the heat to help style my hair when blow drying.  I can get my hair straighter with this brush! The bristles are fabulous! Soft but feel good on the scalp, protected ends as not to tare your hair or your scalp.  Excellent brush!!!"
0,"I bought these SPECIFICALLY to avoid &#34;raccoon eyes,&#34; and after just two uses I looked like I was some comedic movie character who fell asleep on the beach and someone played a prank on me. It was seriously so obvious and embarrassing I had to tan a few more times without goggles (which I NEVER do) just to even things out a little bit. I did myself a BIG FAVOR and ended up buying the Wink Ease sticker goggles, which are amaaaaaazing - although they can be slightly prices since you only get 3-6 uses out of each pair before the sticky properties wear off."
0,"August 28, 2012I just threw away my second brush.  The replacement brush lasted only four months.  I love this brush, but it should last longer than eight or four months.  I am looking for another brand, but it makes me sad.  This is the best brush I have ever used, but two brushes in one year worn to uselessness is just too much.  I cannot understand the problem, but it seems to me it is how the bristles are attached to the padding.  The balls break off and then the whole bristle pushes into the padding.May 17, 2012  Updated Review:Half the end balls were gone and the entire center of the brush have broken off.  It lasted eight months.  I have just retired it and started the replacement they sent me when I emailed them that the balls were disappearing at a fast rate.  Good brush, good company, very short lifetime of use.January 31, 2012, Updated Review:I took the suggestion of a person who commented on my review and emailed the company.  Within five days I had a new brush in the mail.  Wow!  I am so impressed with the Phillips company.  Few companies just make it right anymore.  I would suggest buying Phillips company products because not only do they make great products, they stand behind and make any problems right.  I wish more companies had this old fashioned ethic.December 31, 2011 Original Review:I adored this brush and still like it very much.  I have never had a brush I liked so very much.  Unfortunately, I am already losing the balls on the ends of the brush that keep the bristles from scratching.  I have had it four months and have lost three end balls.  I think that by the time I have had it a year I will have lost at least 12 end balls.  I am severely disappointed and surprised about this.  So maybe another brush would be a better choice."
0,"I got the lightest color and it is still to dark for my skin.. Looks almost orange on my face. I had high hopes for this product, but was highly disappointed instead."
1,"Great coverage for minor facial imperfections. This stuff is great. I also use it to cover up recent scars on my lower legs when wearing shorts. It lasts several hours. You really must also use the special Bare Minerals application brush, it works better than any other brush."
1,I use this leave in after washing my hair and seal with an oil. It softens my hair making it easier to comb; I wouldn't consider this a great detangling solution but it does work well with softening. I also use this almost every other day when moisturizing and sealing - it works great in this scenario as well.*IMPORTANT*This leave-in has a watery consistency. It comes in the standard squeeze bottle so I highly recommend putting it into a spray bottle for ease of application and product conservation.I would recommend this to any that are looking for a leave-in that works and improves hair texture.
1,The Neutrogena Body Oil is very light. I use this when I get out of the shower and within minutes it is absorbed into my skin and my skin is hydrated through out the day. My skin does not feel oily or greasy just soft and smooth. I love that this oil is very lighly scented and does not interfere with my perfume or body spray.
1,"i ordered this and started applying it immediately. My nails are already longer. Awesome product came 2 days after i ordered it, and i would definately reccomend it to someone else."
1,"This is the first product I use in my regime; I follow up with Neutrogena On-The-Spot Acne Treatment Vanishing Cream and then Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisturizer. I did a lot of research on products and I found this to be the best on the market (that of course is on the cheaper side). It is free of many of the chemicals that should NOT be in a cleanser and it is definitely a great buy. I do not buy this on Amazon, I usually just buy it at my local Walmart and buy one at a time, though buying it on here in bulk might not be a bad idea. When I go to the store I'll pay about $5 for just one, so it seems that a pack of 3 on here is overly priced. But anyways, it is a great product that does what is needs to do, clean the dirt off my face! I have sensitive skin so this is a great cleaner that doesn't turn my face red or anything. Also just a tip, I did a lot of research and if you didn't know, you are supposed to splash your face with warm water to open up your pores, dispense the cleanser in your hands and wash for 30-45 seconds, and rinse again with warm water. Be sure when you dry off your face you are NOT wiping your face, you need to pat it gently and let it air-dry for at least 5 minutes before you apply anything else to your face. When using this product once a day, maybe sometimes twice, it lasted me about 4 1/2 months, WOW! For $5, that sure is worth the money. So overall, a great buy, might suggest you buy them at your local Walmart because it seems to be cheaper than buying in bulk."
1,"Mrs. Meyers is the only dish soap I can use that doesn't dry my hands -- this winter is the first since I started doing dishes that I don't have cracked, bleeding hands! I have tried plenty of natural dish soaps, but only Mrs. Meyers is this ""skin-friendly"". The lovely, sweet scent is an added bonus (usually, I have to use unscented products)."
1,"This stuff is a miracle. I have incredibly dry skin from eczema and allergies. Winter is pretty awful for me. My skin, especially my legs, get very dry and itchy. Then I scratch and they hurt. Then I put lotion on and they sting. And I've tried everything, having particular luck with colloidal oatmeal lotions, but they weren't perfect.But this has been a godsend.Even though I use Cetaphil face wash, I would have never thought to try this out but received it in a package of products from Allure called the Allure Beauty Box. After my first use I was in love.It's thick, feels nice going on, doesn't burn, and kept my skin unbelievably healthy. I haven't scratched my legs once all winter for the first time in 25 years. Seriously unbelievable.I can't recommend this enough. Really does what it says!"
1,Essie polish is hard to beat and this color is so hard to beat.  It goes from jeans to an evening gown with no trouble and it lasts well.  Definitely recommended.  Be sure to add a top coat to keep it looking fresh.
1,"This product has a very nice scent and I use it as a natural air freshener. I originally got it to use as a toner and to add to my face masks, but it is nothing special for either. it is the same as using regular water. so it is useless as a toner, but nice for a natural fragrance."
1,"I've been using this on and off from age 18-28. I don't have any wrinkles, and actually have oily skin, but I've always liked how it made my skin feel, and I'm quite picky about moisturizers. However, I've transitioned most of my personal care and beauty products to be free of parabens and other ingredients recognized as harmful by the EWG- Environmental Working Group. I wish they would update their formula to not use parabens!"
1,"I have been using this product for the past few months and my complexion has improved greatly. I love that it's all natural and alcohol-free. The price is affordable and the toner lasts for a few months with constant use. I usually apply the toner to my face, neck, chest and upper back using a cotton swab. I have to say it has also started to help some of blemish marks heal, especially the ones on my face.Other reviewers said that this product helped fight acne when used alone, but I haven't seen that. In fact, I stopped using my usual acne wash and lotion for a month and I broke out severely. This toner reduces the redness and my face doesn't look as blotchy, but alone it did not stop the pimples from forming. Although, I have noticed that my pores are smaller and my skin looks more even than before I started using this toner.It also works well on bruises. Normally, my bruises stay for weeks and slowly make that awful transition from dark blue to green to orange to healed, but with this I've noticed that my bruises heal within days with daily application.I definitely recommend this product to all skin types."
1,Neutrogena produces the best beauty and health products without a doubt. This product has worked wonders for my skin. I will continue to use it for a long time.
1,Great product which blends perfectly with my skin and hair tones.  Leaves soft highlights that look natural and lasts all day.  Shipped quickly.
1,"Nothing special about these gloves.  They work fine and exfoliate well.  Same as you would find in a retail store.  Go for whatever is cheaper, or if you are like me, order from Amazon because you keep forgetting every time you go to the darn store."
1,I keep these in my makeup bag and use them as needed. Great if you smudge a little eyeliner or get a mascara fleck on your cheek or something. I recommend every girl keeping these in her makeup bag :-)
1,"This stuff worked wonders for me on controlling my oily skin. Skin was smooth and fresh. I mainly bought it to control my acne but I can't say that it helped my acne that much. I'm 30 years old with oily, acne prone skin and this came highly recommended. It just didn't do it for me... at all. If you have super stubborn skin & cystic acne, you may need something more."
1,"I love Penny Lane. Oh my I love it. I'm fair skinned and I put this on my apples and orgasm on my cheek bones (round face, so I have both). LOVE."
1,"I love this scrub!  It has a pumpkin spice smell (which you wouldn't expect from citrus scrub, but it's very pleasant) and, as another reviewer mentioned, a little goes a long way.  You just mix a little of the paste with water and scrub away, so you're definately get your moneys worth.  My skin always glows after using it, and I use it about three times a week (give or take).  I highly recommend it, especially if your are debating between this and the Lemon Poppyseed Scrub, I like this one better."
1,I have used this powder for years. It works so well with the dermablend quick fix concealer I use.  It goes on light and lasts for hours. Well worth the money.
1,What a fabulous product!  Very light and smooth and makes my skin look so healthy!  It just feels so wondeful smoothing it on my face - fresh and clean!  I use only Olay products and always will.
1,I use this because lately my skin has been very dry and it is also sensitive.  Some body washes irritate my skin and leave it red.  This aveeno leaves it nice and moisturized without irritating it.
1,"I have been using Philosophy for about a year now, I ran out of my Cleaner and tried another brand .... Never again I cant live with out my Philosophy Purity Made Simple One - Step Facial Cleaner it is worth every penny. Thank you Philosophy."
1,"Need three coats, but easy to apply. The color is different. Depending on the angle and light, it can look like a white frost, a silver frost, a champagne frost, or a gold frost. The variation isn't a problem for me. The problem is that sometimes it almost looks like white paint that has yellowed...if that makes sense. Or like natural nails that have yellowed with a coat of very sheer polish on top so that they shine but you can still see the yellow tone underneath. I do love Essie; it's my absolute favorite brand hands down. I'm just not really sold on this color. (I have fair skin that is neutral in tone. I'm not sure if it would look better on warmer and/or darker skin; I'm thinking probably not. Possibly cooler skin?)Anyway, I found some good reviews on it on the net, which is why I purchased, so you never know. I've also found people who agree with my assessment. It may highly depend on your skin tone whether you can pull it off (which isn't so unusual in nail polish)."
1,"I have an overlapping toe problem. To the point that if I play 18 holes of golf, by the end of it I have a blister where my crooked toe rubs against the other.When I first got this straightener, I could only wear it for 5-10 minutes at a time. For months I questioned it's effectiveness. Was I wasting my time? Was this thing doing any good?  Still I kept trying to wear it for longer and longer periods of time. Now I can wear it for just over 3 hours. The best news of all: my toe is getting straighter! I wear it inside my golf shoes now and even in my running shoes. I can't wear it through the night yet because after 3 hours I wake up from it. Not that the pain in unbearable or anything like that, it's only a slight pain but it's enough to wake me up. My goal is to keep doing what I'm doing and work up to being able to wear it for 8 hours at a time. Once I get to the point where I can sleep with it on, I think I will be set.Long story short, it works! But you have to be diligent and keep at it. It took me months of wearing it before I finally notice my toe was indeed getting straighter.Good luck, my fellow toe sufferers!"
1,"I'm In love with this amber butter. I want more. I need more. I can't stop smelling it and myself.I wish I had a gallon of it. It came fast and the container is nice.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE."
1,"I love this stuff. I use it as a facial lotion. This tub has lasted me over a year and I use it on a daily basis. I have extremely sensitive skin and this lotion hasn't irritated my face at all. It also has NO smell at all, no weird chemical smells or anything. It goes on a tad bit greasy if you use too much, but it quickly absorbs. It also doesn't irritate my acne. When I don't use this product, my face gets really dry like it usually does, but it works great when I use it. If I had to pick a con, it would be that I hate that this product is in a tub.....since it lasts so long, I don't like the thought of dipping my hands into a tub, it feels unsanitary. If you accidentally forget to put the lid on, the product gets hard at the top......either way, whatever. It still works great."
1,"I've used this for years first thing in the morning instead of washing my face, which I do at night.  I have never had any adverse reaction and my skin is sensitive.  I see some reviews fussing about the small 14% amount of alcohol, but it has never bothered me nor stung when applied.  It cleans a little tones and doesn't leave my face tight at all."
1,"I really, REALLY like Mrs. Meyer's basil hand soap. I love the price point and ingredients. I like the (semi-masculine/unisex) scent and packaging a lot. It's not overly drying and very much appropriate any place in the home. This is one of my top 5 hand soaps!"
1,Great Hair dyer. It works for all of our family with no complaints. We have hair ranging from short to long thin to thick. The extra attachments are nice as well. no complaints from this family.
1,I've tried many face lotions but seems like I have to apply more than once to get the effect that I like. With this product all I have to do is apply once and I'm good for the whole day. Recommend this face lotion its the best!!!
1,"By itself, this nail color is a bit streaky as are most sheers, but as recommended on Essie's website, a coat of Vanity Fairest followed by a coat of Essie's Mademoiselle and a topcoat creates a nice, clean look. I wear this combination all the time and get a lot of compliments on my nails. It stays nice for about a week without touch up."
0,"As a young adult, I have acne-prone skin with some enlarged pores around around my nose. I bought this hoping it would help clear me up, when, in fact, it did quite the opposite. When I first squeezed some into my hand I noticed that it had a very chemically odor. After I used it and rinsed my face, as soon as I opened my eyes they burned like I had just been rubbing peppers on them, so I rinsed, rinsed, rinsed some more until the burning stopped. My face felt clean, but smelled like chemicals, and in the morning I woke up with a few new zits. I wasn't sure the cleanser was causing the breakout, so I kept using it. I slowly developed terrible acne and had to stop using it. About a week after I did, I was back to normal. I gave this cleanser to my sister to try and she had very good results, but stopped using it because she was concerned about the chemical odor. I would not recommend a product that has the potential to cause the problems I experienced."
1,"OPI nail polish is my absolute favorite!The color for this nail polish was more in the pink family than purple. Nevertheless,it comes out beautifully."
1,"I think this is great for the skin,  I use it  2 times a day in the morning and at night time. It speeds cell recovery and heals your skin, just dont put t much on your face. To end this review all I have to say is that this product is good for just about any skin problem."
1,I don't really like the smell of this... at all. Actually its horrible but it is the one thing that will help scalp build up or dandruff almost immediately so its worth the nasty smell.
1,This night cream is amazingly smooth. My face feels moisturized but not oily. It smells so good and I can honestly say that I have seen the wrinkles on my forehead smooth out. I love it!!!
1,I use this frequently at night.  Then wash off in the morning.  It does have just a little burning sensation.  After 30 minutes to an hour I layer a face lotion (with a little almond oil) on top for hydration.  I feel this  keeps my skin looking fresh and smooth.
1,"I dug this stuff out from under my cabinet...I had vowed never to use Clean and Clear again after my disaster breakout with the blackhead cleanser. But since this had no beads to irritate my skin, I decided to give it a try and it really worked!! 2 days after putting it on once or twice daily, I could see breakouts that were starting to come had faded, and my blackheads were actually disappearing from my nose! There's a little bit of a stingy feeling, and if you get it in your eyes it hurts like a bitch, and your face is pretty red afterward, I'm assuming from the chemical contents. But it makes your skin smooth as a baby's bottom if you use it everyday, so your skin has a daily regimen and can fight breakouts. I highly recommend and will be back to buy more&lt;3 I'm a 15 year old girl if that helps."
0,"I think this is because Dena Alcohol is one of the main ingredients listed in it formula and it really does irritates my eyes. hope that they would make an alcohol free eye products, because the same irritation I feel it whenver I put the Master Drama eyeline on my inner rim."
1,"I love this scent and would probably buy again.  However, I am only guessing because it is just a toilette spray, the scent does not last as long as I would like it to that is why I gave it 4 stars.  The price was right and delivery was fast."
1,"This handcream is divine- it makes my hands really soft and it smells incredible. My favorite scent is Camille, but the others I tried also smelled pretty good."
0,"I wonder why have they allowed this thing to be on the shelf. Please try this product but a slight brush on ur nail and , u wud have hatred towards it. thankfully i tried it before trying it on my child. I think better is trying to encourage your child out of it.I wonder why isnt there negative rating"
1,"Instant Heat Curling Iron, 1 1/2-Inch it work"
0,"I don't know why everyone is complaining about the faint smell. Yes, it is faint when you open the bottle cap and sniff it. Once you dab it on you - just a quarter size and let it sit and go into your skin, the fragrance will start to grow. Initially when you first buy the perfume, you may need to put on about 12"" of it on your body to detect the scent. Then go out for a day or so (walk around in the fresh air) and you'll start to notice the scent. After your nose can delineate between the fresh air and the scent, you'll notice that the scent is actually quite strong. Later, just a dab will last you 48 hours - through showers and repeated hand washing / dish washing.This fragrance reminds me of my Kindergarten teachers and older women in their late 30s up to 60s wearing this stuff. This is definitely not for women in their 20s, as it smells too ""motherly"" and ""married."" It's a comforting, sweet scent, but it smells old, as in a popular scent that we grew up with when we were little, so it lends itself as an older woman scent from the last generation."
1,"When our daughter had surgery last fall, she wasn't able to stand long enough to shower, and had gauze dressings that couldn't get wet.  I had been sponge bathing her, but her long hair desperately needed washing.  I picked up a bottle of this no-rinse shampoo at Walmart.I was able to massage it through her hair and then towel it dry, and get a comb through her matted hair.  It did remove most of the oil and made her hair smell better, although of course it wasn't as nice as an actual shampoo.  However, when you don't have a choice about being able to shower, this is a good option.  She felt better just having her hair somewhat clean and brushed after a week of lying there.I would recommend this if you are caring for someone who can't take a regular shower or bath, but wouldn't recommend it for a way to skip shampooing if you're able to shampoo."
1,"Like most people, I was sucked in by the cheesy name. The blush provides a nice glow a little more on the coral/pink side than posie/pink like it may seem from the photo. Wears well all evening and, true to name, gives a nice iridescent orgasmic glow ;-)."
1,Love the way this parfum smells.  It is the best and this is the best deal on amazon.  This is the only place I will buy parfume from.
1,"I really love this color, its so classy and classic, looks great on the toes and fingers, don't hesitate to add this color to your collection. It is not like any of the reds I already had."
0,"I tried using this with almost every nail polish I have.... and no matter what, it would not work!!! My nail polish last MUCH longer with no base coat!!!! This stuff seems to make the nail polish come off faster! :'( very disappointed I wasted my money on this"
1,Product is not greasy and has a nice tint to it. Works great under my makeup and doesn't feel greasy or look shiny.
1,"I tried this out yesterday and WOW. My skin felt much cleaner, and a lot of the redness on my cheeks and chin disappeared too! The only downside was that it was a little hard to clean off; I had to use my toner afterwards to get rid of all of it, and I didn't see any real reduction in the size of my pores (you can't actually reduce pore size, but if they are very clogged they'll look bigger). It's very smooth compared to other clay masks I've tried, and goes on quite thick so you don't need very much of it. It also will pull any pimples that are forming to the surface, so it might look like you're breaking out; actually, it's just speeding the process along, and if you're using a good topical treatment they should heal faster. (I would personally recommend the Clean & Clear Persa-Gel and the Popped Pimple Relief Gel Pen; the Persa-Gel really helps to speed up the healing process and the Popped Pimple Relief Gel reduces redness and any pain you might suffer from pimples around the nose or lips.)With that being said, it took a very long time to ship and it looked like the tube had been squashed a few times in-transit; might have been a better idea to use a box instead of a shipping bag.Update: Several weeks after using it every Saturday morning, I've noticed that a lot of the redness in my cheeks and chin has vanished! Bye-bye green concealer!"
1,"I use Vanicream after the Free and Clear cleanser, and I tell you what it's the best combo for my dry skin that I've used so far!  This cream has a nice and thick consistency that is not greasy and it absorbs wonderfully! I will get more of this for sure!"
0,"at first it smelled like mango and it was OK. But when I used it in shower, it smelled different - I can't describe it but it smelled like something not fresh and stale&#8230; I don't know, other people might like it, but I don't. I can stand up with this smell until I use this whole 32 ounce bottle up."
1,"I have used many brands of facial cream, both day and night. I discovered this one while trying to lower the amount of money I shell out each month on beauty products. I am happy to have found it, and I have bought several jars now. It is not greasy and absorbs well. I feel like my skin looks and feels more hydrated after using this for a couple of weeks. I have issues with strong fragrances and oily products and have not had a problem with this in either regard. I would definitely recommend this product. It works well and it won't break the bank!"
1,"After one month of daily use, here is my verdict:  This stuff works.  It's not magic, it's not a miracle, it doesn't transform every wrinkle and age spot.  But it makes your skin look BETTER than before, which is all we can really hope for, isn't it?I've noticed a somewhat dramatic change in the fine lines around my eyes (no, I don't use a separate eye cream).  They are smoother and much less noticeable.  The few age spots I've developed seem to be lighter.  Overall, looking at my face in the mirror now, I sometimes have to do a double-take because my skin looks so much better and brighter.  The permanent dark circles under my eyes are even lighter.I have acne prone skin and I was nervous about using a new moisturizer, but quickly found that my skin actually CLEARED UP while using this product.  Likely, it was due to my regimented focus on skin care in general, but this did NOT contribute to any breakouts at all.This is one product I can see myself using for a very long time.Update:  Four years later, and I'm still using this product regularly.  I stopped for a few months at one point and found my skin started to look somewhat dull.  Being in my 40s, this is prime aging time, but I don't feel that my face is betraying me anymore.  I have to give Olay a little bit of the credit."
1,"Over all I really like this product.  It sprays on fairly easily and has a natural matte finish.  My hair looks much thicker and fuller right away.  It also helps hold back-combing (teasing) in my hair.  Typically what I do is spray it on after blow drying & Curling (if I curl that day).  I spray at the roots especially near the front of my hairline where it is thinning.  I will then go in and do some back-combing for extra volume at the roots. I will then finish with a light hair spray.Some helpful tips when using this product:Shake it really good before applying.  Don't over apply and hold the can about 6"" from where you want to spray.  Don't use this in a hairstyle in-which you'll be running your fingers through your hair.  It will rub off on your hands.  If you're using a good amount on your head, either wash your hair before bed or use an old pillow case since it may rub off on your pillow.  Also for women who wear makeup, apply this product before you apply your makeup.  You may get some on your forehead if you are spraying near your hairline.  I simply used a damp tissue to wipe off my forehead after spraying and before applying my makeup.This would be an great product for women's up-do's for women with finner hair! It really gives the allusion of fuller thicker hair!Here are the Pros and Cons...Pros: It gives a nice even color with added thickness.  It doesn't clump on the scalp like some of the colored powders I have used, do sometimes.Cons:  The smell is just Okay for me.  Its not good but not terrible either. It can be messy when applying and will rub off on your fingers pillows or whatever touches it."
1,"This just didn't look very natural on me no matter how I applied it. I will try other colors, but Copacabana was a dud for me."
1,"My mom is devoted to this stuff, so when I recently saw that QVC was having a $70 special buy for two of the 32 ounce bottles, I splurged and got one for her, and one for me to try it out.The ProsNice size - will last a long timesmell is nicecreamy formuladissolves all of my makeupThe Consthe scent is strong and I can still smell is for hours after I washCan leave my skin tight and dryThe priceI just don't see enough of a difference between this and any other skin cleanser to justify the steep price tag, especially when I can get 32 ounces of cetaphil cleanser for less than $17. I have also heard that the formula has changed, which, while I cannot judge that as a new user of this product, It seems that for the price, there should be a lot more oils and natural ingredients in it, instead of just standard detergents."
1,"Heats fast. curls well, and doesn't grab or snag my hair. I like the circular dial design of the heat control. The only thing to keep in mind is the little metal kick stand heats up along with the iron, so if you plan to move it out of the way to curl your hair, be careful!"
0,"I applied Olay Total Effects one time.  I thought the scent was strong, but hoped that it would dissipate in a few minutes.  Wrong.  I had to wash my face and hands - twice - to get rid of the stink.  And I do mean stink - overwhelming fake floral yukkiness.  Like perfume that costs $1.99 for 16 oz. at Walmart.If artificial fragrances bother you, give this one a pass."
0,Really dries my skin and causes breakout. I have had this for 3 months now and have only used it 3 times but still my skin is to sensitive for it. Waste of money since product does not work for me.
0,"My husband has a lot of sebum in the pores of his nose. He was looking for a good way to get it out, besides squeezing. This thing doesn't suck hard enough to get it all out."
1,"I like how my face feels after use, but it makes my skin dry so I must use moisturizer. I use this product 2 times daily and I think the pads are made way too big. I actually cut the pads in sixths and that's really all you need for facial use."
1,"I don't know what to expect of this other than a clean moisturizer. It moisturizes and doesn't leave a bad smell or oil, but it's really nothing special. I would probably look for something cheaper next time."
1,These roller's foam is firm enough to keep the large curls large & the caps fit snugly but aren't too difficult to pull off.
1,The Shampoo arrived yesterday and tried this morning.  It was very nice and i think I will be glad I bought it.
1,I don't think I have to explain further about this masque because this masque is so popular among young and old women (especially among those of who are fighting acne)This is a great masque that works for all skin types and pretty much all ages.Great product & definitely recommended.
1,"I gave this a try but unfortunately I discontinued using it because i didn't think i can afford buying this again. I mean for what you pay for the quantity is soooo small. That said, i do love the this little thing. I have acne prone skin and it felt just great on the skin. It gave my skin a glowing look and it just glides so beautifully on the face. If the price was cheaper or the quantity was increased this would have been perfect!"
1,"another discntinued item from amazon, i love this moisterizer, need it to return though - seems like Amazon is not carrying Neutrogena products at all anymore. Very disappointing."
1,This is a high quality product.  Love the color.  Great price.  Easy to use.  Bare Minerals Foundation is highly recommended!
0,"I purchased this product to conceal redness. Unfortunately, it cakes so much that it can't be blended. On any area where there is not a spot of redness, this product actually makes you look green. Just try to blend it -- if you can imagine trying to budge a layer of crayon mixed with cake frosting smoothly over your skin. Not happening. Also, the scent is a bit unattractive, almost like some kind of clay. Not for me."
1,I have been using this mask for about 30 years now ..... If you have acne breakout this is a good product and it doesn't cost a fortune...I have tried other masks but keep coming back to this one.......my skin is no longer problematic ....my friends now  cant believe how great my skin is ......when I tell them my ups and downs with hormonal acne...thanks !!! queen helene!!!  I have no scars !!! I just found out amazon carries this product at such a great price!!!
1,"Great for daytime with 20% vitamin C serum  from Timeless and sunscreen. At night I go for PTR retinol fusion PM.  I also do monthly 30% glycolic peel, this AHA 10% keeps my skin well maintained in between my peels. Great price too."
0,"This made my skin so greasy and shiny, in addition to not helping my acne at all!  So very disappointed."
1,"I normally use Aphogee protein treatments to take care of my breakage, but decided to take a break from it and bought this item because I heard so many great things about it. I have to say, it DOES make my hair nice and soft and a little stronger. I may have to use this with their shampoo and conditioner to get the best of both worlds, though."
1,It works great! My face looks fresher after I use it. The skin looks like the stale layer of skin has been removed.
1,THis Alpha Hydrox Oil-Free Formula (1.7 oz / 50 ml)Alpha Hydrox is very good exfoliator and promotes cell turn over.
1,"It goes on easily and feels silky, it isnt thick and heavy like other mask. I could pick up no scent so its a neutral there. It dries quickly, within 15 mins,removes easily  and actually made my face smoother. I am 42 with combo skin so it works for me, going to be part of my regimen."
1,"I've been using microfiber towels for about ten years.  This is my third one.  They all eventually get an odor to them.  I'm not sure why but they do; I've tried drying them, without any softener in the dryer.  I've tried drying them outside.  I don't know what causes the smell.My first towel never smelled.  It was white so I'm wondering if there might be a correlation between white Microfiber towels and those with color.  At any rate, I replaced the white one when it got too stiff to be of any use.My next one was dark blue and it developed the odor so I use it now to remove hair from my cats after I brush them.  It does a great job!This is towel number three and it arrived with the smell!  So who knows what causes it?  I shall use it until I can't stand the smell any more and delight in the fact that the smell doesn't transfer itself to my hair and it cuts down hair-drying time by about half."
1,"I have to say this is a mighty working product to use with the issues I am having. With it providing coverage to skin imperfections such as age spots, acne scars, dark under eye circles and blemishes this is truly amazing cover up item to use. I really love how well it blends into the skin and it isn't heavy. Plus it covers up really well with my dark circles it can truly hide them for me. Plus, if I would get a issue with a blemish I am sure this would cover that up with no problem if it covers my huge dark circles up."
1,"It's Essie so the nail polish is excellent, however, this off-white color takes a few coats to really pop. I thought I would be using it for a french manicure, but now I'm not so sure."
1,"I have mild elevens marks from squinting (glasses), and concentrating hard (school). My mother (she's a saint), has deep elevens lines on her brow, and though she has aged beautifully, I hope to avoid emulating her in that particular way. The frownies seem to hold my forehead still, so if i fronw in my sleep, the muscles cant really move.  I dont use them consistently, partly because the adhesive is intensely drying. But i think it makes some difference --the marks are less obvious upon waking when I use them a few days in a row."
1,"I'm only 19 and I figured that I would start using moisturizer on a daily basis now to help cope with my dry skin.I can't attest to the anti-aging qualities of the product, but I will say that my hunt for the PERFECT daily moisturizer has come to an end! My skin is always super dry and the skin on my nose would even flake sometimes. I apply this once a day in the morning after washing my face and I have seen SIGNIFICANT improvement after one week, my face is smoother and I don't need to wear foundation anymore. I haven't had any breakouts or any discomfort, and it does not feel oily on my face either. I've tried l'oreal and clinique and several brands inbetween but this beats them by miles!Only thing I regret would be not stocking up on these when they were on sale for eleven bucks (shipping included).UPDATE: May 1st, 2013I've gone through the first bottle of this and am halfway through my second. For something that I use daily, this is a really good value. My skin has not acted up since I started using this, and I love how it absorbs really quickly so I can slap on my sunscreen and makeup without waiting in the morning."
1,This is a very nice hair dryer. I like the size. It has a high and low heat which is very comfortable.  It's not too noisy which is nice.  It can be cleaned too which is very easy. The price is very good I have bought others at twice the price and only half as good! Very happy with it.
1,"...have always liked this product and this color, i just can't find it at drugstores.  I prefer temporary color because I cannot stand the roots that are so obvious with permanent color."
1,I love my brush.  It is for finer hair.  I have used this brand for years.  5 years ago I could get 6 for 30 dollars and today it seems one brush goes for between 16 and 22 dollars.  I did find one not quite as good as this one but close for 8 dollars on Amazon.  It's called a Wet Brush.  I may have to change but still had to give this 5 stars because it is a good brush. Just the cost is a little up there in my opinion
0,"It's pretty and looks nice, but started chipping very quickly. When it's actually on and dry it's not all that different from the milky pink color often used in french manicures. It looked nice when I first put it on, but now I'm disappointed."
1,"Having no previous experience with nail polish thinner, I can only say that the product accomplishes its purpose. A few drops added to a bottle of slow-moving polish transform the latter into usable form again. The 4 oz bottle is a generous size that will last me several years."
1,I use this hand soap in my bathroom.  I love the smell of it and plan on using it in the future.  I think it's a little expensive but worth it.
1,"This cream is exceptionally high quality for a comparatively low price. The lavender oil in it its extremely therapeutic, and has a divine scent, which is also relaxing. I found that it is very soothing for sensitive skin, like mine, since I am sometimes allergic to face cream ingredients. Lavender oil not only has a gorgeous scent, but, helps skin heal. I absolutely love this product, and the very reasonable price makes it a win-win."
1,"I wanted to love this product because it's cruelty free and vegan. And to be honest, I do still use the product because of that.  However, I find it to make my skin look dry/older.  The only way I can wear it is by applying it as soon as I apply a generous layer of moisturizer to help cushion this product.  I wish more companies would make cruetly-free and vegan products. Corporations seem to have difficulty understanding this need."
1,"I've been buying Moodmatcher lipsticks for many years.  Although, I've tried all the colors, there's one in particular that looks good on my skin~tone.  Problem was, that I couldn't find this 'shade' anywhere!  And, when I'd find the shade, I'd usually have to buy several of the other colors, even though I don't like or wear, because of 'group packaging'.  But, now I found just the color I LOVE, and was able to buy a few of the same color~!  I'll be coming back Amazon to buy more of Fran Wilson's, Moodmatcher, light blue lipstick!"
0,"this review does not address how well the product works or not because I only tried this out one day as a stand alone for the follwoing reasons:The scent of this is reminds me of the beach, sunscreen, or a tanning bed.  Since I don't live/work near a beach or have a need to wear sunscreen all day or smell like coconut I choose not to use this daily by itself.On to condition weight:  it's a light condition the doesn't weigh your hair down or make it appear oily in any way. On the negative I have very prone to frizzy hair and this doesn't help with that at all.Because I can't just use this product by itself due to the reason above, I will not review this any further."
1,"I bought this for my husband's bathroom and he just loved it. Less shampoo bottles in his way, get the right amount of shampoo all the time... Now we'll get another one for our boat. Very practical. Excelent!"
1,I guess the 3 star review might be unjust because I ordered this 1&#34; curling iron thinking that it was the size that I desired but after I received it I realized I should've ordered the 3/4&#34;. I thought I'd give it a try but it just doesn't give me the effect that I want. Decided not to pay for return charges and just added it to my collection of many curling irons!
1,"This stuff is great to refresh and restyle your air with your fingers, brush, comb or whatever you prefer. It's not at all sticky and smells nice."
1,"I've never seen a cream soften and moisturize quite so quickly. Not only do you need a tiny amount of this slightly summery lemon colored cream, it seems to last for hours. What impresses most about this cream is the skin softening properties. Use this on your hands to see dramatic results instantly.Ingredients include Vitamin E, Vitamin B and Camphor. The camphor scent is very mild and they say you can use this on your face. I mostly use this for my hands and for cuticle care. Works especially well on feet and the cooling sensation is very pleasant.Recommended for when you participate in winter sports. Sumiyo Tsuzuki, a mountain climber, appears in IMAX Everest wearing a tube of this product taped to a shoelace around her neck. She used this product and if it works to protect skin against the weather on Mt. Everest, imagine how healing it will be for daily use.A must-have cream for when you are exposed to harsh wind or cold.If you enjoy this product, also look for Miss Oops Pedicure in a Bottle or the Derma E Hand Cr&egrave;me Age Reversal Formula for Youthful Hands. The Yu-Be Medicated Cream seems to enhance all other skincare products. The softening products are especially impressive.~The Rebecca Review"
1,"Simply put, there is nothing on this earth that removes rough skin for my feet.  My skin is baby smooth after use.  This product is rather messy; therefore I would suggest using the product outside.  Otherwise you are left with white skin bits on your floors that are rather unappealing and difficult to clean.  You will be astonished by how much new skin is revealed after using this product.  I also use it on my hands, knees and elbows.  My skin is highly sensitive and there are no adverse reactions to this product. I've been using this for over 10 years and wouldn't use anything else."
1,"I have a VERY oily face and am lucky enough to have adult acne. I've been using this moisterizer for about 2 years now. I am 24 and was wanting to start taking care of my face to slow the aging process. This lotion is the best as far as ""anti aging"" goes. Cetaphil works really well for light-weight moisterizing but contains no SPF or anti oxidants etc.... I used to be in the army and had to use the eucerin 30SPF everyday. Anything with SPF is going to be thick and when you sweat it is very thick and slippery. I ran out of this one time and there was a loreal face lotion with similar ""promises"" the olay was out of stock so I purchased the loreal and did not like it at all. The olay is much better. This doesn't make my face any oiler. It is very thick, so I put it on over my acne medicine, and before I put make up on I usually have to blot my face with toilet paper, but after that initial ""blotting"" the thickness/shininess is no longer an issue. I will continue to use this for a few more years until I step it up in the anti-aging regime."
1,"I hate makeup. It's a necessary evil for me. But this brand makes things SO easy! It looks natural, and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, and takes half a minute to use. I'm really pale, and Fairly light is a nice colour for me."
1,MY MOM REQUESTED THAT I BUY HER THESE.. SHE WEARS THEM ANY TIME SHE IS AT HOME ALONE AND DOES FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE IN HER DEEP BROW WRINKLE FROM FURROWING HER BROW
1,"This is my favorite lotion. It's rich enough for the winter and to be used as hand lotion. And it smells incredible. It's one of those products I'm afraid will go off the market some day. Sometimes, usually when it's freezing, it's too thick to get out of the bottle with the provided pump. When that happens I cut 'er open and put it in a jar. And I don't mind at all, because this lotion is that good."
1,I ordered this for our 5 year old that has very sensitive skin. We use all natural products for the most part and that is a huge reason we purchased this product. It is 75% Cocoa Butter 25% Jojoba Oil. No fillers and chemicals added. We just started using but it is working great! It is solid so you need to warm between your palms to melt but it makes lotion after shower and bath more exciting for him! He likes melting and squishing it! Thank you NOW for making such a great natural product!!!!!!!!
1,"Works great, doesnt make a mess, dries clear and doesnt rip my eyelashes out when I remove the fake lashes"
1,"I have no real idea what all the one star reviews saying &#34;black&#34; are for other than they did it wrong because there is a special process to make red from a box come out right, and if you don't follow it no matter the brand you get a darker or horrid red shade.First I didn't use it on dark hair, that is the key. If you hair is dark strip it down and use a soft red or very soft honey blonde to as a base. Then the next day apply the red dye, and only leave it on 1/2 to 3/4 the time it actually requires. Rinse it twice, and then use color treated conditioner on it, not just the one in the box. It is a long story but in short the chemicals in pre-boxed dye for red don't always mix well with previously treated hair or dark hair pigments.Product ReviewThe item was pricey compared to other brands, but I haven't found another brand that gives me the deep rich red shade I wanted. It wasn't as light a red as the box, no, but it did turn out well. I also use test strips when I try a new product to avoid disaster in case the product doesn't work right.It does come out blood red and stain everything so put some lotion around the edges of our face, on your shoulders and neck, and your hands so it will wash out easier. Put down towels you don't love because it is going to make on heck of a mess and is nearly impossible to get off anything with using harsh stripping chemicals, learned that the hard way.Positives-Easy to Use-Firm Red Color (at least that was what I got on my hair)Negatives-Fades fast-Comes out black if you do it wrong, and it is easy to do red hair dye from a box wrong-Price TagAll in all, I would buy it again, however I lean more toward the next shade of red down."
1,"This is the best leave in treatment I have ever used. It leaves my hair manageable, soft, and shiny. I would recommend this to anyone who has dry hair from hot tools."
1,"I find this concealer useful for the age spots on my face,  specifically the side of my face near the window when I drive in the sun.  It may be a bit heavy/waxy for under eye use,  but it's great for spots under mineral makeup!"
1,"A nice clean without over-drying.  The cleanser is creamy and doesn't have a lot of lather.  The smell is different but not ""bad"" necessarily.  You don't need a lot so the bottle lasts a long time."
1,"I had a rash inside me nose and in other parts f my body.  This ointment worked; the rash is completely gone.Con.: the amount they give is very little, so it's not good value for the money"
1,"I just need to remember to USE it!  It is vital for keeping the skin around the nail bed soft and manageable.  My hands get so dry no matter how much lotion or whatever brand I use (I LOVE Philosophy products!) but for some reason my hands are not very cooperative but if I would be more consistent with this product, I'm sure I would have better results!  Thanks Amazon for having the people available to make these item accessible!!!"
1,"This product does not lengthen,or add volume. It simply darkens your lashes. I personally did not like it. I prefer a mascara that adds volume."
1,I love the aphogee line because it never lets you down an you will always see great results if you use the products correctly.
1,Perfect nude color. I was a little leery to purchase this at first but to my surprise the application was smooth unlike my mint candle apple one. This is my favorite nude polish. Looks great on nails.
1,"I first found this ""Udderly Smooth Udder Cream"" sitting on a sundries shelf in my local Trader Joe's Grocery Store. Out of curiosity, I picked it up and read the instructions. They explained about how to clean the udder, apply the cream and treat teat problems. What is this? And what is it doing in Trader Joe's? I just had to buy a jar to find out. Well, there was nothing on the package to indicate what humans might do with it, so I just had to improvise.First, it seemed to work well anywhere a good lotion might apply. It makes an excellent hand cream, for example. It's one of the best I've ever found. My fianc&eacute;e suggested that I rub her feet with it and she loved it. What next? Well, I read an account of a fellow who shaved with it, so I just had to try that too. It worked quite well. I doubt that it will displace my regular shaving cream, but if I ever run out I know exactly where to go in such an emergency. Another person suggested it was a good after-shave treatment. It is. It wasn't too long before I tried it as a personal lubricant. It's the best I've ever found. This stuff is amazing! It's a WD-40 for the skin!The cream is soft, smooth and slick, yet it isn't greasy. It has a pleasant, mild odor. It cleans off readily with water and doesn't leave stains. About the only negative I can think of is that I don't particularly care for the taste of it.Since my initial discovery, I've found it in several pharmacies, several more grocery stores and at my local Ace Hardware. My fianc&eacute;e reported she found it in a sewing goods shop. Amazing. Still, it could be hard to find if you're specifically looking for it. The cream comes in a variety of different containers. I usually buy the original 12 ounce jar, but I've seen smaller jars and various tubes. This is a great product. Use your imagination.Gary Peterson"
1,"I bought this after reading stellar reviews on another website reviewing skin products (makeupalley). I have really sensitive skin and it dries out embarrassingly bad in the dry spells of winter, but this is gentle enough to use on damaged patches of skin or even my chest, which usually reacts.It appears pretty thin, but I'm not convinced that thickness is the only or primary indicator of how well a lotion will leave you moisturized long-term. Its second ingredient is coconut oil, so it keeps you moisturized and soft really long. It'll hit me a few days after body-moisturizing with this stuff, if I brush my side or something, I think, ""Why am I so soft?"" and finally realized it's because of this lotion! Ha. I'd recommend this as a hard-to-find, versatile lotion you can use for body, hands or face."
1,"I use a few drops directly on the floor when cleaning with my steam mop, it infuses the room with a lovely scent that's not overpowering and does not give me a headache like store bought cleaning products tend to do. It's all natural so I don't have to worry about kids or pets getting nasty chemicals on their hands or paws. This essential oil is multi purpose I recommend looking online for ideas on various ways to use it. I've used it when making lemon bars (that turned out super tasty), added to oil diffuser or a steam bath, and used it in my homemade bug repellent spray/bars."
1,"yes, this product is the best I tried so far...I'm the kind of person who never really buy the same products again because I like to explore, and see other options, but this cream is it for me. lol, yes, I'm in love with it."
1,"First time try for this great cleanser . . . needed to replace what I normally use but I just don't 'enjoy' shopping! Neutrogena brand name is well recognized and the cost was way less than what I've used. Easy to use pump bottle that is attractive enough to keep in a limited space. Dampen hands, add small amount of cleanser and watch it foam. Gently smooth/light massage over face and rinse with cool/lukewarm water splash.Within the past months I have started using new products that are Amazon available . . . really impressed with the results. 68 years old with mature sensitive skin and that deep brow line wrinkle has almost vanished  and the fine lines are gone. Neutrogena Fresh Foam is the perfect way to begin 'clean!'Other products you might be interested in trying: Freeman Cucumber or Pomegranate Peel Masks, Roc Deep Wrinkle with Retinol (both day and night), Smoothies, and Simple eye gel. Body: Aveeno 24 hour moisture and simply radiant body wash, c Booth honey almond firming lotion and dry oil mist. If this reads as 'too much,' it takes 20 minutes or less each day!"
1,"I've been using this mascara for a decade and have no intention of switching. Ever. I still remember the commercial with Sarah Michelle Gellar even :PIt delivers on it's promises to not flake or clump and to feel more natural. That I love. I've read many reviews that say it doesn't build drama. When I want impact I do three coats, and if I want outrageous drama, I use a mascara primer first. I have zero problems making this mascara go from every day to big night out and everywhere in between. It also washes off easily without black residue lingering around. I do not use the waterproof version though, so I have no idea how well (or not) it washes off.I get complements on my lashes often, and when I tell people I use a cheap ole drugstore mascara that's been around for years and years, people are shocked. But it's 100% true. I love this stuff. I wish I could fine the brownish black in stores, but I can't find anywhere that carries it but here. I like the very black, but sometimes I want a more natural look and like the brown/black."
1,"This seems to work great for me! I will buy again when I run out. Also, will tell friends that might be interested."
1,"This brush slides through your hair like butter. Dull matted hair seems to take on a sheen after using the brush. There is no shedding of the bristles and its perfect for blow dry styling. I am over sixty and have used many brushes, this is the best of them."
1,My mom has been using these for years and I thought she was very old fashioned until I bought my own.  I love that they do not fry your hair like most curling irons and straighteners.  The curl lasts all day and is much gentler on my hair.  I will probably buy another set of the curlers because I run out of the medium size.  Overall I am very happy with this purchase.
1,I've been using this makeup remover for years. It's really gentle on your eyes and leaves them feeling moisturized. It's oil free which is awesome and won't leave a residue on your eyes. I buy it on the subscribe and save program which gives me 15% off and makes it the cheapest place to buy it. LOVE!!
1,"I gave  a 3 star because I am not really sure if this product worked how it's supposed to . It felt a little grimy in my hair , I guess it kinda made my hair a little more manageable ."
1,I like this product very much and I would recommend this its is easy to use and applyI would use black or clear both works well.
1,This cream is great for dry skin.  It has no parabens which I love and it is a very good night cream for moisturizing and softening facial skin.  I notice that my lines are softer and seem to be lessening.  I'm 56 and have very dry skin and am out in the sun a lot gardening and playing tennis.
1,"I've used this mascara for years and it never disappoints. Adds lots of length and volume to my lashes. The first couple applications from a brand new tube are pretty thin and light, but it will thicken and give you the desired results thereafter. I used to go through these tubes so quickly because they would dry out pretty fast... until a trick I learned: if your tube starts drying out, extend its life by adding 2 drops of contact solution/eye drops to the tube. It will instantly rehydrate it for continued use. I've been using the same tube for 10 months now by doing this! :)"
1,I love the Essie brand (it is up there with O.P.I) and this color is perfect. Matches everything and is pretty subtle when I dont feel like standing out. Doesnt chip! Goes on smooth.
1,"I've always used organic or mostly organic body lotion.  I have used Burts Bees Honey Milk lotion, Aveda's body lotions, and many others but my friend in NY had Alba lotion and i'd never heard of it so of course used it while i was staying with her. I am totally converted.  There is something about this lotion that makes your skin almost tingly at first, but it absorbs quickly, makes skin feel smooth for over 24 hours, and smells light and doesn't conflict with perfume smells. I was happy to find it at such a deal. I'll be trying more alba products, as they are cheaper than aveda."
1,"I started using this product after I saw a review online for good astringents and since I have issues with using certain products on my face.  I've got sensitive skin as well so I have to be super careful what products I use to keep them clean.  I had been using other products like this one but they tended to irritate my skin then I would get an allergic reaction or break out badly.  Ever since I started using this, I have noticed that my skin is cleaner and it is crazy how much stuff this picks up that cleansers leave behind.  It's 100% witch hazel unlike other witch hazel on the market.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone that wants to improve their skin."
1,I have pretty oily skin and was dreading the summer months as I hate looking shiny an hour into the day.  I am crediting this face wash with balancing my skin and making the oil more manageable.  I haven't change any other products in my routine so this has to be the golden ticket.  I am not saying that everything is perfect but I do see a significant difference in the oiliness of my skin.
1,"I use this every night followed by nightamins by Origins and always wake up to refreshed glowing skin, no matter how little sleep I get! I love it!"
1,Beautiful color and of course excellent formula. It does look more purple in the bottle then you would think but is a beautiful navy blue with some fine shimmer on your nails. I will never be without this color again!
0,"I love the smell, but it DOES NOT 'stick'. It smelt it nicely when I shampooed, or, when it was in higher concentration, but I could not smell it otherwise. Plus, it is not moisturizing. So, I will continue to use it as a shampoo, but not a body wash. My hair looked nice today, so I can't complain about it's shampooing performance. But, since I paid what I paid for it, I am disappointed. I wish it had a more potent, long-lasting smell, and, I wish it was moisturizing."
1,"I wanted a better quality of round brush for styling my hair and gave this one a shot. At my first attempts, I prefer the old brush I purchased at a beauty supply store for next to nothing. I will take more time later to see if it's the operator :) or the brush."
1,"I bought it for my sister and she really like it. It does what it says regarding the shine control, and it covers a great deal"
1,"I am 21 and have had combo skin for years and years, dry in the morning, oily throughout the day! i love this product though! i use it on my face every morning when my skin is a bit flakey, and it makes my skin so soft! my moisturizer goes on smoothly finally! a bottle lasts a long time, i very rarely break out, and i have noticed a significant difference in the amount of oil on my face at the end of the day! i still have some but much less! my only complaint is that it does nothing for blackheads, i still have those..."
1,"This is simply the best hand lotion I have ever used. I love that it isn't greasy, and I can actually see the difference in my hands when used a few times a week. The scent is not overpowering either. I have paid a lot more for a jar of hand lotion, but I have never had these results. I have a smaller size tube in my purse at all times, too. This makes a great gift, and I have converted a lot of new customers for this product. I highly recommend it."
1,"The only drawback to this blush is that it doesn't come with its own brush. for the cost you pay, I would really expect it to have one. aside from that, the quality is there. I love this blush and it looks well on my olive skin tone. the gold flecks are small and sparse enough to give you just the right amount of shimmer for everyday wear."
1,"Loving this soap!  Leaves my skin smooth and I think it's economical, considering I no longer have to use expensive lotions to try to replace the moisture stripped by other soaps.  This is great and my husband loves it too!"
1,I've been using this serum for years....it is fragrance free which is what I need due to sensitivities.  Works great!
1,I use these after conditioning my hair after a shampoo or a heavy duty conditioner. They hold heat in and the conditioner works so much better.
1,I've used the Dr Bronner liquid soap and really like it so I thought I'd try the bar.  Not disappointed.  Lathers great and rinses clean.  The bar is large so I tried cutting it--didn't work too well as the smaller part broke into pieces.  I use it for washing my face and body.  As with other soaps do not leave it where the water will constantly be on it or your soap will be gone too quickly.  Will be using again.
1,"I use it every day as it is a best there is for me with allergies. Wish the hint of foundation had continued, but can no longer find it."
1,"Like all Mrs. Meyer's products, which make doing chores a little less onerous with their lovely essential oil scents, the dish soap smells great. Basil and radish are my personal faves, though it's hard to pick just one. The dish soap, however, doesn't work up any suds....making it difficult to do the dishes manually without using a ton. And this stuff isn't cheap. So I'll just be sticking to regular Dawn for the dishes, and leave Mrs. Meyer's for the countertop spray and the abrasive cleaner for my bathroom."
1,"I have been looking for an effective hair thickening shampoo for a long while and purchased both shampoo and conditioner. Both have not been used long enough to determine if they work or not. Because this shampoo doesn't lather well initially, there is a tendency to use much more than needed. It will lather as it's worked in but I didn't like the scent. So, if a little goes a long way, it may be worth buying for the price. I'll give it more time."
1,"Ok, this is strong stuff.  I had no idea. That's my bad. It gets a three star rating because I thinks it's way to $$$ considering all of the other products out there that do the same thing. Otherwise, if your new to this product, do not use it every day! Good God, you'll regret that. It will burn your skin off, you will peel like a dragon, and there will be way more deep set wrinkles for about a week. No kidding. I had to place chamomile and tea tree essential oil along with aloe on my face on night. Ouch.So, it does take off skin layers. Does it erase wrinkles. Maybe by 20%. But that's it, tops. I prefer the glycol acid over this.Also, it is a heavy cream. I don't like the feel of it. Too heavy. I only put it on at night...and very sparingly now. I'll stick with it until I run out. If I see a huge improvement when all is said and done, I will surely report back!  :)Using for approx 3 months."
1,"I am amazed once again but how effective natural products can be for the skin. I have been using this product for a week and I am definitely loving in. My skin looks clearer, smoother, and less oily. And with the amount inside the bottle, it will last a good few months. Can't beat the cost either."
1,"I saw this moisturizer in a &#34;green&#34; store and it was priced out of my beauty budget range so I looked for it on Amazon and liked how it was priced. I like this moisturizer, it is light and glides on nice and smooth...I think I may even notice a sense of my skin looking a bit more even...I am still new to this product line and will continue to use it.."
1,"This is a very pleasing scent that does last most of the day. It is fruity and clean with a strong tone so its perfect for daily use. This is great for being around people so, you smell clean, fresh and are pleasing to be around, not over powering. My favorite part is that it is not common for other men to where it so, people always ask what it is?........It's Happy!!"
1,This is an inexpensive styler that Works great.  I have long very wavy hair and it smoothed it out nicely without it being to straight.  Great product!
1,Covers the ridges while nourishing your nail. It helps protect your nail from yellowing if you use dark shades and leave the nail polish on pretty much until you've peeled it off. Also it helps the color nail polish stay on your nail longer. Will definitely buy again.
1,"I got curious about this stuff after doin' an online search for a delicious, dessert scented...scent. The reviews for this stuff were so favorable, I had to find it and try it. Six months later, I have a stash of Body Fantasy Cotton Candy scented lotions, a couple of sprays and a body wash at home. I love this scent. By the way, I'm also an addict of real cotton candy. Brace yourselves, sisters! You WILL hear plenty of comments from men. You've been warned. The bottle of body spray itself will last for months; even with every day use. If you use the lotion AND the body spray, you'll go through about three bottles of the lotion before a bottle of the spray is finished. I've just stumbled upon the gift set containing a body lotion, spray and shower gel. Got it from Kmart this weekend for $12. Really, for a scent this great, you can't beat that! It's a very light scent. To my delight, I might catch a whiff during the day as I'm moving around. For the most part, I barely smell it on myself. I was surprised at how long-lasting it is! I usually put it on right after my shower at 6:30 am. At and after 6 pm, I'm still gettin' compliments! And this is even BEFORE I started adding the body wash to the layering! Does it smell like the real thang? Yes! Would I recommend it? Not only WOULD I, I AM recommending it. To YOU! Right NOW! (You can thank me later.) :)"
1,I LOVE this scent. I picked it up on a whim one day at a store and have been wearing it ever since. It's light and not overly fruity/floral or musky. I can't pin point any once smell it just smells like clean happiness in a bottle. :)
0,"When I was experimenting with cold creams a while back, I came across this upon recommendation from a friend's mother. While I liked the old fashioned, perfume smell, I found the consistency too greasy and it didn't remove my makeup too well or moisturize my skin. In fact, I wouldn't recommend it to people with sensitive skin, since my face did redden when I used it (and I highly doubt it was the red dye in it too)."
1,"I'm a lady, and I bought this because I needed a quick, in-office fix to fuzzy legs. Sometimes you miss a patch. Or the whole thing...Anyway, I did a side by side comparison. One leg I shaved dry and one I used this stuff.This stuff works great, I had a much closer, smoother shave than without it. But, it made me smell like an old man. It has a very potent 'classic aftershave' smell that is just not my cup of tea, as a lady who doesn't want to smell like a great uncle, or for someone I would consider getting close enough to to smell their face.Now I understand why it says 'rinse after using'. That being said, it's still a great product, and I'd buy it again."
1,"I've had really light blonde hair all my life.  When I was little it was almost snow white and I hated it because it made me stand out from the other little girls, but as I got older and it darkened just a little, it was a beautiful shade. The exception is when I spent a lot of time in the sun, then it would turn to that fake looking bleach blonde again and nobody ever believed it was natural.  Now that I'm even older, my hair has thankfully become a slightly darker blonde, and for a few years now the roots have started turning a champagne shade. Every couple of months I will spray a little Sun In and massage it into the roots for maybe 2 days in a row, then blow dry it, and that is good for a couple more months.  It lightens it enough to where it looks more like the other grown out hair, but not fake.  After spraying, the roots are a tad bit of a darker blonde, so it looks totally natural.  I use a really good leave-in conditioner so it never dries out my hair, as some people have mentioned it does to their hair.  I have read comments where people say they can't believe they make this product anymore because the number of true blondes is decreasing, but I for one hope they always have it around for minorities like me!  Someday I'll probably just let my hair go to it's natural champagne shade, as my grandma's and dad's did, but until then, I'll be using Sun In regularly."
1,"I'm a prime customer and couldn't get my usual Dr Bronners product on prime at the time I ordered so I thought I would give this a try in the meanwhile.  Just as fine a product and a little bit better deal.  Great for sensitive and/or dry skin, rash, sunburns, blisters, etc.  Organic, smooth & great scent.  I would pick up either brand in the future... just based on which I can get via prime membership."
0,"I put this on my face and noticed immediately the very thin consistency... this feeling was replaced with a burning sensation and I thought ""alcohol"" and sure enough, that's on the list of ingredients.  Alcohol is extremely drying and is not what I want to be putting on my face or body to moisturize.If you want your face to feel like you're taking a trip to the Caribbean, complete with sunburn and the fragrance of a Pina Colada, this is for you.  If you want a real moisturizer, I suggest Aveeno Everyday Oatmeal.Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion, 18 OunceSorry, can't recommend."
1,"Pompeii purple... more pink than purple, as you can see in the pictures someone was nice enough to post... Very cheerful! - Makes me want to paint tulips on my toes lol (toe-lips??? ;)."
1,While I was waiting to get this product me (being impatient) went out and bought a knock off brand from a local store. I'd have to say so far the knock off brand worked better than this. I did not feel the face tightening effect other viewers had described with this product (though i did with the store bought brand) and this has caused me to break out in the most unpleasent of places on my face. Weird places like in between my eyes and eyebrows and forehead. Perhaps I will try again in the future but I am dissapointed in this product right now.
1,"This nail polish in not for the weak and discrete.This is for the bold and fashion forward girl that is ok with having a little fun and won't mind getting scared for two days or so, when a glimpse of your nails register. It's a bold, durable and super cool color.OPI quality (Which means long lasting and no chipping) and guaranteed fun.I recommend."
1,"I hope you have short hair!These clips are roughly an inch in length each. They hold exceptionally well for their size, but you have to have really small amounts of hair to make them work, or just be reeeeally good at clipping things. Like, you'd need to be a clip ninja.Personally, I've found use for them as paperclips. They work wonders in keeping note cards together, or clipping a gauzy curtain to itself so it doesn't blow around in the breeze. Use your imagination! Just don't use long hair."
1,"I bought this as a start to branch out of ""safe"" colors of lipstick and because I wanted a nice bright fuschia lip color.The color does become a stain that stays around for a good while when food, drink, kissing, etc isn't factored in, so beware.I applied this at around 12 this afternoon and only the edges of my lips were colored by around 5 o'clock in the evening (with food, drink, kissing, etc. involved)For maximum life and beauty, exfoliate your lips and apply lip balm before using!"
1,"I used to love Revlon's full n' soft mascara, so I decided to try this one.  Its just not the same.  If I'm not extreme careful my eyelashes become clumped.  My eyelashes are soft, but only because I used one coat.  If I put a coat this one and then use a different brush, my lashes look great, but I didn't want to have to use two brushes. Just not for me.  The good part is it washes off easily."
1,As I mentioned before...I love this product and order it in bulk. IT is the only thing out there that actually works for me. IT arrived new and the boxes were in really good condition.
1,The product works great. It does not cause brassiness. Do recommend to anyone with light hair. Though i do not have experience with dark one.
1,"Now that the seasons are changing my hands are getting dry, dry, dry, just like they always do. Nothing beats Crabtree & Evelyn's hand creams for dry hands. This was at a GREAT price too. It arrived as expected in perfect, new condition. If you have dry hands I highly recommend you try one of C&E's hand creams."
0,You can see that it smooths the lines as soon as you peel it off but couple hours after your lines look same as before ! It's not a bad product but it's expensive for piece of paper
1,I use this at the job because I work with with cardboard and in cold conditions which are very drying for my hands. The bottle easily fits in my bag and does not leak when I take it with me. This cream absorbs quickly and is long lasting. My hands look and feel immediately better after just one application.
1,"I have tried just about EVERY product imaginable to get my nails to grow, from nail ""strengthening"" polishes to nail growth ""supplements""... and nothing has worked like Nailtiques!  I used to have problems biting my nails and also problems with weak, brittle, peeling nails, and thus they would never grow long at all, or I could get them to grow to a certain length only to have them start peeling and become weak and break.  Now I have been using Nailtiques consistently for a few months and I get SOOOO many compliments on my beautiful NATURAL nails, people are always asking if they are real! They are incredibly long, strong, and healthy, sometimes it's hard to believe they are really my nails!!  And because they are so beautiful I no longer have the urge to bite them (they are so thick & STRONG I can't really bite them anyway!)Here are two tips to help you get the most out of Nailtiques and to help your nails really grow:1.) USE IT EVERYDAY (or at least every other day)!  Luckilly this formula dries super quick and doesn't stay all gummy and sticky like other polishes do, so make sure you follow the directions: paint one coat on the first day, and continue to paint on one layer each day thereafter.At the end of the week I will remove all the layers with acetone nail polish remover, and then start applying layers of Nailtiques all over again.2.) Keep your nails nicely filed, so if you do chip a nail avoid further damage from snags by filing down the chipped areas. And try to get a lot of protein in your diet this helps also to build strong nails! :)"
1,"I imagined this product to be a lot bigger. It works alright. It takes about 15+ minutes for the rollers to get hot enough to do anything to my fine hair. The rollers aren't really big and there is not way of telling when they are hot enough. The top case really has no purpose and doesn't even stay on. These are only good if you want a slight wave in your hair. I honestly think a curling iron works much better. For what I paid, I am not impressed."
1,"Yes, I love all my Olay products! At age 69 I have used several other brands to compare but always go back to my Olay the best. I always get many compliments on may complexion and I know it has to be in this product as I do work outside gardening and exposed to sun. I always remember to take pride in using this product last thing at night before going to bed."
1,"This is my favorite nail polish. The color is a very deep, dark burgundy. The color lasts better than other nail polishes I have used."
1,"I tried Afirm 3X in place of Retin A in the Obagi Nu-Derm plan because I was nervous about jumping right into the harsh effects of tretinoin cream...The results were AMAZING. Within a few days this product had me gently but rapidly turning over new skin.  My moderate hyperpigmentation disappeared within a couple of weeks...even before I moved up to the prescription vitamin A products that are part of the Obagi system. I used Afirm for several weeks and gradually prepared my skin for the more aggressive Vitamin A in Retin A or Tretinoin. Afirm 3X helped me completely avoid the red peeling and discomfort expected in the initial weeks of Obagi.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!BTW, I started the system for some moderate sun damage and discoloration, but the bonus is that my wrinkles are GONE. (the ocassional mild acne breakouts have also stopped completely) I was recently forced to leave a little neighborhood pub until I could come back and produce my driver's license to prove I was 21. I will be 40 in 3 months...maybe the bartender was sipping a little behind the bar before I got there...but I credit this product working in conjunction with the hydroquinone of Obagi-- Admitedly, the poor lighting in that filthy bar didn't hurt either.  Good luck!!!"
1,"I love this brand and have been trying all the different products.  I especially love the the hand soap.  The Geranium scent is very strong and very feminine.  You would not want this in your kitchen, I wouldn't think, or anywhere where men would be using it.  The scent reminds me of the talcum powder I used to have when I was young, the kind that came in a box with a puff.  Very floral and powdery.  The scent is strong enough to smell the minute I go in the bathroom, almost like there is potpourri in the room. The soap is not harsh at all and the container is great - you can use every last drop of the soap without having to add water."
1,"Rose water and glycerin - I mix about 1/4 rosewater to 3/4 glycerin (bought both on Amazon) - I use it as a moisturizer when I get out of the tub - or to clean my face in the morning. It's easy t apply with a spray bottle.  Both are good, natural ingredients - good for my skin and a pleasant reminder of happy childhood days spent with my Mamaw."
1,"Use Purity everyday to cleanse my face, I feel it is just that gentle.  My face feels clean, never dry after applying it."
1,"Cetaphil Antibacterial Gentle Cleansing Bar is indeed the optimum choice for my problem skin.This pH balance non-soap cleansing bar is a super gentle all over body wash. I even use it on my face in lieu of shaving cream - it's that soothing!  The antibacterial ingredient - triclosan, also helps protect my freshly shaved face.CONS:This stuff's priceyCetaphil Antibacterial Cleansing Bar is very soft and it melts away quickly once it's under the shower stream.TIP: To reduce wastage of this pricey cleansing bar, don't lather up under the shower, lather up your washcloth instead and store your Cetaphil Cleansing Bar away from the shower (I keep mine in a covered soap dish).Shop around on Amazon ... this product offers a few buying choices.Hope my review was helpful ... Jeffrey A. (Jeff)"
1,"You can't go wrong with OPI.  The color is different than what I normally buy.  Nice for a change. Nail polish is all about the base coat and top coat, but doing everything right OPI lasts better than most."
1,"Well, my hair did not grow, I'll say that from the very start.I got these knowing that they're not supposed to work the same for everyoneand that maybe my results would not be as advertised, but again, my hairdid not grow AT ALL, which is eve funny because my hair normally growssomewhat fast.The reason I give this a 3, is because after all they are still vitaminsand minerals that you body needs, and because, despite the fact that ishorrible having to be taking so many pills a day it helps with your waterdrinking which is also good for you.My hair however does feels stronger and shinier and is not falling anymore,it was falling a lot and that was another thing i hoped the pills would solveand they did solve that, also my nails grew a lot and are very strong.So, if you decide to try this, do it with the understanding that i will notwork the same on everyone and that it may not do the wonders they say but itwill do some good on regards to the strength of your hair and scalp.I may even get this again, to make sure my hair stops falling..."
1,"I really didn't like the smell of this Big Blue  in the store (though it really smelt like the ocean... dried seaweed and all!), however when I got home to try it, the smell was actually kind of sweet smelling rather then dead fish smelling.  Thank goodness because I found this to be the best bath bomb to use to soothe sore and achy feet.  I work retail, so I'm on my feet for hours at a time and when I get home, I crumble some of the Big Blue into my foot spa and it deodorizes and relieves my feet so quickly.  The real sea salt works as an anti-inflammatory and helps any swelling go down also.I don't have a bathtub to actually try it as a BATH bomb, but I can imagine how great it would feel.  The seaweed in the bomb also helps to soften my rough feet and when I follow with LUSH's Fair Trade Foot Lotion, my feet are so comfortable!"
1,"I've been breaking out more around the time I started using this and while my skin doesn't burn from the wash or the lotion, I have to say that I'm pretty sure this has been causing me to break out unfortunately. My skin just doesn't seem to agree with it and it sucks since I have quite a lot of the soap left."
1,good mascara...happy with this purchase I would  buy this again.I shop on Amazon for everything and think they are great!
1,"I love the product & it makes my hair really soft, smooth & healthy, but with this particular color it's actually the 1st time I have ever colored my hair in over 35 years that it colored it the same color my hair already was!. There was literally NO difference! None! But the grey was gone. Rather amusing & a learning experience"
1,"Pros: I bought this after it was highly recommended by my esthetician. It has an amazing scent and made my skin feel clean and fresh. It was gentle on my sensitive skin.Cons: I am acne prone and this did nothing to help decrease my acne. I so badly wanted a more natural solution, but I am back to salicylic acid type products."
1,"I had the world's worse cuticles when I started using this product.  I was skeptical because I have tried so many products in the past and given up.  I've been using it just over a week now and I can't believe the transformation.  I wish I had taken a before and after photo.  No more dry, rough cuticles for me!  I will never be without this again.  Buy it, use and you won't be sorry!"
1,"I am almost 33 but people says i look 20 something... They also thought I am still single but I told them I even have a 2 year old daughter! I used this product for 4 years already and until now I am amazed by how it works in my skin. It became smoother, tight and pore less. I love this with spf 15, not only it hydrates the skin but protects as well. This is really my beauty secret for looking young... I eat food so much, drink soda more than water but my skin still radiates plus the help of vitamins i take...So i really thank  olay total effects so much!"
1,"Now, I'm not going to go crazy and say that this product works miracles or anything. But it definitely does the job of making your hair look thicker. The product itself is pretty runny. Sort of like a John Freida serum, if you're familiar. Even though it is a thin product, you really don't need to use much to get the full effects.I use about a nickel-sized amount of Toppik in my hair while it is still fairly damp. I make sure to get it evenly applied root to tip, and as soon as my hair has dried, you can definitely tell that it looks thicker.That being said, if you're SEVERELY balding, I don't think this will do much for you. But if you're just starting to see thinner and thinner hair, this can help keep your scalp from showing for just a little bit longer!On a side note, even though this product is only superficial and washes out completely, it seems like it takes a few days/applications in the beginning to start to notice thicker hair. Just an observation..."
1,"Well, no mascara that I know of looks totally natural (except one by Shiseido that is no longer made, as far as I can tell). I've been iso a light-weight mascara in brown that has just enough umph to cover the powder that most shadows make on lashes. This one is the best I've found--after trying more expensive department and drugstore brands. I still would like to find one that deposits even less mascara-stuff on the brush, but it helps if I wipe the brush with a tissue before applying to lashes.I'm in my 50s, and most mascaras make me look worse instead of better. Somehow that mascara-y look is severe and accentuates wrinkles and aging, I think. I'm thankful I revisited this one, as I enjoyed it back in the 70s as well."
0,it left my skin feeling dry and felt like it left a film on my skin. i use it to wash my hands instead of my face then i follow up with a dab of lotion.
1,"I use Heritage Roswwater to set my mineral foundation (Valana Minerals Stardust Luxury Foundation in Fire Goddess). A light spritz makes my foundation ""melt"" into my skin for a more dewy, natural look. The smell is also quite uplifting and soothing.Ingredients: Water, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Oil"
1,"I have very sensitive facial skin.  The slightest fragrance or unassuming offending chemical can cause rashes, stinging and all sorts of unpleasantness.I have tried many, many products. From high end premium brands to drugstore brands. I have found some high end brands that are truly great, but also very expensive.So based on reviews her on Amazon, and the reasonable price,  I decided to try Eucerin Q10. I have been using it for five days, and I love it. It is a thick, rich cream  goes on smoothly and is absorbed rapidly. Skin feels really moisturized after application. I use it in the morning before makeup application and again at night before bed. Smooth skin and no irritations!I can't say if it will deliver on promise to reduce facial line. I'll let you know in six months.For those who are paraben sensitive, this creme does contain parabens. The creme is also a yellow color, which the box describes as being the intended color (result of natural ingredients)."
1,"i live in the NE, this is the best.  hard winter, great product for your skin!!"
0,It made my hands smell so manly. I could't get enough on my hands or get it to go in my hands. It makes my hands shiny and greasy but still feeling not moisturized. My hands were covered in a thin layer of it just sitting on top. From all the great reviews i thought it'd be wonderful but I was so wrong. It could work for others! My skin could just be an exception.
1,"i LOVE THIS PRODUCT IT RALLY DOES HELP, youll see the difference in just a few days.. even just using it one time.. the price is awesome..i use it ones a week, and it got rid of my acne marks cleaned out me pore, its like a nourishing facial in just one stpe"
1,"This is the best facial cleanser I've ever used.  I love how it makes my skin feel really silky after washing with it, and it gets make-up off really well too.  I've tried the generic brand at Target, and it just doesn't work the same.  Stick with the original!"
1,"It smells really bitter...must use different scent after using this...haven't been using long enough to see results, but we'll see."
1,"I used this years ago when I was struggling with dry flaky skin on my face.  A friend bought this as a gift and helped get my face back into shape.  I found this product again and was surprised at how quickly it helps so much!  I use this with the Burt's Bees Carrot Nutritive Night Cream.  I've never been one for the strong Orange smell; however, I don't care, as long as my face gets better!"
1,"Really does make your skin feel and look younger if you keep using it for several weeks.  We use it with the moisturizer, and we're pleased!"
1,Olay is a work in process.  It takes time with this product to bring about results.  The skin appears to be firming/tightening up..  I would purchase this product again.
1,"not only heals chapped lips, but also helps to prevent from chapping. the product is fragrance free with spf 15"
1,I like it but the problem is that I cannot gate  the moisturising night cream from Roc brend.  The Roc  night hidrating cream can not be shipped  autside  the US.
1,"If you are looking for a dense but not glue-y holo polish, then buy this immediately.  The formula is incredible, the glitter is packed full of reflection and the bottle glows with rainbows."
1,"This is an average body wash. No better and no worse than any other regular kind I suppose. The smell is kind of off putting, it reminds me of this chewable medicine I used to take. I LOVE fruity fragrances but this was a little too artificial chemical smelling for me. It smelled alright in the bottle and then when I lathered it on my poof, while it lathers okay, it smelled musky and nothing like in the bottle. It's also not that moisturizing. I still had to apply lotion after my shower and with my old body wash I didn't need to. I also find it very odd how this body wash is Honey mango scent and there is no actual honey or mango in it, which is odd for a natural body wash, you'd think they would have added that. I also don't understand how they call it very emollient because nothing in the ingredients suggests that there is anything moisturizing in it, no Jojoba oil or anything good. I wouldn't buy this again but I can finish the bottle."
1,I love this product as part of my weekly skin care. It's a great mild exfoliant and doesn't damage my fragile aging skin.
1,"I think it works very well for what it says it's for.There is a smell at the beginning, but it does go away after a while. The smell is like any new plastic product.I steamed myself with it while watching a 40-minute show on TV, and I could feel my sweat from the steam coming down my jaw and neck. I don't really need to stay in a certain position to get the steam all over my face. And after I was done with it, my skin did feel very very soft and bouncy.It does its job well and right. Maybe I would like the cord to be a bit longer than it is?!And I do have one other thing like some other people do:In the instruction regarding how many pinches of salt, why don't they just use a standard measurement like 1/3 or 1/2 of teaspoon of salt, instead of how many pinches of salt and stresses again it's ""pinches"" not ""a lot.""  That cracked me up a bit.So, yes, salt did help generate steam. (I have city water.)"
1,"I love Buddy Wash, I also use their leave-in conditioner/spritzer on my shih-tzu/yorkie mix. The body wash smells fantastic and leaves him feeling smooth. It is also not irritating to his skin, which is good because shih-tzus often have skin allergies."
1,"I was hesitant to buy this product because of the price.  However I've been looking for a good, none oily sunscreen, which doesn't use animal products or harsh chemicals, so I thought I would take a chance.  I already have a drawer full of other, cheaper sunscreens which don't do well on my face.  I can get very oily from these products and therefore skip wearing it.This sunscreen was a awesome surprize.  My skin feels wonderful underneath it.  The lotion absorbs into my skin leaving it feeling soft and never greasy or heavy.  Then my makeup glides on it and overall my skin looks well hydrated and healthy.I am making this my permanent facial sunscreen."
1,"It's a thick texture and it does make my hair &#34;appear&#34; thicker.  I use this along with their conditioner.  The pricing is good.  Most organic/natural shampoo makes my scalp itchy, but this does not."
1,"helps with breakouts, like the acne gel better for spot treatments"
1,"I have tried several brands of sun screen looking for one I can use forever and be happy with.  Diagnosed with a Melanoma in Aug. 2011 it's extremely important for me to wear sun screen almost all the time.  Neutrogena goes on easy, it's greasy, and actually feels good on my skin.  I mostly use the Baby version though.  It's exactly the same SPF just not as controversial ingredients in the Baby version."
1,Good; Makes your skin glow like morning due :) and helps even out your skin especially if you have old acne scars. I remember using the generic version of this product from walmart and it worked great * same ingredients* I remember going to the mac cosmetic  store and I wanted to find out what number would be in their cover up. The lady already thought I was wearing cover up :PCons: I would not recommend this product if you have oily skin
1,"I absolutely love Natural Instincts products! They were the original semi-permanent hair color producer and they still are the best!! For those who are wondering, semi-permanent is definitely they way to go. I have tried permanent hair color and it dries out your hair and leaves a line when your hair starts growing. :( Semi-perm slowly fades away after about 30 washes so there is no drastic change or awkward lines.As for this specific color, Navajo Bronze, it is my absolute favorite! It took me about 3 or 4 experiments with other shades before I found this perfect one! I used the old formula and I disagree with other reviewers that this one is bad. My hair has taken to this new formula the same way and the 2 week color refresher is nice!!!I always get complements on my hair color. I mean like every day!! People always ask if it's natural, and I don't mind telling them that yes, it's natural, Natural Instincts!! Hehe!! People also comment on how it really brings out my blue eyes! Other shades seem to wash your face out, but this highlights your greatest features!It also contains no ammonia and makes your hair feel and look silky smooth for weeks!! I love coloring my hair and I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to look and feel beautiful!!!"
1,"I LOVE THIS,GREAT MOISTURIZER.WHEN YOU PUT IT ON PLEASE RUB IT IN AND LET IT SIT FOR A LEAST 10MIN BEFORE YOU APPLY YOUR MAKEUP OR PRIMER."
1,"This curling iron is perfect for creating big, soft waves on my shoulder length hair. You can adjust the heat settings and get it pretty hot if you have harder to curl hair. I really like how it smoothes out the frizzies as it curls, so my hair is wavy and smooth.  Because the barrel is so big, the curls aren't tight at all and I like that for a more casual look.  I'm really happy because it gives me nice hair without looking overly ""fixed."""
1,I just love this toner. It leaves my 66 yr. old skin so moisturized and soft. It deep cleans and contains NO alcohol. What more can you want?  I just found this product recently but I plan on reordering and continuing to use it from now on.  It is the best toner I can find in any price range.
1,"I love Elizabeth Arden deodorant and habe been using it for years.  The product smells nice, but it just seems over the years they put less and less product into the bottle and it empties very quickly.  None the less, I will be buying again."
1,I  love these gel toe spacers and am once again able to wear my 'regular' shoes comfortably. I didn't even know such a product existed before!
1,Love this cream! Have been using it off and on for over ten years. Initially started using it for PMS but now use it for menopause. it levels my mood.
1,I am trying lots of cleansers for their ability to take off eye makeup without stinging the eyes. I also happen to like a nice fresh smell; not real sensitive to that. This fails on all three counts.
1,Bought it for my future husband... each time i smell it on him... i wanna jump on him.  It's very masculine for my taste... but that's a very subjective opinion.  I do recommend!
1,Goes on smooth.  The shipping cost took away from the discount of the item.
1,Always loved makeup and my GMA gave me hers and I used it all and I was so upset cuz I couldn't find any at the stores then I looked on amazon and there it was so happy! It's so pretty and shiny and light.
1,"I shy away from scrubs & exfoliants (even though I really need it) because most products -- even those labeled ""for sensitive skin"" -- make my sensitive skin sting and burn! Not so with this scrub, and I couldn't be happier.I have pale, almost see through skin, as well as rosacea & extreme sensitivity. Though this product looked like it would be too harsh for my skin type, I decided to give it a whirl. I loved everything about it:The jar it comes in is adorable, and I feel great about all the natural ingredients. I love the smell - like figs or spiced cookies. It's a thick paste, you have to water it down to manage it, so the little jar will last a long time I think. The best part though is that it was so gentle on my skin, and still did a great job of clearing it up. There was a noticeable difference in my very first use, my skin was fresh and soft.This is the first time I've ever tried Burt's Bees products, I'd always avoided them for the cost and thinking it was just part of the ""all natural hype"". But I'm sold. I'm going to start collecting all the products suitable for my skin because so far the few products I've used have been amazing."
1,"Finally, I found a product that works effectively to reduce fine lines and smooths out skin. I have been using this lotion for approximately three months now and absolutely will not buy anything else. I have sensitive skin and although the lotion burns slightly when on my face, it is soooo definitely worth it! I have been told I look younger (late 20s, early 30s) than my real age (age 42). I can honestly see the difference myself - even, healthy, younger-looking skin. I'm very healthy but before using this lotion, I was getting acne on both my cheeks. I tried every acne creme from over the counter to prescription cremes and nothing worked. Since using this lotion, no more acne! I have to attribute this 'miracle' to my faithful use of this lotion in the morning and before bed. I also think it's because at the same time, I purchased the NUFACE microdermbrasion facial toning device which I use approximately three times per week. As another reviewer here noted, if you purchase the Alpha Hydrox products from their own website, you DO get it for slightly cheaper (with free shipping), esp if buying packages. I love amazon too!!"
1,"Have been using t his produce for over 25 years.  Believe it was use to cover  u p birthmarks on the face. It lasts almost forever.  Use it under my eyes and on my nose which is red from rosacea.  When blended with liquid makeup on your face it covers up dark circles.The products on the market do not totally cover up dark circles.  This does.My only complaint is that , like many other things, it has gotton smaller and the price has gone way up.  But it's worth it ."
1,I highly recommend this brush to anyonemakeup artist or notit is strong and has so many usesI love itits also not too big or heavyI have many of these; one in every kit for my business and one in every makeup I own:)love it! And I don't even use their products...this is good for regular makeup too not just mineral makeupGreta value!
1,"I bought this stuff because I have a number of skin issues.  Admittedly, it smells like a smokey fire, but this stuff works!  Totally has cleared up my eczema, and I don't even need to use moisturizer any more - and after only 3 uses.  I don't like taking a bunch of medicines, and this stuff is so effective that I don't need to use many of them any more.I would use this even if I didn't have so many skin issues - it leaves my skin moist and smooth, but not greasy.  It's better than even a good moisturizer.I guess you could argue that this stuff is a bit expensive, but when you consider that it really replaces moisturizer (for me), then it is cost-effective - and that's without factoring in prescriptions.Highly recommended."
1,"We all know OPI is great. This color is unique because its traditional but a teeny bit edgy... almost daring to be purple-ish. It's great for we older chics. Try it, think you'll like it. I love it."
1,"My doctor recommended I try this shampoo... I would say it's my favorite now, it doesn't cost much, it does a good job, it doesn't strip my hair (I have &#34;Einstein&#34; hair when I let it get longer than a few inches) or dry my scalp. Smells nice, but not &#34;pretty&#34;."
1,"This one of the better shatter polishes, I like the black as well, the coverage of the shatter here is good and very shimmery, great over any color polish."
1,It is great for your skin. It makes your skin feel light and super smooth. I love it but wish it was bigger. Other than that it amazing
1,"The blush looks very intense in the compact, however once it is on the blush brush, it is not as dark or intimidating.  It is very pretty."
1,"Makes your skin soft and removes the ravages of cold weather. Use all over and then shower off. I like both this and the brown sugar one, too."
1,"This is a beautiful Scent, I've gone through Five bottles of this stuff. I've gotten lots of compliments from wearing it, It does lift your spirits(:"
1,"I rarely see copper colors in the drugstores so I was happy to find this on Amazon. I've been coloring my hair red for years but I have found that the coppery reds are much more flattering. And as I tend to leave the mixture on longer than required as i usually get distracted, this does not leave reddish- purply tones. When I colored my hair today I left in on for an hour and it looks rich and gorgeous. Feria colors don't seem to fade as fast either. Great product."
1,This is the most stunning color of nail polish....you will not be disappointed.  This buying experience was a good one..will return again.
0,"I've had 3 of those brushes, and I ended up throwing all of them away. My skin is very sensitive and applying fondation equalled deep exfoliation for me. My skin would burn for a few hours after applying Bare Minerals on my face. I switched to the Mary Kay brush a few days ago, and it's night and day. In additionto being as rough as boar hair, they also shed and get messy."
0,"I've had problem skin for about two years now and have tried just about everything to treat it. After reading such rave reviews about this product, I figured I would give it a try. The pads work as advertised, but I didn't see any miracles happening with my skin. From what I saw, they had the same effect as the Clearsil drugstore brand cleansing pads. My advice is to save your money."
1,"These are really great and I'm happy to have them. Like others her I've never had a headband that didn't end up hurting my head, but I wear these all day long to help keep my hair in place if I have it back and it's cute. Great design with the little combs at each end because that's what make them so effective."
1,"I am in love with this lotion. I have pretty sensitive skin and this is the first lotion I've ever had that doesn't irritate my skin, dry it out or leave it oily. I'm very impressed."
1,"Absolutely love it!  I purchased the 1&1/4"" brush iron.  Instant heat is exactly what I got!  My last brush took about 1/2 hour to get fully hot but this little gem is awesome!  Been using for a couple weeks and haven't had one issue to complain about.  I love that I can adjust the temperature ever so slightly with the dial.  I was afraid the dial would be easily bumped out of its setting but it hasn't happened yet.  Love that I can turn it on and 30 seconds later be using it.  Love that I don't have to worry if I forgot to turn it off.I'm so happy, I will be buying another one.  This one will eventually need to be replaced and I will be mad if I can't find another.  That always seems to happen with my favorite things!  Not this time!Update 2/25/14Absolutely no change in how I feel about the curling brush. It's still just as good as the day I bought it.  I've still had no issues and not one complaint!  I haven't found a brush iron this good in many years. I am so glad I found it.  Thanks Amazon and Conair!"
1,"Used for about 2 months.  Did seem to help soften the wrinkles that I had started to notice.  Product absorbs quite well and isn't overly greasy although consistency is rather thick.  I have acne prone skin and dry skin areas and while it did not aggravate my acne it didn't really help the dry areas either (surprising considering the consistency).  I hate strong perfume-y night cream on my face when I'm trying to sleep (which is one of the reasons I don't care for olay products) and this product could pass exactly for a tub of margarine or butter for color, smell, and texture.  It was better than perfume but I didn't exactly love it, either."
1,I've been using this cream for years...great product and great price!
1,IT LIGHTENED MY MARKS AND IS VERY GOOD RO THE SKIN INSTEAD OF BUYING THE SEPARATE ONE I USE THIS ON MY FACE. GREAT.
1,"I have platinum blonde hair with darker blonde hair below and I decided to touch up my roots with this product. I followed the directions for root touch up - 25 mins on- and then evenly distributed the remaining product through my hair for 5 mins. The product did a good job of muting my brassy tones, and also did a good job of getting my roots- but...... my white blonde platinum streaks were dyed light blue from the blue-ing agent in this product. I knew that with dying my hair an ash blonde color that I ran the risk of some blue-ing, but I just wanted to warn anybody out there with platinum hair that this product will leave blue in your white blonde streaks! Besides that, it was a great product- plenty came in the kit for my medium/long thick hair. The kit also contains a pre-conditioner (magic), and some very high quality shampoo and conditioner treatments that are not sold anywhere (that I know of). I believe that this is a great product and I would recommend it to anybody looking for a nice quality dye in a box treatment."
1,"I was looking for something chromey and came upon China Glaze's Platinum Silver. It takes about 2 or 3 coats to get to a solid color and lasts for weeks, with a top-coat (I used Essie's)."
1,Like every thing in this world read the instructions first.  I have now used this product for 2 weeks and I have noticed a difference for the better with my face.
1,The product arrived on time from shipper. Over all I like the product.  I have sensitive allergy prone skin and after using the DHS Clear shampoo and this conditioner my allergy is gone.  I think DHS should remove the yellow dye from this product so that it would be more allergy free.  I have allergies to some dyes.  So far I'm doing well with the product.
1,"I've been a long time fan of Philosophy fragrances, particularly 'Amazing Grace,' and 'Pure Grace.' However, this is my first experience experimenting with the shampoo, gel, bubble bath line. I opted for the 'Cinnamon Bun' fragrance based on reviewer popularity.I couldn't wait for the first shower.  I had high anticipation that I would experience an olfactory delight --- that of walking into a bakery where 'Cinnabon' rolls were just being removed from the oven.  Was that my experience?  Well, not exactly. Yes, there is a cinnamon fragrance, but it is rather artificial with plasticky undertones.  That said, it was still nice.  But, as soon as the shower was over, the scent in my bathroom and, on my body, dissipated, almost immediately. This has been an ongoing complaint of many Philosophy products, including the fragrances that require frequent reapplication. I'm not sure why this can't be rectified. I have used cheap, grocery store shower gels, that perfumed half my house and I could still smell the scent on my skin the next morning. What gives?Although somewhat disappointed with the fragrance, I was pleased with how soft the product left my skin.  I actually forgot to apply body lotion, after the first use, which is always a post shower ritual for me.  I can see this product assisting with winter dry skin issues, so I think I will keep some handy, for that reason, alone. I do think I will try a couple of the other fragrances, too. Oddly, my hubby seemed to like this one more than me, so it's not a very feminine fragrance. It's one that can be shared with the entire family."
1,My favorite powder for shiny faces.
1,"If you use Bare Escentuals make-up, you cannot go wrong with this brush.  Just follow the make-up directions - swirl, tap, and buff!  When you apply to your face, you should not see products on the outside bristles.  If you do see it, you have too much on the brush.  Making sure you have not overloaded the brush will help avoid getting make-up all over the place."
0,"This is ok if you have normal skin but didn't impress me for oily skin. Cetaphil is an amazing brand but I wouldn't recommend this item for problem skin. If you have regular skin, it does smell amazing and would probably work great for you"
1,I use it after showers and also use loads of it if I get a sunburn. Works really well and keeps skin moisturized all day without a need to reapply.Smells great too!
1,"This is probably the best Henna out there. Lush Caca Brun is close, but different.Adding information that might help somebody: Henna myths busted.1. ""you cannot use henna on bleached hair"". Yes you can. color might be not what you expected, but you definitely can improve quality of fried bleached hair with light brown henna. in fact, it works much better then a toner to eliminate the brassiness and orange Goldilocks streaks, and you can pat yourself on the back for using something natural on your hair instead of yet another chemical.2. ""you cannot use other chemical dies after using henna"". i have no idea where this myth is coming from. in 4 years of using henna and chemical dies, in different combinations, never ever did i have any problems.3. yes, using henna after the perm will help you restore your hair. been there, done that.4. ""you cannot bleach hair after henna"". yes you can. result will be crazy flaming orange, but you can always tone it down or use henna over it to create new shades."
1,"love this stuff. smells great, cleans well. It will streak if you do not rinse thoroughly, but no qualms other than that. i feel better using this over other dish soap due to the ingredients."
1,"It smells wonderful! My cap arrived broken and I had to cover it with Saran Wrap, I could not contact them about it, I'm sure it will be fine with the plastic on. It was well insulated in the package and I think the only reason it did not leak was because of the shrink wrap holding the top together. I'm looking forward to using this! If you are using this in skin products, stay out of the sun, citrus and skin do not go together well."
0,"A completely unnecessary and strong stench: perfume I guess is what some people call it. I have seen estimates that as much as a quarter of the population is sensitive to these scents; some know it and some don't realize what is causing their sneezing, coughing, choking, watering eyes, headaches, feelings of malaise, difficulty breathing (!) etc. So why put scent in a product that is supposed to color hair? I didn't see it listed as an ingredient on the package; otherwise I would not have spent my money on it. Only when I used it and had to ride in a closed vehicle with someone else who is very sensitive to this allergen, did I realize the strong unwelcome addition to something that was supposed to cover the gray, not somehow change my odor.I THINK it does work to color the wisps of white hair I'm getting. But of course now I can't use it again. I suggest looking elsewhere for a product that won't make people sick."
1,PRO: It removes make up wellCON: It feels like baby oil is on my eyelids afterwardsI imagine the oil free version (looks the same but in a blue bottle) should be just rightStill alright
1,I did break out when I first used this but otherwise it's fantastic. It is the richest cream I've ever used. We'll see if it helps my wrinkes.
1,"Smells good and does an okay job, but for the price, its not conquering any major skin issues.  I expected more, and won't be spending so much again.  It was a nice treat, but the regular Oil of Olay daily moisturizer (about $8) does just as well."
1,"love it.  affordable, nice coverage, nice color, and I think there is something to the soy in it, my skin feels softer.  very pleased."
1,"I really think this keeps my skin smoother.  I am in my thirties and use a lot of the Olay products.  This is my favorite, I use it twice a day under my moisturizer (either Olay Regenerist or Olay night cream). Olay sometimes runs rebates on their website which makes this an even better deal.  I do the subscribe and save with it, to save extra money."
0,"[UPDATE] It looks like Eucerin has changed the formula of this cream, and it no longer contains parabens. Thank you, Eucerin! I will try it again and re-review it. My previous review is for informational purposes only.I used to use this cream, and I looooved it. It smells nice, and glides onto your face like frosting. Your skin feels luxurious afterwards. Then, I read an article about the potential dangers of parabens in skin cream and checked the label. Low and behold, I was very sad to see that Eucerin Q10 Anti-wrinkle cream contains lots of parabens. While we don't know for sure that parabens are bad for us, it sounds like a pretty good bet. Like BPA, parabens mimic estrogen and may lead to breast cancer, premature puberty in girls, and studies indicate that methylparaben applied on the skin may react with UVB leading to increased skin aging and DNA damage. I'm guessing that it's more a combination of skin creams, BPA, birth control, deodorant, and all the other chemicals we're exposed to on a daily basis that may be correlated to breast cancer, but why risk it. There are lots of other paraben free options, and Eucerin should really figure out a recipe for this cream that uses less controversial ingredients!Full ingredients list from the Eucerin website: Water, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Stearyl Alcohol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Tocopheryl Acetate, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Ubiquinone, Tridecyl Stearate, Tridecyl Trimelitate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Biotin, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil (Corn), Beta-Carotene, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/Hexacaprate, Carbomer, Titanium Dioxide, Alumina, Silica, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, DMDM Hydantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate)."
1,"I've been using this mascara for years and it's my favorite. It very rarely clumps, makes my lashes look great and feel healthy. I've tried many others and this is the one I always go back to."
1,This blush is so perfect! Great natural color. Blends well and has a hint of shimmer. Obsessed with the color.
1,"This treatment has being really efective.  My teenager girl was struggling with acne and tried lot of things, with no results.  These tablets are doing its work and the topic cream is the best she has ever had."
1,"I have suffered with skin problems all of my life.  Sometimes worse, sometimes better, but I always seem to return to the Aveeno.  My worst skin problems are always taken care of quickly by this lotion.  Definitely would recommend!"
1,"My daughter has very curly hair. Of course she likes to change her hair, now and then. This is a great tool to help smooth and straighter hair. It tames her hair to waves when she wants that look and makes it much easier to straighten for days she wants that look."
0,I'm asian and my hair is medium in thickness.  My hair uncurls once I get to the other side of my head.  I've used other ones that were better and lasted me more than one day without any sprays.  This one might work for you if you have fine hair.
0,"The cotton on these unravels every single time I use them! I didn't have any troubles with the stick bending etc, but the cotton issue is terrible!! I bought these since they were on sale so cheap - 2 bucks - but now I regret it.I usually buy generic ones at the Dollar Tree, for a dollar of course, and those work perfectly well and NEVER unravel on me. I figured for the price, I'd buy these QTip brand, but boy was that a mistake. I can't even believe these things are so poor in quality, but yet the price is premium. Ripoff."
1,"I bought this shampoo because I love shampoos that smell like peppermint and make my scalp feel all tingly, especially in the morning when I'm groggy and trying to wake up.  This doesn't have a peppermint scent at all.  The fragrance is sort of like a men's shampoo with some fruitiness to it.  However, it does do a good job of cleaning my shoulder length hair.  I like most of Suave's shampoos and use them all the time, but when a label says ""Peppermint"" that's what it should smell like.  I won't buy this one again."
1,I was watching a review on youtube and the artist used this shade of lipstick. It photographs beautifully and works well for any skin tone and especially shows up the teeth. I couldn't find it locally and was happy to find it online. I am glad  I did. It really is a pretty color. A heads up it is a dark cherry color for those use to wearing lighter shades of lipstick.
1,"I had a larger bottle in mind when I ordered this.  It does clearly say 33.8 fl oz but, from the picture, I had a gallon size jug in my mind's eye.  That's my issue, not the product or the product page.  I absolutely love the scent of this soap.  I had purchased the boutique glass bottle at a little mom-n-pop gift shop during a recent girl's weekend away and fell in love with the scent.  My husband does NOT like the smell.  The scent does remind me of a man's cologne...and what woman doesn't love the scent of a good smelling man?  Ladies, give this a whirl.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I hope not, anyway."
1,My Daughter luvs this scent. I bought it for her for her birthday in Feb. but I know she will be excited to get it !!!!!!
0,"EW!! GET IT OFF! GET IT OFF!I was unable to take home samples of the Philosophy products, and let the SA talk me into the $30 set of cleanser/retinol/moisturizer.I had high hopes for Hope in a Jar. But my gawd does this reek! As I'm sitting here typing this review, the occasional whiff of this craptacular moisturizer makes me sorry I didn't wash it off first.This doesn't have any kind of moisturizing feel or glide, it's like I rubbed liquid candles on my face. Stinky liquid candles. My skin feels tight, like there is a mask on it. A mask made out of the same stinky stink of the candles! My face feels very annoyed and irritated, to match the mood this smell is putting me in.If you can get a sample of it first, I'd recommend that. Or at least buy from a vendor with a generous return policy in case it doesn't work for you."
1,Works really well. For me almost to well as if i forget to wash my hands with regular soap after my hands start to peel after using for a month. It clears my skin up when it gets a little rough in the hot summer.
1,Just what I was looking for to replace my old hair dryer!  The options of hot air at a LOW speed is perfect.  Most other hair dryers require tornado force air to have hit air to dry hair.  This is the best of both worlds
1,"I found this shampoo at my local drugstore (cost a little more) and decided to give it a try. I was really surprised at how well it worked with my straight hair. It added lots of body to my hair. It didn't lather much, but that was expected. I need to try the conditioner now too. Great find!"
1,"Very good product, for face and other problem areas.... my face rarely gets pimples but other body parts do (very embarrassing!) I  have tried everything - for over 20 years - and this is the first product to eradicate body-pimples completely.However - -be careful who you buy them from - I have gotten products that seemed like they had been replaced with stridex pads. The PTR pads should NOT smell like alcohol - the scent is very nice.  I trust Payless Beauty and Flex Commerce - their products always arrive sealed and smelling the way they should!"
1,"You won't be disappointed with this product...that is, as long as you don't mind the lemon scent.  I use this product every day and have been using it for many months.  It moisturizes the cuticles so they aren't all white and annoying looking.  This is particularly useful for people like me who don't paint fingernails.  Professional manicures just never made my list of priorities.  Using this product makes the nails look ""clean"" and healthy.  I can't imagine being without it!"
1,I bought it because I needed a wide tooth detangling comb . I dislike the size of the comb it's too small however I do like the function of this comb.Glides through my hair.I would recommend it for mothers who need a detangling comb for young children.
1,"I got this for my hubby for Father's Day. The scent is nice and light, but lasts a long time. He usually wears Obsession, but this is a nice change for everyday wear. The price was really good too. I will order this again from the same company."
1,"Most of these cloths on the market are made of nylon and other inorganic materials. This one is 90% cotton and only 10% lycra and it is mostly biodegradable and also recyclable. It has a pretty surprisingly course texture but with soap applied it just feels really good on your skin and leaves you shiny and new! It gets softer with use and it is long so you can easily scrub your back. It did shrink in the washer but it was still quite usable. They are priced good too,  I replace them about once a month or so. Great exfoliating product I would highly recommend."
1,"Super pretty color, especially if you like a muted pink and prefer matte over sparkle or glitter, like I do.  OPI is the best nail color brand."
0,I'm so disappointed to find this product containing Methylparaben. Can they remove it? Maybe this isn't the real product? The one my sister has states NO PARABENS.
1,"I purchased this item not really knowing mud about it, just read up whatever it said on the tube. I decided to go ahead andbuy it.I LOVE LOVE LOVE this item. It feels very refreshing and cooling on the skin. Has a peppermint scent. However, not an overpowering one.Makes my face feel very smooth and clean after I take this off. I use this about 1-2 a week and i really enjoy it. Works wonderfully for me.I recommend this item if your looking for a refreshing masque, that will clean your face, and make you feel very refreshed!"
1,"I have been using this for about three weeks, seems like the smaller dark spots are fading but nothing on the larger darker ones.  It is real creamy and feels good on.  Will use this bottle and then decide."
1,this gets off those fiber water proof mascaras that you would typically need sand paper to take off.  I put it on before I wash my face and it comes right off.  I don't use tissue or cotton to wipe it off because I feel like it will take a lash with it.  But that's just me.
1,After using this for a few months I think the Neutrogena retinol and Serious Skincare brands work better.  The Alpha Hydrox Retinol doesn't seem to have lightened any dark spots or had any noticeable change in skin wrinkles or taughtness that the Neutrogena and Serious Skincare had after the same period of time.
1,"I really like that this stuff is mild and gentle, but also totally cleans off any makeup that I'm wearing, even waterproof mascara. I love the scent, very fresh and clean, and the texture is nice too. It washes off very easily and doesn't cause any problems to my skin. I have a problem with acne, and haven't noticed any improvement on it because of this product, but it definitely doesn't make it worse and really makes me feel fresh after I've used it.This is now my favorite nighttime cleanser because it's gentle, yet does an amazing job of getting my face clean and makeup-free at the end of the day. I love it for that reason, and will keep using it."
1,"This Conair Ionic was purchased after my other hair dryer fell into the pool.  Don't ask.Anyway, thinking the ionic part was just a gimmick but still hoping it was for real,  I got this.  It's a pretty thing, and on the small side which I like.I actually DID see a big improvement in the shine of my hair from using this!  My hair has more body bounce and shine, and just looks much healthier.  This seems to be less hot on the highest setting, and it takes a slightly longer time to dry my hair with this but I don't mind a bit because whatever ""ionic"" means, it works.  I am extremely pleased with this.  I don't find this any heavier than other hairdryers, as some reviews stated.I highly recommend this dryer.  My hair loves this.  Finally a hair dryer that seems to improve the condition of my hair instead of damaging it.  I'm so happy I got this!"
1,I've been using this and it works for me to stop places on my face from drying out.  This was the second time I've bought this product.
1,"this stuff works really well.  i have very blond hair naturally.  i applied  this and put a bad around top of my head to lock in the heat.  i left it on for an hour.  after i rinsed my hair, i had a really deep, dark brown color.  it does get lighter over time, but it still looks very natural.  now it looks like i have brown hair with blond highlights.  much better than putting chemicals all over your scalp."
1,"This facial cleanser is perfect! (Just so you know, I have combination skin and I'm acne prone.) It easily takes off my make up and whatever else happened to be trapped on my face! I feel so clean after I use it."
0,I've been using this for 2 months and it's nothing great. I have normal skin. Occasional break outs. This didn't do anything for me. At all...  I get better results from my black African soap and it doesn't have as many chemicals as this.
1,I love this stuff!  It's a great way to wash your hair when you don't have time for a traditional shampoo.  It cleans my hair very well.  I love it because curly hair can get very frizzy when you wash it.  My hair does not frizz up when I use this.  This shampoo also does not dry out my hair. I have very sensitive skin and this does not irritate me at all.
1,"First off, The description states that is had a paraben it it. IT DOES NOT!! Parabens are harmful to us , manufacturers like them because they preserve the shelf life of a product which is cancerous to our bodies. Alba botanica products do not contain parabens especially not this item. It is written in big bold letters on the bottle:No animal testing, artificial colors, prabens, phthalates, sodium lauryl/lareth or methyl sulfate. !!When I step out the shower, my skin looked so well moisturized, I didnt even need to lotion. It was radiant, as if I went to the spa. I loved the shine so much, Im excited everytime I use it. Unlike the minty version of this product this one has actual moisturizing benefits and I suffer from dry skin so that's a plus!It smells wonderful and what can I say its a great NATURAL product!!"
1,"I love to create a twist to an otherwise boring french manicure.  Instead of using white on my toe or finger tips I use dark colors like this one.  Other colors that work are Opi Lincoln Park at Midnight, Sephora, I'm with Brad,and Sephora 212 and add a translucent sparkle glaze over it like Sally Hansen Diamonds. You go from soccer mom to sexy mama.  This color Cherry Chutney is a dark reddish purple that wears well on my toes and easy to touch up if it chips if you at the salon add a flower ""gorgeous"".  LOVE IT!"
1,"I love this product, I was using this since I was 15 years when I had pimples, it just dried up the pimples and the black heads were gone, now my face is smooth. I did not have to use any other acne products. It helps with the large pores, apply it at the nite time and go to sleep next morning u will feel the difference on ur face, its more firmer and refreshing. The mint flavour feels so good on ur skin."
1,"I've used this brush to apply concealer for YEARS.  I love it!  It never sheds and it cleans really well with soap and water.  This is my first time replacing it, and I would say the other one lasted about three years.  Highly recommended!"
1,"First of all, thank you to all the other reviewers who persuaded me to give the Norwegian Formula Hand Cream a try! I can't remember the last time my hands were this soft... if ever.It took a little less than 7 days of regular use to smooth my rough, winter skin and now my hands are soft all the time and that includes after washing dishes.  There is no scent so the men in the household also did not mind giving it a try. I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from chronically dry, rough hands and probably will never buy another brand of hand cream again."
1,"A dermatologist recmnded this for reactive, sensitive skin. She's right . It's gentle yet thorough. Sometimes a gentle cleanser doesn't get the face clean but this one does yet without ""stripping"" it. No burning or ""drawn"" skin. Just clean & happy.It's oil free if that's important for you."
1,I love this color.  It's perfect for fall and winter.  I get compliments on it all the time and I will buy it again when I run out!
1,"Love the smell of this soap, gets soggy quick so keep in soap box. Use this on face and body. Doesn't dry out skin. Am 55, normal soap am allergic and drys skin. Not this. Kind of expensive so don't buy often, splurged for me. Still, very good product and I love most of the company's products. Have used for 25 years."
1,"Not perfectly, but it has helped to clear my son's face.  He is 15 and getting him to wash his face is a nightmare...at 15!?!  Anyway, he had pretty mild acne that absolutely came from not washing enough at 15.  This is so easy for him and it isn't too drying.  I have noticed a huge improvement with just this product.  One step is about all I can hope for at this point."
1,"This item was precisely what I ordered.  I am a regular user of this fragrance.  This purchase was a good price,and. It arrived promptly as promised."
1,great color and not harsh on my hair! i love this line because it gives you more of a natural tone and a little something extra for in between coloring your hair! worth the money.
1,"I bought this for a dance number because my leotard kept creeping up and exposing my rear and on one occasion exposed my ""kitty.""  So I bought this as a last effort to keep my pretty costume.  It worked amazing.  Everything stayed in place.Tips.1.Use it about an inch under the area you wish to keep covered.  For me this meant gluing the leotard to my butt cheek to keep it in place.2.make sure the garment is where it is supposed to be an not taut.  ie. don't try to stretch the fabric and hope this will hold it because it won't hold that well."
1,"For some reason or another I have problem skin. I used to use proactiv solution but my skin is way too sensitive for it. Then I used a litany of brand-name facial cleansing lines--but they were too expensive to maintain. I tried Stridex for a while but it just seemed to take my skin off. Nowadays I have stumbled upon the simplest solution (astringent). I wear lots of makeup throughout the day and if I don't remove all of it I tend to break out. I clean my face once a night with astringent, I put a little bit of lotion under my eyes and on any super dry areas, and then go to bed. Astringent, Lotion, Repeat."
1,"To be honest, I only bought this because I needed just a little more to get to $25 free shipping.  I'm  glad I did, because these are nice, comfortable headbands.  They really hold my slippery, fine hair, which is quite an accomplishment."
1,"I have mixed feelings about this product. When I first started using it, I can see and feel the difference. It actually started to literally peel the dark skin away. There's a bit of a sting but that's how I know it was working. My skin was lighter in just a couple weeks! However, once I've stopped using it when I reached my desired skin color, it went back to being dark. I applied more and suddenly it was no longer working. It didn't peel or sting. I wonder what went wrong or if it has an expiration date or something. Overall, it works but definitely not consistent."
0,"In the pan it looks mocha with subtle gold glitter, on the lid it is an extremely dark matte brown, almost just looks black.  Don't buy if you're expecting a shimmery mocha, the shimmer doesn't really transfer to the eye at all. But it does wear long"
1,"I should of been using this time a long time ago.  At 62 and have spent a good amount outdoors in California, my skin is in fairly bad shape with lots of wrinkles.  I started using this cream and the night cream 2 weeks ago and it has actually taken away the deeper wrinkles and smooth out my smile lines.  Hope it will do eve more as time go by.  I'm now a believer in Retinol."
1,"This shampoo is the best I've used. It's fragrance free, ph balanced, yet my hair has never felt better. It feels so clean after I shampoo and stays clean longer. I've recommended (and bought) for my daughter and she loved it also. I've used a lot of shampoos and this is by far the best I've found."
1,Nice smell same I brought from Europe but not long lasting. I don't know but not long lasting at all. I love perfumes long lasting. Daytime use with casual wear only.-HP
1,"This is a fantastic product! I cannot wash my hair without it.  I am so used to this towel sucking up all the extra water that when I just use a normal bath towel it actually feels weird to have all the excess water in my hair.  This also cuts down on a lot of blowdryer time too. I have fine, medium length hair and this works fantastic for me.  I highly, highly recommend this for anyone who wants to save time on drying their hair in the morning and get out of the door faster."
1,"This is awesome I love it, haven't noticed crazy differences but the red little bumps under my eyes seem to be going away. However I read on ewg that dickinsons version is safer and has less chemicals."
0,"I had to return this product because it is basically a placebo. You have to take it too many times and the results arent anything less than what you would normally get> I gave 2 stars because maybe I did not use it long enough to see the ""miracle"". I stopped using it in February and have since just focused on nuturing my hair, scalp massages and no heat and I have already grown 2.5 inches. Don't waste your money."
1,My wife loves this hair dryer. Its easy to use; drys and curls her hair nicely. Just make sure your hair is damp not real wet before putting it in rollers. Other wise your hair really won't dry or curl. The hair dryer will work better and you will have a full head of curley hair.
1,"If you are looking for a thick and heavy lotion this is not for you. This lotion is very fragrant with the smell of coconut, but it light and not sticky at all, great for every day use. Plus, all of the ingredients are all natural if that is what you are looking for.The only downside, is that if you are looking for that overly moisturized feeling, you have to keep reapplying all day."
1,"I've tried many products, you name it, I've most likely tried it, (proactiv, duac, Murad, dermatologica, skinmedica, differin,  epiduo, benezaclin, a bunch of stuff with SA or sulfur, and the list goes on and on)This cream works better than a lot of the prescription stuff I have tried, and it doesn't over dry your skin (which alot of the others do). When I feel a pimple forming, I put the cream on and it stops the pimple from getting bigger and it starts fading away immediately. I'm very pleased with this cream and totally recommended it because its much more affordable than the other creams and prescription creams with better results.I also really like the PCA blemish wash. It makes my acne prints fade away so fast! I also use the PCA clear skin as well."
1,"Weird... Of all products I try, I keep putting this one on my face. Goes on nice. Absorbs great. Not greasy. Fine for sensitive skin...IMO.Now, yes,, it smooths out lines. I'm heading to 40 and lines are starting to form. I noticed a difference in my three forehead lines, and brow line, within a week. Not kidding. Around the eyes?  Eh, not a huge difference. But definitely in the other two areas.Okay, only 4 stars because it is not permanent by any means!  Make note of this.  If I go out in the sun and wrinkle my forehead or brow line for a period of time, I notice the lines return. I've become mindful of my wincing and started to do less of it, ie a more relaxed face. As long as I pay attention and do not wince up in the sun so much, the lines do not appear back.So, all in all, I think it's a great product. Especially considering you can buy this at your local drugstore. Seriously, that's a big shocker to me.And as far as the new night serum in the tan bottle, I notice no difference. I actually like this product better. :)"
0,"I am not knocking it as a product. The smell was nice and the exfoliation was gently, but it did nothing for my combination skin."
1,"Doesn't stay all day.. It's OK, but definitely not the best. Will not purchase again.I prefer physicians formula or cover girl."
1,"This cream feels great and feels like it absorbs well. Unfortunately, it also seems to be slightly pore clogging since it causes small white heads.I also the had the tinted version of this cream and was not satisfied with it at all. It was too thick and did not spread well. The &#34;tint&#34; was more heavily colored than some of the foundations I have used in the past AND it just seemed to sit on top of the skin. As a result, the color would rub off in spot and look blotchy. In other words, it was terrible. This one is MUCH better, but it still doesn't cut it, really.If you want an AMAZING cream, see my review of the L'Oreal Ideal Moisture Even Tone cream. I really love it. http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P4OWBH1VSBUF/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B00AYWN8OY"
1,Our light fixtures are centered between our double sinks which means one side of my face is always in shadow.  This mirror has the small footprint I need in the limited space I have to attach it.  It folds away very nicely and the magnification is perfect.
1,This stuff is awesome. I have sensitive skin and this really helps to exfoliate but is gentle on my skin.
1,"I'm a girl that when I get my nails done or do them myself, I always choose the color black. During the Fall, black. When it's summer, black. Opening up Christmas presents, black. Even when I get my long talons at the salon, I practically have to fight the lady to paint them black (they always end up giving me weird looks for having such an odd choice of color on long nails) But anyway, this Luxedo color is literally black and purple. It's so pretty, but it is one of those 'might as well be black' colors. It actually kinda looks black. So if you love super dark, black colors, you might just like this."
0,This is not a clarifying shampoo.  Avalon Lemon is much better and the Old Pantene Clarifying shampoo which is no longer available was the best is you have a greasy scalp and dermatitis.
1,"I've been using Aveeno Active Smart Essentials face wash for some years now, but when I was running low and went quickly to the local CVS to pick up some more, I noticed the store was out and thought it would be great time to just try something new.  I'm in my late 20s and lately have been doing a lot more preventive care and changing of products all of a sudden as needed when you're body changes.This face wash is awesome! I love the consistency and find it to clean very well without  drying (thanks to it being sulfate-free) - even on the lazy days when I don't feel like taking off my make-up before washing.  It's been about a month now and I can honestly say my skin feels a lot tighter after using this.  I follow with Alba Botanica's oil-free aloe moisturizer (gold! - I'll review that too). I was surprised to hear that some experienced a burning sensation and thought it to be strong (glad I didn't read them beforehand).  I consider myself to have pretty sensitive skin (I can't even get an eyebrow wax without breaking out) and this didn't burn at all!  I try to stick to natural products and only explore sulfate-free and paraben-free options...I'll definitely be buying this once I'm out.  On the hunt now for a great eye cream. I'm a happy camper."
1,"Love it, Love it, Love it!  I have very oily skin and this leaves my skin soft and clean.  Used in combination withNeutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Cream Cleanser, 6.7-Ounce, my skin has never been clearer or felt better."
1,"They really don't hurt my head, and that's wonderful. Also, the design is very nice looking. They will break, so I've gotten several over the years. I used to find them at Wal-Mart but not any more. So I'm glad Amazon has them!"
1,"After a couple of times of using this, my scalp psoriasis has disappeared. I will continue using occasionally just to help with that.Update - This is working! I havent had any problems since I started using it. I use it 1-2 times a week now. I forgot to mention that it stinks... It does consist of coal tar so you can expect to smell like tar. I will use this and then a fragrant shampoo after to try to lessen the smell.I also have color treated hair and it has not caused any problems with that."
0,"I still love china Glaze polish but this is hideous. It's sheer frosty pink on it's own - over clear basecoat or natural nails....BUT  It's totally purple... if you paint it over any other color,no matter how light or dark - it paints over solid/opaque.  I thought from the sheerness of the polish in the bottle and the way it is on=screen, it would be a topcoat look with kind of rainbow of colors depending on the light or reflection.  BUT it paints over as a frosty purple/lavender.  I even tried it over Zoya Verushka which is a matte velvet dark forest green on it's own. Frosty purple, no hint of forest green-same with paint over candy cane red, dark burgundy, over pale pink or super bright pink, over Audrey Blue, Recycle Grey-you get frosty purple!.  You can tell there's a dark color underneath but just barely, and certainly no forest green or any other specific color.  On it's own, it's a frosty pink that looks like it could be a topcoat and changes color but not in a good way because it's all rainbows of pink, pink, pink-nothing else, no rainbow.  On everything else it just obstructs and ruins any decent color you have on your nails by making it purple.  It's just awful.They really missed the mark on this one - the least they could do is tell you what color the polish is.  I'm really fed up with looking at a gazillion web sites to try and find out what one nail color is supposed to be so I can buy it from the manufacturer or a seller on Amazon.  Why can't the sellers give us a clue?  Obviously the trendy thing to do is name your polish something fun or funky or crazy that has little to do with the actual color, and then the manufact. gives descriptions (and sellers) that are stupid, like ""if you're a such-and such person..."" ""If you like fast cars...""  WHAT?  How about ""If you like bright pink glittery polish""  after all, we are buying POLISH!How about telling us if it's a metallic, a frost, a cream, is it opaque or sheer, or, let's see WHAT COLOR IS IT!!!!I know...don't buy it online!  Here's the thing - first of all, everyone buys online these days so that's no excuse.  Second, because of my illness, I can't get out much, hardly ever, so I depend on online to get pretty much everything. I appreciate that I can finally get polish online but since the prices are typically ridiculous, and get more pricey all the time, and then the shipping cost is inexcusable in most cases, and then add to that the more and more stringent return policies that make it not worth returning, and the least they could do is give a three word description.Name  Sheer or Opaque  Metallic/Frost/Creme/Glitter  Color or Color FamilyI mean they have to tell us on the bottle what the ingredients are but nobody has to tell us what color it is when you put it on your nails?And then so-called Nail Polish/Beauty Supply stores online don't tell us anything, while making it impossible to return anything. Your only hope is that someone somewhere bought it and has the time and energy to write a review that tells you about the actual polish, not just the brand or the seller.Kudos to ZOYA and Art Of Beauty for being the one and only manufacturer/site who tells you exactly what you are getting from the polish on their website. Shame on any seller online who sells Zoya and is too lazy to copy the information about the colors of polish when they sell it on Amazon.Sorry for raging against the polish companies and online sellers but NOBODY should waste $5-$15 a bottle on what could be purple, red, pink, brown, who knows what color - you just have to hope your screen is close to the color and if you hate metallic or frost or creme, you can cross your fingers and hope it isn't the one kind you hate, and if you need opaque, you can hope it isn't sheer, but good luck on that one too.Ultimately, it's my own fault for buying a color called ""Rainbow"" that looked like a sheer topcoat that is a wierd sheer pink frost on it's own and lavender frost that is opaque with one coat if you paint it on ANY color.I hope this helps all of you who don't want to waste money on a pink frost/purple frost polish when you are looking for a cool topcoat to give a different finish to your other polish, or are looking for an interesting sheer polish that isn't just clear, but changes colors in the light. And I hope it helps anyone looking for a sheer pink Frost polish/ or Lavender Frost opaque topcoat and can't find it...here it is, no thanks to anyone in the business."
1,"I get little breakouts occasionally and because I have sensitive skin, I can not use the typical acne cream or gel, which is usually Benzoyl Peroxide. Because THIS product is Salicylic Acid, I can use it without overdrying my already sensitive skin.I compared this to the similarClearasil  Ultra 4 Hour Treatment (Tube) Gel 1 Ounce.and another brand's version of the 2% Sal. Acid gels, but got more for my money with this Clean & Clear gel.This literally does shrink my pimples to a QUARTER of their original size within a couple of applications. I tried the Rapid 4 hour treatment Clearasil and another brand offered, but there was no difference in its performance and this gel, which claims to take 8 hours. *****Realistically, it will take acne a few days to heal with any treatment***** so the best bet is to keep skin clean and treated, but not too dry.I have this handy gel in my makeup bag as my primary acne-fighting weapon. The thing I found with this is it can be put on OVER moisturizer and makeup, but can also be worn under makeup.My younger cousin who is in Grade 9 secondary school also uses this product and it works for her everyday acne. I would definitely recommend this product to my fellow 20+ year old female acne sufferers."
1,Easy on my hands when I am shampooing my dogs every week and it's easy on their skin and coat.  Smells wonderful.  The fragrance lasts a couple days.  I have used a lot of dog shampoos and this is the best.  I buy it by the gallon now.
1,"My number one criteria in a new face wash was that it had to be all-natural/organic.  From reading the ingredient list you can rest assured about what you are putting on your face.  But I also needed a face wash to take off a solid layer of foundation every night, and this product does just that!  It removes all my make up and leaves my face feeling squeaky clean.  I do need to use a moisturizer after washing both morning and night, but that is normal for me.  Does it smell good?  No...without any artificial perfumes, you can't expect a good smell.  It smells faintly of cheap bathroom cleaner, but it isn't that bad.  It is very thin; it's about the consistency of baby oil, except it isn't oily.  But even though it's thin, it lathers up better than any face wash I've ever used!  You can't dispense it from the refill bottle it comes in, so I put it in a cosmetic spray bottle.  That way there's no mess, plus I use a consistent amount of three squirts every time.So overall, I highly recommend this product!SummaryPros:all-natural/organicremoves all make upsqueaky clean feelinggreat lathereasy use in spray bottleCons:smellneed moisturizer (normal for me)"
1,These work great and are not the kind that are flimsy.. Good quality and durable.. I use daily and they are soft and the cotton is tight rolled and dont come unraveled in your ear like some cheaper versions!
1,Saying I can't live without this color is oh so true!  My nail salon doesn't carry it so I order it from Amazon and they keep it tucked away in a drawer just for me.  I continue to get compliments on the color...it's very natural!
1,"I am a little older and have basically ""normal"" skin with some aging concerns starting to develop - yet I STILL have occasional breakouts, and clogged pores in my T-zone. So I was looking for something that would clear my skin without over-drying. This cleanser did the job. Of course, I still use a moisturizer with sunscreen."
1,"I am white as snow but I was born with pretty funky curls. (I have since relaxed it and what not) I decided that since this is working so well for so many, it must do wonders for my hair. Well, I do admit that I felt good while using them (vitamin Bs can help mood levels) my hair didn't grow as magically as has been reported. I should have known because it clearly says ""For Ethnic Hair Growth"" but shame on me. I can't de-rate the product because it wasn't marketed for me in the first place, but I must warn any non-ethnic gal to stay away."
1,"I've been using Nivea's face scrub for years, and I would never consider washing my face with any other product. The scrubbing elements in this product gently scrape the dirt and dead skin from your face, and leave it feeling revitalized and really clean. If your skin is oily, or if you work in a humid or otherwise grimy environment, then you will certainly appreciate this scrub. I use it after taking a shower and/or right before I shave. I feel that even when my face is not particularly grimy, this scrub helps me get a smoother-feeling face that is much easier to shave. Overall, this is a great product that has become and integral part of my personal care arsenal."
0,This product broke my skin out and I have very strong skin.  I am unsure what happened but I got horrible acne.  My skin is not sensitive and I use other products without any issues.  So be cautious if you have sensitive skin when using this product.
1,"Ok I've had this  product for  a little over two months, and so far :my sensitive skin has improved ,and I feel like  its balanced out if I skip a day I don't get an imeadiat  break out  if I forget I washed my skin and wash it twice it doesn't dry out my skin.  And  again no parabens. Phylates , sodium laurel sulfate ... Its pretty darn natural  and the  bulk size just adds to. The value, even though a little goes a long way.the only think I would. Recommend  is since it is a liquid cleanser not a gel or goop , to get a good foaming  pump bottle  or a loofah ( the gentle kind your can use on your face)"
0,"Sulfates!  This product broke me out with cystic acne on my forehead, chin, and nose.  Also, it's very drying and I have super oily skin - like wash face at 8am and tiny beads of oil on my nose by 9am.  So disappointed by the product."
1,"It's a very small pack, but it holds enough.  I don't know why I thought it be bigger. Anyway, it's a great color. It is a purple/blue/gray that is matte and it's a great color for blue eyes. You can put it on dry and it's not overly intense or use it wet and get a more dramatic effect. This is a great shadow and it applies nicely.  Everything NARS does is great, both in terms of the unusual colors and application. I like the black cases, even if they pick up finger prints and I can't tell my blushes apart. Nothing spills, and it all lasts forever."
1,"When they say deep clean they mean it.  I have sensitive skin and don't normally use astringent products like this but right after I had my baby I was only getting the chance to wash my face about twice a week.  My normal cleanser (which I typically used every day) wasn't getting my face clean when used so infrequently so I tried this and it was a great find.  I understand why some people felt it was too harsh and I would never use it every day, but if you have oily skin and are only getting the chance to wash every few days this is a great way to go.  One problem was that it did dry out my lips if it ran over my mouth when I rinsed my face, so I spread a little petroleum on them first and that did the trick."
1,"I have found that for me, it doesn't pay to go cheap when it comes to nail lacquer.  OPI dries quickly enough to be convenient, but not so fast that I can't get it it on smoothly before it starts to get thick.  This is a good color but it was not what I was looking for. OPI used to have a color called Calendar Girl that picked up the pinks or the oranges of my outfit and looked great with both. This is definitely more on the pink side, but the closest thing I've found to my old favorite.  It has a bit of iridescence that makes it easier to apply than the flat colors.  I am a bit of a clutz, and I can apply this one fairly easily so that it looks good. It looks best with 2 coats and a top coat."
1,"The parsley hand soap has a wonderful, fresh and clean scent. I keep it in my kitchen and use it after cooking and gardening, and it neutralizes even tough food orders like garlic and onion on your hands. I wish they made this scent in more of their other products!"
1,I really enjoy this face wash. My boyfriend even uses it too! It smells great and makes my skin feel smooth and clean. I will continue to purchase this product.
1,"I use this as a night treatment about 3 times a week.  It is a good price, as some of the aha products don't have the potency of this, and are 3 to 5 times more expensive!"
0,I bought this for my son who is a chronic nail biter.  Unfortunately it didn't work at all.
1,"I have been using this powder foundation for 5 years and I have tried others along the way, but nothing compares. Living in Hawaii where the weather is very humid forced me to back off the liquid foundation because it would just melt off and look awful. So in searching for a powder, I decided to try this one. I've always had a little bit of light acne and redness on my face. This powder does a great job of covering up blemishes and redness with out looking like you've caked on liquid foundation. Its definitely not full or heavy coverage, but it makes imperfections on the face way less noticeable. After I moved back to the mainland I wanted to go back to liquid foundation because I knew I could get full coverage and hide everything. Well the problem with liquid foundation is it makes you break out and it gets messed up every time you want to wear sunglasses. PLUS it takes a while to apply.... So I save a lot of time and I save my face from loads of acne by just going minimal with this product. If you are someone that insists on using liquid foundation, this is a great setting powder for it as well, you get some serious coverage."
1,This product is amazing.  I had a terrible breakout and I put this ointment on it (I'm a huge grapefruit seed extract fan).  I woke up the next morning with little redness and no swelling.  I highly recommend it!
1,This 5X magnification wall mount mirror gives perfect viewing size for makeup application without distorting ones face. It tilts to normal view on the reverse side. The mirror is easy to install and extends far enough from the wall to make it easy to view while standing to view oneself from in the mirror. The mirror size captures the entire face.
1,"Give it 2-3weeks and I gaurentee you will be glad you tried it, it is light and thirst quenching on the skin and seems to cover a multitued of tasks, you will not need seperate creams for eyes etc. My tip is to use it a s a night and day cream after gentle washing and exfoliaiting the face. By night put slighty too much on so as the skin has to slowly drink it in.You really will see a plumpness and radiance to your face in this space of time. This stuff is not bank breakingly expensive either."
1,"I really like this color even though I was hoping it would be closer to a burnt orange color (since I'm a UT fan), but it's still a really nice color and as always (in my experience, at least) Essie's polish is top notch! Now, if only my manicure skills were on par with it's quality...Thanks again, rockandglamorize!"
0,I went by the directions on the package. You keep adding layers of filler. This made my nails a grotesque yellow color.
1,"This is a very pretty crimson color, perfect for the holidays coming up, it goes on very smooth, it's not gooey. Dries pretty quick, and the color lasts pretty long, depending on what type of cleaning you will be doing, like the dishes, I put on a dry fast top coat by "" Seche Vite"" it's not oily, it really dries my nails quickly!! And I did my nails about 4 days ago and they still look pretty darn good! And it keeps my nails nice and shiny. I only put a top coat on dark color nail polish, if I don't, if my nails get dragged against the wall or our white cabinets you see a dark nail polish line then I have to get my Cutex nail polish remover to get it off the wall or cabinet."
1,"Picked this up at a health foods store...I've become a huge fan of Plantlife items!  Cassia Clove is a good option for men, since it has a musky, spicy smell to it, though I use it as well and I'm a chick.  I've smelled pretty much their whole line (Berry, Green tea, Patchoulli, Cedar Sage, Sandlewood, Lavendar, etc), and in my opinion, the top two soaps are Cassia Clove and Vanilla Orange, by far!!!!"
1,"I have long, naturally curly hair and I can't wash it every day or it breaks and uncurls and looks like hell. So I've been trying out dry shampoos. This one works pretty well but not great. Maybe it's better for people with less hair? I don't know."
1,I love the Olay Regenerist line! Moisturizes your skin and makes it smooth. You will see a big difference after the first use! I've been using this product for 2 years now and just recently started the serum and it's great.
1,"Philosophy products are very eye catching.  Their smart, clean looking bottles and the cool names given to each.  I work with skin care products and don't always believe what they claim.  There are usually far too many claims to be made that simply can't be done to someones skin.This product however, is pretty good.  It's a fairly good moisturiser that could honestly sell for less considering the cost of the product, but it does do the job it promises.  The only problem I have with it, is that for someone with sensitive skin, there is far too much frangrant extracts in here.  It cannot be good for sensitive skin.  I'd recommend this to Dry skin people only."
0,I wear red nail polish all the time and liked amazon's price! Its hard to tell what a color would be without actually seeing it. Needless to say this was not my style and has been sitting.
0,"I purchased a facial steamer along with this to help keep my pores open and face wet while using this product. I used this several times, and with the steamer got my skin hot and wet, but this product does absolutely nothing. As far as other users saying it needs good grip to get the right amount of suction, I had this thing pulling my skin up into the small opening, but nothing cleaned out of my pores. Get a good cleaner, a soft facial brush, and the mud masks (that you mix from a powder) to get your pores clean. I did keep my steamer because I loved the way it softens your skin and helps with absorbing lotions. This is garbage."
1,I have had a difficult time finding a face wash that really cleansed my face and didn't make me have breakouts.  This works great for me.  I have oily skin and it does seem to get all of my makeup off.
0,"I have long, thick, and straight hair. I bought this curling iron because I wanted to curl my hair for special occasions. This curling iron doesn't curl my hair much at all. All it does is make a little wave at the very end of my hair and that is when it's set to the highest setting. Pass this curling iron, especially if you have hard to curl hair."
1,"I use this under my eyes almost every day under my foundation/ helps to counteract purpley or blue dark circles. thick, pigmented and creamy but still blend-able but not too wet so it doesn't blend away, stays where I put it well."
1,"I have tried this product a few days and it seems to work great so far.  It is easier to apply than the liquid type because it does not run.  It does not cover 100% off gray hair, but it cover enough for it to blend in.  I find it very convenient to use while I give my hair a break from color treatments.  I highly recommend it.My husband uses it as well and we think it works well enough to continue using. It blends in grays and it is not so time consuming as hair dyes (which in his case, being a man with very short hair, it grows quick!)Very highly recommend this product!"
1,"I do love this fragrance but even when I layer the Falling In Love body wash, body lotion and the perfume spray, it does seem to fade a lot faster than other perfumes. Falling in Love is a really great scent so when I do wear it - I will continue to refresh the scent with an occasional spritz throughout the day."
1,"I waited a LONG time before writing this review because I wanted to be REALLY sure that this product was working for me.  At first, I was using it along with another product in the Alpha Hydrox line,Alpha Hydrox AHA Souffle 12% Glycolic AHA 1.6 oz (45 g), and experiencing problems--it turns out that I was sold a container of the Souffle that was actually several years old.  Whatever the cause, I stopped using the Souffle and have been using only the Enhanced Lotion alone for a few months now, and my skin is looking better than it has in years!!!First, a little background information about me.  I am currently in my early 40s.  As a teen, I had very oily skin but only mild acne problems.  In my late 20s/early 30s, however, I began to experience increasing issues with adult acne.  Although the problem wasn't severe, it was quite persistent and recurrent.  I actually went to two different dermatologists and tried various tropical and oral medications with little success.  (The only thing that really worked was Accutane, but that became WAY too cumbersome to continue to use given all of the requirements surrounding prescribing it.)After that, I experimented with using various over-the-counter products, always with mixed results.  More recently, I began doing some reading on alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs).  I did a lot of research of various products both here on Amazon and on the web site Makeup Alley, and after my failed experiment with the Alpha Hydrox Souffle mentioned above, I decided to try this product, the 10% Enhanced Lotion.  I am amazed by the results!  Within only a week or two of discontinuing the Souffle (which made my skin break out even worse) and using the Enhanced Lotion alone, my skin was MUCH clearer.Now, after using this product daily for about two months, my skin looks great: NO blemishes!  I do occasionally get a small pimple or two (usually around the same time in my menstrual cycle), but when that happens, they fade very quickly, leaving no scarring behind.  Also, I am starting to notice that the old acne scars I had from before I started using the Enhanced Lotion are FINALLY starting to fade as well--that is taking longer, but it IS happening.I use this product twice a day.  You only need a very small amount, as it is thin and spreads easily over the entire face.  At night, I will apply the product slightly more generously.  (It definitely does sting a bit; this occurs with all AHAs.  You can minimize this effect by applying less or trying a moisturizer on top.)  In the morning, I will use only a tiny amount of the product (or sometimes skip it altogether), and on top, I will use Olay Complete Lotion for Combination Skin with SPF 15 - 6 oz., which contains a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA; salicylic acid) and also SPF, which is important when using AHAs because of increased sun sensitivity.  This combination seems to be working well for me.  I haven't really needed much extra night-time moisturization given both that it is summer and that my skin tends to be more on the oily side anyway, but when I do, I have been usingSt. Ives Fresh Skin Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer 10 oz (283 g).I am thrilled to have found a skin care regime that is not only working for me but also consists of very affordable products.  Definitely, this Enhanced Lotion by Alpha Hydrox is the cornerstone of my routine, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it highly!"
1,This color is good for someone who doesn't want to have to redo her nails every other day.  Little chips do not show.
1,Smells great and my little girls really enjoy the lingering scent after washing the germs away. I prefer the basil scent as my absolute favorite and will be going back to it after we work our way through these bottles.
1,Love this. I started Nu Derm 3 weeks ago but just added the toner. It's helped a ton with the irritation you get while doing Nu Derm.
1,"Neutrogena Body Oil is an added extra....something good especially through this exceptionally brutal winter. However, for me, it doesn't work as well in the shower as I expected it to.  I love Neutrogena products and decided to try this.  It works just OK during the shower.  I even do as instructed...use on damp skin w/o rubbing off. I must say though, I find it works much better when I use it in the bath.  Maybe it's the fact that it has more time to penetrate into the skin.I have sensitive skin &amp; therefore I'm really comfortable w/Neutrogena's light products.  I may have to get something a little stronger for the shower but for my baths...it's good!"
1,"Finding the right shade of red for nails is a tricky business.  You must know what color bases look good with your skin tone. I tend to find red nail polishes skew either too orange, or too wine colored, when I really want true deep dark red. A power color that suits me. This is it. This is a deep rich color that looks classic and sophisticated. A real power color."
1,"I have been trying to find amber butter for years! I couldn't even remember what it was called but this is my favorite ""perfume"" ever. Great product, arrived fresh and sealed and exactly as pictured!"
1,This is the first time I buy this product and will definitely buy it again. It is really a good buy!!!
1,I'm 46 and have been under a lot of stress lately. My period was 5 days late (something that never happens)and my breast where killing me even after I started to bleed (something else that never happens). Also started having a weird flush feeling. No sweating and not at night but during the day when I got rushed or upset. Did some looking into natural permenopause treatment and found this stuff. Read the reviews and picked up some that night at my local Sprouts. Just after 3 days I had relief from the flush feeling and my breast stopped hurting and slept so much better. I also noticed that I'm not trying to stay awake in the early afternoon anymore. I'm really glad that emerita is available for me. I'm even happier that it's helping me.I think it's well worth the money to try it.Best Regards.
0,"I don't understand why this had such good reviews.  For the price, it didn't work as well as I thought it would.  I should have just saved the money and bought the one from Ulta that I've been using for years that's only $4.99."
1,This product doesn't match up with other Essie polishes. It's streaky and thin and it takes several coats to make it look decent. I think I'll grab a different brand from now on when it comes to white jelly polishes. Don't get pulled in by the name. This polish just doesn't cut it!
1,"This is so far one of my favorite colors for OPI. It looks exactly as its name indicates, naked, and of course sexy."
0,"Sorry, not a lot to say about this except I used it as instructed and there was absolutely no change or growth in my hair. The only thing I got from this was a really and long term upset stomach. I use Biotin and Mane 'N Tail now and my hair has grown about 3.5 inches in a little over a month."
1,Love this lotion.  I think it is the best out there.  I don't use any other lotion out there this is the best.
1,"This powder really does what it says, controls shine! I have relatively shiny skin, especially in my T-zone, so I have to dab it on there & it takes the shine right out. I don't have to continually re-apply, which I usually find myself doing with other shine free powders I've tried. My typical coloring is nude beige & this soft cameo matched my complexion perfectly. I will say that I am using L'Oreal Paris Magic Nude Liquid Powder Bare Skin Perfecting Makeup & they work perfectly together. I don't have to use much of either."
1,Great detangling comb. The handle makes it nice and easy to use. I use it every day to keep my hair manageable
0,"I tried to like it.  Good shipping speed, good price, packaged well.  But it doesn't smell like sandalwood to me, not even a tiny bit.  It smells very synthetic and just not good; too sickeningly sweet.  Sigh.Also, I would like to mention that when it arrived the roller ball was broken - stuck inside the cap.  FYI - it is not returnable, to anyone thinking about ordering this.  I've emailed the seller to ask how they will make this right and am currently awaiting reply."
1,"I love this color, it is so dimensional, each time you move your hand, it changes from darker to lighter. I would highly recommend it. Like all OPI nail polishes, this one doesn't disappoint."
1,"my poor hands, cracked, peeling, painful, terrible hangnails, cracked nails, painful skin. this cures all of it in like a day. it's just like all the other reviews say. i garden and do a lot of housechores (we're poor as dirt so i'm always cleaning) and this is the only thing that's ever worked. i actually love the smell. and it rubs in super quickly, or perhaps it's my hands that suck it up so fast... either way i use it every day. i lost my last jar and had to replace it as i was in hell without it. thank you badger balm."
1,This oil is real good and works so well on breakouts. One little drop is enough for the face. This has become a must for my dresser.
1,"I live in a climate where humidity of 10% or less is not uncommon.  The skin really suffers but using this product has put an end to the dryness on my face.  I faithfully use it daily (sometimes both morning and night) and it makes my skin feel hydrated, plump and velvety.  I have been using it for many years and it has kept my skin looking fresh and not aging like I am sure it would if I hadn't used it.  I have even taken some to my mother-in-law (in England) and she loved it, too.  You will not be disappointed with this regenerating serum--it is the best thing you can buy without a prescription!"
0,"This is definitely not new, The cover is broken, the product is totaly not new. I really don't want to buy this product again!"
1,"I feel the need to write a review of this product mainly because of all the reviews saying its caustic.First let me say I am a soap maker and run a very successful business making cold process soap. Sometimes I don't get a batch made for myself and I have to buy some,so this was convenient and I bought it even after reading some of the terrible reviews. I have several means of testing soap for caustics I used every single one on this bar before using it on my skin,this soap is in NO way caustic! It's a pretty nice basic soap, a large bar, and came at a good price.When I neglect to have soap made for personal use I will definately purchase this product again."
1,I like the steam hair curler set. It creates great nice waves and they lost a long time. I also like that it's using moist heat which won't be as damaging to the hair. (I think.) Just be careful not to burn your hands. I was careless a few times.
0,"Check the ingredients, do your research. One of them is Methyl paraben combines benzoic acid with the methyl group of chemicals... Highly toxic, you don't want to be letting parabens absorb in your face! And anything with unnatural coloring and fragrance is really not good for your face."
1,"I've been using this toner for a few days now, but after 2-3 uses I've noticed a difference in the the size of my pores. They shrink after a moment or two after putting it on, but the effects don't last after I wash my face. I probably need to use it for a while longer like other people have said before I notice a somewhat permanent result.On the other hand, it successfully removes a lot of dirt that's been clogging my pores! I can see all of it on the cotton pad and I'm surprised by how much junk is left on my skin after using my cleanser.I do have a problem with the smell. It's probably because of the alcohol in the product that's making it a little too strong for my taste. The alcohol also stung my skin the first use, but it's gotten significantly better. Does not dry my skin out at all.I use it mainly in the morning before I head out and during the day when I need a pick me up for my skin (:Overall I give this toner 4 stars! Recommended for oily skin (I see less oil on days that I use this toner)"
1,"I had a curling iron with teeth (only way I know to describe it) about 30 years ago.  It disappeared somewhere along the way, and I have wished I could find another one for a few years now.  But I never found one in any store.  Then I came across this one on Amazon.  I love it.  It accomplishes the same thing as the old one, which is to smooth out my hair after I have blow-dried it without adding unwanted curl.  Of course, you can use it to curl your hair if that's your pleasure."
1,"Fantastic round brush! I use his brush for straightening my thick, wavy hair and love the results - I even bought one for my daughter."
0,"The iron heats up well, but the barrel snags my hair which. Makes it quite difficult to maneuver and get my hair curled"
1,"I have been using this toner for quite a while now and love it.  The smell is divine (like roses) and it really does a nice job of removing all traces of oil, soap, make-up, etc. without drying out your skin because there's no alcohol in it.  I'm going to stick with Thayers!!!!  I like that it contains natural products like witch hazel."
1,"There is nothing quite like this zesty cuticle cream. It feels silky and creamy all while turning dry nails into lemon scented shimmering health. I started to use this product when I lived in Seattle, WA and it was one of the first Burt's Bees products I ever found. I was hooked.IngredientsSweet Almond Oil, Lanolin, Beeswax, Lemon Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate & Tocopheryl (Vitamin E), Cocoa Butter, Candelilla Wax, Rosemary Extract.If you buy this cream and a lip balm product you will be amazed at how much more comfortable summer and winter can be. I've been known to rub this onto my elbows and feet before bed. Many of the products have multiple uses and this one smell so delicious you might have to go out and buy lemons and make a lemon meringue pie.~The Rebecca Review"
0,"I ordered this for the price and the notes of fragrance, ordered then read the reviews. I would never wear this cologne, It is too subtle and faint smelling. It smells feminine and may smell best on a female. The seller did a great job packaging and shipping but product is inexpensive for a reason."
1,"Even my baby still 1,5 years, I already tried this stuff on her thumbs which already flatted for being sucked a lot. So I just can't wait. Unfortunately she cried and vomited for the taste very bitter(which I tasted too).  I realized for applying covered almost the whole thumb's nail. Then I applied a tiny bit, she sucked her thumbs and surprise...never suck again just like that. Even more she the one asked me to apply when she find out no more bitter taste on her thumbs when by coincidence she bite them. And her thumbs no more flatten."
1,I purchased the Ski Til We Drop and in the picture it shows a very beautiful blue so I fell in love with it instantly and bought it. I am disappointed because it is VERY dark in my opinion and looks nothing like the color on the nails in the picture. To me it's more of a dark navy color which I wasn't expecting.
1,"This lotion is very good and the product is one I buy often, so yes I would suggest you try it and do as instructed.I will buy this product again from this seller.  The price is right, shipped on time and wrapped well."
1,"it is very useful for me, especially in autumn and winter part of my body starts to be very dry"
1,"I am a fan of NARS creme eye shadow and am a bit disappointed with the powder version. Color is fine, nice neutral, everyday color but I need to wear eyeshadow base to make it work."
0,"Hi I just bought this product a few weeks ago off of amazon. I have just been putting it on the underneaths and corners of my eyes to hopefully stop more wrinkles from appearing there.The box does say that you will have irritation the first few times you use it. So I used it for two nights. On the third day under my eyes were scaly, swollen, and red. My throat was hurting and swollen too I think from the allergic reaction.My eyes are finally starting to feel better three days after not using anymore. I am just disappointed that this product had such a strong reaction and wasted my money.If you have sensitive skin I wouldn't use this product. If you do buy this do small test areas."
0,"I tried this product because I feel like I've tried everything else for my acne prone skin.  While other people reported great results, I did not see any improvement."
1,"Good astringent, smells terrible though like dirty socks! [...]Check out all the ways you can use it and try it out."
1,"Love this whole line of sun care products, but they are becoming increasingly hard to find. I sure hope they don't  discontinue this one, it great for early summer to get your tan going. Spreads on easily and smells fantastic."
1,"Great product!  Made my skin smoother without irritating is (unscented version).  I really liek Aveeno and the price on Amazon was cheaper than the store, plus it was delivered right to my house!  I will definitely purchase it again!"
1,"Este cepillo es excelente para mi cabello, la diferencia es enorme, ahora solo necesito la mitad de tiempo de lo que necesitaba anteriormente . Mi pelo tielo mas volumen que cuando no uso este cepillo. Estoy muy satisfecha con los materiales usados en la cerdas ya no no maltraran el cuero cabelludo."
1,"I use it for last 5 days together with Horse Chestnut and Butcher's Broom supplements , I work in office and sit all day long in the chair, and each year mysterious in summer only getting pain issues with my legs and heavy swellings  and restless legs , I am tall with low blood pressure so that may be the reason , however after 5 days of using the cream 2 times per day morning and evening  the swellings reduced to 80% , I tried everything else but the cream working so well , I hear that the cream working even better with an extra dose of ascorbic acid ( Vitamin C ) , also noticed to going to the ladies room more often than usual , I believe Horse Chestnut is response for that as it increase kidney functions , I can't tell much about the spider veins as it is to early to see any improvements and I have 2 of them on the side of my feet .. but my major issue was the low circulations in my legs and a lot of walking make it even worse with the swellings so I am glad the problem got reduced and I believe in about a week my legs will return to normal. I wish the cream last longer.. I ordered 2 and one is already half gone so it will not last long as the jars are like face cream jars ..so small 2.25 ozThe cream absorb so well so not sticky , however it have some funky smell , like wax mixed with vaporub but it cool off the legs so nicely so that is more important .. if my 2 spider veins vanish until I finish the 2 jars I will let you know ..regarding the swellings and pain it work straight away so here 5 stars from me !"
1,"I have been using this product for about four or five months now and I have seen an improvement. I have combination skin, my forehead is oily and my cheeks are dry. I use this at night before I go to bed and my skin is soft and I haven't been breaking out on my forehead as much as well. It is the only product that has shown me results like that.I also have a wart on my finger and I put some of the witch hazel on that and it is also making it less noticeable as well.This bottle last for a long time, I am just a little under half way done with it now. I just put a dab on a cotton pad every night and wipe it around my face. I was doing it in the morning and at night. In the morning I put on face wash, this toner, and moisturizer but it did seem like too much for my skin and when I went to just putting it on at night and the face wash and moisturizer in the morning that is when I got the best results.  Nights when I forget to put on the toner I can definitely tell the next day.I just love this stuff!"
1,"Had not seen this product for years, then noticed it on-line.  After purchasing it, I remembered why I stopped using it 20 years ago.  It's really strong smelling.  Although I get good reviews from my husband and others who smell it on me, I find it a bit overwhelming now.  Can't say how it would be on you.  I do recall that guys used to love it when I was in my 30's and dating--which is always a great sign, but I don't recall it being that strong when I put it on.  I find WISH is wonderful and much milder, and get great reviews from people when I wear that perfume now."
1,THIS IS A GREAT 'SOAP.'  IT CLEANS VERY WELL AND RINSES EASILY.  I USE IT FOR BOTH FACIAL AND BODY.  IS GENTLE AND DOES NOT DRY OUT THE SKIN.
1,"I bought this for my sis because she has sensitive skin and most anti aging products irritate her skin, but Eucerin is very gentle and doesn't irritate the skin at all."
1,St. Ives does the job for me. I used the regular apricot scrub but turned to the gentle one after wondering if the product was to harsh on my skin on an everyday basis. I used this Gentle product everyday and have great results. My skin is clear and soft. It seems to do the job of the regular apricot scrub without the general harshness of it!
1,"This soap is AWESOME! I first found it at a discount store and the single bar lasted 8 months. I wash my face with it twice per day. Olive oil is the perfect for any skin type. Its nature's perfect moisturizer. The bar itself is extremely large so that it will not fit in a normal soap container. I was tempted to buy two just in case but its so large I will have it for awhile. Now that I think about it, I will buy more at the current price. You never know when it might go up in price."
1,"Love this stand.  Been looking for another good one for years, and finally found this one.  Great for hands free drying, and if you have long hair, and use a round brush....this is for you.  Fits most dryers, and keeps the dryer off the vanity.  Great for styling.  Also if you have problems with shoulder, or arms, then even better.  When I had shoulder surgery, this saved me.  I was able to dry my own hair.  I use it everyday."
0,"i didn't expect the outcome to be orange. i expect healthy hair and shine.. yeah, whatever... too much praise for this product. i hate it..."
1,"As a woman nearing 50, I need all the help I can get, especially as I don't wear foundation. This serum goes on silky smooth and leaves my face soft and supple. It makes a perfect base for powder and blush, working almost as a primer. I originally tried the scented version of this, and the scent was very pleasant."
1,"All the neutrogena are very effective when it comes to anti wrinkle and acne fighting, only draw back if you are prone to have sensitive skin like me, be careful how much you apply, and how often you apply it, otherwise it will really dry your skin out and your skin becomes very itchy.So make sure to follow the directions, do only apply to the effected area, stay away from anywhere from the eye area, about 1 inch at least, and try it out first and use it every other day or so.Even as I keep my Neutrogena products on hand for emergencies,:) , for the day to day use you maybe want to check out the Lush products that are also on sale here on Amazon. Dream Creme, amazing moisturizer(also for people who have dry skin due to Caner treatments !!!!) , Vanishing creme, amazing moisturizer for acne prone skin, deminishes redness, acne scars, and Herbalism, an organic cleanser."
1,"Been looking for a bubblegum pink polish, found this one at the nail place and they used it for my nails and I had to get it afterwards! It's a cute color with a pearl finish. It takes 3 coats to get a really great color though."
0,"Not for Sensitive Skins-- Perfume is UnnecessaryWhy would a company put such a heavy perfume in a facial moisturizer? It seems that the majority of the negative reviews are because of the odor.I usually use Clinique, or Bare Minerals which is completely fragrance-free. Even then, I sometimes get reactions (usually to chemical sunscreens that are in a lot of day creams).This product is not a good choice for women who have sensitive skin. It didn't make me break out, because it actually burned and I had to take it off immediately. This product contains Diazolidinyl Urea which is irritating to a lot of people (including me).Conclusion: Lots of good reviews, so I guess it's worth a try, but skip it if you don't like perfumed moisturizers."
1,"I agree with the other reviewer that the names indicate lighter hair color than the actual color. I have dark brown hair with reddish highlights and I mix 5N and 6N, Light Chestnut and Dark Blonde, about 1/3 and 2/3 respectively. The ""dark blonde"" is really medium brown and the ""light chestnut"" is much too dark for me by itself. I am also 10-15% gray/white and this product covers beautifully and is permanent."
1,"I've been wearing this as long as they've been making it. I only wear clear because I'm very fair complected and color looks weird on me. My lips are small too so I prefer just gloss. It has a very subtle sparkle and will keep your lips conditioned. It's not sticky like so many are. It's very easy to apply while driving or sitting at a light. When I finish a tube, I take an orange stick (for manicures)and scoop the rest out from the base of the tube. Then I put it in a small plastic container. You wouldn't believe how much is left in the base! Probably at least another month of usage."
1,"I bought Nail Envy on recommendation. I actually like the Nail Strengthener as a base coat better. I still have some peeling of my nails but not near as much as a basic base coat. The Nail Strengthener seems to stick a little better and not peel off all in one piece like the Nail Envy. No harsh smell. It dries quick, too."
1,"I hate the smell of witch hazel so i ordered this rose scent. I was a little worried that it would be an overpowering scent cause i get headaches very easily, but its not, it smells very light and rosey and goes away after a few minutes. So if your sensitive to smell i would actually recommend this product."
0,"I am sure that this shade is not as pictured on the website - even making allowances for computer differences. Also, the polish is thick and apparently old. One coat is too thin and two coats is too thick and chips easily. Quite a disappointment. Unfortunately, the return or replace policy is non-existent for a &#34;hazardous&#34; material. I'm out $8.00 with no alternatives."
1,"I love the lavender scent and the consistency of the lotion.  It doesn't take a lot to use as a body lotion, and it absorbs pretty quickly."
1,Good mirror at a good price.  I can put my eye makeup on so much more easily when I can see what I'm doing!
1,"I mean, I have nothing bad to say about this face wash, only because it didn't gave me any negative side effects. My acne didn't break out more by using it. I like that it was organic and it has a very strong orange fruit scent. It smells very good but I could never tell if it really cleaned my skin all that well. Either way, it served as a great emergency face wash when my regular face wash would ran out."
1,"this hot hair brush detangles my hair and gives beautiful curls.curls may vary ,just depends on how you work it.heating is perfect and love the grip too."
1,"I would highly recommend this ceramic hair dryer. Excellent workmanship.  Indeed, very high quality, and quite handsome.  RECOMMENDED.  DAME HILDA"
1,"Got this product within 3 days of ordering it. And normally I just the bottle of witch hazel and normal cleansing pads, but this is 10x better! I'm mixed so my skin can get very oily for no reasons and I've found out that witch hazel is great for drying my skin and removing pimples within the same day of using it. Also! I had my nose pierced twice so it works for my healing process."
1,not all lashcurlers are the same... and definitely will pull out your lashes if you don't use it correctly!  i like that it's easy to find replacement pads; of course the curler itself if made to last forever too!
1,"I love this perfume. It smells so good. I love to put it on, especially after a bath or shower. Has strong staying power, so you don't need to apply it often."
1,"I have very, VERY breakout-prone skin, and this serum has yet to cause any problems for me. It's smooth and light, and I feel like my skin has looked smoother since I've started using it. I don't think it's made much of a difference for any marks or blemishes on my skin, but the texture of my skin looks better now. With the warmer weather, I've been using it alone (without any other moisturizer) at night and it's doing a great job on its own of keeping my skin moist."
1,Love the coverage because product is light and does not break out my skin.  Beautiful color and easy to apply.  Will buy again.
1,"I was not very happy with the actual scent of this body body, it has a more synthetic smell than I was expecting but it was cheaper so I guess I got what I paid for."
1,Best ever....Miracle of Aloe Miracle Hand Repair - 8oz QTY: I bought several and it is the greatest product I have ever used.
1,"Ok, this is simply, hands down, the very best and healthiest way to curl your hair. I have heard numerous people say that they liked the salt version better, so , here is a way to achieve that same look. After hair is clean and completely dry, spritz with a beach (salt spray) to each section and let dry (just a few seconds) then wrap that section. BOOM! I love Davines' but any quality beach spray will work. For all you healthy hair nuts (myself included) try the Wen cleansing conditioner before using this great product. You won't be disappointed. If you are gonna steam the shield, be sure to zap curls with blow dryer due to the fact that the steam in the shield can make hair wet and you won't get results. I learned this the hard way. ugh. Don't hesitate, buy this today. It's cheaper on here than I have found anywhere else. Good luck!Licensed Beauty Pro"
1,"I've been using BareMinerals for a few years now...  The makeup is great, makes my skin BETTER than before and looks very natural.  The only reason I didn't rate 5-Stars is because I can't build up enough coverage to cover my dark under eye circles, but the Bisque works great for that anyway :)"
1,"I bought this brush in both the regular size and purse size.  A must for long hair extensions.  No pulling, just smooth brushing."
1,"i bought this the other day because for the first time in my life, i have dandruff. i'm not sure why it took 35 years for me to develop this problem, but hopefully this shampoo will always work like it has been for the past couple weeks. after exactly one use, my scalp felt so much better that i didn't mind the smell. it definitely smells like you'd think coal tar would smell: i told my boyfriend i smelled like an asphalt plant and, being the heavy equipment operator he is, he clarified that i do not smell like an asphalt plant but rather, a coal miner on a lunch break. so sweet, that guy.  but i digress...i was hoping for a stronger menthol, tingly, cooling sensation than what i got, but it doesn't really matter anymore because my itchy, red, angry scalp is calm now. i'm pretty impressed. i used it on my patches of extremely irritated skin and it most definitely calmed the itch on those as well, but then i smelled really strongly of the tar. the smell is so strong that i am sure some people would be afraid to use it but if your scalp is itchy enough, it's totally worth the smell. and if you shower at night, the smell is gone by morning. would recommend."
1,"Really like this cream. It smells great and makes my skin very soft. I only recommend using this at night, because the smell is too strong for during the day."
1,"and it's ok. I noticed one little patch of eczema I had is gone and it lathers well. .but it also kinda leaves you skin with that ""tight-soap"" feeling. . especially if you've used Dove other soaps feel like ""soap.""..but it was worth a shot."
0,This literally did nothing for my skin.  You're better off buying a glycolic acid cream and using emo oil as a moisturizer.
1,"I have always had straw like course hair and to my utter amazement , this product in combo with the conditioner , eliminated the straw like feel. A little goes a long way and washes out clean. I  have medium length hair so the price is not too much BUT for long hair , it may not be such a  good value."
1,"This review is for the &#34;Danke - Shiny Red&#34; color (since products seem to be mixed on this review page) although a lot of what I have to say will apply to the entire product line.I can usually get away with using cheap nail polish on my toes.  I they don't come into contact with other surfaces that can cause chips.  But I was having a hard time finding a nail polish that lasted on my fingers -- I'm pretty hard on my hands -- so I decided to try something a little higher-end.This polish does a pretty good job on both fingers and toes, as it turns out.  It's still looking good on my toes after three weeks (with Essie combination topcoat and base coat).  It lasted for a couple of days on my fingernails, as well (with Seche Vite quick-dry top coat).  It probably would have lasted longer but I have to use my hands a lot -- I type all day at work and then I have to come home and do all sorts of household chores that chip away at fingernail polish.This goes on very easily and is highly pigmented.  Two coats were all it took to get nice, full coverage.  I found that it dried quickly and that the color was a lovely, shiny red -- just as advertised.  I hope to get many uses out of this bottle, and I now am a fan of OPI polishes in general.  Definitely worth the extra money."
1,"Works decently. And definitely helps, but it doesn't completely solve the problem. It also usually wears off kind of quickly. So it is a must to reapply like daily so that it continues to be strong to the taste."
1,"Okay, so it's quite a bit overpriced.  I have a ton of different moisturizers.  I really like Cerave and it's a fraction of this price and also of my Lancome moisturizers.  However, Philosophy has so much hype surrounding it that it can afford to charge an arm and a leg.  I can't tell you exactly how this will affect YOUR face.  Everyone is totally different, and the opinions on HIAJ are VERY polarizing.  People love it or hate it, and not a lot in between.  It makes a lot of people break-out, but totally transforms and brightens other people's skin.My advice is to first get a sample of the stuff before buying a big jar.  My mother-in-law bought me a bunch of little samples of Philosophy products for my birthday and said if I liked them, that she'd buy me the full versions.  I have been on the edge of purchasing this before on my own, but the really mixed reviews stopped me.  But the idea of getting smaller-sized ones first is great.For me, the results have been quite good.  First, it feels AMAZING.  It's a soft, silky mousse that is by far the BEST feeling moisturizer on my skin that I use.  It feels very nourishing and brightens my skin.  I've had great results with it and love it, and requested the full version.  However....WARNING WARNING: the stuff smells NASTY.  Some people claim to like it, but I have no idea how anyone could like this smell.  I can't even describe it...it's just very, very gross.  The good news is that it goes away for me in about 10-15 minutes, and a lot of people say it takes just a few.  And FYI, I am NOT someone who is usually sensitive to smells.  At all.  So the fact that I noticed it means something, I promise.  But I can stomach it for a little while to have luxurious skin.However, if you can't shell out the cash for this - don't worry.  TryCeraVe Moisturizing Lotion (12 oz)or plenty of other cheaper alternatives with great reviews from picky skincare people who CHOOSE those cheaper brands over the more expensive ones.  But if you like HIAJ and can afford it - go for it!  Packaging is adorable - always a plus."
0,"I BOUGHT THIS Avalon Organics: Biotin B Complex Thickening Conditioner, 14 oz AND THE SHAMPOO AND USED IT DURING THE WHOLE 2012 AND NOT ONLY DID NOT THICKENED MY HAIR BUT IT MADE IT VERY DRIED."
1,"I have been using this product for nearly twenty years, and back when it only was sold in salons, it was just as good. I never thought much of the matching shampoo, conditioner and hair gel, but this stuff still rocks; it is a legendary product. This has a wonderful sea scent to it and it really hydrates my hair and finishes my makeup. It used to be referred to an an all-purpose skin and hair product. This stuff really agrees with me and I will always use it wherever I can find it. Ebay may be your best bet folks! Awesome, awesome stuff."
1,I love this product!  It's so good at keeping zits at bay!  I use it on my body and even on my face and everything has cleared right up!  I didn't have sever acne but just regular zits here and there and now they are all gone!!  Please bring this product back!
1,"Glass bottle meant allot to me. There is no trace of chemical smell/fumes . Natural ,as it described on the label-I guess;) A bit on a weak side,but maybe its just my stuffed nose (seasonal allergy ;)"
1,"I will not use any other moisturizer after using this. it's absolutely helped even out my skin tone and from someone who's used a million different face moisturizers, this has boded as the best for my combination skin."
1,"This is a pretty good product. I've used other shampoo bars before and this is the best so far but I opt to find even better so still on the search for the perfect shampoo bar.  I have curly/wavy/frizzy hair so I need something with alot more moisture, but if you have fine hair or normal hair then this product is A-OK!"
1,"It's very comfortable after use, and the skin feels soft, moisturized. I feel this one is better than the one for dry skin, and easy to clean up away. Definitely will purchase it again!"
1,"I purchased this for my husband who has skin allergies.  It was actually recommended by a doctor who also has skin allergies.  My husband says that It lathers well, and he likes it.  He is still getting used to the fact that it has no fragrance in it because that usually triggers for him a clean feeling when he can smell the scent of the soap on him.  This has no fragrance.  He says that he still feels clean without the fragrance smell."
0,"I did not like it because it left white residue on my face and neck. Plus, my face broke out when I applied it. I was disappointed."
1,"I don't know what's in this perfume, but every time I wear it I get compliments.  Even my son stopped me the first day I wore this and pulled me close to smell me, and said, &#34;mmmmmmmmmmm,&#34; which says a lot seeing as I wear perfume every day and he has never done this before.  It will be one of my signature fragrances, for sure.  Great price for a huge bottle, as well.  A little goes a long way, and I smell the fragrance all day as I move."
1,"I have lots of very fine, straight hair. This comb is perfect for styling my type of hair. The tail is well-shaped and comfortable against my scalp, and the teeth a well-suited to both smoothing and teasing. I have been purchasing this particular style of comb for about a decade now ... and I don't plan to get anything else as long as these can be found anywhere."
1,"For really irritated hands, Aveeno Hand Cream Intense Relief with Natural Colloidal Oatmeal is IT! My hands have actually been so dry that the skin was cracked and hand washing and drying was torture. THIS PRODUCT was the solution. No other hand cream on the market can match it's ability to protect so well that the skin can begin to heal. There is no perfume or medicinal smell. Works like magic!"
1,This stuff is awesome.  I use it all over on my skin.  This is also a great price on this product.  It has a fresh sort of lemon-y scent.
0,"I am glad that this works for some but as all should be aware,everyone's mileage will vary and there is no single wonder cure that will work for eveyone. Beyond the arguments made in the scientific community concerning the efficacy of this product in regard to progesterone replacement and the cancer warning that some have noted, I was apparently one of the select few - given the reviews here - that has experienced negative side effects. I was hoping that this product would provide a natural option to level out some of my periodic hormonal roller coaster ride days. Unfortunately it raised my blood sugar at such an alarming rate that I had to discontinue after a short period of use. Immediate raise upon starting + immediate drop upon discontinuing = no question this was not working to my advantage. This was also accompanied by water retention, fatigue and a bout of extreme moodiness which was not what I was shooting for. I thought is important to share as I had searched extensively for any guidance on potential side effects and found the info spotty at best in regard to potential impacts on blood sugar. In this case, I am sticking with the professionals to address moving forward as this was not the silver bullet I was looking for."
1,"This product smells like a campfire and if you are in to the outdoors, you may like the smell. I use it for my eczema rash and for my PUPPS rash pre delivery. It worked pretty well."
1,"I use this once or twice a day after I wash my hands, or after I do my nails. I like it because it absorbs easily, and though it has a pleasant almond fragrance, it is not heavily fragranced, which is important for me especially because of my sensitive skin, though we all need to avoid irritating ingredients in skin care products--especially ones, like fragrance, that have no function for skin, nails, or hair. I intend to get more applicators of Solar Oil for locations around the house as I empty everything else, and buy in more bulk!"
1,smells really good and gets rid of all the make up. kind of burned my eyes a little bit but i usually rinse my face after i use any kind of make up remover so it was no big deal.
1,"I have very sensitive skin and this lotion works great with my skin, it does not irritate it at all. It makes it smooth, and silky and very even in tone. It doesn't clog my pores, and handles my dry t-zone. I am a huge fan of Aveeno and have now found my new face lotion!"
1,"I've been intrigued by this product line for a while now. I have very thin, brittle short peeling nails thar don't grow quickly at all. What I wanted for my nail care was an overall system that would help resolve the issue of the peeling, encourage growth and strength. Nailtiques has a multi steps system with products to correspond to each step in the system to resolve all those issues.Unfortunately I bought the wrong product. At the wrong step in the system. It was an expensive mistake.The protein formula 2 plus is rather like the last ditch effort if the initail products don't work to resolve any peeling, breaking and strength issues. I don't realize this, and I have used the product (even if it is out of order, it was too expensive not to try) with some success. My nails did get stronger, but the peeling persisted and I can't be sure if its because I lacked a step in the system or if this formula really only resolves the lack of strength issue.Over all I probably will not buy this, or any other Nailtique products again -- though the oil is nice. But really, why spend so much when a little effort, patience and Sally Hanson's does the trick?"
0,This stuff is nothing special. Leaves a tacky film on my skin. Try the Tehani Salon skin care anti-aging products. I found those to be better Amazon Products.
1,"The color of this polish in person looks very different in person- a good different! This is a great, wearable orange that leans towards coral. It's a nice, bright color without being too much. Not too neon, not too tangerine, just a nice, bright orange with a hint of red/coral. The formula is great, no streaks and completely opaque with two coats."
1,"I am adult nail biter and let's say I've fought this battle since I was little. I have went in and out of phases where I bit my nails, sucked my thumb, etc. since the womb! After wearing acrylic tips for about 10 years, I finally said enough was enough. I bite my nails, especially during peaks of anxiety and I needed something that was going to help counter than anxious habit. After reading reviews, I bought the Mavala Stop and I am glad I did! It has been two weeks of use and let me say, it works. The polish DOES NOT taste good at ALL and it does leave a horrid taste in your mouth. Eating foods with your fingers is tricky because this polish makes your entire finger taste something terrible. I usually only need to apply about two coats per day since I wash my hands a lot and use hand sanitizer frequently. To counter the smell, I let the Mavala dry for a few minutes and then apply some natural, scented lotion to my hands so shaking hands during business meetings won't be awkward. It's been 2 weeks and I can say I see some growth coming in and I haven't bit my nails. I have tried but the taste is repulsive!"
1,"This toe spacer is really good. I have a bunion and it becomes painful especially in the winter when all I can wear is closed shoes. This spacer makes the bunion less of a pressure point against the shoe, it straightens your toe so that the contact point becomes the entire side of your foot and not just the bunion against your shoe. Keep in mind that it will take you a few days to get used to it, start by using it when you have short errands and build up to wearing it for a full day. Also some flat shoes like the ballet flats may be exposing more toe than regular shoes, which means that the toe separator may show so definitely take it with you when buying a new ballet flat if you want to make sure its not exposed. Other than that, I highly recommend it, your feet will thank you!"
1,good price good product good presentation i recommend the product you can buy it several times excellent bran and you can be confident
1,I purchased this oil conveniently form my local Whole Foods market- it works great and is worth the price given the fact that it is organic- works great as a hair treatment.
1,"After reading the other reviews of this product, I ordered it reluctantly, wondering if I had just wasted my money.  The first time I used it, I followed instructions from another reviewer-making sure the skin was wet, not using the mister, using the small nose cup, etc.  I didn't really feel anything, and got out of the shower thinking that I had indeed wasted my money.  I was quite surprised when I looked in the mirror and saw that it had worked!  I now use it every other day and definately recommend it."
0,This Burt's Bees cleanser left my skin feeling greasier after I used it than it was before.I have normal-oily skin and this is definitely not a good cleanser for that skin type.  This cleanser might work really well if you had very dry skin.It does smell nice though.
1,"I have been looking for a replacement for my Jilbere including contacting the company.  A friend told me about this one and I ordered 2, will likely order 2 more for back ups.  This is a perfect finish styler as long as u don't use the brush bristles which can tear the ends of your hair.  I recommend this unit to all my clients that have hair 4 inches or longer.  Again, this is a FINISH styler and not intended to drive your hair from the beginning."
1,I have only been using this for a few days and I have already noticed a marked improvement in my skin.  My fine lines are diminishing and my pores are smaller.  I have very sensitive skin and this has not caused any redness or irritation.
1,This is a pretty nude polish for those day you just want something simple but elegant. Can't beat a beautiful nude polish.
1,"I use this twice a day. It doesn't grow back all or a lot of hair, but at least it's enough to help. I did stop using this once for about 3 months and it is true that the hair that had grown in while using the product, all fall out when I stopped using it. There's not much out there for Women when it come to hair regrowth, so any help is better than none."
1,I like this concealer brush. I've been using it for about a year now and I wouldn't switch it for anything else.
1,"Neutrogena oil free moisture SPF 15 is amazing. The bottle has a little pump that makes it very easy to dispense. The product goes very far and you only need a little bit. This product is great for people with dry/semidry or combination skin. It helps combat dry skin in the places that need it without adding additional oil. It is also good to put under makeup. It causes much less foundation to be used up due to the fact that the skin is already moisturized. It also has SPF 15 which is great for the summer when you're not outside for long periods of time. (For long periods of sun exposure, I would suggest a higher SPF.) This product does smell a bit like sunscreen so there's no secret to what you're using!"
1,Very nice face cream.  I have never tried Aveeno before and I love it.  I can feel the softness of my skin after the first week.
1,"I have 3 cats and one little shihtzu that is piddle pad trained so I wash my hands dozens of times throughout the day.  They get so dry that they crack and hurt so I was looking for a good hand cream that didn't feel heavy or leave a greasy feeling.  Hard to find one that does all that, but this one is perfect!  It absorbs right in and feels so light, yet leaves my hands feeling so soft.  When I first used it, my knuckles were actually so cracked they were bleeding and that cleared up in one day of use.  It has an amazing scent as well that make it a total winner.  I just ordered another bottle to have in my kitchen.  Love it.  Totally satisfied with price as well because I have paid much more for a good cream."
0,"I purchased this based on the good reviews I read, and had confidence that it would live up to them. It didn't. This mascara smudges and smears very easily. It's allergy season, so my eyes tear a little... but just from that it streaked under my eyes! Other mascaras don't do this at all. The mascara goes on nicely and separates your lashes well, but I can't give it a three-star rating because I can't use it and had to throw it in the trash."
1,"This is simply a mind blowing product!  I don't get pimples very often, but when I do, I need something that works effectively and fast.  Each time that I have used this product, it has delivered amazing results.  I simply apply it to the pimple as soon as it erupts and usually with an hour the zit is dried up or gone.  NO JOKE!!!  This stuff works!!"
1,"This great product, sit with all the natural oils I use on my body and hair, I also use it in my new line of hair product that's has all natural ingredients and it's important to me to keep that standard of healthy living with no harsh chemical that you will put on your body and hair.Recommend it."
1,"I love how this stuff makes my hair feel.  I spray it in after I wash my hair and towel dry it, and then I brush my hair after using so it gets evenly distributed.  The only thing I'm not fond of is the smell.  It smells like shea butter, and I've never been a big fan of that scent.  I use it either every day or every other day.  It doesn't leave my hair greasy or weighed down."
1,"This is a very nice facial cleanser. Nice moisturizing feel on skin, but did not completely remove mascara. I'll keep looking."
0,"I have normal skin with very minor ""acne"" this mosturizer made my face look so greasy. If you have extreme dry skin then this is totally for you."
1,"Love this product!  This product is often hard to find in the local stores.Have been using this product for a number of years, and it leaves my face feeling so soft!  And, I love the smell!  Also, love the dispenser -- dispenses just the right amount.Terry"
1,If you have 4C hair get the brush with 4 rows. Trust me. Cause I brought the 6 rows and it almost pulled my hair out I had to remove 2 rows.
1,"I've been using this for years. It's a great astringent and very cheap at Wal-Mart. However, don't use it more than twice a day. It'll strip your face of all your oil and make you break out like crazy. I think the alcohol content doesn't help either in terms of acne. So, I'm going back to Thayer's alcohol-free brand."
1,"This is really a great bar for bath, even for face, if you use soap on your face; I do, then follow with my good Acure Day Cream.  I recommend this soap bar."
0,"doesn't hold my curls very well. Took a long time for the curls to even hold, it felt like i was holding this curling iron in my hair for at least 5 minutes per section. I would curl my hair and spray the curls so they would hold but within an hour they had fallen out."
1,I used this product to make my own Verbena hand and body lotion.  The scent is okay but has a very artificial smell - in fact - every time I use the lotion people tell me I smell like lemon pudding. Not sure if that is good or bad...
1,I used to like this cream because it is a good moisturizer. I liked how my face felt after I put it on. But I can not attest to its firming capabilities.
0,"Don't think there is a significant enough concentration of retinol in this cream to make any difference whatsoever. It has a nice texture and light feel, so I've used it up as a day cream but that's about it. No results to report. If you are seeking results, go with Babyface 2% retinol Night Renewal cream."
1,The product works great!  My only complaint is that is smells like an old lady!  Do they sell a fragrance version?
1,"Wow...I didn't know natural cocoa butter was so solid. No wonder people prefer to buy the synthetic stuff. When I first got it, I would always have to microwave it every morning or dip it in hot water to melt it because it's so solid. I always hope it will stay liquid, but it goes back to its solid state by the next day! I got tired of heating it up so I barely use it anymore. Pros: smells excellent - smells kinda like chocolate! real chocolate. Yea...so does anyone know how to keep in in a liquid state?"
1,"Item is moslty used by my wife, she has very sensitive skin and it starts to crack if using regular washes, even some of the gentler ones. she has been using this for a while and finds that it is the best wash that she has used so far."
0,"I work full time and go to school at night so I was looking for a product that I could throw on in a hurry that was able to stand in place of make up. I have combination skin so a moisturizer was just what I was looking for. At first I LOVED this product! It covered quiet well and was very moisturizing. However, I only wore it for 4-5 hours at a time while I was in class. I later tried it on a weekend and noticed I had some minor break outs. The more I used it the more I broke out. Then I noticed there is SHIMMER in it! If you have acne shimmer will accentuate your break outs. Awful!Pros:Coverage; Not quite as good as make up but able to stand inSmell; VERY light smell of sun tan lotion, other than that unscentedFeel; It goes on pretty thick but absorbs into the skin well so you don't feel too greasy. Heavier than my normal face lotion, thoughSPFCons:SHIMMER!Caused break outs"
1,These rollers work very well with the Caruso steam hairsetter. I have some from my original purchase.  I just needed more.
0,"My first box worked great: lessened forehead furrows temporarily, stayed on all night, felt like really firm construction paper, were difficult to remove. I would have to wet and slowly peel to remove. Second box: didnt help much bc they often came off, felt flimsy. I have to glue 3 together to get the same effect. Very disappointed. I think company changed paper and glue. I wont continue to use."
1,"Great nail polish brand and great color for spring/summer 2012. However, as with many neon polishes, it is best to have a white base coat underneath so the neon color ""pops""."

It is soap-free so it won't dry out your skin. I've also used it as a moisturizing mask.For a quick face cleanse try smoothing this luscious yet lightweight cream all over your face, just take a warm washcloth and wipe it all off.

1,"This toner is gentle and smells great. I have oily, acne prone skin and this did not irritate my skin or cause me to break out. I also loved the fact that it did not stinng. With that being said, it didn't do much to help treat my acne, so my seach continues for another toner. If you have dry skin, I would recommend this toner b/c it is not drying."
1,"used for a couple of hours, just to test it, it didnt smudge,or cake, i dont like a thick coat anyway,i want to my lashes to look as natural."
1,"This covers in two coats. It has such high shine and lasts so well I don't need a top coat. It looks beautiful, like the dark cherries you see in the supermarket in springtime. I received several compliments on the color. Beautiful!"
1,"I hate scented products since I'm sensitive, but I really like the non-medicated smell. The product is creamy and I do not feel the need to scratch my heat after shampooing with Nizoral. Great travel size!"
0,It did make my hair soft the first time I used it but after it dried it was really hard and stiff. To me it was not worth the time and mess spent.
1,"Although i have very good skin, I have a birthmark on my face that I like to cover. I've been using Revlon Colorstay foundation for a decade and like it. Upon recommendation, I tried this and find that it covers better than any other products I've used. It's on the greasy side, so I wouldn't recommend it for oily skin type. It's definitely not a &#34;light&#34; make-up, so unless you really need the coverage, I wouldn't recommend it. If you need a good coverage, I can't think of a better coverage than this."
1,No bad reaction on my very sensitive skin and I believe it is helping to get rid of a bad dry rash around my eyes.
1,It's impossible to decide so I basically have them all. I had to get a lipstick organizer. I like the sheer ones they're easier to control for a daytime look. This tanganyka seems to work well with any winter outfit
0,"This product is not what I expected. I'd never used a BB cream before, so I guess I wasn't sure what to expect,  but this cream does nothing for me. It actually makes my skin feel greasy and doesn't do what the description says. I would not purchase again. Not worth the money."
1,"For those bored with the same old bottles of shampoo an hair products at their local drugstore this is a fun new way of washing their hair with no chemicals and natural botanicals that truly do wonders and enhance every single hair.This solid shampoo bar works wonderfully; I had my doubts just like everyone else, and was worried that this would remove the build up but leave the hair overly squeaky clean and stripped, and if it would later at all. To my surprise this small disc turns into an avalanche of bubbles once I wet it and rub it between the hands. I also wet my hair and rub the bar all over, working with the lather form my hands and the lather from the wet bar. I have to admit that this produces more lather than liquid shampoos and washes the hair without leaving it feeling like it was tortured, instead its slippery and wonderfully light. Afterwards I follow with the American Cream conditioner (probably the best hair scented product in the universe) also from Lush for a head of hair that feels rich and buttery soft, with a fresh light fragrance that lingers on.The scent itself is wonderful, citrusy and earthy, with Patchouli Oil, Orange Oil, Lavendin Oil, Pine Oil , Lemongrass Oil , Elemi Oil , Gardenia Extract and the Roman Chamomile Flower. I often find that all the oils and rich botanicals nourish the hair and leave it feeling happy, organic and natural products have been of high interest to me lately because of the results they deliver for bouncy hair and supple skin. After using drugstore and even expansive brands of hair products and skin potions, I find that my skin and hair never really benefited from all those preservatives and unnatural products derived from mineral oils and god knows what else. Lush and Burt's Bees, Jason and The Body Shop made me change my mind and seek out products that are as good as they smell, and that truly transform me from a sleepy duckling in the morning to a happy princess by the time my morning routine is over.- Kasia S."
1,There are better choices out there. This irritated my scalp and made it very itchy.  The color consistency is lacking.
1,"First off, this turned out gorgeous.  Absolutely perfect, very close to the box.  LOVE this color when it's fresh.  I have medium to dark brown hair and it really turned out fantastic.  However....I've really only been getting about a week of vibrant red before it starts fading despite using mild shampoos formulated for colored hair, without sulfates.  I'm having to recolor every two to three weeks otherwise it's more of a really dark auburn color instead of intense red.  The formula is very strong.... smell is strong and it burns my scalp.  I am hoping to find an alternative to this product with more resistance to fading...the burning scalp thing probably isn't good either...nor is coloring so often.  Good news is that despite very frequent coloring my hair is still in good condition."
1,"On the advise of my dermatologist I purchased this sunscreen. I love it, the difference in this is that it is micronized zinc oxide! Great delivery system for aging skin! Also, Citrix Antioxidant Sunscreen SPF 40 has green tea in it to calm skin down!"
1,"I really like this stuff because it leaves my skin feeling super soft and it doesn't seem to clog my pores or make me break out, and I have sensitive skin. The only thing I don't know about it is if helps with anti-aging... I guess time will tell."
1,My kids have eczema. I was walking around Walmart looking at soap section. A woman saw my kids and told me to use Cetaphil soap/body wash followed by Cetaphil cream. My kids are 9 and 10.  I ask them how their skin feel after using the Moisturing Cream. The 9 year old said her skin felt softer and smoother. The 10 years shares the same opinion. I felt it was softer too.
1,"I've only recently started incorporating toner into my facial cleansing program, but this is my favorite that I've tried so far. This toner leaves my face feeling very clean, yet soft (not tight or itchy), plus it has the benefits of an Alpha and Beta hydroxy. It really does help keep my pores cleaner, and therefore smaller over time. I find it to be perfect for my combination/oily skin, but for those with dry or sensitive skin the alcohol might be irritating or overly drying."
1,"I PURCHASED THE LIPSTICK IN MAUVY NIGHT. IT GLIDES ON SO SMOOTH, AND MY LIPS FEEL SO SOFT. I GAVE IT FOUR STARS BECAUSE IT COULD BE MORE PIGMENTED, BUT NOT THAT BIG A DEAL BECAUSE THE FINISHED LOOK LOOKS SO GOOD!i THINK I HAD TO PUT A FEW LAYERS ON BECAUSE MY LIPS ARE MORE PIGMENTED, I HAVE OLIVE SKIN/ROSEY LIPS, SO MAYBE THATS WHY."
1,"Up to my NARS standards in terms of application, wear-time; it goes on smoothly and stays on the whole day. Having said that, the pigmentation is not up to my usual NARS standards. Considering this is such a dark color in the pan, I would expect it to go on at least as dark. It doesn't. It's very sheer. Because I am extremely fair skinned, it's okay. For more tanned beauties, I would suggest looking elsewhere or trying darker NARS colors.I apply with a Kabuki brush over my foundation. I put it over the tops of my cheeks and the middle of my nose (right where my freckles are) to give a nice sun-kissed look. It has a red undertone, which really makes it look like a natural tan. It's nice because there aren't gigantic chunks of glitter. In the online picture it looks like there are gold sparkles, but there aren't. Only a very subtle golden sheen."
0,"Let me preface this brief review by saying I own 60+ bottles and growing.  This is without a doubt the worst bottle I've had the displeasure of smelling.  The smell is something out of this world, it's difficult to describe.  Imagine sour, cheap, soapy notes that are so synthetic it hurts the nose.  Man I don't know what fragrance these other reviewers are smelling but this is aweful.  If you absolutely need an FCUK scent try FCUK Connect it's much better scent wise, even if the longevity is poor.  I usually am pretty forgiving on my fragrance reviews since everyones nose is different but...DON'T BUY THIS.  That's my good dead for the year."
1,"I have a graduated bob and bleached (level 12) hair. This means varied lengths, from about 4&#34; to 10&#34;, and damaged hair that must be treated very tenderly. Because I favor a smooth underswept style, I was using my flatiron to achieve that look, but first I had to blowdry my hair or my natural wave would still turn through the ironing. A double process is a pain, and the blowdrying takes away the sheen from my hair, making it look lifeless.The brush iron is easy to hold and does not diminish the hair's sheen. I strongly recommend sectioning your hair, doing a little at a time. Don't try to take a large section and roll it...unless you are very precise, it will be easy to cross-roll as you get it out of your hair, creating a nightmare tangle.I take a section and hold the end of the hair so the section goes straight up. Then I put the iron under the hair...the stiff bristles keep the iron awaay from my scalp, so no danger of burning myself (unlike my flatiron). I pull the section of hair down over the iron and keep it like that for about 10 seconds (on 'high', and my hair is fine) then I continuously roll the brush through the hair as I bring it down to the end. I keep rolling it as I let the end curl around and roll it up like a regular curling iron.Because there is no upper grip, there is no danger of getting an indention in the hair. Just beware of cross-rolling the hair.Also, keep your fingers offf the barrel. Easy to say, but I did burn a fingertip. Now I let the cool plastic end of the roller rest in my left palm for guidance, and keep my fingers well awaay.I'll post an update if I have more observations."
1,This is the perfect teasing comb.  This is my 2nd time buying this comb because it works -definitely is the best i've ever owned.
1,I have a dark completion and was worried about this making my nails look too &#34;clammy&#34;. I am a big Essie fan so I wanted to give this a try. While I like there others colors much better this held up to the Essie commitment.
0,"This doesn't really work. It might succeed in drawing some oil out, as evidence by how slick it becomes in between rinsing, but it doesn't really get the gunk out of my pores. This unit has been sitting under my sink doing nothing for the past year. I love Panasonic, but try to avoid this product."
1,"I am 63 and really wanted to try this. I swirled and tapped and noticed that the places on my face that are Not lined turned out nice. But I wanted a little more coverage due to some spider veins and 2 age spots. So I put a second coat on and these lines under one eye really stood out! I didn't know I had them until I used this product! So I got some makeup remover and took off the bare minerals that was on top of the lines and they disappeared! On those, I put my regular liquid foundation (on the lines)and all was well.I think you should have nearly perfect skin for this to work nicely."
1,"I've been using this facewash for years now.  It's my favorite of all the natural facewashes I've tried.  I have fairly sensitive skin and this is the only wash that doesn't leave my skin feeling dry, itchy and burning.  It has a very mild fragrance which may be why it doesn't irritate me like other washes that have strong scents.  It lasts me about 2 months using just one pump to wash in the morning and one at night.  I also use Earth Science SPF face lotion and love it too.  This is a great brand especially those needing milder face products."
1,"I use alot of Philosophy products and love them. This lotion is one lower on my list. It is because it is promoted as a body firming lotion and it has no firming action. It smells really good, moisturizes pretty good, but has no body firming capabilities. Reviews on other websites reflect the same. This is a nice lotion if you like Amazing Grace or want to try something new, but do not buy it if you are actually looking for a body firming lotion. You will be disappointed."
1,"I use the self tanners from FAke bake and wanted in an attempt to optimize the self tanner use their polish. Like another reviewer stated, it is very overpriced and well the smell, is very fruity>! And I did not see a difference between using this one and another store version for half the price. Not worth the money. To bad really wished it would have made a difference. AS stated before the self tanners from FAke Bake , flawless spray and lotion are amazing !!!!"
1,"Very good price for this product, works great. If you have stretch marks, scars or deep wrinkles, makes them less noticeable."
1,"This has a grip and handle not like a ""normal"" rolling iron you may be use to, and you may find this to be hard or a pain to use, so remember when ordering!! I love this grip and clamp style and the rolling handle makes is so easy to do your own back of head hair with out trying to use 2 mirrors and backwards!!  Love love love, gets hot quick, stays on till I am done with it! Wish they had a lock for the open bar part so it didnt flop around when in travel."
1,"I tried a bunch of other serums and cosmetics and have come back to this one, happily realizing that I really did get it right. Neat price too."
1,"I like to use the temporary colors so I don't have roots or have to worry about maintenance. I like to add some color to my hair here and there but I'm busy and don't want to have to worry about follow up. I have not yet had to do a 2 week spruce up, this seems to be a recent change. I love the Egyptian Plum color, it adds a bit of burgundy without going overboard or being too much shock value for a working professional. My job puts me in court and I don't want to look like a spunky 15 year old in front of a judge so it's colorful but subtle, which is what I was looking for.I'm cheap and shop around. 3 boxes for $20 is a great deal, about a 3 for the price of 2 bargain."
0,This smelled wonderful but did not clean me at all. I ended up just using it to clean my bath tub after I took a bath. I would not buy this again!
1,"I like it for summer wear on my toes.  Topping with a sparkly finish polish like China Glaze fairy dust makes it even more vibrant.  On my fingernails I top it with OPI silver shatter to tone it down a bit, as I don't like loud colors on my fingernails.  This mutes it and makes it more finished looking.  I'm basically happy I bought it."
1,"I am 49 years old . the last 15 years of my life I have been working out on the highway all day long with the sun beating down on my face and always hated it the sun is your enemy women I am proof of that but I had to make a living and made good money with all the overtime. I must say I just started using the deep wrinkle serum . I have notice a nice difference my face is so sun damaged and I have deep wrinkles terrible. I can not believe in only a week I am seeing an improvement . When I say my face looks softer what I mean by that is. My face has always been so weathered looking from the sun damage put it this way its hard looking, I can't understand how it could do anything so fast and just having that softer look makes me want to smile.my lines in my fast are not so deep and hard looking but softer and finer smooth looking..I am shock I never expecting anything after only a week. I will never stop using roc deep wrinkle serum . Even if this is my only result. I am a very nice person and friendly and people always tell me why do you got that mean look on your face ..thats how hard my face look.I can't wait to see my friends . I know they will notice a big difference>&lt;smiling>. I will be back on this site in a bout 4 weeks . I was not going to even write a review until 4 weeks  but I had to after only one week of use . I see where people say no improvements..hmm I guess your face wasn't as bad as mine. I massage it in until it is totally absorbed and I use maybe more then most of you are using ..I have finally found something that has worked I have tried everything else I was so desperate ...oh yes and I don't work outside anymore ..so I hopefully can correct all the old damage or some of it..I will never go with out this product and plan on getting others stuff of roc."
1,This is my 3rd of 4th time buying this. It works pretty well; and of course I will purchase again.
1,"I hate it when my moisturizer slithers of my face like an oil slick, or is so thick you almost have to add water to spread it onto your face. Just one pump of this covers my face, neck and d&eacute;collet&eacute;. Makeup application is smooth, and seems to stay put longer than usual when I use this. I haven't noticed any major changes in the appearance of my fine lines, etcBut I do like he way my skin feels when I use this.  I'd order it again for sure."
1,"I've tried many different brands of moisturizer for my very sensitive skin and found this to be completely non-irritating and it moisturizes well. I don't know what ""anti-aging"" means. I wouldn't say that I look any younger as a result of using it. I like that the same amount comes out each time with one press on the pump--it helps prevent accidentally squirting out too much. And I sure wouldn't want to do that because this stuff costs a whole lot per ounce for those of us on a limited budget. The best deal around is to buy a two-pack on Amazon. That cost will beat a retail purchase by several dollars."
1,"There's nothing like a Conair Curling Iron! I love the instant heat feature. It gets good and hot, not mediocre. It shuts off automatically for those people who tend to forget that they left their iron on (I'm not one of them but I still appreciate this feature). The variable settings are a nice feature to have as well!"
1,Smells great & feels great on my skin.  It will foam up really well and my face is very clean after I use this product.
1,Nars Orgasm is a nice nude-peachy lip gloss with shimmer. I paired this with the Nars Borneo lip liner (brownish pink). It gives me a little more depth. They both have a good amount of staying power.
1,"This product is ok. Made my skin super dry and peel. It did help a little bit with my acne, but not enough to deal with the skin drying out. I did start to use a moisturizer with it and that did help. I didn't see any help from the pills. This product was not for me, waste of money!"
1,"Smells fantastic, but I still broke out using it. Not the case with Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash, 9.1 Ounce (Pack of 3)"
1,It is not really extra large. It feels very small. Just average size. I wish the actual product was extra large as advertised.
1,This is by far the best witch hazel I have ever used.  The smell is delicious.  A hint of rose aroma.  I will be purchasing again.
1,"The very first time I dyed my hair was 7 or 8 years ago and I used Cinnaberry. I loved it so much I have NEVER even tried another hair dye since then.It's really affordable and a great value for the price. I have really long (almost to the bottom of my back) curly, thick hair and one bottle is enough.The process is really easy and the directions are clear and understandable. I am able to dye my hair alone with this, versus needing somebody else's help. It smells really great while dyeing, and afterwards, too. While walking around with the dye setting, my boyfriend commented I smelled ""like blueberries."" - It's not chemical smelling at all.My hair is medium to dark brown and this makes it slightly darker in areas, but really well lit in other areas. It catches flashes of red, gold, and browns - really making it an interesting color. I always get compliments on it. I also like that it is a 28 day wash out b/c it just fades away over time, instead of making root touch ups and maintenance necessary. It has always lasted in my hair about 6 weeks, though. Perhaps b/c I don't wash my hair everyday, but I've found it really holds up.It leaves your hair REALLY shiny and silky. I have curly, coarse hair and it's usually it's healthiest after I've dyed it with this and used the enclosed conditioner. They give you enough for multiple shampoos, also, which is helpful.The only negative I can think of is that it is impossible to ""rinse until water runs clear."" This may result in some light colored towels or pillowcases to have some slight staining. But that's to be expected with any wash out haircolor - right? I just put aside some of our raggedy linens for the dyeing process so nothing good gets ruined."
1,"I got manicure done at a local nail place, and came across this color. I got a manicure done and fell in love with this shade, and had to buy it on Amazon! The color is a gorgeous orange with slight shimmer, its not too bright nor too light. The orange feels very ""fresh"" to me because of the shade and shimmer. Perfect for summer! I like Opi products a lot. This color dries fast and stays on longer. My nail polish usually starts chipping and by the next 3-4 days the top layers start coming off, not this one. I recommend this color for summer!"
1,"I have always loved the heady, rich and intoxicating scent of Plumeria even though quite honestly florals are not my favorite fragrance type as I prefer mossy, woody, milky or musky scents.Auric Blends has been a favorite scented roll on oil based fragrance and this scent sure doesn't disappoint. The second I put it on my wrists and neck the rich buttery aroma of Hawaiian Leis envelops my senses and puts me in a good mood. This morning as I got to work I quickly dabbed some one and my new coworkers started asking what that scent was, and how good it smelled, and I sit feet away yet it bursts with luxurious bouquet of freshness. Plumeria is an incredible scent all in it's own but this oil really makes me appreciate the fine craftsmanship of true artisans of perfumery."
1,"Really love this roller kit!  First of all, I have very straight, thin, curl resistant hair.  I found that there was only one curling iron which could hold my curls for more than an hour and that is the Hot Tools tourmaline.  I hate slaving over the mirror with a curling iron holding one curl at a time and have often fantasized about using a roller set but worried that the curls wouldn't hold.  I tried the Caruso Ion Hairsetter today and it was great!  It's been several hours and my curls are still there, I was able to roll the curls and go about my business rather than holding the damn curling iron forever.  I like that the kit comes with three sizes of curls along with a manual on how to create different styles!  This is so much nicer than a curling iron, so much versatility in what you can create and it takes almost no waiting for the unit to start or to fill the rollers with steam.  This has to be one of the best inventions ever!  It was also easy to clean, just dump out the water and put the rollers away.  Love it!"
0,Not a fan. The brush is kinda stiff so it's harder to make a shape.When I'm putting it on my eyes start to tear. I have the feeling this product have tons of chemicals.This eyeliner last for longsite and I put it above my other eyeliner
1,Love the smell and it lasts a long time.
1,I like the creamy texture of this moisturizer as well as the light pleasant smell.  I try to use SPF products so this is perfect especially with the upcoming Summer season.
0,"I bought this due to the good reviews. I have curly, highlighted hair so it is really dry and needs extra moisture, was looking for something that would detangle my hair and leave it silky soft. I used it twice, the first time was before shampooing and conditioning my hair, the second time I skipped shampooing and co-washed and conditioned my hair, which naturally leaves my hair feeling better any way. Both times was hard combing through my hair, so hard in fact that I stopped and just finished with my normal routine. My hair was nothing like it says moisturized, shiny, smooth.... Don't buy not worth it."
1,"I like to use the rose water in spritzes when I do my twist outs. It leaves my hair, not only smelling great, but nice and soft. It also enhances the curliness of my twist outs. I'm ready to buy more of this!The rose water sold by Heritage has no unnatural ingredients in it. There isn't an artificial rose scent added to make it ""smell like roses"" while not containing actual roses. This brand uses mainly European roses -- I believe. It is also made organically. I was surprised, also, to not have an allergic reaction to this brand of rose water, when I have sensitivities to perfumes."
1,I keep this  bottle packed in my swim bag. My skin can get dry with swim workouts and I like to have a nice compact moisturizer along. This is nice and smooth and does the job!Chris WodkeAuthor: Running for My Life-Winning for CMT
1,Nice gentle body clean
1,"Suave shampoo is one of those products that I've used for most of my life. I've tried more expensive shampoo over the years but keep coming back to Suave simply because it works very well and it costs very little. Usually I'm a huge proponent of the 'you get what you pay for' way of thinking. However, there are exceptions that prove the rule, and this is one of them!That said, I have short, uncomplicated hair that's only dislike is conditioner (it makes parts of my hair stand on end for no apparent reason). I don't do much styling aside from a littleFiber Molding Cremeto spike the front a little bit, so my shampoo needs are probably not as complicated as someone with long, curly hair. For a guy (or woman with short hair) this stuff is perfect and does exactly what I need it to: clean my hair. It's worth trying even if you think you might not end up loving it, simply because it's inexpensive, so if it doesn't work out, you've lost nothing.For the price, I can't find a shampoo that is as good. This is straight up the least expensive but highest quality shampoo out there. Recommended to anyone without complicated hair, for use with kids, or as an alternative to more expensive shampoo that does exactly the same thing.NOTE: I'd recommend getting this from Amazon directly to take advantage of their free shipping options."
1,My bottle did not come with a spritzer came as shown in the picture. The rose scent is nice but I was not overly impressed. I used it as a toner and in the bath. I didn't notice any difference in my skin and the scent gets lost when put into a bath.
1,"This is the best glue ever! It goes on white and dry clear... all you have to do is go over the band, once dried, with eyeliner and you have a pretty, natural look. It stays on all day and I have never lost a lash!!! The trick is to put the glue on the lashes and wait about 45 seconds to apply them. This way the glue is sticky and adheres to your eye without sliding around. It's the best glue out there!!!!"
1,"you best believe that even an entire night of sweating and dancing, this lash glue will stay on.also it's dark, - and gets gradually darker after you give it some time to dry out.it smells heinous, but such is life."
1,"I have a condition which makes my arms itch intensly and nothing, I mean nothing has worked. Finally, I have found something that helps! This lotion really does the trick as it has Calamine (3%) and Pramoxine HCl (1%) in it which seems to be the key.  The calamine lotion does make the application appear a bit pink but rubbing it in well disguises this and helps the lotion work even better.  I would recommend this for all itching, but if you have itching that nothing has helped, give this a try. It's not greasy and works like a charm."
1,"I've been using it for about 10 years. It's not clumpy, it lasts forever, it doesn't flake, it's easy to wash off (even if you are a heavy mascara wearer like me :) and its affordable. I don't know what I'll do if they ever disconntinue it! LOVE THIS STUFF!"
1,"I love this color but every time I apply it appears streaky, unlike my other essie colors. To get the deep red I really want from this polish I need to apply four coats! Also, this color rubs off every time I touch paper (which is true of a lot of red tones anyways) so beware if you handle paper at work because it looks like you're accidentally marking everything up with a red crayon."
1,"It greatly relived my itch skin.  Although, it has some unique smell though.It is a bit expensive then regular lotion.  If you are going to use it for your entire body,this 4 ounce bottle won't last long and it will be better to get bigger bottle."
1,I can see this nail file lasting a really long time. The file seems to be as effective as day one after many uses. I have really thick nails that grow fast so I am really happy to have found this one. I highly recommend it.
0,"I've been wearing toe spacers for nearly 8 years, so I've seen my share of brands.  I was very disappointed with this brand because they are so thin.  They really don't even space my toes apart because they are so narrow.  I'm looking elsewhere."
1,"I bought this product at my local drugstore because my hands are extremely rough and dry. This did not moisturize my hands for 24 hours, like the bottle says it does. After applying, I realized the hand cream wasn't greasy, but it also wasn't that moisturizing for my extremely rough and dry hands. It only lasted through hand washing if you don't use soap. As an Aveeno lover, I am disappointed."
1,"I was so happy to finally find a bottle of 100% pure Tea Tree Oil in something bigger than a 1 oz. bottle.  I love the Desert Essence brand and often have to buy a couple of bottles at a time, as I use it so much.  Currently, I use it in my homemade hair and face products.  I will be looking for it in an even larger bottle, next."
0,"Not long enough, you need to  use these products for a minimum of 60 days to see any results, so check back with me later."
1,"I use nothing but this eyeliner. It stays on all day. you can apply light or thick. I like a dramatic yet natural look, and this works perfectly."
1,"It doesn't get all my eye make-up off, but it still does a nice job. It leaves my skin a little dry, but this could just be me.  I did expect a little more from the Neutrogena name and will be going back to St. Ives."
1,"I have used this brand forever and love the  brush on adhesive that dries clear. Duo really is the best adhesive out there. Unfortunately when this item got to me, it was solid and the top was glued on. It has been below freezing here lately- so perhaps something happened in shipping."
1,"Not exactly what I was looking for, but it is a great scrub for gentle skin because the beads are so small. My sis likes that it is so gentle. I didn't realize that it didn't have any salicylic acid, though, until I arrived. If I weren't looking for a product with salicylic acid, this would have been perfect."
1,My doctor recommended this shampoo and it really works. I have Seborrheic dermatitis and years of Head & Shoulders never did a bit of difference. This is golden. I just wish it didn't dry out my tight curly hair so much!
1,"This lotion is the best that I've tried. It's lightweight, yet does the job of keeping my skin looking fresh and hydrated. I also love the fact that it has sun block in it. I use it in the morning and at night, and find that it works really well for me. It's a great product."
1,"I haven't had a BAD OBAGI PRODUCT! ALL GREAT PRODUCTS AND DIFFERENTLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON YOUR FACE.My problem is where I have to get them since I live in Key West FL, Amazon have SAVED MY FACE! and my purse.Thanks Amazon"
1,Smells funny but does the job. My lashes never fall off. I can shake my head at a rock concert and head bang all I want and my lashes wouldn't fall off.
1,"I love many of the Philosophy products, this is a fabulous face wash I use it twice daily. Awesome product!"
1,"I have a hormone imbalance and tend to get acne and a lot of oil production, I take this along with spironolactone, but ever since I started taking this along side with the spironolactone I have noticed a big difference, the bp/aloe vera cream is exactly what I needed not top drying! will continue to order"
0,"I ended up not even opening the packaging; I could tell by the look of them they had to be pretty old; one was actually very yellowed and they both looked like they'd come from a discount sales bin somewhere. I looked up the product codes from the bottom of the tubes and learned that they had been produced in 2005 and 2007, respectively. This is clearly well past the ""safe"" three-year shelf life. Now I have to return them in the hopes of getting my $20 refunded. This company should not be allowed to sell on Amazon.UPDATE: Third-party seller (BeautyTime) claims the product ""never expires"" (contrary to Maybelline's website, even), and has accused me of lying and that the product ""didn't exist in 2005 & 2007,"" which is not true (I've been using this mascara for YEARS). I have ordered this mascara on Amazon before, and not had this same experience. Be careful as to who the third-party seller is. This company is clearly shady."
1,"When I am concentrating hard or feeling stressed, a pronounced deep wrinkle appears between my brows. Over the years, this has gotten deeper and more noticeable. I stumbled across this product when I was looking on Amazon for ""deep wrinkle treatments."" I was skeptical, but I took a chance and ordered. I've been using Frownies for 3 weeks now, and I am surprised at how helpful they seem to be. As other reviewers have described, these are essentially brown-paper patches. Wet the shiny side with toner (I use witch hazel toner) or water, stretch your brow muscles gently to release the target wrinkles, then press the Frownies onto the skin and hold down with your palm until the glue affixes it. Yes, the patches looks somewhat ridiculous, and yes, for the first few minutes, the sensation of having something affixed to one's forehead is rather annoying. But after a while, that sensation fades. I haven't had any trouble falling asleep in Frownies, and only once (so far) have I clawed the patches off during my sleep. I've found them easiest to remove by just letting them steam/wash off in the shower. Sometimes, I put witch hazel toner on a cotton-ball and use that to slowly and gently lift the sticky item from my forehead. It takes about a half-hour for the slight redness of my skin (where the Frownie was affixed) to abate. However,  my facial muscles do feel and look much more relaxed in the morning, and that seems to be the case for several hours. By nightfall, I have done my share of inadvertent scowling, but at least for 8+ hours at a time, I know that I won't be scowling in my sleep! In addition to Frownies, I've been using collagen-filler moisturizers night and day. So those might also be contributing to the results I am experiencing. I will definitely re-order this product and continue the experiment."
1,"I bought this because I thought I needed a heavier night cream, but its a little too heavy for my face as I have oily/combination skin.  If you are dry/combination or dry and need that extra moisture, this would be an excellent product for you.  I use it on my neck only and it works wonders for that, but when I use it on my face, I have a few whiteheads in the morning.  Still a good product as most of the Olay line has proven to be."
1,"I hadn't used a non-permanent color in years before trying Natural Instincts so had no idea what would happen. My light-to-medium hair had roots and a little grey around my temples. Since my hair is naturally dark brown, I went with #28 to try for a natural look.Applying the color was easy enough. It's a liquid color, so I had a little dripping, but nothing difficult to clean up and it didn't really stain. The color rinsed easily and my hair felt awesome after using the Natural Instincts Color Treat conditioner (comes with the coloring kit). My hair now looks and feels way more healthy than before I colored!I don't want to give this five stars because the follow up color touch up treatment is terrible. It stained my shower and left my hair feeling cruddy and dry. The initial color itself is awesome, super even but with nice variable tones (it's not patchy, but it has dimension) and so far, nearly four weeks later, it's still dark brown. There's a teeny bit of fading but nothing like when I've gone red or ashy.I'm not usually one to stick with a color brand but I'm happy enough I signed up for subscribe and save to color my hair every 6-8 weeks with Natural Instincts #28."
1,"its easy to use, the waves last all day, very good quality for the price, i really recomend this curling iron"
1,"My hair is naturally dark brown. A year ago, I dyed it blonde, then red. Since then I've been trying to get my hair back to its original color, so before using this product, it was already pretty brown. I wanted the red tones to be less apparent, so I used coffee instead of water as the instructions say to do. I left it in for one hour. It didn't do much for the red tones. My hair is now slightly darker (and smells like dirt). I like that it's all natural and seemed to condition my hair but the messy, smelly, and long process hardly seems worth it in my case. I think it did the job it was meant to do and I simply expected it to have an effect it wasn't marketed to have."
1,"I, like many, many women had terrible monthly cycles.  I could write a novel on how horrible they were, but I am sure if you are reading this yours are just as bad if not worse so I will refrain from further details on that!  However, I must explain why this product is so wonderful for me and will be for you as well.  I have just recently hit my 40's and I had a few perimenopausal months which wreaked havoc on me so I started researching and found I had some thyroid issues as well.  So, I started on a thyroid vitamin cocktail consisiting of B and D vitamins as well as Thyrotrophin and Thyrosol.  For about a year I was fine, but then I started having those horrible periods and some memory issues.  Also, the dreaded weight gain.  I just happened to be reading a women's magazine when the article of Emerita Pro-Gest appeared.  Well, I am a skeptic about ""miracle anything"", but had to give this a try.  THANK YOU magazine article!!!!  I've been using for 2 months now and I have had the best cycles I have ever had!  Easy 5 days...much lower/less flow, no bloat, no headaches, grogginess, memory loss...NOTHING!  I did have a few cramps a few days before my period which I had never had before, but hey, I'll take that!  I use a teaspoon or so in the AM and again in the PM.  Always on my stomach, no skin reactions.  I am so happy with this product I tell everyone about it and I have signed up for automatic delivery.  Try this cream.  It works."
1,"This NOW Foods Lemon Oil is a great essential oil to use singularly with a carrier oil, (I most often use almond oil as my carrier), mixing with other essential oils to create a custom scent for your skin, room freshening/deodorizing, and for making your own homemade cleaning products that leave a fabulous scent behind.The lemon scent itself is clean and bright with no heaviness or odd undertones, and is a great scent to help perk you up. I enjoy mixing this with orange oil with almond oil, and dab on pulse points (that will not be exposed to sunlight, as these essential oils can cause skin irritation for many when exposed to sunlight).In case you don't know, this doesn't come with it's own dropper, so you may want to have one ready. The quality, strength, scent, value and ""multi-purposefulness"" of this lemon oil has made a wonderful addition to my essential oil stock and I highly recommend it!"
1,"This is a very light and soft scent that is NOT floral. Sandalwood is definitely the more dominant of the two, lending a powdery and airy quality to the fragrance. The vanilla is more subtle, and comes to the top more throughout the day as you wear the fragrance.This scent is not in the least offensive, and it would be difficult to put on too much. As I said, this scent is reminiscent of a luxurious body powder. It would be perfect for a teenager who wants to enter the world of perfume. Auric Blends are very high quality oils."
1,"This is a really nice, clean face wash. Don't get near your eyes. It leaves your skin feeling very revived and clean."
1,"The product is very good.1. Hypoallergenic: Great for people with allergies.2. Doesn't burn after shaving: Something lots of people look for in deodorants.3. For the most part Odor-Free4. It's a clear gel, so it won't leave white marks on clothing or on you.The only bad thing i have to complain about is that the gel takes a little bit to dry. But i still recommend it."
1,"My natural hair color is black. I had it previously dyed with henna one time. The henna did not work at all, therefore, my haircolor did not change. I had 1 inch of black roots and the rest was a dark red. So, today I dyed my hair with Naturtint fireland.  Surprisingly, it did not dye my black roots at all! My roots were supposed to be red. It only worked on the rest of my hair. Here is what i think might have gone wrong:1. The previously dyed henna affected the results. Even though the hennadid not work on my hair.2. I started to dye my hair at the nape of the neck rather than at thefront. It took me 1hour to dye my own hair.3. Or maybe the product was defectiveWhy cant i just dye my hair red and have it turn out red?Everyone else gets to dye their hair and be happy with the results! Why me??Nothing seems to work on my hair, not Henna, and maybe not Naturtint. I will dye it again and see if it works this time."
1,"This ""Instant Heat Hot Brush"" is an excellent tool for your hairstyling arsenal.  And believe what it says:  It is definately INSTANT HEAT!  It has an excellent range of heat temperatures that will suit any type of hair.  The barrel is 1 1/4"" and in my opinion, works on any length of hair.  It's easy for me to style my ""growing out from a Victoria Beckam bob"" that has anarray of lengths in the back and longer lengths on the sides.  The brush can be used as astraightening iron as well as a curling iron.  It works very well on my fine hair giving itmuch needed volume.  Yes, I said VOLUME!!!  Plus, the ""brush"" actually holds my hair during the process making it easy to use - plus it has an automatic shut off.  And did I mention - it works GREAT for bed head hair!  This hot brush is made by Conair so you know it's a qualityproduct.  I highly recommend this Instant Heat Hot Brush."
1,This works pretty fast.  In a couple of days (using it only once at night) I have notice a good improvement with the bad pimples (I have them inside my skin) have all but disappeared.  I will purchase again!
1,"This is an excellent product.  I have been using this hair color for the past 5 years, and I wouldn't be without it.  It is gentle and doesn't contain any of the harmful ingredients in other hair color products."
0,"I bought it and never used it. however It gives a nice volume. But if you are looking for curls or waves, this is not the tool. It just gives a slight wave and if you want that then it's a good tool.its good for traveling but i never take it with me when i travel"
1,"Im so happy I got this brush. It is amazing on wigs, even curly ones! It brushes through easily and with little fallout. Other wig brushes I've used pull the tracks out and have lots of hair in the brush when Im done. This one is awesome!"
1,I get gel nails done every other week and this in and of itself - dries your cuticles out considerably - this is a product I'd read about in a magazine (I believe In Style) anyway it's nominal in pricing and is a dynamite little cuticle oil.  I would surely recommend it.
1,The nice thing about this brush is the small brush tips allow you to clean the shed hair out of the brush easily. The brush feels sturdy and is easy to hold in your hand. A good buy that should last a long time.
1,"This mascara makes my lashes look longer than any other mascara I've ever tried...and I've tried tons of them.The trick to the primer for me is to use only one coat. (If I try to use two, the mascara goes on lumpy.) I let the primer dry for a minute, add one coat of mascara on top, and I'm done. It stays on really well, too. I'm very happy with this product."
1,"I had done a lot of reading on treating cellulite and stretch marks and found a recommendation to try glycolic acid and AHA. I did a search on Amazon and stumbled upon the Alpha Hydrox which had some good reviews so I decided to give it a try.I've been using it for about a week now, twice a day and I am actually seeing a reduction in the appearance of cellulite! I've been using on my hips/thighs/booty in conjunction with zone-specific exercises (which in the past by itself hasn't produced results like these). I was never overweight or large, so there was never a lot of cellulite, but enough to make me self-conscious in a swimsuit.I would say that the appearance of stretch marks is still the same, but for the price of the bottle this is definitely worth it for combating cellulite!"
1,I spray my clothes and my daughter's clothes with this every day and we ALWAYS get compliments. An excellent conversation starter!
1,"I love  this stuff, I invested stock in this I put it in my hair and little girls hair when it dry before I Put in a ponytail and it makes the hair feel soft and moisturized."
1,"My favorite daily cleanser.  It cleans without drying out, and I feel light and fresh after using it.  It has a gentle fragrance and after using it daily you can really notice a difference in how clean your skin looks and feels."
1,"Like all of the Olay Regenerist products this moisturizer is great!  It goes on smoothly, and lasts through my day.  It's great under my light makeup."
1,"This is one of my favorite essie polishes of all time. It arrived on time and was as described brand new. Great price, will reorder."
0,I am no longer happy with non adjustable plastic head bands.  My head isn't built for them.  These look nice and hold great but they poke my head at the ends.
1,"I bought this polish from Rite Aid the other day, applied it yesterday, and found it was absolutely breathtaking gorgeous.  You know how you see a color in a bottle and think, ""Hmm, that's pretty.""  or even ""Hmm, that's okay."" but when you paint it on and see it against your own skin - well, that's the deciding moment.  And I have to say that Play Date is a jaw dropping color. I have tan/olive skin and this creamy, light purple with slight pinky-rosy undertones (or is it just me?) is the perfect pop of color on sun-kissed skin.This is among my favorites, ladies, and I can't believe for a whole year I passed this up 'til now.  Save yourself the pain of regret:  GET IT GIRL!"
1,"Great Essie quality - dries super fast, really glossy, and even!Took one star off because it is WAY brighter/more neon on the nail than in the bottle. I didn't really mind since it's summer and it's still a really pretty colour."
1,"I've only had this cream for about a week now but so far so good. It is so smooth and creamy and really makes makeup go on smoothly. The one thing I don't like is if you use too much and don't rub it in really well right away it will flake off like peeling skin later in the day. I can't say much about its effects on lines or age spots yet but hopefully it helps!UPDATE: This lotion isn't really living up to my expectations. I'm not convinced it actually changes anything about your skin, it just slightly masks flaws. Once I run out I'm going back to my AveenoAveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer SPF 15 - 4 oz."
1,"A really good, inexpensive spray on, leave in conditioner.  Comb, spray and you're on your way.  Has a very mild coconut sent that reminds me of the water/ocean.."
1,I originally was looking for the philosophy purity oil free facial cleanser but found this one and thought I'd give it a try.  I really like how my face feels after using it.  I've had a lot of dry skin along with acne and this really has helped my face.
1,Aussie products are amazing anc affordable! I love the hair insurance. I have fine long hair and with this I can easily work through the knots after a wash. And it smells delicious!
1,Starting working after a week.  I seriously noticed a difference and I already bought a second.  Also helped with acne scars.
0,"I have used BE for several years. I thought BE was a good product because it was ""natural"" however it is NOT! It causes BAD BREAKOUTS!! Cystic under the skin hard acne, urrrg! I do not know if they changed the formula but I would stir clear of this!! I had no idea it was breaking me out for the past 6 months until I read about it on a acne forum and sure enough Bare escentuals was on the list! They have some ingredient Bismuth Oxychloride (spelling?) anyway that is what causes breakouts from what in read. Regardless once I stopped using it my sking slow cleared up now I have acne scars I need to remove! Grrrrrrrrrrrrr"
1,"I used it once when I didn't have enough time for a 2 hour shower (wash, blow dry, and style) and my hair smelt great!  And it even felt lighter and just as if I washed it.  Perfect for on the go.  All I had to do was dampen my hair with this product then blow dried it and styled it and my hair felt great! Excellent Product!!!!"
1,Ive been using this for years. Put it on before moisturizing. Its light yet leaves my skin soft and smooth. Other products seem to go on better with this as a base. Sometimes I use Olay microdermabrasion and the the serum afterwards and my skin feels amazing. I don't have many lines for nearly 59. Not saying its just the serum but it probably helped. Look for 2 or 3 dollar coupon that is sometimes available on amazon.
1,"I have naturally dark blonde/light brown hair with a lot of red undertones. My hair easily turns brassy, and so I have to be cautious when coloring it. Sandalwood is perfect for my hair type. It never gives me any brassiness whatsoever, and the color is very natural looking. I have about 10% gray, and while it doesn't completely cover it, it does make the gray blend in and look like soft highlights for about 1 to 1 1/2 months. After that I will start to see the gray showing up, and I know it's time to color again. My hair always looks shiny and healthy after coloring. It also gives my hair some fullness because it deposits color on the hair, thereby making it appear thicker.As for the new formula, I actually prefer it to the old one because with the old one you had to wet your hair before applying the color. With the new formula, you apply it to dry hair which is more convenient. I have not noticed any difference in color results between the old formula and the new one. The two week refresher is an added bonus and will give your color a boost as it starts to fade.I hope they never stop making this color because I haven't found anything that compares!UPDATE May 8, 2013: I still love this color and haven't found anything better, but they have changed the formula again, and now you have to apply the product to damp hair once more. This extra step makes the product more difficult to use because it's hard to tell if you've missed any areas if your hair is already damp when you apply the solution. Also, the color refresher seems to have changed. It tends to make my hair yellow-looking, and I do not use it anymore. I will still use Natural Instincts, but they could do a better job on the color refresher and make it so that it can be applied to dry hair again."
1,"This seems like a very well made mirror, it is a nice size, and the magnification strength is great. It is easy to install, and the nickel finish is very classy. The one thing, though, particularly after reading another reviewer's comment, is that I make a habit of tightening the screws on either side of the mirror from time to time ... just seems to make sense, considering that the mirror gets rotated back and forth quite a bit."
1,"I can't recommend this cream for everyone, but I do believe those of you who say it works for you.I now buy it for a family member who has asthma/breathing issues (with his pulmonologist's OK; more about that later in this review).However, I am one of the ones THIS DOES NOT WORK FOR.  I wanted to believe.  I really did.I had the same experience as others reviewing here, but my weight gain was fast and severe (15+ pounds in the relative blink of an eye--from my fairly fit 142 to my all-time high of 158.  It isn't so much the weight itself that bothers me, as much as body composition/shape.  More about that in a minute).I'm healthy & like others here, bought the line that I NEEDED progesterone because I was of a certain age.  I bought and studied Dr. John Lee's books--like this one--What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Menopause: The Breakthrough Book on Natural Hormone Balance, but was always haunted by the fact that he used progesterone cream himself and died of a heart attack.Unfortunately, I also believed what I read about continuing to use the cream even after the first 5 pound weight gain, since this was just, supposedly, a temporary activation of the estrogen receptors.  WRONG!  I kept using it for another 5-6 months, till the weight gain just made me say ""this can't be good"" and I stopped.Sadly,using this progesterone cream completely altered my body shape, added fat to abdomen/core that I have NEVER had (as in 3 inches to the waist), inflated my upper arms, added fat to derriere & thighs that I've also never had in my entire life. Classic estrogen pear shape.  I also went through a 2 month period of feeling like I had severe hypoglycemia (again, I'm a healthy, athletic person & never experienced this before).  I'd get ravenously hungry, shaky, feel lightheaded, etc.My athletic build was totally altered by this supplement (it was the one and ONLY change to my routine--I continued to exercise 3-5x/week) & FIFTEEN months later (after stopping completely) I'm STILL working at getting my ""old"" body back.  I've found I3C--NOW Foods Indole-3-carbinol (i3c), 200mg / 60 Vcaps-- to be helpful & am slowly getting myself back to the shape that looks like me in the mirror, but this was an ""extra project"" I just did not need.  I simply did not recognize the body in the mirror any more--this was a very startling and disturbing experience.My theory is that some of us are more estrogen-sensitive than others and I suspect our bodies look at progesterone as a useful building block for making even MORE estrogen.  This cream is NOT a good thing, if you're one of the ""estrogen lovers.""I'd definitely recommend looking into I3C (indole 3 carbinol) or DIM--Source Naturals DIM (Diindolylmethane) 100mg, 120 Tablets-- to take along with your progesterone cream, if you do decide to continue taking this, to help counter the effects of the ""bad"" estrogens you may be encouraging by using any hormone supplementation (including DHEA or 7-Keto).I have a family member with periodic asthma & I can say this progesterone cream is an absolute blessing for people with breathlessness/asthma/COPD--it works as a bronchodilator when airways constrict & can definitely relax the airway passages during an attack.But please, ladies, BE CAREFUL WITH THIS.  If you need it, it's a blessing.  If you don't, it's a curse.I would urge EVERYONE to get bloodwork done before starting this, to confirm that you are indeed low in progesterone and that your estrogen is within safe limits.If you're healthy now and doing fine overall, I'd strongly advise you NOT to use progesterone creams, regardless of brand.Learn from my mistake.  Despite the plethora of ""literature"" out there, HORMONES are NOT simple supplements.  There are powerful interplays involved here and BALANCE is the key.  Personally, because of the experience I'm sharing here, I no longer accept the claim that progesterone will work to balance all of your other hormones, effortlessly, if you just get the progesterone dosage right.I feel VERY fortunate to just have (I hope) some weight gain/body shape issues that I'm gradually reversing.  I can see that some women (particularly those like me, sensitive to estrogen) could be unwittingly encouraging ovarian and breast tumors by supplementing with something their bodies may not need, all in the belief that we are ""protecting"" ourselves. And THAT is definitely ""not a good thing.""Like the old-timers say, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.""Update 7/9/12:  Just an FYI for those interested in mitigating the effects of too much estrogen.  I switched from I3C (indole 3 carbinol) to this particular DIM supplement, based on many positive reviews here at Amazon:Nature's Way - Dim-Plus, 120 capsules.  With very minimal dietary changes, my weight loss accelerated dramatically and my body shape is now much closer to its pre-progesterone cream shape, after using just 1/2 of a bottle (so far).  I would highly recommend investigating this supplement, which helps your body metabolize/eliminate harmful estrogens.Update 12/20/12:  I'm doing GREAT on DIM-plus.  My body is back in shape & my energy levels are back to normal.  I'm on a daily maintenance dose (2 pills a day at breakfast).  Once again, I wish you all good luck with whatever protocol you choose; just think first, then act.P.S. 1/24/13: Just one more thing:  PLEASE take the time to read through the other 3 star, 2 star, & 1 star reviews to learn more about other peoples' experiences, just to collect a wider perspective.  Progesterone cream might be the answer for you or it might not, but KNOWLEDGE is power; good luck!----Update 6/9/14:  I STILL cannot use this myself, but it has proven to be a terrific blessing for my husband, who struggles with COPD.  With his pulmonologist's approval, he's using this regularly now to help him breathe better & it's WORKING!  When he gets short of breath, we can apply a small amount and he breathes easier within 5 minutes and the effect lasts overnight.  I've also read some studies linking progesterone with improvements in memory & can say that in my husband's case, it does seem to be helping him in that area as well.  Just an FYI for those looking into this cream; hope it helps someone else like it's helping him!  There are books available via Amazon regarding the health benefits of progesterone for men."
1,"i have tried a lot of sulfur masks ever since i started to get acne at 11 yrs old (i know sad lol) and this is by far one that i can see improvements on the size of my acne in days. i use it as a mask and leave it on for a while or as a spot treatment an leave it overnight and i get great results. the price is unbeatable and its smell minty (like spearmint gum or toothpaste. there is little tightening feel (unless you put a thick layer) and very little tingling sensation. once i rinse off, my skin doesn't feel dry (like the ddf sulfur mask) and i put a serum and moisturizer and my skin feels good.by no means does it completely  get rid of my acne, but it has made it more manageable and i wear less makeup because of it."
1,"I bought this Neutrogena Hair Mask and the Daily Deep Conditioner--this did absolutely nothing to my hair. I might be exaggerating a little, but if felt like I put it in and after keeping it in for a couple of hours it just came right out. When I used the Daily Deep Conditioner, I put it in and then washed it out after the remainder of my shower, which was like 10 min. HUGE difference!"
0,"This product is extremely watery (even after a good shaking). It seems to be conditioner mixed with a lot of water. I find it difficult to get in my daughters hair before it runs through my fingers!  I have seen no results or an increase in softness or &#34;brushability&#34; for my girls who have long hair.  I don't particularly care for the smell either. I really hoped this would be a good leave in conditioner for a good price, but this was one of those, you get what you pay for scenarios. This reminds me of the concoctions my children make in the tub when they mix a little cheap &#34;suave type&#34; conditioner in water in one of their toy teacups or the hair rinsing container. Don't waste your money, I will have to buy something else to replace it with."
1,This brush works like a dream with absolutely minimal hair loss :) I put it through some pretty cheap extensions and wigs and it went through smoothly with very little pulling!
1,This is a basic make-up remover.  I forgot how thick it is.  It does a good job at removing my make-up.  You need to wipe it off with a face cloth or wet wipe to remove.  It will not come off with just a water splash.  It leaves my skin soft and dewey.  I would recommend to you if you like the extra removal step.  You wil need to follow with a toner to completely remove the residue from your skin.  Nice scent.
1,"I got tired of my blonde and red highlights- mostly because they took so much time to maintain.  I was going to grow them out but then I started having those growing-out-highlights roots that look kinda crappy, especially now that I can see a few sparkles(what I call my gray hairs) showing up in there.I used the online tool at the Feria website to choose which colors would work best with my coloring, ordered the product from Amazon and dyed away.  This color is a shade darker than my normal hair.I wasn't expecting much- but this stuff is amazing!  Despite being a slightly darker shade, it still has tons of shine and made my hair look like it has *natural* highlights, as opposed to the chunky salon highlights(I love those, too, and was worried this color would look really flat and boring but I wanted to choose a color I thought was closest to my natural shade- and will be even closer as the color fades a little).  So, no you will not get salon-style highlight results but on my hair, this product dyed all my hair evenly and it still looks fairly lively.I have relatively fine and thin hair but it is down past my shoulders.  I used one box, left it on my hair for the recommended 25 minutes before washing it out.  When I first mixed it, the color looked like a creamy white but slowly darkened as it was exposed to air.  I used some cotton balls with water and soap to get dye off that I had gotten on my forearm, in the sink and on my forehead/ears/neck- no stains to speak of.  I do recommend using gloves other than those in the kit or under the supplied ones- they break too easily and you could end up with Hey!-I-just-did-a-home-dye-job hands.Most importantly, to me, this product resulted in very even and professional looking all-over color.  I can't even tell where my highlights used to begin now.  I highly recommend but please follow directions.  There is also a pretty pungent ammonia smell, so you'll want to make sure you have adequate ventilation.  When applying, go slow and make sure the product is *really* worked into your hair.  I started at the top and worked my way down.  Used the entire bottle but I think it still would have been enough if I had longer hair.  You might want two boxes if you have LONG, THICK hair(like I only dream of!).5 stars for excellent results and beating my expectations!"
1,"This brush is wonderful! I have very thick, course,curly hair that I like to blow out straight. It smooths out my hair and glides through it easily. When I saw the brush I had my doubts but gave it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised with the results. I have hair that is hard to deal with and it was soft and pretty tame after using this brush.I would definitely recommend this brush!"
1,"I buy these regularly. They are wonderful for getting in the corners of my eyes to remove smudged makeup, etc."
1,It smooths and hydrates well but I think it is little greasy for my skin type. I have oily skin all over and oilier in T area.I apply powder on this to cover all the shine. So far (3 days use) it has not no adverse reaction on my skin.
1,"LOVED this nail polish! Such a pretty purple/grey color. Not shimmery at all and looks awesome on my nails. Is not too thin and streaky but is not too thick either. I love Essie colors, especially purple and will continue buying them!"
1,"I love, love, love this color.  OPI is always my go to brand because they hold up better and have a great selection of colors."
0,"EDIT: I stopped using this because I just couldn't justify the expense, and honestly I think my skin looks BETTER without it. This product, though refreshing and pleasant to use, doesn't do much for the quality of my skin. I am going to use up the rest of my bottle by ""setting"" my makeup with a spritz - otherwise I won't be repurchasing.I love this toner! It is hydrating, smells lovely, and really helps my moisturizer sink into my skin (I use CeraVe lotion). I also love the spray-on application because it is less fuss than using a cotton pad, in my opinion. In addition to using it between cleansing and moisturizing, I will also use a spritz of it on top of my makeup (Maybelline mineral powder foundation) to give it a nice ""dewy"" look. The only reason I have not given it a full five-star rating is because of the price. Although it lasts pretty long (I have used about half in three months because I use it two or three times daily) it costs more than I typically feel comfortable spending. Amazon's price is cheaper than buying from a salon though, and it is a high-quality product, so I guess the price thing is a relatively minor complaint."
1,"I love this cleanser for it's mild fragrance and it's moisterizing cleasning ability! Gentle but thorough, removes makeup without stripping delicate, sensitive skin!"
1,This is a great witch hazel toner that is completely alcohol free.  The aloe vera and rose petals are really soothing on the skin.  I have sensitive skin that has a tendency to be quite dry and most toners aggravate this issue this one does not.  I bought it multiple times and have never been disappointed.  It is sometimes hard to find in person so this is a great solution for that and it's not more expensive if anything it's less.
1,"that was my question and after using everyday for the last 2 weeks twice a day, i will tell you if it works.I went to the gas station up the street and  my adult son asked me  to pick him up a pack of  cigs.  I know...Idon't smoke.anyway, while paying I got carded.The lady said they have  to card anyone who doesn't look 40.Doesn't look 40!I'm 54.BTW, pay no attention to the name.  I need to change it from my  sonSo, I'd say yes it does.Think getting carded at 54."
1,"i was leery to try this perfume,w/all purchases via internet,u can't ""try before you buy"" which can certainly lead to regretfu purchase..However i was very pleased w/this oil. EGYPTIAN GODDESS is so many things. In reading reviews, alot said it smelled different on everyday,i haven't experienced that but the scent is 1 i quite enjoy& i'm looking forward to purchasing a larger bottle as well as solid perfume(when available). My ONLY drawback was that some reviewers stated to only buy from Auric Blends, i've no prob w/this&thought I HAD but when i recieved perfume in mail the order invoice stated it came from""OLD GLORY""i've no prob w/O.G.,it just troubles me that i clicked on Auric Blends in order to be sure the E.G.oil was the real thing&still ended up getting it from elsewhere.It still smells great but i WILL make sure to have a witness for my next purchase lol! Enjoy this perfume oil,it begs to be worn,shared&experienced..just be careful in crowded places,you may find yourself overwhelmed!"
0,"This so-called ""natural"" hair color still contains the 3 most toxic ingredients: Resorcinol, p-Phenylenediamine, and phthalates in the parfum. I am appalled that this is even considered ""safer"". wow....Google any of these ingredients and you will get an eye-opener. No wonder they don't list the ingredients on the box.From the online ingredient list: Parfum (Fragrance). (+/-) p-Phenylenediamine, 4-Amino-2-Hydroxytolueno.p-Aminophenol, 2-Methyl-Resorcinol, m-Aminophenol, 4-Chloro Resorcinol, N,N-Bis (Hydroxyethyl)-p-Phenylenediamine Sulfate, 2-Amino-4-Hydroxy-Ethylaminoanisole Sulfate."
1,"I've always gotten terrible hangnails -- so bad that they often bleed.  I've used hand lotions and creams to try to help, but I recently saw something in _Allure_ magazine about how great this Solar Oil is, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I love it!Since it is a bit messy, I've been applying it right before bed.  I put a bit on each nail, and massage it around the cuticle area and entire nail bed.  When I wake up, it has sunk in, and it leaves my nails and cuticles nicely moisturized -- much more so than just using regular hand lotion. It's helping to heal up my hangnails.The smell on this is also divine.  It smells like almond cookies.  Great product that I will definitely re-purchase!"
1,"This cream is about as thick as plumber's putty -- it's probably one of the thickest I've tried.  It spreads surprisingly well, considering that, though.  I think once it gets warmed up a bit by your body temperature, it thins a little or becomes more workable.If you have super dry skin, the thickness of this product is wonderful.  This really stays in place, doesn't run, etc.  So it'll actually moisturize the area you apply it to.  For me, it does eventually absorb into the skin, although it takes a few hours to fully do so.This is not really an &#34;all over&#34; moisturizer for me.  I use it on trouble spots to make it last longer.  My elbows get particularly rough during the winter (don't know why, as I wear long sleeves) and Atopalm has helped soften them up for spring and short sleeve weather.  I think this would also be an excellent foot balm for dry, cracked heels.I see &#34;fragrance&#34; in the ingredients list but I don't find the fragrance particularly noticeable.  I like that this product does not contain parabens and artificial dyes, which makes it nice for my sensitive skin.  It's an interesting take on a moisturizer, using a lot of natural fatty acids as the major ingredients (it does contain a bit of silicone -- dimethicone -- but not a lot, it's pretty far down in the ingredients list).Recommended for super-dry (winter) skin!"
1,"I bought 2 of these in October 2011 and they are still working perfectly.  When I have a need for another one, I naturally come back to the same brand, same style - the  Classic - and ship and sold by amazon.I like the fact that when I need to refill, I can take each container out individually, plus the fact that there is one cover on the outside making it easy to keep it clean.Some other dispensers have 2 or 3 chambers and the chambers are all in one piece. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CD3T2U/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc;=1You have to slide the whole thing out even if you only need to fill one chamber when others are still full.  In addition, the others not having a one-piece cover on the outside, water tends to get inside the chamber holding mechanism and mold can develop inside that you can't see without taking the chambers out.  I have a couple of those that came with a house I bought. This also reinforces my decision in going back to the 4-chamber Classic one."
1,Amazing!! I think my hair is the type that needs protein every now and again. I only perform my shampoo/conditioner routine every 2 weeks on my kinky curly hair so I believe that this product is exactly what I need. Makes my hair so soft and its a heat protectant as well (woah!) I put this in a spray bottle because to met its distributed better throughout my hair that way. It smells good and its light. I am very satisfied.
1,"Can't remember how I stumbled onto this product, but am very glad I did.  It works really well and I like that it removes my makeup well too."
1,"I have pretty straight hair and every now and then like a different look. I have tried regular curling irons (1 inch and 1.5 inch); the curls are good but they don't last long and I on't get soft curls with those. This is a great product for soft curls or smoothing out hair in the morning. Best part is, the curls last much longer compared to the regular curling irons. Only thing I would have loved to see in this product is a better brush, this brush is not bad at all, but my hair slip out of it while curling as the teeth are smaller than expected. With loner teeth I guess this would be an ideal product for me :)"
1,Love this purple color.  Goes on smooth and very jewel-like.  Very happy with coverage and with shade of purple.  Would highly recommend.
1,"Honestly, this is a great body wash. Would it not be for the price (too high!) I'd only use this one and never switch.The scent is absolutely amazing!It cleanses with out drying too!"
0,I tried this product with a lot of hope for quite sometime. I didn't see any improvement what so ever. I would not recommend buying it.
1,This is definitely one of my favourite mascaras so far. The wand is very small and thin which takes a little getting used to but the results are rather impressive.
0,"I'm not sure what the exact issue is, but these rollers only curl the bottom of my hair. Maybe 4-5 inches. I suspect this is because they do not get hot enough. The clips are not the worst ever, but they are a  pain. They look like they will be nice, but they don't hold the hair quite as tight as I would like, and they leave a dent every. single. time. My stylist recommended hot rollers to me, saying they are the best way to get a curl that lasts all day, but the curls I get from this barely last an hour. I don't mean that after an hour the curl is a little limp, I mean after an hour my hair looks like it did before I curled it at all. I have hair that is naturally a little wavy, I usually have no trouble holding a curl. I even used Redken spray starch will is great for holding curls, but still no luck. I'm very disappointed.Also, I noticed a very recent reviewer complained her set did not have an on/off switch. Mine does have this switch. A big one right on front that you couldn't miss.  Are there two different models they are shipping at random? That is a problem."
1,"This stuff works really great! I had a couple of medications prescribed by my dermatologist but they never seemed to work for very long and I was always concerned with the side effects. I tried many different things to help and they all usually worked for a little while but eventually I would be back looking for another solution and spending more money. I get the hormonal acne by my mouth area like clockwork every month and this stuff has been the best (and cheapest) solution that works for me. I use it twice a day and concentrate only on the oily areas of my face and this dries it up really quick. I made the mistake of scrubbing my face for a minute the first time and my skin became too dried and started to feel like I had a bad sun burn. This large bottle also lasts a long time. I'm so happy that I bought this stuff off based off of the other Amazon reviewers. You guys picked a winner, Thank you!"
1,I bought this hair dryer after my old one seemed to be taking a long time to dry my very long hair. I also had just bought another ionic hair drying tool and I loved how it helped prevent my hair from getting frizzy. I went to the store and tried out a bunch of hair dryers ranging up to $200 and this one seemed to be just as powerful as some of these very expensive dryers. I also loved that it was ionic. It does a great job at drying my hair and the attachments are really great too. I also paid double in the store for what it is listed at here.
0,"Got this as a free deluxe sample at Sephora. Was underwhelmed. Did not manage my hair, or do anything to make it less frizzy. In fact, it made my hair dry and lifeless. I still have three unused large samples ... I wil give them away or toss.Also, I put a well thought out, but critical review on Quidad's website. They did not print it. If you go to their website, ALL the reviews are positive. Not credible at all. Just leaves a bad taste."
1,Have used this on and off for the past seven years.....really like it! Great cleanser for oily to combination skin.
1,Love the product! it really does work for the lower eye lashes! in love with it. Hope u guys like it as well
1,I looked for this after having a pedicure in a salon and writing down the name of the color and product used. I received and it is great.
1,I got this tip from a co-worker who's daughter had terrible acne-I use it as a body lotion and also on my face.  There is no oily residue
1,the way that the deodorant comes out is a bit odd because it sorta squirts out like its lotion. it smells good and not in an overwhelming way. so far so good!
1,I don't have a problem with this leave in.  This product is not a detangler but the scent is pleasing.  Hopefully time will tell if my transitioning hair is strengthened.  I use this after washing on damp hair. Using this spout on your hair may cause you to use more product than necessary.
1,Live this perfume.  vanilla and sweet.  I will use this often because I get many compliments  when I wear it.
1,Very pretty color. I love any color OPI puts out.  It's a very nice tan color. I would recommend. :)
1,"I do not have any hair volume, this gave me a healthy amount of volume, I love it! So much easier to use instead of using a hair dryer and a round brush. Usually my arm gets tired once I get to the crown and kind of give up. This dryer/styler is very light weight and really easy to use. My hair looks so good when I use this to dry and style."
1,For a really great refreshing shampoo without the necessity of a complete shower or bath or if you are ill or caring for someone who cannot indulge.This is a great idea for what we used it for - i.e. a refresher after a long train ride.
1,I have used this product for many years and it remains the best option for me. No burning. No rashes. No sinus & lung irritation. What a relief!
1,"its a great product, its smell very good. I,d like to say it is really great,and i like it very much."
1,I tested this product on my boyfriend's feet as he get calluses from playing basket ball.  his feet were smooth and clean.  I use it every 2 weeks and apply O'Keefe's Foot Moisturizer and my feet stay soft and smooth.
1,"I have skin so porcelain and sensitive that even ancient Chinese pottery experts would be baffled by it. So, needless to say, finding a soap that doesn't irritate it can be a baffling chore. Enter: Aquanil.This stuff is, honestly, perfect. It's so soft and light in your hands that it feels only slightly more substantial than the small amounts of water you need to dab your face with pre-use. Once you're sufficiently wet enough, apply as much or as little of the soap as you want and you'll barely be able to feel it once it's in place. Scrub to your heart's content- no abrasive soap suds here- and then rinse gently with water and you're done. It's like an odorless, colorless waft of air just hit your face, not a state of the art soap product.Have sensitive skin? Tired of unpleasant soaps with weird fragrances and color additives and grainy suds? Then this is the cleanser for you. It feels like a delightful cloud passing across your skin. Except, y'know, cleaner."
1,"I love the fresh mint scent of Avalon Organics Peppermint Hand and Body Lotion. I've been lookng for a lotion with just that for a long time. Unfortunately, it just isn't moisturizing enough for me. In all fairness, I live in a dry climate, am fairly active and rough on my skin (fairly large house and yard and I do my own house and yard work.) If you have less need for a long lasting, intense moisturizer, this would probably be fine."
1,"Beautiful color (Dolce Vita) on fair skin...healthy, silky feeling lipstick, but needs many re-applications. The only reason not 5-star is because it did not last as long as it should given the price ($24)."
0,I didn't like this at all! The scent is terrible and not relaxing at all. It also didn't bubble at all. It didn't moisturize my skin either. I left the bath feeling more stressed for having had wasted my money on this product. Smell it before you buy it and expect a bubble-less bath.
1,"Wasn't sure about the age of this product.  I buy this product on a regular basis and frequently the color of this cream ranges from white to a cream color.  The color on this particular product was more yellow - I wasn't sure about it but used it anyway.  It didn't seem to cause any break-out.  However, I have since purchased this from other vendors and again the color of the cream ranges from white to a cream color."
1,"Suave Naturals Shampoo, Daily Clarifying - 22.5oz. . .. I have used this many times before and I have always loved the fragrant scent"
1,"This face wash reminds me of the $5.99 wash from Trader Joe's. My skin feels clean, clear, and fresh after using this product, it's affordable and consistent."
1,"I bought this primarily for its SPF function, since my new foundation doesn't contain it.  I've been very impressed with this cream.  After using it 1 month, I noticed my skin tone is more even.  It hydrates well and it doesn't clog pores.The disadvantages are: 1) the shiny finish - perhaps would be better for more mature skin (I'm in my 30's);  and 2) it doesn't last that long.  My tube was gone after 1 month, although I was using it on my neck and chest as well.  I'd say you should expect to buy a new tube every 2 months if you are the only person using it.Due to the low price, I'm going to stick with this cream unless/until I can find other places to cut my budget.  to cut the shine, I use Peter Thomas Roth... a small tube of this lasts at least 6 months:http://www.amazon.com/Peter-Thomas-Roth-Anti-Shine-Mattifying/dp/B001MA5RKK"
1,"I wasnt expecting this scent to smell the way it does, I bought it blindly just based on the reviews and because the price was pretty good, it smells like alcohol at first, but after i let it sit for like a week, i went back to smell it and it smelled good. I wore it to work one morning and i didnt get a reaction of how good i smell like i usually do when i wear my burberry brit or hot water, but later in the day a couple ladies said i smelled pleasant. So its not to shabby i guess. Nothing i would bend over backwards to get though."
1,"This product feels very nice going on and is comfortable to sleep in.  It is not greasy.  I have not had any break outs, and my skin is jumpy with creams.  I thought maybe the formula might be too gentle for any results, but so far I do see a smoothing.  I come from the generation of no sun screen, so my skin has plenty to say for my age.  This cream seems to be undoing some of my past neglect!"
1,"waaaaay awesome that you can use during intercourse. the boyfriend doesn't like it so much for his purposes, but other lovers haven't seemed to notice or mind. easy to clean and toss... i feel a bit guilty about the waste, but mother nature can suck it. we gotta deal with this bleeding, she can deal with my polluting. i make up for it in every other way anyway; i don't even use makeup remover wipes! no bleached cotton growing bacteria all day, no changing every 4 hours, no drippy pee string, no dirty silicone cup to boil, no feeling it at all, no fuss at all, really."
1,Rarely do I go cheap on things that have to do with my hair but I wanted to try out a new size barrel without making a huge commitment so I gave this one a try.Pros:heats up quicklythe barrel and clip hold even my thinner hair tightlygets hot enough to produce a nice curl without burningcool tip makes holding at certain angles easier.Cons:the collar that regulates the temp broke - it is stuck in the temp range I wanted it in so no need to move it but that could be a bigger problem if I wanted varying tempssometimes takes several presses of the on button to get it to turn onno auto turn offFor what I paid I think this is an acceptable choice; if you are looking for something that will last I'd suggest looking elsewhere though.
1,"Have used this for 5 months and have seen a difference. I have sensitive skin and use hypoallergenic so I buy the fragrance free style. It actually does as advertised. I am very impressed. I am 64 and have seen a noticeable improvement in texture.  It is worth trying and the price is reasonable compared to other products. I have never used Olay products before, and am thrilled to find these results at such a reasonable price. I use it with their Pro X scrub and small white brush that spins. Together, with a few other of their Regenerist products, and WOW!"
0,"literally, I don't know they found this or what they did or how long this was sitting around, but I got the bum end of the deal, I used it pretty much to cover up bad smells around the house to use it up........ it was awful and ruined the like I have for the original bottle that I had bought at a department store....... will NEVER buy perfume off internet again."
1,And by fine I mean it does not feel or look heavy on my face. Helps set my liquid makeup if I have used it.
1,"Got this moisturizer because it was the cheapest at Walmart, about $5 bucks. I'm happy with my purchase and I like the subtle shimmer that it has. It doesn't dry out my face, which I tend to experience with these ""brightening"" moisturizers.  One or two pumps is sufficient for your face and neck so I expect it to last a long time before I need to buy more."
1,"Great pads, I usually only get the positively radiant ones. I tried these a year ago and now I am hooked, since the pads are so big I cut them in half for more value."
1,"I use this product second in my regime; I first use Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser, then this, then finish off with Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisturizer. I did a lot of research and found this to be the best B.P. product on the market. It is 2.5% B.P and this is the amount you need in a product, if you go over that it is much too harsh for your skin (especially mine because it is sensitive). Obviously if you have severe acne and need medication type products, that might be different for you. But for the average face, anything over 2.5% B.P is much too harsh. I actually don't buy this product on Amazon I just buy it at my local WalMart and it is about the same price on Amazon, minus the shipping charge. I'd say it's a pricey little product for the small tube you are getting, especially the way I use it all over my face but, hey it works and that's why I stick to it. The other two products I use last months and aren't that expensive for how long they last so I can afford to use this product. While it says it is an ""On the spot"" treatment, I actually use it all over my face. Because it is not a gel and it is creamy, you can't really apply it all over your face then rub it in, you'll have to apply a small amount to your finger and apply in batches. I don't find this annoying or hard to do, though some might because it takes a bit longer. When I first started using this product I only applied a small amount to my face in certain spots to get my skin used to it. Progressively over 2 weeks I began to use more and more and my skins takes it like a champ now. Even though it is a B.P. product, I actually don't get the stiff feeling after applying it all over my face. It also does not leave a white residue as other creamy products might do, it is a little difficult to work in if you're using small amounts but it goes on well. I find that it clears my skin up well but of course I get an occasional pimple or so due to that time of the month or stress or whatever, but much less than I used to! I always let this soak in for about 10 minutes or so before I put on my moisturizer. Overall, a small tube of the product and a bit pricey but it works and I would reccommend it for the average face!"
1,"im in my way to have the second bottle ,this toner is awesome for your face & neck each of you girls should have itabsolutely recommend it."
1,"I dont know why or how this brush doesnt pull my hair extensions out, I have I tip micro-links. Its amazing, I honestly dont know how I would have brushed down to my scalp. So so happy I bought this!"
1,i wasn't happy with the cost but i love the product i just thought there would be more but i like it
1,"I have an oily t- zone...NO lotion has ever worked in treating it (and I have tried MANY different matte lotions) Now having this lotion, I only have very little oil on my nose area but I still see a major difference in my skin compared to before and i am 99.9% satisfied with this product.p.s.This stuff feels like Amazing silk going on the skin.!!!Thanks Clean-and-Clear!"
1,"I have been using this product for approximately a year now, and have no intention of using anything else. I live in a High Desert area, and have until now suffered from dry skin. Since using this face wash (and the Dessert Essence Liquid Soap, Castile) I no longer suffer from dry skin. In my opinion, humble as it is, this is pure excellence."
1,I love this cream! I used it during my first pregnancy and I didn't get any stretch marks and I'm using it again.
1,I sent this to a friend as a gift.  She absolutely loves for it. I will be ordering this product for myself soon.
1,This brush is great for my extensions and also for my natural hair.  It reduces static cling which my natural hair has very badly.
1,"I love this witch hazel and use it as a base for a lot of things. It soothes scalp itchiness, works wonderfully as a toner, I've also used it mixed with tea tree oil and lavender as a natural liquid deodorant and mixed it with citronella oil and lavender as a bug repellent that also works fairly well to clean up hands when my family is out having a picnic.It's also pretty inexpensive. A very nice old fashioned remedy that comes in handy to have in your medicine cabinet!"
1,I have previously bought this soap in lavender but decided to try it in patchouli and I am impressed that I plan on buying more.
1,"I'm not sure if it's all in my mind or if the scent really &#34;works,&#34; but I really enjoy this lotion. I have allergies and usually always opt for the fragrance-free, but Aveeno Stress Relief is the one scent I can tolerate and enjoy. Aside from the soothing scent, the texture is very light and smooth, not greasy or sticky. I highly recommend this product!"
1,"I like the mirror, it lights up but the light isn't that bright in my opinion it's kind of small but it's a gd beginner mirror."
1,"Doesn't come with antiperspirent, as an option, and that doesn't work for me when the weather warms up.  And the applicator just kind of squirts out the creamy gel."
1,"This is my first Essie nail polish purchase. I am happy to report that I love it! ""It's Genius"" is a metallic plum color and it looks beautiful on! The quality of this Essie polish is superb. The price of this product is also great. I purchased this nail polish to use with my Konad Nail Art kit. This nail polish worked fantastically as the base polish for my nail art. Overall, I really feel you can't go wrong with this purchase. Essie is a great nail polish brand, and if you are looking for a beautiful plum-purple color than I would definitely recommend ""It's Genius""."
1,"I love the fact that Burts Bees facial cleanser is a natural product and it doesn't dry out my skin after use.  However, it didn't meet all of my expectations.  I was looking for a natural product that removes makeup and also improves complexion.  The product is natural, but it doesn't do a good job of removing makeup and it doesn't improve complexion.  The product doesn't claim to improve complexion or remove makeup, so it's not falsely advertised.  But if you are looking for those qualities, then I do not recommend this particular Burts Bees product."
1,"After hearing raves about Burt's Bees products, I purchased my ""Head to Toe Starter Kit"" from a mass retailer.  The products in them are small (very small) and they are all basically GWP sizes.  My kit differs slightly from the one above and I'll list off the ""substitutions may occur"" products that came in mine.(1)  Citrus Spice Exfoliating Shower Soap (0.8 oz.): A dark green exfoliating soap about the size of a hotel complimentary facial bar of soap.  Smells of citrus, cinnamon (barely), and patchouli.  If yours is anything like mine, it picked up the scent of the...(2)  Peppermint Shower Bar (0.8 oz):  What can I say, it smells like peppermint.(3)  Wild Lettuce Toner (1 fl. oz): Haven't tried this yet.(4)  Hand Salve (0.3 oz): This stuff looks like Carmex, except less sticky, more firm, and more oily.  A bit unpleasantly oily until it absorbs.  Leaves a soft sheen to your hands.(5)  Honey Lip Balm (0.15 oz): Like a full size of chapstick.  Nice feeling and taste.(6)  Lemon Butter cuticle cream (0.3 oz):  About the same consistency as the Hand Salve, comes in similar packaging.  Has a lovely light lemon chiffon smell.(7) Peppermint Foot Lotion (.47 fl. oz): Smells like Crest toothpaste.  I think I prefer the Bath & Body Works Aromatherapy rosemary-peppermint foot cream.(8)  Orange Essence Facial Cleanser (.56 oz): Formulated for sensitive skin, has a citrus smell.(9)  Almond Milk Beeswax Hand Creme (.25 oz): In a small Carmex-sized jar, this has is very similar to the hand salve, except it is a little easier to apply; it turns to an oily cream at a touch.  Has a wonderful almond smell, but when that fades, it leaves a beeswax smell.  A little bit sticky.  98% natural.(10)  Banana Hand Creme (.25 oz):  Exactly the same as above, except has a faint banana smell.  100% natural.(11) Burt's Bee's Milk & Honey Body Lotion (1 fl. oz): In a hotel-shampoo type container, this softly fragrant body lotion is a little thinner than the consistency of your average Bath & Body Works lotion.I like the Milk & Honey body lotion, the almond milk hand cream, the lemon butter cuticle cream, and the lip balm.  This is a great and relatively inexpensive way to sample a bunch of the products instead of buying the full-sized originals.  I immediately purchased another as a birthday gift for a girlfriend.  The Starter Kit makes a wonderful ""whenever"" gift, great upscale bathroom gifts for guests, cleansing + moisturizing travel pack (I'd give it half a week before used up), or just something for yourself.  It is well packed and comes in a handy clear plastic zippered bag that is sized *just right* for this collection.  If you like samples, this is a good buy.  While I don't like all of the products, at least I got a chance to try them.  Next time, they should perhaps replace a ""creme"" with a small bottle of shampoo.  But I'm just nitpicking now :)Verdict:  I would definitely buy this again."
1,deep cleans and takes off all your makeup even waterproof makeup. I wouldnt recommend for dry skin though because it can leave it drier.
1,"My favorite color ever!  I'm addicted to it.  The polish lasts well too, but I only use it on my toes."
1,I like Camille Beckman's products. Oriental Spice has a nice scent and does a nice job moisturizing. Need three more words.
1,"PanOxl bar used to be available locally, but my drug store stopped carrying it.  So I am very glad I found it on amazon.  There are two varieties a 5% and a 10%.  For me, I usually use the 10% during the warmer months of the year, and the 5% during dry/cold winter months because the PanOxl soap does have a drying effect.This product works better for me than any other acne/face soap that I have ever used. It lathers well, apply to face, and rinse clean. The medication in the soap is great at clearing up blemishes, and better yet, prevents break-outs.I tend to have oily skin on my face, but using PanOxl soap in the morning and at night prevents my face from becoming shiney.The soap comes in a little plastic soap dish with a clear lid, so it is clean and self-contained.I recommend this soap to anyone who has oily skin or acne breakouts. If you tend to have dry skin on your face, you may want to try the 5% first.  I have used it for years. Glad to see that it is carried on amazon."
1,"I can't really help you pick this polish based on the color, since I recommend doing a Google search for color swatches and bear in mind things are never a guarantee based on the colors on your monitor and the way the person took the photo, you could see things in a whole different light. However I can comment on the seller, the price, the quality. All were excellent and I love this polish."
1,"I have noticed that a bad hair day can really put a damper on my whole day, weird but true! I remember reading a national study done on women and it pretty much said the same thing, so I make sure to avoid bad icky hair as much as possible.As a big fan of Burt's Bees and their natural holistic approach to beauty and body care I was recommended to try this product by a friend of mine who's always absolutely gorgeous and wholesome looking without even trying too hard. Her hair was all the way down to her waist and she said this was her secret weapon. That was pretty much all it took for me to buy it and try it myself. The ingredients in this product are; Vegetable Glycerin, Olive Oil, Oat Protein, Avocado Oil, Orange Oil, Lanolin, Sweet Almond Oil, Water, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Nettle Extract, Rosemary Extract, FragranceI have long hair now, which I keep dying million colors of blonde because dark colors never stay on my hair and this is a blessing to combat for the long length and the split ends and dryness that always follows. I have medium and pin straight hair and this is not too heavy at all. The tube is metal, the contents are avocado scented toothpaste like and goopy but I love to massage it in my wet hair and then twist it up as I brush my teeth, shave, washy my face and do all my other shower stuff. If I have scrubs and oils and any activities that take me longer in the shower, I always make sure to use this mask so it can penetrate for the longest time possible. When I am done I simply shampoo and follow with some conditioner for 30 seconds and that's all it takes for slippery, shiny and luscious hair. This is a great product, its natural and not that expensive and it always ends up being used up more than I have left it as when I have people over.Burt's Bees people recommend it to be used ever time when one shampoos, but even when used once a week I can tell that my hair is well nourished and happy. This is a product that I have been buying for years and I don't ever think I will stop, it's natural , wonderful and easy to find!- Kasia S."
1,"First off, if you have an Ulta near by, you can find this product there for four dollars in the same size. I used to use the Biore oil control clay mask which is an excellent product but they're no longer selling it anywhere. I was going to buy another expensive mask to replace the Biore but decided to try the Freeman brand since it was so inexpensive. It's not as good as the higher priced masks of course but it works well enough for me to purchase again. It leaves my face feeling soft and tightens up my pores. The results don't last very long for me; I have a very oily face due to hormone imbalances and it's very hard to control this for more than one day. I use this mask every three days and use an oil-control cream cleanser the rest of the time. My favorite thing about the Freeman mask is that it doesn't cost much. If it were more than ten dollars, I would never buy it."
1,"Here is a good, ""quick and dirty"" daily solution for graying/balding. I use it daily on my hairbrush for my beard.  It works, and has worked for several years."
1,"Yes, you read that right.  This oil is an amazing moisturizer for oily skin.After learning about how skin's oil production works, I threw out all my expensive face care products and started washing my face with organic raw honey.  Afterwards, while my face is still *very slightly* damp (important!), I apply a few drops of this organic jojoba oil.  About 10 minutes after you apply, your skin will look and feel like velvet.  I have been doing this morning and night for the last 6 months.  I still have half of the bottle left.I used to have a very oily T zone, but now my T zone stays matte for the entire day.  Even when I wake up in the mornings, my skin is matte.  My skin has never looked smoother or felt more supple.  My skin feels comfortable, not dry or tight.Jojoba oil mimics human sebum (your skin oil) more closely than any other compound in nature. That's why it works so great.Lovely natural product, works great, much less expensive than ""commercial"" facial moisturizers.(PS cheapest price I've found is at Vitacost, depending on if you order enough for the free shipping)"
1,I use this eyeliner after I use pencil eyeliner to give it more color and lasting power. I bought the brown liquid eyeliner. Its very good.
1,"I'm using this product with support hose for lymphedema. I use hosethat are thigh high and have a tendency to roll down as I walk. Thisadhesive keeps my hose up all day. There is some residue, but it isn'tsticky and washes right away. I've been using this type of product fora number of years and this one works very well."
1,I use this face wash with my Clarisonic and I love it!  It;s gentle and it doesn't leave skin oily. I follow up with Hope in a Jar.
1,"I've had adult acne for quite a few years now, and have been given just about everything except Roaccutane (which I'm very hesitant to try after reading on all the side effects), with no success.  However, a couple years ago I decided to start taking various Vitamins by themself (rather than a multivitamin), so took Biotin, B12, Super B Complex, Vit E, C, Beta Carotene and Omega 3-6-9 and had clear skin from last year February until now.  However, recently have been having some serious breakouts in my chin area (due to stress I think) and my Dermatologist has put me on Ketoconazole antibiotics, Triamcinolone cream and Clindamycin spray for the past 2 months (also have eczema), but I just keep breaking out more!In desperation I decided to ditch the cream and look for a masque.  The lady at the Beauty Store suggested Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque..never heard of it before, but she said it worked wonders for her.  Decided to try it the same evening (a week ago Saturday).  The next morning the pimples had all dried up considerably, but by mid-day I broke out with new comedones (whiteheads)!!  I nearly freaked out, but decided to check Amazon where I read others saying the same thing.  However, I decided to try applying the masque every day for a week as someone suggested and so far it has actually worked.  I do still break out with new ones the day after, but not as often, and it is that time of month, so that may explain why too.  I've therefore decided to try this for a couple more weeks and see what happens before I call it quits, so will give an update then."
1,"I am a dark skinned African American women and I can honestly say that this product really did help to lighten the spots on my face, however the container that it is made can EASILY break or crack just from even placing down too hard on the counter. Also the only reason I stopped using this product was due to the smell. After a while it began to make me nauseous  and I just couldn't bare with it any longer. But overall the product really does work. :)"
1,"Good product, makes your hair soft and works great as a defrizzer (and for me, that's saying a lot - I have Hermione Granger hair.) The only complaint I have is the smell. It isn't a BAD smell...but it isn't a great smell either. Just smelling it tickled my nose and made me sneeze, and none of my hair products have ever done that before since I don't use hairsprays or anything like that. But, it worked so much better than the leave-in conditioners that I tried from the salon (Biolage products, for example). So for that, I will deal with the smell and give it 4 stars out of 5."
1,"My hair is thinning due to medications I am on--my hairdresser recently gave me layers and I was looking for an air brush with a smaller barrel.  I read the reviews on this air brush and decided I would go with this brand--one I haven't tried before.  I was afraid the smaller barrel might be too small, but to my surprise and delight, it is perfect and gives me such beautiful curls and is so easy to use.  It is definitely tangle free and dries my hair quickly and easily.  Love not having to bother with a round brush and dryer.  This just makes drying my hair such a breeze.  It is lightweight and does not come in a clam shell.  I let my hair air dry a while and then use the low setting and curling option.  Great product for me and I would recommend it."
1,I've been using this for almost 2 years. It is so expensive to go to a salon so I do my own color with Feria! This color looks like a subtle red-brown until you step in the sun or under a light. Then the color looks really bright red. It's very pretty and easy to apply.
1,Only reason I give the item 3 stars is it did not cure my 5 year old daughters thumb sucking habit shes very determined to do so I guess
1,"I've been using this for months now, and I still can't really tell if it's actually working or not. I kind of feel like it doesn't but I still use it. The small beads are not too rough on the skin and the smell makes it that much more pleasurable to use, but I'm still uncertain if it actually does what it insists. I understand products work differently among the person that is using it but I'm really not impressed with the scrub."
1,"great coverage on your face, i just wish there was some sort of scent to it, otherwise wonderful product. THanks"
1,"I've always loved Neutrogena products and when I'm in the States, I stock up on this and some shampoos because you can't get these here in slow Australia.  This is one of the best hair treatments I've ever used and I love how soft and silky my hair is afterwards.I straighten my hair every 2-3 days which can be highly damaging, yet with this, you couldn't tell.  It's great for putting moisture back in, and for dull looking hair and split ends.  You have to be careful not to use too much or it can feel a little heavy and 'greasy' otherwise, but with the right amount (you have to play around to get your own right amount based on hair length), it feels great and leaves your hair smelling gorgeous.  It's easy to use and I use it religiously once a week on Fridays and you could never tell that I don't go to the hairdresser as often as I should or that I straighten it too much.I cannot rate this highly enough and hope that you'll give it a go.  You certainly don't have to use super expensive items, and this is great value and does a wonderful job.  I love it."
0,"I'm amazed at all the good reviews people have given this product.  This leave in conditioner is SO watery and runny and doesn't help detangle or condition hair at all.  I knew that it was a liquid leave in conditioner, but I was expecting it to have a slippery feel to it like other leave in conditioners I've used.  This however is just like scented water.I definitely would not recommend this product.  Waste of money."
1,"I started to use Natural Instincts instead of permanent dyes because I was scared a permanent dye would mess up my hair after it's been dyed/re-dyed/highlighted for 10 yrs.  I read good reviews about this and picked up a box at Whole Foods for $16.  I was hesitant that an organic/natural hair dye using vegetable and such would come out some weird color and didn't really think it would have any staying power... but this dye was a surprise.  The color is rich and deep.  Before dying I had dark blonde/golden hair and after using this product you can still see golden undertones but the hair is definitely brown now.  I would not classify this as what people usually consider ""dark blonde"", it is definitely a brownish color but it has no red hues in my hair.  My hair felt nice after dying too-not too dry.The reason I have 4 stars instead of 5 is at $16/box this is about twice the price as what I normally buy and the color on the box is misleading so you don't know exactly what you're purchasing until you experiment with several boxes.  I know most hair coloring kits don't look on the box just like what they will in your hair, but if you see this box in person you will see what I mean.  The top of the box where it shows a sample of the hair color-is just a weird color and completely off.  This product would be much more successful with better marketing because the actual dye is great... but without reading good reviews I would have never purchased this.Using Natural Instincts (as well as other at home color kits) I had plenty of dye left over after covering my long hair (well below the shoulders) but with Naturtint I could barely cover my hair with one box... just to warn people with thicker or longer hair.  I'll be sticking with this dye, it looks natural and although more expensive than other at home kits, it seems to not dry out my hair as much as other dyes.  Still cheaper than going to the salon too..."
1,"I started checking out facial cleansers on Amazon because, in my late 20's I'm experiencing yet again some terrible break outs like I did back in high school. It seems the last few weeks I've tried everything and nothing worked and the toughest concealer wasn't enough to hide it. Along with the breakout, I was getting welts and redness on my cheeks, and the skin was uncomfortable and hot to touch. So I got this stuff based on the good reviews and because it was extremely mild and soap free, since I didn't think my skin could tolerate any more harshness. Its mild, has no odor and is soap free which is a plus, but i do wear light makeup every day and this wasn't enough to thoroughly clean it off every night. I know this because I gently ran a finger nail down my face after cleansing it with this stuff and there was makeup on my finger. To make matters a little worse, I started getting white heads (milia) around my cheek and chin area.. i'm pretty sure because this didn't cleanse well enough and my pores we just backing up with junk. I'm still on the hunt for another facial cleanser, but i'll keep this only because it makes a good shaving lotion. I guess thats a benefit."
1,"I've now tried three Auric Blend body oils... and this is by far, my favorite. Very feminine and sweet & just can't stop smelling myself....  so in love with this scent. No allergic reactions to this product & my husband loves it when I wear this, as well. Very impressed, will definitely re-order!"
1,"I absolutely LOVE this little jar. The Amber Butter reminds me of the 60's, I'm gonna refill it with some solid perfume when it runs out."
1,"You get what you pay for - an excellent conditioner at an excellent price.  I used to spend a gazillion dollars (Well, maybe not exactly a gazillion, but close to twenty bucks) on conditioners for my shoulder length, fine but thick hair that likes nothing better than to tangle beyond recognition after washing it in the shower.  Suave makes the tangles comb out easily.I used to think the expensive ones were much better for my hair than the ""grocery store"" brands. Then when traveling and not being able to find my shampoo in an ""under 4 oz."" size that I could carry on the plane I decided to wait until I reached my destination to buy some shampoo. I bought this one because I like the name brand that it is comparable to, but also because it was cheap and I wouldn't feel bad about leaving a good portion of it behind at the end of the trip. (I gave the remaining shampoo to the person at the hotel front desk).I was so surprised to find that this shampoo left my hair just as soft and manageable as the more expensive brand. I couldn't tell the difference! Still, I thought maybe it was just the difference in water or the weather at the place I was staying on the trip. I bought the shampoo again at home when I ran out of my salon brand and found that it performed just as well with the local water, weather, etc. That was 6 years ago and I have been using Suave shampoos and conditioners ever since. I haven't found a single one that I don't like and I've saved a bundle on shampoos and conditioners."
1,"This is a decent eye makeup remover, but not the best in my opinion. Makeup is removed pretty easily but I don't know if its the product itself adding to eye dryness on my lids, or something else. This product is a convenient buy, and pretty gentle. Dries fast with no oily residue at all. This is my second or third time purchasing. Can be found at any drug store."
1,"I originally received this product as a sample and loved it!  When I finished the sample in only a couple days, which doesn't often happen with other samples, I ordered this tube.  This one is lasting a while.  It's a great, fast-absorbing moisturizer especially since I live in a very dry climate.  I've even put it on my face and it hasn't irritated it.  Would highly, highly recommend!"
1,"I've tried many products out there, expensive types or the over the counter items easily available.  However, of all the systems I wasted my money on, this is the ONE.  This cleanser is the ONLY cleanser that actually washes away the mineral makeup, my greasy oily face, and leaves my skin clean! It doesn't irritate of overly dry.I am using the whole complete Obagi Nu-Derm system.  I am now on their Maintenance Program and my skin is smoother, brighter and supple! I'm glad I can purchase this wonderful cleanser from Amazon and not have to go into my Derm's office to buy it.Update: Feb. 13, 2013:I am not using the Obagi system anymore because after years of using this line, it was not doing anything for my skin anymore.  I believe because as time goes on our skin's conditions change with the weather, our health, stress level, hormonal changes, etc.  Sometimes you have to switch to a different product when such said product does not produce marked improvements.Currently, I am using the Exuviance Acne-Oily Skincare line that I purchased at Ulta, after the saleswoman told me it had helped her adult acne and oily skin.  We'll see, as only time will tell how this will work for me."
1,"This is, hands down, the best face wash. It's so good, that I went and bought the gigantic jug and plan on buying another one as soon as I run out. Why? Because it makes my skin so clear, so even toned, so soft and it's so gentle. I recommended it to someone I know that had some issues with dry/flaking skin and it cleared up within 2 days.Granted, not everyone has the same skin so this might not be as perfect for you as it was for me. But let me tell you, if you're going to try something new and be adventurous about your face wash, start here. 9 times out of 10, you will not regret it."
1,I especially like the dimethecone in this product. It really softens and fills the lines in my face. Will buy again
1,"I've wanted to love this product, but every time Ive used it, I've had the same result--mediocre curls. I read other reviews stating that you shouldn't use any types of hair oil or anything like that to ensure that the curls will stay. Ive tried cutting out every thing that may make the curls come out (leave in conditioner, hair oil, etc) and they still do not stay well."
1,I love this product.It ads so much moisture to your skin/face without looking shiny.  Withing minutes your skin feels so soft and the tiny lines look softer!  I've used this a week or longer and I can honestly say I am seeing the results....even in the deeper wrinkles on the upper lip and at eye point.  I will continue to purchase
1,"If you are going to buy this face wash, buy the 32 ounce size because you definitely get more for your money.  I've been using this product for about 6 months and I really love it.  It is a little on the thin consistency side, but it doesn't stop it from working up a good lather.  If you have sensitive skin like I do, please don't give up on this if your face happens to break out after using it the first couple of days.  For some reason, any time I switch to a new face wash, my face rebels and breaks out for about the first week.  After that, it clears up and I haven't had a problems since.  I did just find a new way to use this soap, besides washing my face.  I had a blemish on my cheek that um...how do I say this without being gross....it was swollen but without a whitehead.  I decided that after I washed my face to take a Q-tip and dab some of the soap on the blemish and let it sit over night without washing it off.  The next morning, it wasn't swollen anymore, and I repeated the same process the next night.  It completely disappeared after that!  I couldn't believe it, this soap is that awesome that you can use it as a blemish treatment.My husband even uses this as his body wash and he really likes it.  I will only buy this face soap from now on."
1,"It smells so good, and it's a light foam.  If you're looking for a bubble bath, this isn't one.  The foam is very light.  I love that they have it on amazon because I cannot find it in any stores.  I find the smell very light and relaxing and it doesn't dry out my skin while I'm sitting in the tub.  I will keep repurchasing this."
1,I love this soap for after shave.Whats great about this bar is that is doesnt lather up bubbles but it melts onto your skin leaving it soft and if you have irritated skin like excema or razor bumps its gentle on the skin..Leaving skin soft...
1,"When choosing skin care products, I usually follow the recommendations fromThe Skin Type Solutionor Paula Begoun'sDon't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me). This product is one of Paula's Picks for an overall excellent product, so I decided to try it when I needed to pick up a new cleanser.I have very sensitive skin, and this did burn slightly the first time I used it, but, since then, it has been fine.  It also works great with a Clarisonic brush.Since, as of my writing this review, Amazon isn't including the ingredients list for this product, I wanted to include them here:Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Ricinoleate, Isohexadecane, TEA-Cocoyl Glutamate, Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PEG-20 Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Bisabolol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Stearyl Glycyrrhetinate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, BHT, Geranium Maculatum Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Propylparaben, MethylparabenThis is a great cleanser for the price, but I just wish that it were free of parabens.  It's worth trying, though, if you have sensitive skin."
1,I am using this product for 7-8 months now & I don't think it makes any difference to my skin. I mean no positive or negative effect. So probably I vl not buy this again.
0,I do not like these.  Don't waste your money.  Don't like the way they go on or stick to the face. Very disappointed  in this product.  Would not buy again
1,this is the best brand of polish i know of it stays on and the color is awesome i love it!!!!! will continue to buy it i have use it for years can't beat it !!!
0,This product did nothing for my wrinkles.  It does moisturize well. Although I wil not be reordering it.
1,"I bought this Retinol product to prepare my skin prior to a mild peel treatment. It is a good night cream, but I wish they would go easy on the fragrance, or offer a low-fragrance version of it. It is also quite strong. Most of the time, I use it on the skin on my throat, which tends to get crepey if I don't moisturize it."
1,"...to clear up a blemish!  It is pink when put on the blemish, so it is a lotion one would want to use at nighttime when they will be going to bed.  Who wants to walk around in the day time with pink dots on their face?!  But, it sure does work well!"
1,"I was looking for a soap that is non harsh to the skin and to my nose since i have a very sensitive skin and any fragrance or scent makes my nasal so congested i have problems breathing. I just found out about my condition recently when i was using Ivory soap. Little did i know that Ivory is so overpowering, scent wise.So i search Amazon and found an excellent reviews and well satisfied customers who have used Vanicreme. I bought it at Walgreens because i wanted to try it right away.  I was really amazed by the wonders of this soap. I used it to my face for cleansing and it did not even irritate my eyes at all like those regular soap. Plus, i didn't have to wear any moisturizer because it didn't make my face really dry.  I used it as a body soap as well.  My mom and brother likes a lot because it does not dry their skin as well. From now on, we'll be using this soap for good..  I am planning to try their products."
1,"I love love love this cleanser!!! I'm changing products all the time to see if I find a better fit, but I always come back to this cleanser! It feels sooo good on my combination acne prone skin. It doesn't dry it out, however I can feel it cleanses very well. I like to leave it on as a mask during the time I brush my teeth (about 5 min or so), then when I rinse it off my skin feels amazing, there's a light tingling feeling and incredible deep clean sensation! They say it contains beta hydroxy, so I'm guessing it's acting a little kind of like very light peeling, refreshing your complexion every time..."
1,"I love my &#34;Amazing&#34; products, but honestly, the Firming Body Emulsion part of it does not work.  Love the soft feminine scent along with the thickness/coverage of the lotion.  I feel so pretty when I am wearing my Amazing Grace products. I have been a fan of Amazing Grace for quite a few years."
1,"I am unhealthily obsessed with having clear skin, as I had very clear skin until my mid 30s.  Seborrheic dermatitis is one of the banes of my life, and I think it came about as a result of antibiotic overuse when I used to get chronic bronchitis (antibiotics can really disrupt your ""good"" versus ""bad"" flora and can aid and abet opportunistic yeast overgrowth--and somehow, don't understand the exact mechanism, this yeast overgrowth can work its way into your skin tissue).  No one else in my family has Seb Derm, and based on the youtube videos I've watched about Seb Derm, it seems like most people who get it develop it when they're a teenager or young adult.  I had beautiful, clear, glowing skin when I was a teenager and young adult. I've completely overhauled my diet, as my skin will break out if I eat added/concentrated sugars, refined grains, junk food, and highly processed food. I regret that when I was a teenager and young adult with very clear skin, I did not eat so healthfully.  My doctor will only prescribe hydrocortisone cream and an anti-fungal cream for my Seb Derm.  I refuse to use hydrocortisone cream because I've heard so many horror stories about it--only at best a temporary fix, can thin the skin, and will make your skin much worse in the long run.  A few days ago, I had a consultation with an aesthetician from a medical day spa and asked about products that can help minimize the lingering redness of Seb Derm.  She gave me a sample of a product that many women suffering from melasma use, and so far, I like it.  She also highly recommended Jojoba oil and said of all of the oils on the market, it is the most similar to the skin's natural sebum.  My skin just soaks it in.  I also use Argan oil, and as long as I don't put it on active dermatitis breakouts, my skin tolerates both oils really well.  I'm actually going to try a ""gentle"" microdermabrasion to see if that will help clear up my skin, and I'm crossing my fingers that it won't make it worse.Overall, I'm loving this organic Jojoba oil, and it just feels like silk when applied to the skin."
1,I use this when I go out into the sun because it has that SPF 50 thing. I do burn terrible in the sun without it. It feels lovely on my skin. It does not have that terrible fragrance that most suntan lotions have. It does have a minute fragrance that my sinuses are able to tolerate. I do love the feel of it on my skin. I'm very happy with this product.
1,"This is MUCH more than a hand cream. It's not really a cream, which initially disappointed me; it's basically a slightly thinner, petrolatum/vaseline-type product. I initially just wanted a fragrance-free creamy hand lotion I could put rub into my hands the same way I would with any other lotion. But this has a slightly different purpose; it's more of a dry skin treatment than a standard lotion-type moisturizer. I found that if I rubbed just a dab on the backs of my hands and on my nails where they can get a rough, ragged and chapped, it softened them up within a matter of a few days. And because it's a little thinner than vaseline, it rubs right in. If it leaves behind any residue, I haven't noticed. I also use it on other dry areas like my elbows and knees without concern that it will come off on my clothes. I have also started using it 2 or 3 times a day on the very rough, dry areas on my feet, including my heels. I spend much of the year barefoot and never wear socks down here in our almost tropical climate. Now, with just a few applications, most of the dry areas are basically ""cured,"" and my VERY dry, cracked heels are close to it. I will have to continue using it as a preventive measure, but it does work beautifully.Since the tube size is legally small enough to put in my carry-on on flights and I prefer the fragrance-free version, I can also use it on my face around my eyes and my lips which get dry on long flights. It's basically a multi-purpose product I wouldn't be without and costs no more than a regular jar of vaseline. OTOH, if you ARE looking for something thicker like vaseline, you might find this a little on the thin side. I still recommend trying it, though."
1,"I was looking for a beige polish and this delivers. It has great shine when dry , true color and applies very evenly."
1,"Got this and stuck 4 ties in it to go on a cruise for 2 weeks in Europe.  It made it back in one piece but didn't really get abused that much.  The construction seems to be good, despite some other complaints about the quality.  Time will tell if the zipper holds up or not, but so far so good."
1,Creamy formula glides on lips.  Non-irritating despite the fact it has a SPF 15; most sunscreens irritate my lips.  Definitely will buy again.
1,"Thank you Amazon for finding an importer for this makeup.  When Max Factor stopped selling in the US, I was devastated.  I then found it at another place online, but they stopped carrying it too.  I hope this vendor will continue the relationship with Amazon.This makeup is creamy, covers well, and comes in a variety of shades to blend with almost any skin tone.  And it is a lasting makeup.  I get several month's use from each tube.  I also love this makeup, because I no longer have to worry about spills when I travel.  It's not magic, but it will cover those flaws and blemishes, of which I have far too many.  It doesn't cake or look garish.  What else can you say?  It works!It is expensive, since it has to be imported, but it is worth the cost to me to.  I love using it that much."
1,"Love this. Have been using for 3 years when my hair was shampooed after surgery at USC. Really good to have in the house at all times.Leaves hair clean & soft, very ideal when you are having medical problems or very cold weather"
1,I found my hair color on the mons site and it is such a relief not having to worry about buying it every month it will just arrive. I love this color have been using it!
1,"This is one of the few Philosophy products I buy. I love the fresh smell, as clean as soap and water, as crisp as your favorite white T-shirt, as refreshing as a breath of fresh air on a snowy winter night. The light, sweet scent and the skin-nourishing benefits of philosophy's lotion is well known. this is infused with vitamin E, aloe, and other natural extracts, the antioxidant-rich formula moisturizes and soothes skin, leaving it soft.This my very favorite lotion product of all time! I love the scent and so does everyone I know,they always compliment me on it and it seems to last and last, even better when you use the bath and shower scent too! I would never spend this much on a product that has not proven to be so great.Recommended. prisrob 03-25-13"
1,"This dog wash works great on my French bulldog. It makes him smell good and helps with his dry, flaky skin."
1,"I am a devoted user of the Neutrogena acne wash line.  However, the acne washes don't really remove makeup.  Annoying, right?  Last thing those of us with sensitive skin need is left behind makeup.  I started using these wipes to remove makeup.  I have also used the Biore brand of oil free wipes.  These are thicker and softer.  The Biore wipes are scratchier.  I like these better.  However, they are not perfect.  They are pretty much useless for eye makeup.My typical routine: Wipe off my makeup at some point in the evening.  I then wash my face (could be immediately afterwards, could be just before bed) with my Neutrogena Acne Wash Grapefruit Scrub to exfoliate and get in that salicylic acid.  Also, I just don't feel 100% clean without washing my face.  I have washed my face before bed every single day for the past 20 years, so it's a hard habit to break!  After that, if I have a pimple, I dab on a spot treatment. I also take a cotton ball and remove remaining eye makeup.  I always end up removing eyeliner and mascara this way.  These pads don't get that off.For me, this is a 3.5 star product.  It removes most makeup.  I've tested it by using toner afterwards and the cotton balls come out clean.  But it doesn't remove eye makeup.  To be a 5 star product, it should remove eye makeup too."
1,Definitely making a difference lightening marks and uneven tone. It has a weird consistency but it does work - I noticed a difference after about a week of consistent use. Highly recommend.
1,"Thanks to all the reviewers that have shared with candid honesty...  I found them to be very helpful before buying this product.  I'll try to do the same, hoping someone will find it helpful.This product was definately a godsend for me, but it's definately not for everyone.  My sister, for one, would have tried it once and said, ""Yeah, good luck with that one..."".  But I was deturmined to give it a chance because I no longer find tampons comfortable, and frankly end up wasting a lot of them because I think they need a change and then find that they don't and it's not like you can put those back in.  I really liked how this product gave me the comfort of feeling clean and dry when I was wearing it, yet I could take it out and clean it and put it back in.  Talk about reducing waste!  One of these could easily last an entire period.  I still wear a decent panty liner or super thin pad as a back up (like Always Dry Weave, which would give me time if I needed to get to a bathroom) but at least I get to feel clean and dry while wearing it, as opposed to having to sit in the 'stuff' I'm menstruating.  Also, I use to have a terrible time sleeping with a sanitary pad because I would get woken up by the sensation of the blood trickling gravity-style downward while I wondered if I was sufficiently covered to not stain the bed. Such a hassle and lots of restless sleep.  The Instead allows me to not be awakened by that, yet not have to deal with tampons that never lasted all night anyway.  So, now for the down side.  It's a bit tricky getting used to insertion and I'm not so sure the one size fits all.  It feels like it's a bit big around, but maybe it would leak if it weren't so.  I love how flexible and bendable it is and it's not bulky.  After trying this I KNOW I could never use one of the non-desposable bulkier Diva type models with a stem to grab.  The Instead seems much more user friendly compared to those.The ideal bathroom would have a sink right next to the toilet so you could remove the Instead, rinse it and re-insert it.  Or better yet, do it in the shower!  But that's not usually the location you'll find yourself in.  Oddly, I found that many times I didn't actually need to remove it!  Something about the position of crouching over the seat in a public bathroom seems to lend to enabling the Instead to purge it's contents into the toilet without me actually needing to remove the thing.  Odd, but hey, who was I to look a gift horse in the mouth? I just made sure it was situated back how it should be before finishing my business.  Once, I did remove it in a public bathroom and wiped it down with a flat wad of toilet paper before re-inserting it.  Gross, yes, but then so are pads with clots in them that I have to sit on until the next change, so it's a trade off.  Ahh the joys of womanhood.  I don't think I ever washed my hands so much before and after entering the bathroom until purchasing this product.  So there's always an up side to everything. I think every woman should try these to see if they'll work for them.  I wish I had found these 20 years ago.  I bought a box of 24 and plan to give one to my niece and another to a close friend just so they can try it and see if it'll work for them and make their lives easier.  It's definately better than the alturnatives if you can make it work.  Good luck ladies!"
1,I love this stuff its just like I remembered! I will definitely be repurchasing again once this runs out I love it!
0,"I love the smell of cocoa butter, so was looking forward to bathing with it.  However, this bar soap doesn't smell anything like cocoa butter.  Worse, it doesn't seem to moisturize my skin either.  I won't repurchase."
1,"I'm in my mid-thirties and have NEVER had strong, long nails.  They have always split and peeled so they could never grow longer then my finger tips.  I used gel polish for a couple years as that was the only polish that would last a week and would make my nails feel a bit stronger so they could grow.  But every time I removed the gel polish, my own nails were just getting weaker and weaker until at least three of them split half way down my actual nail bed.  I decided to try this after reading all the great reviews and was diligent.  The first three weeks I didn't see any improvement and was going to give up, but by the 4th week 8 of 10 nails are long and strong!  When I take this off weekly my nails aren't peeling or weak, it's amazing.  They are so strong.  I have NEVER had nails like this.  I follow the instructions exactly; on clean nails apply two coats, followed by a coat each day for the next 5 to 6 days.  Then remove and start over.  I go through a bottle a month, way cheaper then shellac every week and I'm hoping to be able to use color soon!"
1,I was first introduced to this perfume in the 80's when my friend in high school wore it. I loved it. It was such a soft floral scent that was really feminine and girly. I sort of forgot about it over the years but smelled it the other day on someone passing by and a flood of memories came back. Now I have to buy some for myself. I forgot how lovely the scent was until I smelled it again!
1,"I have been searching forever for some TRUE FREE AND CLEAR soap.This is the ONLY thing I have been able to find that doesn'tirritate my skin. Would highly recommend to anyone that suffersfrom Chronic Eczema.Vanicream Cleansing Bar, Fragrance Free, 3.9 Ounce Bars (Pack of 3)"
1,"I bought this to replace a similar product from a different brand.  It is larger, thicker, and more absorbent than the other one, and I really like it.  I have approximately elbow length hair, fine strands but thick volume with 2a/b curls.  This dries faster than a towel and leaves my hair less fuzzy.  It also seems to result in less breakage; hair is a lot weaker when it is wet and traditional towels are hard on it.  The towel is also thinner than a traditional towel, and so you can easily make a great turban that dries your hair while you put on makeup or do other things."
1,This comb works great on my hair. I use it while I have conditioner on my hair to remove tangles.
1,"I love OPI. It's always consistently a good polish but this color is much more brown in person then in the photo. I wanted a dark grey but when I got it it's definitely more dark brown. I still like the color though, and I have been using it."
1,Lovvvvvvvveeeeeee love! I use this spray to set my makeup and honey child!!!! It works and makes your face look dewy and life like!!! Yasssssss I love it!!!!!
1,"I have naturally light brown hair. Sun In is a great way for me to go blond that is very easy. Just spray it on, and head out into the California sun. I also feel Sun In gives my hair nice body and makes it fuller. People have commented on my hair, thinking I was a natural blond.I just wish they made a product to just do the roots of your hair. To spray from the bottle just the roots is alittle difficult.But overall, a very easy way to go blond with a natural look."
1,"I love using pure tea tree oil.  Be warned, too much on your bare skin and it will BURN.  I like to add a tiny drop to a cotton pad moistened with witch hazel after my shower but before applying moisturizer to my face.  I usually wipe down my oily t-zone and maybe my whole face at least once per week.  This provides a nice cooling effect and the smell does not linger, (some mind the scent--I don't.)  Since using the oil in this manner, I have not had breakouts and my skin feels clean and smooth.  You can also add a few drops to your witch hazel and create a nice toner.  I wouldn't go over 5-20% pure tea tree oil."
1,"I have shoulder-length, medium-textured hair, and I can fit all of my hair in these rollers.  They're great for giving your hair some body and slight curl at the ends, which is what I wanted.  I also like that the unit is small and easy to store away."
0,"I wanted to like this soap.  The fragrance was wonderful until it stayed on everything I washed with it.  I rinsed and rinsed, and  tried using less with no avail.  I bought the Seventh Generation Free and Clear dish soap instead and didn't have the same peobelm."
1,"I still got stretchmarks even with religious use of this product. After asking my doctor and reading books and online articles, I'm not sure if stretchmarks is something you can avoid by rubbing in some cream. I think genetics and your body shape plays a factor, too. I mean I have friends who just used plain old olive oil and coconut oil and didn't get stretchmarks. I had friends who didn't do anything and didn't get stretchmarks. Then there are gals that tried everything and still got stretchmarks.I still give it 4 stars because it's inexpensive enough that if you want to try it, it's very affordable. Plus it smells great and has a great texture. Rubs in easily and is a nice way to relax and bond with you baby in utero while giving yourself a little R&R; time and a belly massage. And this cream is very hydrating. I sometimes apply to hands and feet as well and it works great.If you want to try, go for it. Can't hurt!"
1,"I use a little bit of this AFTER my shampoo and with my conditioner to help hydrate the ends of my long hair.  I don't find it too oily and the results are pretty!  Hair is shiny without being oily or heavy!Also, the butter smells and feels great applying it (added bonus).  Will definitely buy more once this runs out."
1,Good comb for natural hair
1,Its kinda cakey under my foundation and doesn't blend well... its water proof to a point. i am not a fan. i gave it to my mom. she likes it.
1,"The colorful containers lured me to buy one while I was at the store today. Got this one because the name sounded refreshing. I'm wearing it right now and I love how it's creamier and goes on easier than my thick, chunky, queen helene masque. Don't know why it's so much more expensive on amazon since all these 6oz masques were 3.99 at my nearby makeup store."
1,"Excellent value, excellent quality.Gentle scent.Even the packaging is great, as it opens easily, doesn't fall apart like flimsy corrugated cardboard, and even has a nice rope handle.A wonderful present for a budding yogi, or anyone who wants to spend more time relaxing or meditating."
1,"This is some good stuff. A lot of lotions on the market today are drying and oil-less  You can still feel this lotion on your skin 6 hours later. This is a blend of good oils such as hemp seed oil, shea butter, sweet almond oil, apricot kennel oil, soybean oil, safflower seed oil, sunflower seed oil, sesame seed oil, kukai seed oil, vitamin E and more."
1,"I am using this in combination with the Life-Flo Biestro-care cream and they make a nice combination. If all you need is progesterone, this works well for that too. It's a nice consistency and absorbs without feeling sticky afterwards."
1,Color is nice but not as dark as I thought it would be from the picture and is too golden for lower lids.  It does last a long time though.
1,"I bought this Olay serum on a whim because it was an Amazon lightening deal. I like it; however, since I am using it for preventative maintenance, I am not sure it really did anything. I think this product would work for someone, but for me, it was just too much moisture underneath my daily moisturizer!I would recommend this if you have dry skin; however, I have oily skin. I would not recommend this product for oily skin! :)"
1,"I enjoy this body wash. The smell is fresh and clean, and not overpowering like some Tea Tree products can be.It lathers up nicely, and did not irritate my sensitive skin. It also left my skin very soft and clean feeling, not dry."
1,I'd must admit that this product was on sale and it was free shipping else I'd wouldn't have boughtt it!!! I'd love that this product has strengthened my nappy hair and it seem to do what most products I'd tried cannot and will not do!!! A balacing conditioner with protein an ingredient I'd believe is missing in a lot of NAME BRAND products this day and time!!!
1,"Considering that these are discontinued, I was SUPER happy to find them on Amazon; and I bought two. When they arrived, there was multiple pealed off stickers on each product, with gross fuzz stuck to the leftover glue from the stickers. The casing itself is dirty as well. They still seem factory sealed, but it's just a little gross in my opinion. Good thing I'm stocked up on disinfectant."
1,"I'm ordering this for the 3rd time. I've used it for about a year and it really helps. I'm 56, a natural redhead, with deep wrinkles and age spots on my face. It has softend the depth of a lot of my wrinkles, and faded my darkest age spots.They're not gone completely, but definitely less noticeable. My skin tone is much more even. I use it morning and night. My skin is very sensitive and every other AHA lotion I've used has caused breakouts. I get none with this stuff. My skin is very dry however and after letting this absorb for 5-10 minutes, I use Cetaphil moisturizer... cream at night and the lighter Cetaphil lotion in the morning. Very happy with this product, which is 1/2 the price of drug store stuff and 1/4 the price of department store stuff with all it's fancy advertising."
1,Doesn't really style my hair while damp.  Gave it away to someone who could use it.  First one came damaged but Amazon was quick to replace.
0,"I loved the oil, but the soap had barely any scent, and felt as though it was going to fall apart in my hands. It was odd shaped and very fragile. Not buying this again."
1,"I love this cuticle cream! Instantly makes your cuticles soft. I was having a serious issue with my skin peeling around the cuticles and now my fingers are not so dry. The fragrance is lovely and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a decent cuticle cream that works. I ordered a few more directly from Amazon.com to leave in my desk and other parts of the house. The tin is relatively small but the amount will go a long way because you don't have to use a lot at a time. It is more of a balm (like chapstick texture) than creme but it works nevertheless!I did have issues with shipping and ended up having to purchase this from CVS. It's $5.99 there. I also saw that Wal-Mart has it as well. Definitely pick some up as soon as possible, you won't be sorry!"
1,smell good and light weighted leave in conditioner.
1,"BEST mascara I've ever used.  I recently had been following the advice of some beauty bloggers and tried a couple other brands only to be disappointed by their clumping, or inability to give me long, beautiful looking lashes (mostly clumping - yuck).So I came back to my old favorite and it's just as good as ever.  This mascara goes on really well-- no clumping even if you slide the wand through your lashes a few times (for complete, awesome coverage).  It makes my eyes look great, doesn't smudge for me.  I have a friend who says she gets raccoon eyes from this-- so she uses their waterproof version and loves it.  So if you touch your eyes a lot or have allergies/watery eyes, maybe go waterproof.  I don't prefer waterproof because I like that this comes off easy with soap and water without need for a special makeup remover."
0,"I saw the ad for this product and was intrigued. I bought it from a local high end spa so I assumed it would be worth the price. It is the worst beauty product I've ever purchased. It simply does nothing. It certainly doesn't thicken lashes and barely lengthens them.  As for the ""tubes"" concept...talk about marketing b.s.  It goes on exactly like mascara and is indestinguishable than the traditional kind.Don't waste your money."
1,"I bought this actually based on the Evolving Dish Nupur henna review to use with that henna, but I've been using this as a pre-shampoo treatment, and I really love it!  I have really long hair that is almost to my waist, so I don't use it that often since I need a lot of it.  When I do use it, though, it makes my hair really soft and moisturized.I also really loveDabur Vatika Enriched Coconut Hair Oil 300ml (Pack of 2 Bottles)as a pre-poo treatment that is also cheaper than this product.It's also Curly Girl-friendly for those who follow the no-silicone and no-sulfate hair routine.Great product!"
0,I read about this in Prevention magazine that it was great for post workout for sprucing up curly hair.  I did better with some Garnier stuff from Walmart.  Don't waste your money.
1,Great for refreshing your curls and nurturing your scalp. It doesn't have a strong smell and it actually calms your scalp.
1,"I thought this was going to be a kind of metallic yellow.  It's more of a dark sparkle yellow gold.  It's not a color that covers your nail completely it's more like a small sparkle, but it's just a dark yellow/gold.  It's pretty if that's what you're looking for, but I was looking for a yellow gold color."
1,"Works like it is supposed to, I find it helps my occasional acne, which is not surprising seeing as it is the OTC version of Retin A... which leads me to warn you about it causing the intial Breakout effect that some Retin A users get... also referred to as the &#34; worse before better&#34; effect. I use it 3-4 days a week at night, so not to cause irritated skin. I see some improvement in the texture of my skin, and the few fine lines near my eyes are less noticible, for sure... I do think the Neautragina version of this product smells better and works just as good.. I am fussy about what smells go on my face, because it is obviously going to be noticible to you! It just smells ... odd. So four stars."
1,"I don't normally write reviews, but I HIGHLY recommend this product.I have very dry, long, curly hair which gets knotted & tangled up quite a bit.I primarily use this product as a detangler after showering, and it's truly amazing, I can comb through my hair with relative ease!! It also has a pleasant, light aroma.Thank you for such a great product!"
0,"Heard great things about this product, but it is very drying (combination skin) and it has paraben.So I will not be using this. They should re-formulate and take out the paraben, it stuff has been banned in Europe."
1,"I was surprised to see so many negative reviews for this device.Granted, the misting option does not work very well and is useless. There is reduced suction when using the narrower side of the nozzle. For these reasons, I give the pore cleaner four stars, instead of five.When I use the pore cleaner I use it dry, right after I've either washed or steamed my face. I always use the wider side of the nozzle, and run the device in slow, gentle strokes across my face.To leave it in one place for too long could cause some of the problems (hickeys, etc.) that I've read about in previous reviews. In fact, the instructions that I received with the cleaner discourage leaving the nozzle in a specific area for a lengthy time.Another thing one has to remember is to rinse the device often. If you remove the nozzle, you will see a very small, fine screen not unlike what you see in faucet nozzles. Because the area is so small, any sebum or dead skin that is sucked in there can cause the suction to be reduced, clogging it.Anyway, enough of explaining how to use it.I have very delicate, sensitive skin with very small pores... but I can get oily and develop small blackheads in my ""T-zone."" So far, I have had this pore cleaner for a few years and it has worked wonderfully for me... better than the pore strips that leave red welts on my face for hours (I think I'm allergic to the adhesive).It is well-built and I have had no problems with it functioning so far."
1,"I've used this mascara for years and years.  Lashes are full, they are not stiff or clumpy.  To find the color brwn/blk is hard to find, but much more natural than stark black."
1,"Amazing sunscreen! I can't use any other after getting this. Even better testimonial is my husband will actually use this too, and he is one to HATE anything creamy. A very small amount of this goes a very long way. It works too, I burn so easy and for an average day (4 to 5 hours) of being in direct sun outside swimming, I have never needed to re-apply. Never had any sunburn, or even the feeling of being sunburned that most sunscreens leave me with. This really works. It has a nice clean smell too, so great for men or women. Non-greasy, it is a little more massaging to rub it in than most of the suncreens I've used in the past, but nothing to difficult at all. Just rub it in and enjoy your day. You will smell fresh and clean the whole time too. Great stuff!!"
1,I love this color. It has just the right amount of pink and orange mix. Great hot summer color. With a tan or darker completion it stands out even more. Gives off a bright cheerful glow. Friends and other ladies at the salon have asked the color and are now huge fans of it too. Being that it OPI it wears fabulously.
1,"If you have problems with extreme dry skin, please buy this product. A friend has chemo and the hands were really feeling awful and flaking and painful. Applying this balm solved the problem! It works:)"
1,"I love the clean look of the product labels, and I thought this stuff would be more ""natural"" than other brands.I really like the smell of lavender, and I use the essential oil sometimes, but...this stuff smells VERY strong.  I know it says aromatherapy, but this smells like a chemical, not like essential oil.Also, the ingredient list is pretty disappointing...  I don't see SLS, BUT there is Sodium Coco Sulfate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Fragrance, and a bunch of unpronounceables; not really what I was expecting from something that looks so environmentally friendly on the front.I won't buy this again, because the ""Fragrance"" is just too strong for me.Also, I've been using just the tiniest drop on dishes that I wash, and although it gets the job done, I think this probably functions about as well as regular dish soap.  So, I should probably just use a little more and come to terms with the fact that I was duped by a pretty package.(But, what should I buy next time?  Preferably something without SLS...)"
1,"Yes, this cream really does work--but don't expect instant results.  Keep using it for about two weeks to see what's happening.  It does make skin more elastic and youthful.  It's not a liquid face-lift (let's face it, nothing does that!), but it does dramatically improve one's appearance if used regularly.  I use it when I get up in the morning, just a light touch will do it.  It has a smooth, creamy, light and hydrating feel without being oily or sticky.  Lovely!"
1,Didn't see any improvement while using this product. Will try to find something else that will help tighten up facial skin.
1,"I have occasional adult acne ""bumps"" and usually have pretty dry skin otherwise. Using most acne medication dries my skin out, doesn't really 'kill' the pimples and basically makes my face flake. Yeah, not attractive.I decided to give this product a try, since I wanted to avoid salicylic acid.I remembered how soft and gorgeous my skin was after bathing in natural sulfur springs...The product comes in a small glass bottle with heavy pink sediment on the bottom and clear liquid above. You dip a q-tip into the sediment and apply pink stuff to your problem areas. It dries pretty quickly, within 5 min.The only drawbacks are the (1)sulfuric smell (very mild) and (2)powdery residue it leaves on the sheets at night. It is a night-time only product in my book, since it is pink, very visible and smells a bit.Other than that, this product works very well to dry out break-outs and make skin soft and it appears to be very gentle. I have had no flaking of the skin, redness, irritation or dryness.I'm so glad I found this. No more drying, burning salicylic acid for me."
1,I've been told about wide tooth combs to prevent breakage....and this comb does what it promises.  I hope it will aid me in my natural hair growth.
1,"I tried this mascara, and I would buy it again. I usually buy expensive mascara, just wanted to try something new.  It gives you long lashes, but I had to work on my lashes for a while. To get the effect I was looking for. If you don't mind putting on three coats, it works really well. One great thing about this mascara ;if you wear your makeup to bed they look great the next morning...good tip if your wanting to look ,hot for your man in the morning..."
1,I love Oil of Olay products.  I use it nightly and will continue to buy Olay products.  Been using Olay products for years
1,"A good, solid clean, especially for pregnant bellies where itchy skin is an issue.  Clean, non-irritating.  The scent doesn't bother me, even though it is strong, it's not a fakey perfumey smell.  I've been using it for quite a while."
1,"I have no words. These are truly a must have. I like to do a lot of the vintage pin up hair and these give you that look in literally minutes. They are super easy to use, they heat up in just 5 seconds, and they come with a large variety of sizes. The best I've ever used. No complaints what-so-ever."
1,I saw this color on Pinterest and just fell in love with it as an alternative to a true berry color for the summer. It looks great on all skin tones and really brightens up dull nails.  I am very pleased with my purchase!
1,A good bargain on this lipstick. The color is neutral and goes on creamy and smooth. I love the feeling of it on my lips. It doesn't smear or wear off. A great deal on pack of 2. Will buy them again!
1,If your looking to smell good without smelling like you put a bottle of perfume on this is it. Not heavy at all and the scent is perfect I love this more than my Lancome lol
1,I've only had this for a few days but I can already see the benefits. I was afraid to put it on my face but I did. I used it in the place or my normal moisturizer. When I woke up my face looked supple and not oily!! This stuff is great. Doesn't break me out at all and it makes your skin so soft. I put it in my hair too and it didn't leave a greasy film. I will definitely buy this again.
0,"I have sensitive skin and a history of melanoma so I require a high spf.  I chose this product because my old product was discontinued, Aveeno has typically been very gentle and this one offered a 30 spf, which I need.It smells like sunscreen.  It went on easily but after a few minutes, it feels like it's kind of caked on.  Like a layer on top of my skin.  After a few hours, my skin felt very dried out as if I hadn't put a moisturizer on at all.  Three days into using it, I got two huge under the skin pimples that left marks on my face for over week."
1,I was sad to see that my local Sallys store stopped selling these I am so happy I found them online for the same price and also free shipping these are a must have for nail art and doing eyeliner
0,"The scent is absolutely wonderful.  I have baby fine hair and it IS a little difficult to lather up into big suds like other shampoos, but it still cleaned well and made my hair nice and soft.  I also used the matching Avalon Lavender Conditioner with good success.Problem is... when I was diagnosed with Celiac disease, I made HUGE changes to my diet and lifestyle--more organic, nothing with wheat/gluten, less processed & more natural/raw.  This shampoo and conditioner was my treat for this total life make-over I had to do.  So the other day when I replaced my shampoo, I noticed a different label on the bottle.  I double-checked the ingredients and it now contains hydrolyzed wheat protein when it did not before.  So *NOT* that I expect to ingest my shampoo, but it is more worrying to me about getting ANY suds in my eyes, nose, or mouth.  It is a risk I am not willing to take.I sent a note via their website asking why they changed the ingredients adding wheat, and that I cannot use it now, and this is the response from Sarah,Consumer Relations Representative at The Hain Celestial Group:  ""In our efforts to make our products the best they can be, there have been reformulations to some of them. Our consumers help us determine which variations they prefer. We are sorry to hear that you can no longer use this product and we appreciate your feedback.""  Sooooooo, masses of people requested hydrolyzed wheat protein be added to their shampoo???  I'm a consumer and I prefer they NOT use wheat in their products.New label photos are included in case anyone else has this concern and prefers not to risk their health with this new ""variation""."
1,"My son is a finger sucker.  I wouldn't care so much if he'd keep it in the privacy of home...  but he's 6 now, he does it in school, the other kids tease him - so it's time to stop.We tried Thum.  Thum doesn't last long at all - and it doesn't even taste that bad.  Spicy, but with all the Thai food I ate when I was pregnant with my him, really, spicy probably doesn't phase him.Then someone on a parenting board I read mentioned this and we bought some.  Good God.  This stuff is FOUL.We were sitting downstairs playing video games and my son stuck his fingers in his mouth, then ran upstairs to get a drink of juice to get rid of the taste.I tried some on my own thumb, to see how bad it is.  It's bad.  And after washing dishes twice and washing my hands I don't know how many times, yuck, still bad!  And it's BAD, bitter, nasty, not just spicy.I've got high hopes for this.  We just started using it today but if any sort of flavored deterrant is going to do it, this stuff will.I'm almost afraid it's TOO nasty...  You don't realize how much you inadvertantly stick your fingers in your mouth till there's something like this on them.  I did it a couple times during dinner.  Yuck!  It's really, really nasty!!!Crossing my fingers - so far I'm impressed.1/25/10 - updating to say he totally kicked his habit in a very short time.  I would reccomend this to anyone with a finger/thumb sucking/buting habit.  Money very well spent!!!"
1,"I have high expectation for this product, because it's a bit pricey, so if you ask for higher price then give a higher quality. However, it neither makes my skin more bright nor brings more moisture. Actually I already put this product aside for a while. If you need a more moisturizing toner, don't buy this one."
1,"When I have the time, I usually like to use a dry clay mask that I mix with water or vinegar. If I'm pressed for time, I reach for Queen Helene Masque Mud Pack, and it really is good as a fast fix to get out the impurities caused by cosmetics, excess facial oils and the general crud that floats around in the air. If you don't currently use a clay mask, this is a great one to start with. You will instantly see a difference when you apply fresh make-up. Very good!"
1,"Sometimes it's hard to find this kind at the stores,  It was much lower priced, and it does give a pretty good coverage."
1,"I started using philosophy shower gels about a year ago when I discovered that they seem to be the only scented shower gels out there that don't make my super sensitive skin break out, even when I shave with them.  Amazing Grace is my favorite scent.  It's just so clean and soothing, with hints of baby powder and floral notes.  Unlike a lot of the other philosophy scents, Amazing Grace is not overly sweet and it doesn't leave you smelling like a baked good.  It's a nice clean scent that lasts all day.  The gel has a good, long lasting lather, and doesn't leave any kind of residue.  It has quickly become one of my favorite beauty items, both for myself and to give as a gift."
1,"This is a decent astringent. The only problem I have with it is that it has a strong odor. I have used other astringents and they don't smell the way this one does. Other than that, it's pretty good - gets the job done."
1,I've been using this lip balm since high school and love the feeling of this product~ It's with SPF and not oily on my lip.
1,"I am so impressed with this product!  I've been searching for that perfect brown and I've finally found it!  There is no chemical smell and the color went on so easily.  Before, I had been using L'Oreal Healthy Look and it was always a struggle to get the color through my hair.  It would always make my hair clump or stick together, making it nearly impossible to comb through.  Natural Instincts goes on damp hair and perhaps that's what makes it so much easier.  I found the actual hair color to be more of a gel, which was a nice consistency -- not too think but not runny.  I was able to put the color on, part my hair into different sections, and continue to color.  The instructions say to leave the color on for 10 minutes and up to 20 minutes for stubborn grays.  I only left it on for 10 minutes because I was afraid of ending up with black hair.  But I probably should have left it on longer because I found a few grays left behind.  Even though the grays were not completely tinted, it adds a nice dimension to my hair, almost like highlights.  One complaint my boyfriend has about hair dye is that it leaves my hair looking all one color instead of showing the different highlights.  I found that Natural Instincts allows for that dimension.  I'm sure if I left it on longer, it would have dyed the grays darker, but I like the different colors.After conditioning my hair with the included aloe vera conditioner (which was very pleasant), it left my hair extremely soft and shiny.  Even co-workers noticed how shiny my hair looked the day after coloring.  Another thing that I noticed was that after drying my hair the first time, very little dye was left behind on my white towel.  That is always a good sign of a high quality dye.  I have found my new hair color and I'm so excited!  I highly recommend this product.  And if you don't like it, it will wash out after 28 shampoos.  I would just be careful with not leaving it on too long the first time, especially if you're concerned with it turning out too dark.  It is not black, but I can imagine that it would look black on those who leave it on over the recommended length of time.  I would just start with 10 minutes the first time to gauge the level of darkness for your particular type hair.  Enjoy!"
1,"I FINALLY found an affordable toner that works to balance my skin without over-drying or over-moisturizing it. I have used ""gentle/non-drying"" toners before while trying to avoid the alcohol ingredient that is so common to freshening astringents only to find that instead, the toners would leave behind an emollient or sticky residue that I ended up having to wash off. This product falls into that fortunate ""in between"" group. It is perfect for me at this time of year when my oily skin needs just a little bit of help keeping the dry skin away yet it doesn't clog my pores or exacerbate oil production. Fortunately I have no problem tolerating the witch hazel (I don't notice it at all, really.) The size and price of the bottle make it very easy to afford. A whole bottle should last me 6 months at least. It is highly fragranced with a rose scent; but that's no surprise as it states this openly on the label. If you can't tolerate highly fragranced skincare products you might consider Thayer's Unscented toner."
1,"silky moisturizing lipstick that comes in many colors. The sheer needs frequent application, so that I go without lipstick all day since I don't have time to reapply."
1,"I really like this serum.  It leaves my face feeling soft, it hydrates my dry skin, and it has no scent.  The problem is the ridiculous pump leaves the last bit of serum lingering helplessly at the bottom of the bottle when it should be making my face fantastic.  What's up with that?"
0,"I dont get what kindve hair this works for. Im half latina, I look caucasion, people say my hair is black, but seeing family I dont consider my hair black, I have thick straight hair, and a lot of it. I used very little hair to see if I could curl it, I heated it up to a high setting, I kept it in my hair for 15 secs, it was very hot, as I had touched it to my head by accident, practically nothing happened except for the very end was curled. Seeing I was new to curlingn irons I looked up youtube vids to see what I was doing wrong, I tried 2 techniques, rolling the hair around the shaft, then clamping, and clamping the end and rolling up, still nothing, Im keeping with my straightner to curl, its ceramic, curls last long, and it actually works... reason I looked for something else is that my particular flat iron has a gap that rips my hair out. IDK why people like this, except that it seems like a sturdy machine, it is a bit heavy."
1,"There's no way of sharpening this!  And though it is packaged and encased well, it's not a product I would buy again.  I will just stick with what works: the brow pencil."
1,"I have large curls/wavy hair, very fine but a lot of it. After reading a few reviews and seeing the price wasn't too crazy I thought I would try it out. It is definitely a good product - adds shine to my hair, more &#34;life&#34;, and even my hair dresser noticed less split ends. I would not say this is a miracle product as some of the reviews seem to indicate, but I would recommend trying it out as it does have good benefits. The keratin is the real secret, it prevents damage/split ends to hair - so any spray that has keratin in it should be beneficial to your hair."
1,"I use three types of moisturizer at any given time, try a new shampoo every two weeks, and currently own at least 6 types of facial sunscreens. When it comes to cosmetics and skin care products, I love trying new things and very very rarely am content to use any product exclusively and consistently.This is the only toner I use. It is the only one I've used in at least half a year, and I do not have any plans to try any other toners.I use it twice a day: in the morning underneath my moisturizer and at night, after I cleanse my face. My skin is slightly on the dry end and gets dryer with certain, unfavorable ingredients.This toner leaves my skin feeling moisturized, refreshed, and sated. It's a weird feeling. I use oil-based moisturizers (i.e. with argan oil, sea buckthorn oil, calendula oil) so I was a little shocked that something so liquid could moisturize so well (Aloe Vera leaves me feeling dried out after 5 minutes). I also believe this has reduced the size of my pores slightly.I was inspired to purchase the Thayers witch hazel in peach after finishing half my existing rose bottle, but unfortunately the alcohol in it (rose is alcohol free) did not react so well with my face. I usually do not fragrances in skin care products, but I love the rose-y scent of this one."
1,"i have sensitive, very combo acne prone skin and this does wonders for me. i use it every night after cleansing and toning. this has seriously changed my skin (at least while i continue to use it). this is HG for me. it stings sometimes when i use it, don't let that deter you. you are going to love this! pleeease give it a try."
1,this product has been really suitable for my skin type. it helps me look brighter when used it for one week staright
1,Wonderful face wash. We have used it for years.  The tea tree oil makes it both refreshing and extremely effective.
0,"I would honestly love this if it weren't for the fragrance. It seems to work great, but I just can't get past the smell. The fragrance is way to strong for something that's going on my face. I wound up going back to my old standby, Neutrogena, because the texture is very similar and it doesn't have an offensive fragrance."
1,This is a perfect nude for my fair skin tone! Make sure to use thin coats otherwise it will end up looking terrible.
1,"I must always have this serum, you dont use a lot, and I wear mine under a moisturizer, under makeup, it really gives my skin a youthful appearance."
1,"This is amazing, and a true nail saver. The secret is that you cannot use it too much.See, this item uses formaldehyde much like Brazilian straightening systems for hair. By painting this on it changes the cross links in protein causing the nails to become stronger. However, formaldehyde is both dangerous, and applications of too much causes brittleness.Follow directions closely, only apply to nails, and wash wash wash when you're done."
1,"I needed a source of additional fiber and was very upset as every brand of fiber seems to have a great need to add sugar in some form.Really glad I found this product, in Walmart, of all places.You need to shake it vigorously, not stir; I use a small Tupperware container with a lid for it.Obviously, it works. Sometimes it works too well /cough-cough/, so be careful with the dose.Seems pricey, but you get a good bang for your $."
1,"It is so great! Cleans well, the smell is magical. We use it as a kitchen hand-soap and I find myself washing my hand one extra time just to experience this soap."
1,This body wash is very relaxing in the shower after a long day. I have been sleeping a lot more sound as well
1,"Although the medicinal smell is strong at first, it wears away quickly.  I live using this on my hands on on dry spots like elbows/heels.  It is great on your cuticles as well.  Yu be has a cult following and now I know why!  I agree that it is a little expensive, but keep in mind that it is very concentrated and you don't need very much.  This is a wonderful cream and I would like to try the body lotion version that they sell as well."
1,"It is particularly good for blow drying. I didn't really understand the use of expensive boar brushes, or expensive brushes at all, but after seeing the $22-40 one that is sold with the wen system I decided to look for the cheaper similar version and this is it.  It is great, I don't know what it is about it, but you can tell the difference in the hair the first time you use it."
1,"I guess that is why the buyer &#34;extreme closeouts&#34; can offer the price for so low...I will have to look to buy this somewhere else, not sure how I feel about a product that has an expiration date.."
1,"So this product review will not be as in-depth as many of my others but that is because there is not a lot of in-depth info to post. I have always been a huge fan of Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle moisturizer (the one with Retin-A) and figured that coupled with the glowing reviews, this might be the way to go for cleansing. In short, I love it. It does a great job (T-Zone, combination skin, daily moisturizing, daily sunscreen use, rarely wear make-up, mid-thirties with minimal wrinkles). I have not broken out at all since I purchased this (except for recently when I tried a new face mask). It does not have a strong smell or any cons EXCEPT possibly one. When you squeeze it from the tube, it kind of &#34;balls up,&#34; and can roll right off of your hand. Once you realize it, you can be more careful. It rolled off my hand a few times into the shower, so from then on, I knew that would happen so took steps (cupped hand, etc.) Try this if you like Neutrogena or are just looking for an excellent skin cleanser. If you have any questions, just ask."
0,"Plus I've burned myself several times.  I didn't read thoroughly enough and thought I was buying a blow-dry type tool.  I should have returned it, but I needed something and don't see anything I like this barrel size.  I'd like to see a brush bristle tool (boars hair) with the plastic &#34;teeth' interspersed to add strength and hair-holding power in a blow-dryer wand type tool this size.  Would anyone else?"
1,This is a great non-irritating toner. I like using it after I wash my face to balance out the pH of my skin. No more alcohol based toner for me. Witch hazel is much better. This stuff also is paraban free. Definitely good for your skin.
1,I love this cream . ive been using it for years tried a few different creams but always come back to this one
0,"While unwrapping this mirror, it fell onto the floor from a height of about 1.5 feet, and smashed into a dozen pieces.  :-(I've owned a similar mirror from Goody that I've had for many years, and that one has never broken, despite falling numerous times.Not recommended."
1,"Love these Witch Hazel pads.  I use them at morning and night.  Work great, high quality, and great price.  Thanks!!!"
1,I like that this creme is thick and has natural ingredients.  I don't like that it doesn't absorb very well into my skin.  I also haven't noticed any change in my skin since I bought it (3 weeks ago).  Maybe it needs more time to work?
1,No wonder this is Hugo Boss's #1 seller.. so many notes in the fragrance makes it very unique. Quite a bit of citrus with a side of woods. Would definitely recommend to others.
1,i have been using this stuff for years. burt's bees rock... they offer a lot of good for you items..
1,This is the first time I have used this Neutrogena Foaming Cleanser.  In the past I have used Shiseido facial cleaning products which are a lot more expensive.  So far I have liked Neutrogena's light fragrance and it does do a great job removing all make up.  I do remove my eye make up using the Neutrogena towelettes before I use the foaming cleanser.
1,"Growing up in England, I always had a Denman or Mason Pearson brush. After moving to America and finally wearing out or losing all of my brushes, I went to Walgreens to find another. I think I've tried just about every brand of brush; Conair, Revlon, Vidal Sasson, Goodie, Kent.... the list goes on. At one point I did find one nice Revlon brush, but I lost it and by that time it was discontinued. I went through a hairbrush every two months, it seemed. The nubs on the top of the bristles would catch on a tangle in my hair and sometimes rip my hair out. I would get disgusted because lint would get caught around the bristles and the nub on the top of the bristle wouldn't allow the lint to be cleaned off. The actual bristle holes would get dirty, and cleaning them was a chore which involved my nail brush and a toothpick. Not to mention, all of these brushes felt cheap and poorly designed. I bought a boar bristle brush from Conair (which I am still very pleased with), but the bristles weren't enough to get the job done, especially when my hair was wet. Finally, after much aggravation, I asked my mother about the hairbrushes I remembered from England, and then began my search on Amazon. I found this product. I bought two. They are exactly how my mother and I remember them. The bristles aren't too sharp and feel divine against the scalp. Any lint or stray hairs are easily removed from the bristles (no annoying nub on the top!). If the holes get dirty, the rubber cushion can be removed from the handle, the bristles pulled out, and everything can be given a good washing. Re-assembly is very easy and straightforward. Even so, I don't find myself having to clean this brush very often. When we first received the brushes, it was a little annoying because the rubber kept sliding out due to the smooth, sealed surface of the rubber. We pulled the rubber out, and cleaned the plastic holder and rubber cushion with some soap and water. It stays in fine now, it just needs to have a little rubber grippy-ness. I wish these brushes were available everywhere. I wish I could give one to everyone. Please, save yourself the money and the time and get yourself a nice Denman brush. If you have the extra money, opt for a Mason Pearson."
1,My wife and I have used the Q-tips swabs for many years. There has never been any problem with the way that they work. They do not come apart or unravel under normal usage and this includes using this item as a small paint brush or a cleaning tool for small objects. The Q-tips swab has always worked just fine as they should.
1,"We have one of these in both bathrooms, and love them. They are as advertised. I highly recommend this product."
1,"Well, peel-off masks are just fun to use. This one is very nice--smells good and leaves the skin feeling very smooth and fresh. Freeman products are priced economically but are of very good quality."
0,"I wish I had been able to try this out or at least smell it before I bought it.  I knew it was going to smell herbal based on the ingredients, but I barely got the lid off the container before it brought tears to my eyes.  I returned this to the store.  Normally I like Burt's Bees but this is just too pungent!"
1,"So basically I needed a new facial wash since my old one was discontinued. (Sad day indeed)I have oily combo skin and get a break out about once a month and this soap really does the trick of keeping my skin acne free and feeling fresh. What I like about this product is that it really cleans, I mean like, you can feel all the dirt and oil being washed away.The smell isn't so bad. I actually kinda like it. It's a tad watery but when you rub the soap in your hands you get good bubbles.Just the one thing I don't like is that it dries out your hands. You definitely need to constantly moisturize. It's the summer and my hands are dry so that means winter's is probably going to be rough. My face hasn't been too dry, but I always use a spf/moisturizer so maybe that's the case.I really do love this soap though, and would recommend it (with maybe a little moisturizer infused if possible!!)"
1,"This is a great salon quality curling iron. I love the curls or waves you can make. If you have never used a Marcel Curling iron it is highly recommended, you can learn how by watching you-tube videos. The barrel I purchased was 1 1/2 in. and it is perfect for big bouncy curls. The iron itself heats up quickly and you can adjust the temperature."
1,"I've been using the night cream from this line for a few months and quite like it -- so I decided to buy the corresponding day SPF 15 cream.Overall, it's a nice product. Moisturizes well, and have good enough SPF. I like the fact that it has retinol and comes in a tin tube (so sun can't decay the retinol). I haven't noticed any improvements in my fine lines or wrinkles, but I'm using it more as a preventative measure (I'm 34 currently).However, I have noticed that the texture of the product is a bit chalky and less nice and soothing as the night version. I attribute this to the SPF, so that's fine. I like this product enough to continue buying it."
1,"I ordered this because I needed a face moisturizer for nighttime wear.  I have had great success with Ester C creams - I am not old enough to have any severe wrinkles but it seems to be stopping what little creasing I had starting in its tracks.This cream is heavy and smells good.  I mixed some argan oil into it for an extra boost.  So far, my face feels very good after using this and I'm glad it comes in a very generous container for the price.  I would definitely recommend trying it, especially if you've been using stuff from a drugstore or supermarket - it's definitely nicer."
1,"I had originally been sent a sample of this serum through the mail. I used it one night without thinking it would do much-- I was wrong. I am 23 and I am starting to notice my skin look a little dry, not quite as tight, and just not what it used to. This made my skin feel so soft and smooth and tight in the morning. I will definitely continue to use this--hopefully this will prevent my aging as I go into my late 20s and 30s. I'm not sure how this works for older ladies-- hopefully you can read the other reviews for that. This is pretty reasonably priced and it lasts a good time for me."
1,"This is one of my favorite perfumes.  It is very feminine without be sweet or very strong. It is a floral scent. This is my third bottle, and these little bottles last for months, even using it daily.  The Auric Blends brand is made from high quality oils, and don't change their scent as you wear them or fade. Even though perfume is a very personal item, and you can't tell what a scent is like without smelling it, I would recommend the Auric Blends line as well as Night Queen in particular. It is high quality perfume oil at a price you can experiment with until you find what you like."
0,"I have been using derma blend since 2003. I bought the setting powder but it never works. When I apply my concealer, I dab on a generous amount of setting powder and leave it on for 5-10 minutes before I dust it off but the concelaer still remains moist/wet and rubs off if I touch it or brush up against clothing etc. Perhaps I got a bad batch but it makes absolutely no difference to me."
1,"I have very sensitive, combination skin that is also prone to breakouts. I purchased this moisturizer a few weeks ago and so far I am satisfied. Complex 15 provides even coverage, doesn't cause breakouts, and doesn't have a strong odor. It isn't completely effective in combating my dry, winter skin, but I expect it to be a great moisturizer for the warmer months."
1,I bought this product thinking it would help with acne scarring but I couldn't get pass the smelll. The smelll is vanilla mixed with Neem oil which is a strong scent the vanilla does not really cover the scent of the Neem oil.
1,"My fiance insisted I buy this for his niece as he can not stand the sight of her chewing on her fingers all the time.  She will be going to school soon and we hoped this would stop a bad and nasty habit.  I applied the product several times and she said it did indeed taste horrible.  However, after a few times, she began to bite her nails anyway.  She said it tasted bad but, would often just keep doing it with a disgusted look on her face.  I do believe this product would work for any child that isn't so insanely stubborn.  I think she just needs an attitude adjustment but, she isn't my child lol."
1,"Pleasant smell, non-irritating, non-drying does it what it claims! I was depressed over how my skin was looking & tried Proactiv but that stuff made my condition worse, with this & the Neutrogena, Anti-Wrinkle, Anti-Blemish cream, I noticed a noticable difference the next day even my mom said that my skin was pretty! Don't expect a big lather with this in fact, it's actually a good thing it doesn't lather too much (it's just right) because that can be drying to your skin just as they say you don't want an uber soapy shampoo that lathers too much because that can strip the oils from your hair drying it out. I LOVE THIS STUFF, & being on a fixed income I needed something I can afford that actually delivered on it's promises!"
1,I really like this shampoo and brand. The lavendar scent is really nice but it can be drying if used too often so I use it every other day. The matching conditioner is also a great smell and moisturizing. This is a great price compared to my local store.
1,"Helen of Troy 1"" curling brush purchased through Amazon.This was what I have been looking for and was so excited to finally get one!  One problem is that it takes a while to heat up and then it doesn't get very hot.  Strangely, the very first use was excellent.... Hot enough to make curls fairly quickly.  Each time since then, it doesn't get hot enough.  I am going to keep working with it though.  Hopefully it is user error!  I am used to a hot air brush that gets hot quickly.  Maybe I am not giving it enough time.  If this is the problem, I will update my review.Update 2/13/13This brush curling iron works awesome if given the proper amount of time to heat up.  It was as I thought, I wasn't giving it enough time.  However, it does need a lot of time compared to others I have used.  I have just gotten used to turning it on much earlier in my routine.  Not big deal.  Once it has enough time to properly heat up, it gives beautiful soft curls.  Love it!"
1,"I have had a really  hard time finding an acne cleaning body wash that I like. They either smell terrible or leave my skin feeling filmy. For me this is the second best smelling one out there. It could, however, do without the silly little pink beads in the soap.I prefer Neutrogena's Stress Control Body Wash for scent but I have a hard time finding it. It seems to be gentler as well. This, however, is really the only substitution if you can't find the Stress one."
1,"I am VERY fair-skinned, and this matches my skin tone perfectly.  It sits well on top of my liquid foundation and doesn't give me the crazy face-one-color-neck-another phenomenon that some other products have.  It's not a heavy foundation, but it provides seamless coverage.  I also appreciate the SPF 15 built right into it!"
1,"I am in love with this perfume, it smells so sweet and so sweet, the bottle is pink and cute!! I get many compliments on this perfume!!"
1,This is very gentle and makes it easy to remove eye make up.  it's also not oily so it doesn't leave any kind of residue in your eyes.
1,This stuff works great. it is well worth the money. I works better than proactive has worked for me and cheaper
1,"Thayer Witch Hazel AF Toner w/Aloe Vera Vitamin E, Rose Pental 12 oz is one of the famous product if Thayer, I just got it and waiting for effects"
1,I love this scrub.  I think it is some of the best I've ever used. It is gentle to you skin and not a wasteful product as so many are.  A small dab  and water will do.
1,"I am a very loyal costumer of olay.  I buy all their products and I have had great results.  I have combination skin which is somewhat sensitive and so I can't use alot of products out there and not many of the products out there work for me.  Olay is reliable, gentle, effective and alittle goes a long way.  I will definitely continue using olay regenerist and I would recommend this to anyone in need of a fragrance free moisturize for sensitive combination skin.Update:it also works to reduce aging signs at the back of my hand.  It softens my hands and reduces age lines."
1,"My daughter is 5, I haven't cut her nails for almost A YEAR since she chewed ALL of her fingernails  - and toe nails (yuck!) off.So I finally stumbled across this on Amazon. I red the reviews and thought it was worth a try.And it worked - I have been cutting nails for two months now!!! The first time we put it on and she didn't think about it and tried to chew on her nails she was horrified!!! She gagged and kept whining for hours that she couldn't get the yucky taste out of her mouth. (She tried everything - candy, brushing teeth). I felt horrible, I thought I had scared her for life. However, two days later she proudly announced that she hadn't chewed on her nails in a full day. And now two months later we are still putting it on, just in case. She actually comes herself and reminds me to put it on her fingernails and toe nails. And sometimes she asks me if she can do it herself, and that is totally fine with me. :) She was so bad about biting her nails and I thought it would be impossible to get her to stop it, but with this it took about 2 days...... Thank you Mavala!!!!"
1,"This item is so superior from my 7 year old curling brush and a great value for $17.99, and superior quality as well.Brush heats up in seconds; plenty of different setting to choose from based on the type of hair you have and the biggest bonus an automatic shut off -- saves me from obsessing over potential of house fire while at work.Highly recommend"
1,these lotion contains AHA. So it works great to slough off dead skin cells and help prevent ingrown hairs. It feels silky smooth too. It doesnt have all of the nasty petroleum ingredients like so many other lotions. the smell is also nice
1,I just received it yesterday and have used it twice already (night and morning). So far i am liking what i see the acne on my face reduced in size significantly overnight which i am really impressed with. The consistency of this cream is more like toothpatse (the paste type not gel). The color is more of a tan/beige color and although i am dark skinned i still like it. It is formulated with Zinc oxide and also does contain parabens. Goes well under makeup and is also non greasy.
1,"Gels are great when used with sponges and washcloths. You can easily get the gel into all the nooks and crannies of your scrubbie or sponge and then ensure it lathers well so you get both the cleaning power and the gentle exfoliation. In general this is much easier to do with a gel than with a hard soap.I'm very pleased with the Suave Naturals gel. It is almost like a jello-consistency which means when you turn the container upside down it ALL comes out! One of my key gripes with many soaps and gels that come in containers is you always waste the remnants of it. There is always residue inside which you can't get out and have to throw away (or try to get water into the container to rinse it out that way). With the Suave, there's no issue at all. Turn the container upside down, it all comes out VERY easily and you use every little last drop of it. Brilliant.I really enjoy the aroma of this as well. It is fragrant but not overpowering or sickly. I enjoy the blend of the sweet pea plus the hint of violet. I'm sure there are different people who would like more of X or more of Y, but that always comes down to personal preferences. For me the balance is just right.Highly recommended!"
1,"The beads make you feel super clean and the scent is really addicting. Depending on your climate, it can dry out your skin."
0,"I recently bought some more Q-tips.  I use them every day.  You known when you're all dry from the shower but your ears are still wet?  Well, these are the only things that will do the job.  So, as I said, I recently bought some more.  And may I say that I hate the generic versions of Q-tips: the CVS brand or Target version of Q-tips are weak.  They bend when you apply any pressure to them.  I like Q-tips because they are much stiffer and hold up perfectly when used.~Q-Tips, you have let me down.~My recent purchase has led me to discover that Q-tips have changed their formula: The shafts are now much weaker than before and are identical to those knock-off brands I mentioned earlier.  This is a travesty.  It's obvious that they are trying to save money by using less paper in the design of these things, but it's terrible.  They don't hold up like they used to and it's driving me nuts.  I now HATE Q-tips and will be buying the cheaper knock-off brands since they are now equal in quality.~Q-Tips, shame on you."
0,Part of the black handle was chipped off. I wanted to give this as a gift but couldn't because of it.
1,my fav.  love it its so beautiful and dark but not too dark where it looks goth.  i've been trying to find it in stores but i never could and if i did it was ridiculously expensive
1,"I like this scent because it is very clean-smelling and feminine, in my opinion.  However, the bottle's design makes it a bit of a challenge to grip and spray.  Maybe it's just me, but I think the neck on the bottle is just too long.  The eau de toilette, however, is wonderful.  Get the whole set if you can find it reasonably priced. It includes shower gel and body lotion with the scent spray."
0,This product is no joke!  If not careful it will burn your skin and leavemore of a pigment mark to you skin.  I will never try it again.  This productshould be in the hands of a perfessional medical person.Thank youLucy AB
1,"These are exactly as stated and work just fine, but I wish I had bought a size, or even two, smaller.  Granted I am new to this system, but I find the curls are looser than normal setting rollers (or even electric rollers or curling irons).  I like the curls; they are soft and long lasting, but I recommend you buy the set, experiment with the differnt sizes, THEN decide if you need more curlers and if so which size."
1,"This stuff is really good. I actually purchased it based on a review I read on Amazon and must say the review was right on point. What I like most about it is the way it peels off of the face, pretty much in one piece and sometimes you can see the particles it's lifting from your skin. Very pleased and plan to order more. I've been looking for a great peel off mask for a long time and this definitely get's the job done for me."
1,"The benefits of Apricot Kernel Oil for your skin are many. Look it up on Bing.com  Non greasy, absorbs and for the size an excellent price.  I add it to body lotion and shake it up. After a shower it works. A little goes a long way."
1,I like it when I combine it with Lierac Coherence Firming Day Cream. This is too thin to use alone unless on sweaty summer days  but for right now it needs to combined. When putting this on after you wash your face I feel some tingles. It seems to work. I've been using this for a month along with the Lierac and I got a dewy complexion!
1,I've owned this for years now and its still going strong without shedding. Its durable and great for applying liquid or powder undereye. I would use this on small acne blemishes because of its size. But its perfect to hide dark circles and bags. At this price you're getting a bargain.
1,"If you do ANYTHING in your crease, you need this brush. It blends beautifully, and gives a completely natural, blended finish. It's also good for buffing out anything. It's soft, yet stiff enough to get the job done.I'm a total fan!"
1,"nice light smell and feel.  Using it to make various lotions, and body scrubs.  Works well with the scents I have used so far."
1,"I use this over ROC max system, I am seeing results with ROC and will continue to use, very inexpensive"
0,"Unfortunately, it didn't alleviate underarm odor. It seems as though these products only work for some, and I'm one of those who just can't find an effective natural deodorant."
1,"The product name ""Stress Relief Body Wash"" says it all. This wonderful product, put out by Aveeno, does the job. Made with wonderful ingredients, like lavender, chamomile and ylang-ylang, you feel the stress of the day melt off of your body. Its special soap free formula gets the job done, in addition to the wonderful addition of oatmeal, as a base. It smells heavenly, without being tacky or overly perfumed. Please use this if you need a lift, or, simply a release from day-to-day pressure. This is good as a companion item to any shower in America......"
1,I like this all over the lids with a soft brown at the outer corners and crease. Goes on soft and smooth with a brush. Good color for fair skin.
1,"a really good one,gives a bold black long lashes,that lasts all day long!!"
0,"Again, if your skin is too sensitive or you suffer from eczema, like I do on my face, you have to be careful because this product may not work for you. It didn't work for me. My symptoms got worst."
1,HA!  That was the OLD me!  The &#34;me&#34; today LOVES OPI nail polish and OPI is the ONLY reason I wear polish.  If you knew my age you would know why I am amazed I am wearing it when I never have.  Fantastic polish!!  This is the color I wear a lot.  And that ALSO surprises me!  AND my family!! *smile*
1,A few girls on YouTube use this product so I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. My lashes stay in place without having to touch it up.
1,"I've been using the 10 Dark Cool Blonde, but I think an updated version from the store. This color works well for me, since my hair is medium brown, highlighted to a dark blonde.  I do have gray roots, I'd say about 50%.  This *blends* the gray. I left it on for 20 to 25 minutes, otherwise the gray coverage would have been poor. I think this will probably last me 3 to 4 weeks, but I wash my hair daily.  Nothing obnoxious about this and it left my hair shiny with blended roots.I don't like the color refresher packet - I throw it out. I tried it once in a different color and it was a horrible brown/orange shade.If you need full and lasting gray coverage, you would be better off with a permanent color.I also use Ion Color Brilliance from Sally Beauty which is a good product, but when I don't have time to get there, I will use the Clairol NI."
1,"I started using this shampoo on my hair journey two months ago and I have noticed a decrease in the amount of breakage I've been having.  It also smells good and is very rich so you do not need to use much, lathering once is enough.  Definitely buy this if you desire an effective shampoo."
1,"My hair was looking like a bird's nest cause I had just dyed it.  I tried this shampoo in conjunction with the conditioner and the mask and WOW!!!!  Shiny soft hair again, almost like before I dyed it - virgin hair!!  I'm not exagerating, it lathers well, it smells great and I'm glad I got it for a better price.  As soon as I run out, I'm re-ordering again!!  Hopefully continued use will keep my hair looking and growing healthy."
1,"I love the L'oreal Feria color line and this is proof why I do. Every color I have used by them has been wonderful! I had Honey Brown hair and wanted a change. I didn't want a black with a blue base tone or a violet base tone, I just wanted black. My hair now is very black, shiny, healthy looking, and vibrant. It is kind of messy with the application (but what hair color process isn't?) I knew what to expect though since I use Feria quite often but someone who is trying it out for the first time might be surprised. My only advice is, use a towel. Fabulous product and the results are what I wanted."
1,"To begin let me tell your that I am 29 years old, but I never took care of my skin when I was younger; I was involved in sports and never used sunscreen or any moisturizer and let me tell you that all that was reflected on my face.  My skin is difficult (I have mild wrinkles, my skin is losing up and some parts of my face are oily while others are dried).  Before I tried this serum nothing worked very well on my face.  I tried every product that you can imagine(even derma e that has great reviews) without seeing results.  Now I am so excited to see what this serum is doing to my face.  This serum sure does ALL what it promises:regenerates skin,makes it glow of youth, not greasy, and mildly restores elasticity.  I saw results on my first application.  Oh, and the microdermabrasion and peel kit system is exellent too. I highly recommend this product!"
1,Great oil. There is no smell at all and I use it daily on my face (wet skin before applying to help it soak in) and also as a makeup remover.
1,"I have nothing bad to say about this product. It leaves your skin soft, healthy, moisturized,not greasy and with a very light scent of sunblock.I've been out in the sun a lot since I bought this product and I have yet to get a sunburn on my face even when the rest of my body gets sunburnt(have yet to find a good body moisturizer with SPF).And to make it even better, a little of this product goes a longggg way. The thin consistancy of the product makes it so I need just one small squirt to cover my face and neck, making the bottle last a long time which saves money :)My search for a facial moisturizer with SPF has come to an end with this product :) I love it :)"
1,I bought this to replace this $20 Vidal Sassoon gold plated one and this one is SOOO much better. My curls fell out very soon after I used the vidal sassoon one even if I used hair products.  I have thick Asian hair so that might have been another reason why my curls never stay.  But with this curling iron I can sleep on my curls and my hair still stays relatively curly the next morning.  The 1 1/4 creates beautiful curls too.
1,It is a pretty color not metalic like it seems in pics its spreads well could be done in 1 coat but 2 coats makes it evenstamps ok
1,"I always come back to this cleanser, and even if I use other things, I usually start with this to remove my sunblock and /or makeup. It is mild and not irritating, lasts a loooong time, and works great with my clarisonic."
1,"I am african american/american indian/white. I purchased this because of the reviews after suffering a medical condition, I lost a lot of hair; it broke off from the root and broke off in small pieces. My doctor said I &#34;broke the hair growth cycle.&#34; I lost about 4 inches of hair on one side of my hair, which is normally mid-back length.  It took about 3 washes (once/week) for my hair to stop breaking and shedding.  After 5 weeks, my hair is back on track again.  I am growing it out natural now, and keeping the permed hair, and trim it myself.  My goalnow is lower back length...I also use Moroccanoil products right after this shampoo because it can make my hair feel dry and stripped, but the Moroccanoil products puts all the moisture and life back into it right away.  I have made this part of my hair care regimen."
1,"Product has changed in the last year, I now fine it too thick and very difficult to apply to lashes"
1,Is there anything better at this price... NO...This is a staple for most makeup artists and pro's... Goes on great. stays on for hours without flaking....Can't beat the price
0,"I picked up 183 Pine Tar Soaps (4.25 Ounces) at a going out of business sale.  I thought I was getting a good deal.Turns out the Soap smells horrendous and caused me to gag and itch all over when I used it on my [blank].  I had to toss all of them out.If you are prone to skin allergies or aroma allergies, don't get this one."
1,"I'm a sucker for anything rose-scented, especially body products. I eyed this Rose Milk Skin Care Loton for a very, very long time before I finally thought ""what are you waiting for?"" and ordered it. I must mention that have no nostalgia tied to the product, no memories of my mother or grandmother smelling of its elegance-by-association with as they kissed me goodnight.So, with no pre-set expectations, I opened it immediately (even as other family members were clamoring for their part of the order) and breathed it in: a powdery, true rose scent, almost old-fashioned somehow. Just the way I like it. I let out two sighs, one of relief, and one of delight.I've first I applied it a few times to my hands and arms, and later my body's shoulders, d&eacute;colletage, legs, and feet.My reactions:1) This is far more moisturizing than I expected! Many perfumed lotions will wind up only drying you out (Bath & Body Works, for example, has never satisfied my skin. And I only use one kind: Pink Peony, because it includes notes of rose.)a) The alcohol content of Rose Milk is not specified, but it does come towards the middle of the ingredients list, meaning the prime ingredients are: water, mineral oil, and glycerin, before the various types of alcohol start popping up.)(Comparatively, my B&BW; list reads water, glycerin, petrolatum, and then cetyl alcohol launched the longer list of ingredients.)b)  Maybe that mineral oil is giving it some staying power? All I know is, my skin feels so good, and I won't be reaching for the bottle again and again. That's a relief.2) The rose scent is light indeed. I'm not slipping into a silky peignoir made of rose petals, to be sure. But I won't be overwhelming innocent souls who must work next me to or sleep beside me. It's my personal fragrance in my personal space. I like that.A) This stuff does NOT smell like grannies! Despite the nostalgia factor for some, as someone whose grandmothers did not use t, I do not associate it with little old ladies at all, except that I think it would be a wonderful, useful, well-enjoyed gift for Nanas everywhere. :)3) The lotion is creamy enough for a little to go a long way. A dime-sized amount is enough the moisturize both my hands and arms.4) I'm noticing the fragrance seems buildable, perhaps. Apply in layers to carefully strengthen the scent!5) I have but one complaint: this is not a pump bottle nor does it have a snap cap. A loose cap is a challenge, no matter who you are, no matter how old you are. It can easily be knocked off the dresser or bedside and could roll out of reach under furniture. If there are dogs or children around, yikes! Danger! It's quite, quite frustrating, as I have a tough-luck history with such things (no, not children and dogs, but runaway caps.)Ultimately, I had to take away a star (I wish I could only dock it a half star) for the loose-bottle-top issue.But otherwise, this Rose Milk is a romantic, soothing, skin softening treat and and excellent value over luxury brands I haven't even mentioned."
1,"[Good]It's cheap.It cleans.Cool looking bottle.There are no weird dyes like another product from Suave:Suave Men 2-in-1 Shampoo + Conditioner, Ocean Charge, 12.6 Oz (Pack of 3)Suave Professionals Men 2 in 1 Ocean Charge Shampoo/Conditioner, 12.6 OunceIt smells alright; more on this below.[Bad]There is no peppermint smell. I really hate false advertising.The smell is really strong and it lingers. Why does every cheap product have more perfume than more expensive products? Wouldn't the manufacturer save more money by using less perfume? Using this shampoo is a great way of announcing to the world how cheap you are.There is no peppermint or menthol like feeling on your scalp.[Verdict]Decent and cheaper American Crew alternative."
1,I've tried many many hydrating lotions. This stuff is amazing. I will never buy any other lotion. Doesn't have a scent (that I can tell) and a little goes a long way.
1,"I didn't buy mine from this vendor, but I just wanted to drop a bit of advice for those who don't think it smells like cotton candy! It doesn't at first! You're right! But spray it all over you, wait a few minutes (5 at the most) for the weird grape medicine smell to go away and then you literally smell like spun sugar.I promise!This stuff is so affordable and amazing, please never discontinue this!"
1,"Its the same item you would buy off maccosmetics.com but its a bit cheaper on here. I think i paid $5 less. The product is the exact same, so if you like MAC, this is something for you! Studio Fix + is a Medium to Full coverage, which does its job when used correctly. Comes with a little buffer pad so it makes it easy for touch ups when you're on the go."
1,Dark blood red color. Appears black in some lights. If you are looking for more of a red wine color this will be too dark once you put two coats on. Essie staying power.
1,Expensive blusher probably because it is produced in limited amounts and there are far too many colors from which to choose.  My advice is to find a clolor you like in this line and go to a drug store and get a similiar color in a cheaper version.  Does it really make that much difference when it's on whether you paid $30 or $10.00?
1,"I have been looking for a shampoo for my little Ozzy for some time now...and did some searching in local stores and didn't see anything that I liked. So I turned to my trusty friend, Amazon, and poof!!! There was this product!! I waited anxiously by the mailbox for this to arrive. First thing I did was open the bottle and smell this product....WOW!! :) Secondly I got Ozzy in the tub and scrubbed him up and I am honestly in love with this product!! He smells amazing, his coat is shiny and soft. I would recommend this product to anyone!! (Thank you to every one for posting the reviews, YOU are the sellers of this product!! and I thank you!!)"
1,I really love this stuff. It smells amazing and lasts a really long time.  I find that it doesn't irritate my allergies either.
1,"Honestly, I couldn't tell if this cream was working or not. Yes my stretch marks faded, but it could have been them naturally fading over time. Regardless, it didn't hurt to go ahead and use the bottle up. After a while I didn't see any difference so I just stopped using it. I've also heard rumors that cocoa/shea butter has no proven affect on stretch marks. Perhaps IF I ever get stretch marks again I would re-try this product. It has a nice, subtle smell and it is very creamy. Not too thick, not too thin. It takes about 5-10 minutes to dry but it will definitely make your skin softer."
1,"I stumbled onto this amazing cream about a year ago.  It quickly solved all my skin problems in just one application a day. Now I hope I'm never without a jar.  I had sun damage, brown spots and dry itchy skin and this cream made all the spots lighter and my skin moist and healthy. My nails improved and the tone of my skin improved.  Did I mention the great smell?  If you are looking for a quick acting, effective, healing and aromatherapy cream you can not do better than Arbordoun's Calendual cream."
1,"The only things about this is that the plastic bristles are actually quite stiff and will scratch your arm/shoulders/face if you dont mind what youre doing, but hey it works great, and thats all the really matters! On the brush it says with boar bristles... so Im not to smart about this put I suppose the style of brush is called  porcupine and has nothing to do with the animal... I thought perhaps they used porcupine bristles or something... that is just my ignorance, anyways it grabs the hair without tugging, you can even kep rolling it up without fear of your hair gettign in a tangled mess, and to save time Ive been using it to tease my crown, which works great. But I do wish I wouldve gone with my better instinct and gone to the 3"" diameter... I have 2 feet or more of hair... the 2 still does it right, just thinking the 3 in would probably give me a bigger blow out? IDK, I might purchase the 3 in in the future! Great quality! Ive returned brushes I bought from Ulta because bristles were falling off, I have not seen one bristle fall off! This is just a classically awesome brush every woman should have, and the price... man, cant get quality like this for that low... Ive had $20 brushes and not been as happy as I am with this brush... Ive basically been bragging about it to anyone that comes over, its my new favorite purchase :)"
1,It works.  I believe strongly that the brand works better than the generic.  Have seen better results with the tried and true original.
1,I have to wear makeup everyday. Makeup remover is very important to me. I love this product as usually. It is very gentle and give me the best result. I will keep using it.
1,"This Shampoo smells great and does what Shampoo is supposed to do, clean and moisturize.  Somehow, I always seem to think of the Caribbean or Hawaii whenever I use this Shampoo.  I was first attracted by ""Tropical Coconut"" and the price.  So far I have no regrets."
1,"I have dry and, let's face it, old skin.  Every night, after washing my face, I have been puttingOlay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment, 1.7 Ounceon to retard the inevitable wrinkling process.  But when I'm brave enough to look at myself in my 8X magnifying mirror, I can see that, in spite of faithful exfoliating, I do have some clogged pores, a condition I think is exacerbated by so many facial cremes.I'm now substituting this derma e product instead of the Oil of Olay several nights a week, hoping the tea tree oil will work against pore clogs.  I apply a small amount and work it into my face and haven't noticed any greasiness.  As a matter of fact, I love the way it makes the skin feel. And I've been a tea tree oil user for years so I actually like the smell.One other very nice thing about using this instead of the Olay is that, although Olay products are not especially expensive, this is even less so.  Saving money and saving my face?  Priceless!  And it's a multi-purpose creme that will come in handy when mosquito season is here."
1,"So I am horrified to say I have skin that is not just sensitive, but likes to get big bumps (particularly on my underarms) has been going on for years. Nothing I have tried has worked like this, the closest thing I was doing was literally using my biore face wash (which I LOVE fyi for my face) on my underarms, but I was still getting these bumps. I found this at walmart for like six bucks (they are hidden on the bottom shelf).I have been using for 8 days (once a day) on my under arms (not using it on my face, dont really need it) and other sensitive places prone to acne. I am so proud to say two days in I was getting relief! Plus it hasn't bothered my sensitive skin! I have used everything on these bumps over the years from drawing salve (black tar like dream that literally draws out the infection) to having to take antibiotics when they got bad.  I do as the box says and try to leave it sitting on the skin for a few minutes. So far I am over whelmed with relief and joy, I wont be embarrassed to wear sleeveless shirts this summer!!As a side note I also use seabreeze (well the knock off brand) on my skin as well to help stop any bumps from forming. If all I have to do is use this soap and sea breeze I will be happy. In a week I have used a fair amount of the bar, but I figure maybe a bar every month to month and half."
1,Decent moisturizer with SPF 30. Use it after I apply my regular moisturizer because I have dry skin and no flaking. SPF 30 is a must even if you are outside for a short time.
1,"I have had other wraps before but didn't like them.  This one is terrific.  It absorbs really, really well.  It is a nice fit.  I have bought it for all of my sister in laws.  Love it."
1,"I love this stuff, that and Purity Made Simple.  That smells a little like Medicine also, but I think that the line was first made for people with skin problems and eventually made it to regular old ladies (55 soon) But it is great for all ages.  I am just one of those people that was blessed with skin that took awhile to show wrinkles. I started with the line 4 years ago and have been very happy with 95% of the products.  Some things just don't work for everyone."
1,I have been using this product for many years and cannot be without it. I have very fine hair and it helps with the tangles and breakage.
1,"I really like these processing caps, they are large enough and roomy to cover the hair line in the back of your neck without tugging the front of the cap back or side roll up  and then you wind up having a tug-o-war game going on. When it stays it stays, the cap got you covered. Period. It is good for conditioning, oil hair treatments, perms, body art quality henna applications(for hair), painting the ceiling and walls(not to get paint on your hair), sanding and priming the car (no dust on hair).I always henna my hair once or twice a year and this fit the bill; this is a universal fit, not like some stores that have caps and they tend to be on the small side.For the price I paid  is a steal for 30 caps.  These will last me at least very, very, long time; if it isn't ripped I just rinse the stains off and let dry and reuse 5 times until it gets, too, gnarly. The quality isn't cheap like some where the cap tears; this cap is pretty durable. I will definitely buy again."
1,"I think this product works wonders. I'm 62 and have uh,""mature"" skin  but I've been using this little yellow stick for over a decade. Covers, is not harsh, eliminate dark circles, can be used as a concealer and brightner. For the money, this can't be beat - wouldn't be without it!"
1,I mix this oil with the orange and peppermint oils to use as a hot oil treatment for my natural african american hair. Smells great and is really great on my scalp. My hair is so healthy!
1,"During a visit with my doctor, I had to purchase an overpriced $50 thigh-high compression stocking, just one, not a pair.  It worked well for several wearings and then just wouldn't stay up any longer.  I needed quite a bit more use from it, and I got to where I couldn't even walk the dog a few feet before it fell down.  The elastic wasn't stretched, just seemed to have lost all its clinging ability.  I tried what I could think of to keep it up, including wrapping an ace bandage around the top of it.  That didn't work either.Then I found this handy product.  The stocking stays up beautifully, even for long walks in the heat, even when I get a little sweaty.  In fact, it was a little difficult to removed without tugging on skin too much, so I applied some water, and that helped.  Of course, I wash the stocking before I use it again.This adhesive saved me the cost of a new stocking."
1,"It's hard to find any product that fulfils its promises nowadays, especially where adhesives are involved, but this product really does the job exactly as promised.  One of the few remaining &#34;reliable old standbys&#34;."
1,This one I really like and it probably deserves a 4.5 Stars. Excellent pump and one feels refreshed and invigorated after the daily ablutions. Neutrogena has been around and they always distinguish themselves for carrying some Very Decent products and this is for sure one of them!
0,"It seems to me that Maybelline is synonomus with mascara.  You would think, then, that given their years in the industry that they would have mascara down pat!Not so, as evidenced by this product.  It is not a good product because it does not do what it is suppose to do which is to make the lashes look longer, thicker, etc.There's a company in Australia that makes the best that I have found.  Then there's Lancome which is always good.Both of them are much more expensive:  4 times more so.I would think Maybelline would improve their product and if it's mmore expensive to do so, then do so and charge perhaps 10 bucks for a product that will end up doing what its suppose to.Their liquid eyeliner surprisingly does well in competing with Lancome....why not their mascara?"
0,"Though these correction pads have some good ingredients, this product strips the skin - which can cause a rebound effect of even more oiliness.  When denatured alcohol is one of the first five ingredients (ingredients are listed by amount, with the first ingredients comprising the highest % of the product) don't buy it. I get better results from MD Alpha Beta pads. It has a LOT less alcohol in it. It's ingredients are:Ingredients: Salicylic Acid, Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Extract, Citric Acid, Copper PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Glycolic Acid, Camellia Sinensis Extract, Lactic Acid, Malic Acid, Polysorbate-20, Water, Alcohol Denat., Sodium Benzoate, Soy Isoflavones, Genestein, Hamamelis Virginiana, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Zinc PCA"
0,"I used this on some older stretch marks that I had and it did nothing for them. It is a great moisturizer, but way too expensive to use for that.  I ended up buying 100% unrefined shea butter and noticed a significant improvement in my older stretch marks and it moisturizes my skin all day from just one application.  Makes a great all over body moisturizer and you can even use it in your hair.  The unrefined shea butter is way cheaper and way more effective.  I would suggest buying the unrefined shea butter instead."
1,It makes my complexion look so smooth & lasts for hours. I'm so sad it was discontinued. It's my favorite.
1,I have dry skin as well as oily skin and acne prone skin. It's not a fun combo to work with but this moisturizer sure helps!
1,"I have to give this product at least 3 stars.  I loved that it was powder form, and it does look very natural.  Although,  the minerals are in powder form, this makeup is definitely not like your typical powder.  It absorbs into the skin and looks very natural.  This makeup doesn't sweat off or ""drip into your collar when the weather is hot and humid.  The color selections are great and the makeup really does look very natural. The problem:  It broke me out,  I am allergic to the minerals.  This makeup doesn't have a bunch of fillers in it.  This is simply powdered minerals.  My skin was clear before I started using it. After about one week of using this product, I broke out, my skin really broke out.  I didn't want to believe it was the makeup, because, it was perfect in every other way.  I stopped using the product and my skin cleared up.  I tried it again, and I broke out again. I do not usually have sensitive skin.  I can use liquid makeup that cost $2.99 at the drug store.  My skin stays clear even if I don't always wash my face before bed.  Basically, this makeup is excellent, BUT not for everyone. It's a excellent product if your skin is not sensitive to the minerals.  One more thing, if you purchase the foundation, you need to purchase the application brush as well.  The brush is essential in applying this product."
1,"I really love this hair dryer. I mean, for the price I paid it's comparable to a high end salon dryer. My hair frizz is DEFINITELY reduced. It works fast without damaging the hair. Highly recommend."
0,"Wow this stuff is garbage. I am so perplexed by all the great reviews. I have very fair, sensitive skin with mild/moderate acne. I have been looking for a good facial moisturizer for years and thought this would be my answer. Nope. It's not a cream, it's runnier than regular lotion and upon application it feels like a gel. After 10 minutes it feels like I put nothing on my face, in fact it makes my face feel a little tight. I look in the mirror and see dry patches. I am so disappointed, I just can't trust reviews anymore. Only good thing about this product is that it has no fragrance and doesn't irritate my skin."
0,"I decided to give it a try because of the previous good reviews of using it for outdoor activities ...After received it, I have been using it for months mostly for my water sessions, which are about an hour to two hours each session.  I will not reapply it after getting out to the water, and i think it should be able to protect my skins for at least an hour or two ... however, it doesn't, my skins still get tan after each session, and the worse is the sun spots on my face are darkening ... and I have to use a special face cream to fade the unwanted sun spots after showering ... so what's the point of using it???for outdoor activities, i don't think it can fully protect human skins from the damage of sun exposure, like i said earlier, and it is much more expensive then those sun blocks (around ten dollars) in the drugstores.  I didn't return it because I couldn't tell the actual result from using it on the first few times; however, after 30 days of ordering it, i confirm its ineffectiveness when i have used it more ...well...two stars are for its light weight, non-greasy texture, and decent smell, so it can be applied under the foundation for daily use; however, there are tons of similar products that gals can use it under the foundation and are much cheaper; or tons of foundation already have spf.  perhaps guys' skins aren't that delicate as gals' ... my husband uses it too ... but i still see his sun spots on his face ... he just doesn't care about that ... doesn't mean that works though"
1,"I'm a big fan of exfoliating to remove the dead skin cells that tend to clog the skin and make it look dull. I had been using an exfoliating brush for washing and an exfoliating back brush (not the type with the long wooden/plastic handle but the one that's a long continuous bristle with a handle at each end). Since they were out of my usual back brush, I picked up a single pack of the hydro towel to give it a try. Its length is designed for self cleaning your back.  I wasn't expecting much but I was very pleasantly surprised by:1)  its light weight. You can ball it up in your hand and use like a shower sponge but it does a great job exfoliating while cleaning and it feels invigorating!2) It lathered up great with only a little bit of shower gel. I wasn't expecting such a quick and heavy lather so I put more on it than I should. My next thought was wondering how long it would take me to rinse all the suds out.3) The lather rinsed out quickly and cleaning! No rinse, squeeze, rinse, squeeze to ensure I don't put away a soapy towel.The hydro towel is durable and dries completely very quickly (unlike bath brushes, sponges, loofahs which can harbor bacteria). So I have now replaced my back brush and body brush, wash cloth and all other shower sponges with the hydro towel.  I definitely recommend this product!"
1,GREAT summer finger color. It looks good on toes too but I love that it's just fun enough for fingers without being too young girl.
1,"Neutrogena hand cream is just about the best heavy-duty hand lotion out there.  It isn't nearly as greasy as many of the hand creams on the market.  It is quick and easy to apply because it rubs into your skin fairy quickly, yet its effects are long lasting.  Using this cream a couple of times a day really helps my chapped hands.The only drawback of this product as far as I'm concerned is its packaging.  The old version of this product used to have a flip-top cap which was much easier to use and less messy than the screw-on cap which the new version has."
0,"What a waste of money.  This, along with a brush, a comb and all kinds of other &#34;natural&#34; hair growth remedies have now gone in the garbage.  I sport my &#34;baldness&#34; and wear it proudly.  I am done spending money on things like this.The oil does smell good and is probably great for the scalp.  But, other than that, I really don't see the benefits of using it as a &#34;solution&#34; to hair loss.  (I used it religiously for a month)The research on baldness is legion... and most everything I have read list several main causes:  Genetics, Diet and Stress.  There is only so much a person can do about all 3 of these causes (especially the genetics one).Save your money... until they come up with a cure for Vanity... which we all deal with in our culture in one form or another... and we are all guilty of it.You look great... if you are beautiful from the inside out."
1,I have been using this for years and really like it. It makes your face feel so soft after using it.
1,I've used many concealers but this is by far the best I've found. It covers everything and without being too heavy and it lasts for hours.  It comes in different shades and they are good for everyone. I would highly recommend.
1,"I have recently been suffering from dry skin and my face looked so dull. I changed up my cleanser and added this amazing moisture cream and its like I have new skin. It absorbs quickly and the results are amazing. Its made a definite positive impact on the look and feel of my skin. I put it on auto-delivery, cause I don't ever expect to have to look for another moisturizer."
0,"The first time I used this I put it on and within two minutes began smelling vomit. I thought my dog had thrown up somewhere so I walked all over the house with the mask on looking for vomit. When the timer went off I figured I'd look more when I get out of the shower and never found anything nor did I smell the vomit after I showered. Never associated the smell with the mask. The second time I used this I immediately noticed a vomit smell and put 1 and 2 together. By now I've used it four times and every time it smells like vomit, not kind of like vomit, just like vomit! The product works well enough, but considering it has fragrance as an ingredient I just don't get why it smells so bad."
0,"Smell is completely chemical. As other reviews state, it seems that product has changed, but continue being sold using positive reviews from the previous version. Shame"
0,"I have used this 3 times so far and it has not made ANY bubbles. I am so disappointed. I did everything right, even shook the bottle. I squeeze some out under the faucet and it makes really tiny insignificant ""bubbles"" and by the time I get in the bath, they are all gone and what's left is cloudy water. Waste of  money! Only positive thing is that it smells good. I don't notice that my skin is softer."
1,"This cleanser is great. My skin always feels very clean after I use it. Although, I agree with people who have said to use a soap pump bottle with it. It is almost impossible to hold on its own. Before I bought the product I read a lot of reviews that said the smell was bad, I disagree. I actually really like the smell. It is an unusual smell but not bad by any standards."
1,"I bought this to use with my Clinique Even Better Concealer. It's amazing. Even though it's really made for the powder concealer from bare escentuals it works perfectly for the cream concealer. The Bobbi Brown brush I was using was too hard on my skin, which can create wrinkles and stretch the skin. This brush is like sweeping a feather across your skin and it smoothes the concealer perfectly. I'm obsessed now."
1,Revelon Super Lustrous Lipstick Creme Lipstick is as in thename very lustrous. This lipstick will keep lips moustourized all day long. There is no need to add extra moisturized to your lips when usingthis Lipstick.The Color is very beautiful and last all day. All in all I would say this is a good value for your money. I have used this lipstick for many years and I have never been disappointed by its performance.
1,"I just started using this product about 3 months ago after researching online for organic products used for acne prone skin. I am female/23 years old and have had acne my whole life. Some products help some don't, it's the same story as many others I'm sure. I got to the point where I accepted my bad skin and just tried to make the best of it with makeup.This mask is wonderful. It doesn't get rid of pores completely (at least not yet!) But it has made the pores on my cheeks/nose/and under my eyes MUCH smaller. As others have said it is nice to use as a spot treatment over night for larger blemishes or pimples just starting out. I personally have never had a pimple just ""disappear"" but this helps so much. I use it almost every day if I'm not in a rush. Sometimes I use it in the morning and at night. It has opened me up to other KMF products as well wich work very nicely.Never in my life have I gotten a compliment on my skin until using these products but people can really see the difference."
1,"HiGot this for my daughter who had some black heads, Not sure if it would work or not but we put it on for several nights and it drew the black heads out enough to get them on our own. I will use if I get a splinter alsodeezie"
1,"I so wanted to wait a week at LEAST before I give a review of this product. But I really could not wait to tell anyone about it.THIS. IS. AMAZING.I have no idea why people complain about this? Now, for me personally my cuticles weren't super gnarly or anything but they were in a dry state a LOT from working with food (meaning washing my hands constantly) and swimming in the pool everyday (chlorine KILLS my cuticles.. makes em so dry! Geez) and painting my nails frequently and removing them with acetone isn't the most nourishing thing either.But after even a FEW days I've noticed BIG changes. They are so soft and look so much more healthy even after coming out of the pool. They even look nice after I've washed my hands and without lotion!As far as the greasy complaints I've seen about this product? Well... honestly at first what do you expect in a lotion/cream? It will be at first of course! In my opinion it absorbs fast though so it isn't a problem. And I put a GOOD amount on. It just takes a couple minutes and you're ready to go!I would definitely buy this. It'll repair cuticles in any shape with diligent use! And it couldn't hurt to use it in conjunction with lotion.:)"
1,"I am the kind of person who will splurge on cosmetics and beauty products and feel it's worth it so I don't necessarily look for the bargain buy in this area but the best working product.Fortunately, this curling iron is not only priced well for the value, it beats out the ""old school"" curling irons I've used for the last 30 years.I actually bought mine at Walgreens for a higher price after reading about it in a magazine.Unlike any other iron I've used this one actually heats up in...wait for it....wait for it....30 SECONDS!!!You can also choose your heat level from 1-15 but be leary of that 15---that is a scorcher.However, some may be looking for that high of a heat.  I keep it around the medium to medium high numbers and it curls in an instant.  And I have uber thick hair.Touch ups are instant rather than waiting for the iron to heat up. If I am going out and find I've missed a spot I can basically now instantly reheat the iron and have it hot 30 seconds after I turn it on.Negative: I'm probaby odd in that I always hold my curling iron real close to the barrel. Because of this a few times I've accidentally turned the heat level without trying. Not a big deal, but something I'd change if I could to make the wheel maybe a little harder to turn.Conclusion: tops in my book. I won't go back to the curling irons of the past where I have to wait for them to heat. Instant gratification, baby! :-)"
1,I wanted something that wasn't super sweet smelling i smelled the one in a Japanese store and the smell wasn't as strong as the one I got here. But it came pretty fast so thats one good thing.
1,"I am a huge fan of blue polishes.  I am completely in LOVE with this particular color!  It's just a perfect, pastel blue.  2 coats using light, even strokes gave me maximum opacity. The formula is just like every other Essie polish I have - not too thick, not too thin.  I apply with a Seche base and a Seche top."
1,It makes me hungry just using this spray. The resemblance to bubblegum cotton candy is amazing AND it lasts all day! If you're thinking of buying this then buy it. You will not be disappointed.
1,"Wish I'd found this sooner - I was using a similar body spray with a lower percentage of salicylic acid, and this works much better!  It was recommended to me by a dermatologist and it's really helped clear up bumps on my back and chest caused from sweat and moisture wicking fabrics.  Buying my second bottle now."
1,It's a great color but a bit more transparent than I had expected. Less bold pastel than it looks in bottle
1,"I used the Burts Bees Natural Acne Solutions line for a while, and although I really liked the products they were just too expensive.  I decided to switch to this face wash and am so glad I did.  It's a great value and a very effective product.  Plus, it has simple natural ingredients.  I've been using it for over a year and my skin seems well-balanced with even color.  I don't think the smell is very noticeable at all.  I put it in a small glass pump bottle and use one pump of liquid to wash my face in the morning and again at night.  Lathers up nicely and washes away leaving my face clean but not dried out.  I have combination skin in the winter but generally oily skin the rest of the year and this face wash is perfect.  Highly recommended."
1,"I like this oil very much.  I use it straight out of the bottle to moisturize my skin and find it absorbs well and feels great.  I prefer coconut oil for my hair.  I find this just a little too &#34;oily&#34; for my hair but it did seem to moisturize and added shine.  The main purpose of buying this was to use it with coconut oil, distilled water, and essential oil to make my own moisturizing lotion and night cream.  It whips up very nicely.  I used lavender essential oil.  After the lotion sat for a day or so the fragrance that developed was very relaxing and soothing.  This oil does not smell like apricots.  In fact I really don't smell much of anything but that's ok because I use essential oils.  The bottle does say 100% apricot oil."
1,This is a great item to carry with you and have at home.  It smells really good and nourishes the cuticles.
0,"I was tired of natural deodorants that just didn't work for B.O. However this isn't that much better on odor.  It stops you from sweating which I did not care about.  It also makes me sneeze and is hard to wash off the next day in the shower. While it goes on clear and dries smooth, my armpits feel sticky or coated in the shower the next day. I would not get it again."
1,"This big round brush is great for styling long hair, wavy or not! It manages hair easily, doesn't scratch at scalp like some other brushes would. The feel of it's weight is ok. The combining of natural bristles with longer sinthetic bristles accomplishes great combing and smoothing of hair."
1,"It is a good product, and would extend the life of polish, but maybe for a couple of days more than regular base coat. It does help the color polish to go on smoothly and with out running all over."
1,great ointment for skin rashes.
1,"I use this comb in the shower to comb out tangles.  Works great.  Good size and weight to the comb.  It's a sturdy comb and I don't expect to lose any tines pulling out tough knots.  The tines aren't sharp either, I've had some combs that hurt your head because they're so sharp.  This one is nicely rounded and easy to use.  Would highly recommend to someone needing a basic comb."
1,"After washing my face, this moisturizes my skin with just the right amount of moisture to make my skin not feel dry/tight."
1,"I thought I had previously reviewed the products thanking the maker for saving my life.  My face suddenly became allergic to everything 2 years ago.  I had all kinds of testing and trials, I paid huge sums of money for  fancy products at the mall with promises that now I would be happy.  Thank heavens a good dermatologist, thank you Sarah, suggested Vani products to me and my whole life has changed.  I can actually put on some eye makeup now!  And if you are old like me, you want to add a little frill every once in a while.  The cream is a bit heavy for my kids (twenty somethings) but if you massage it in a bit, it is gone and you don't feel it.  These pots will last and last and the price is amazing.  Do we want the manufacturer to know this or is s/he already making millions off of us?"
1,item was shipped quickly. however i was rather disappointed at the quality of the item. it didn't leave my hair as soft as i would have liked it to be. it left my hair big and frizzy.
1,This brush has a great handle and is good for reaching those hard to get places. I bought one for the bathroom and one I have for washing my car as the brush is firm but not too firm when cleaning my car.
1,"This color is fantastic. Rich, good coverage, and resists chipping.  Russian Navy should be a staple for your fall polish collection"
1,"My face has been clearer since I started using the product, so it's doing something. Plus my face smells nice too!"
1,"I have my hair professionally colored, but the grey starts peeking through in just three weeks.  I had purchased an expensive temporary spray on product from my stylist to cover the grey. It was messy and difficult to apply.I read the reviews here on Amazon regarding this Roux touch up stick and ordered the dark brown.  I love love love it!!!!  It does have a citronella fragrance, but it is not heavy, and I find it to be pleasant.  I take a little bowl of water and dip the stick in it to moisten the stick.  I keep dipping the stick to get good application on all of my roots.  My hair is medium dark brown with reddish highlights and this color blends perfectly! The dark brown has a bit of an auburn hue but when dried looks good.  I have also purchased the black color and surprisingly, the black blends in beautifully and perhaps, even better.  I used the stick yesterday and today my hair looks great.Use one hand to lightly pull or hold down your roots as this makes application so much easier.If you use this for a thinning part (I do) then you may need to experiment with a couple of different colors to see which looks more natural.  For my thinning hair part line and scalp...the black works best."
1,"It is a nice texture cream, takes only a small amount and the cream is nice, odor free and rubs in well without leaving any greasy feel.  I will review after I have used this a while with results.  Menopause is not fun!!  I will admit so far there are no hot flashes waking me up at night!"
1,Product arrived quickly and packed well.  It smell nice...not stale or rancid like some brands.Tried using on my face but my skin wasn't thrilled with it.  I usually use a little raw coconut oil while my face is wet and I guess the apricot is a little heavier.  It may work for someone else though. We're all different :)BUT....I love to use it getting out of the shower. My skin is so soft and not oily at all.
1,"I love MAC make up. I originally purchased this make up for my wedding. I was going to get my makeup done at the MAC store, and they told me it would be $150! I decided I would invest that money into make up I could keep, not just for one day! I am so thankful. I purchased this powder plus foundation, it works great. I have oily skin, and this product works great. Yes, it is expensive, but definitely worth the money. It makes my skin look great and flawless.I am hooked on MAC."
0,Didn't really do much to clear my skin. I have pretty clear skin but occasionally breakout; I tried this on a breakout and it didn't really have any effect at all. It feels and smells nice but that's pretty much all I can say.
1,I use a lot of make up brands! NARS always delivers. This is an excellent color. A very nice peachy pink that looks good with light or darker skin!
1,"I love this lotion, the smell is delicious and I feel my skin very soft after use it. THIS SELLER WAS VERY FAST AND RESPONSIBLE WITH THE SHIPPING... AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE. I'll buy again, THANKS!"
0,"I have very sensitive facial skin prone to acne. I began using this night and day, as directed, for about 1 week. It cleanses well and thoroughly, but after about a week of usage (washing twice a day (as indicated in directions), I developed dry skin with red rosacea-like patchy bumpy areas on my skin. I think washing twice a day or even once a day with this cleanser, may be too much for very sensitive skin. It may be OK to use a few times a week during the night. After stopping using it, I continued to have red patches and bumps on my skin which took about a few weeks to heal. If your skin is NOT sensitive to alpha hydroxy acid, it may be OK to use, but I have decided after using this, that my skin must be sensitive to the ingredients, so I returned it.Note: you should make sure to wear a good sunscreen since using any products with AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) can make your skin more sensitive to the sun."
1,"This is the color for you! Ruby Rush is really, really red... perhaps even a little more so than the box shows. It's a blast of color for the redhead for the holidays, but not sure I'd want it 365 days/year. Still - it is FUN! But remember: it's permanent, so you'll have to wait a bit if you want to change it!"
1,This is my go to perfume. I have used it for years. It is great to use in the summer or winter.
1,"Price:-Around $40-Regularly available on Amazon for a slight discount-Very often included as part of a variety of Philosophy skin care ""Kits"" in which it will be included at a discountWhat's the product like?-Any scent is not very noticeable to me - neither pleasant nor unpleasant, just smells like a typical skin care product-Does not seems to have lots of 'extra' frou-frou ingredients to make it appear like it's doing something it's not.  I run into this 'extra' ingredient problem a lot with Olay products, they like to include some kind of shimmer or sparkle in their lotions and creams that reflect in the light and immediately make your skin look more 'luminous' but it's not FIXING anything it's just a fake shimmer - I like a product that penetrates and seems to do something to improve my skin, not just sit on top of it; Philosophy does just that - it sinks in, it feels ""clean"" without any extra unnecessary ingredients-I'm not sure what the big difference (if any) is between this ""dry skin"" version and the other versions as this is the only one I have tried so far - this one works well for me, it sinks in, it's definitely not greasy and doesn't make your face look shiney-No issues with the product clogging pores and I've been using it nightly for over a month-Product seems very concentrated (like most Philosophy products) and you don'd need a lot to ""feel"" the moisture and hydration - this 2oz jar will last for monthsWould I recommend this?-Yep!  It's really not that expensive when you realize that how little lotion you have to use.  I love the ""pure"" ingredient feel to it.  I don't see a real improvement in texture, lines or even skin tone but my skin does feel healthy and hydrated when I use this product.  I will repurchase in the future"
1,"Not only does this toner remove excess oil, makeup and other impurities from your skin, but it also does the job without the added alcohol content. I didn't realize that the original Dickinson's Witch Hazel contained alcohol until I read the label on this product. It clearly states that it is &#34;alcohol free&#34;. I immediately grabbed my other bottle of Dickinson's Witch Hazel Toner that I spent barely $4 on at the local Target store and sure enough, there is a slight alcohol content.Clearly, price matters here when you compare this brand to others that can be up to $3-$4 cheaper. However, when you feel the difference on your skin, you will realize exactly what I did---that it's worth it to spend a few extra dollars.  I use this product up to twice daily, and immediately felt a difference with how my skin feels. I have a very combination/oily skin type and this is the only product that I can use as needed without a fear of drying out my skin. It also feels more soothing than the competitor that contains alcohol, and balance my skin tone. I didn't expect those two bonuses.In addition, I've had a brown spot that developed during my pregnancy. I spend a lot of money on creams that promised to help lessen or eliminate its appearance, but nothing worked at all. After using this product for a few months, I took a look at my skin prior to applying makeup and realized that the brown spot was gone. Well, there's my solution!I continue to use this product throughout the day without worry of over drying my skin, and it feels soothing. It's worth the extra money because of all the benefits. One bottle typically lasts me a month, and that's with using it 2-3 times per day to control shine and clogged pores. It also effortlessly removes makeup. I'll be back in a month to purchase more."
1,"To me, the only way that this product could be better is if it was made in the USA (but I'll take Canada over China any day!). Anyways, this moisturizer is a little thin so you may want to wait a little while before you hold anyone's hand. :) My husband said that it felt greasy, but the product just needs a few minutes to absorb fully into your skin. My hands and elbows feel great!"
1,"The usual form of Glycolic Acid in a cream for exfoliation and cell renewal is 5% and for those who have not yet approached that era of aging effects on skin  that percentage is adequate.  But for those who have `mature' or sun damaged skin this night cream containing 10% Glycolic Acid is by far superior. The treatment should be used nightly after thorough cleansing and the use of an alcohol free toner for best results. It goes on very smoothly without a greasy since, tingles a few seconds and then goes to work. (it is fine to put a moisturizer over the cream if the tingling is prolonged).  The results are very rewarding and noticeable after only a few days to a week of use.  For those with lentiges or actinic (read senile!) keratoses, the treatments take a bit longer to notice.  But this product does indeed work and it is a safe product to use. Grady Harp, July 13"
1,"I cut these in half with a sharp, clean pair of scissors and put them all back in the container. It doubles my use as I found the pads are really big, much bigger than Stridex pads, they are generously full of sudsy product and I felt I was throwing them out half-used before deciding to cut them ahead of time.The salicylic acid is just the right amount to prevent breakouts. The pads have enough texture to give me a good exfoliation, and I usually have enough to clean my neck and chest with the back side. My skin looks great, and if I ever get the slightest blemish, usually around my t-zone, I use an oxy spot treatment with benzoyl peroxide. I find the salicylic acid coupled with the occasional benzoyl spot treatment has become the perfect combination.Remember, cut a few in half and I think you'll find it's still more than enough to clean your face."
1,"So far I like OPI and use it only and it provides good coverage, a nice shine, doesn't peel or chip, and the two good coats fill in the nail ridges.  I bought two bottles and will give an update after finishing the second bottle if there are any plus or minus comments to add."
1,OPI is nice. Love the color. Lasted for a really long time on my toes. I had a bit of a problem with my fingernails. The polish seemed to bubble but only sometimes.My nails were clean and just manicured before applying the polish. Maybe the brush wasn't wide enough for me.
0,"I ordered this to surprise my mom after she bought a bottle that turned out to be fake off a popular auction site.  I wanted to be sure that this was authentic so I opened it and compared it to my department store purchased bottle.  I sprayed my wrists with each and they were nowhere near the same.  My department store bottle is soft, sweet and powdery with a hint of jasmine...I don't know how to describe this one except that at first spray it was overwhelming with more spiciness and no sweetness.  I've been wearing it for over an hour and it still smells nothing like the other one.To make sure it wasn't just me, I left everyone in the house smell my wrists and they definitely preferred the department store bottle and said the Amazon purchased bottle didn't smell anything like the other one and even went as far to say it smells bad.  I am so disappointed.  Amazon, as always, is amazing with their customer service and made it right."
1,Love this stuff. It's gentle so I can use it on my face and body. And like with all vanicream products a little goes a long way! Great for people with eczema or sensitive skin
1,"I don't wear a lot of make-up.. just mascara and eyeliner so I didn't think I needed this but I got it just because i felt it i should since i do go to bed with that little make-up on and i keep reading and hearing its bad for the skin somehow. so yeah i got and its alright, it gets most of what i have on my eyes off, but not all ( i think i need one for waterproof) unless im doing it wrong idk. but yeah if you need a little make-up remover this works just fine. No itchiness, no irritation, no blurred vision (obvs don't rub it into your eyeballs) and i always rinse it off. its also convenient which is the No.1 thing for me. I love Maybelline so yeah, not bad"
1,I am crazy about this shampoo. The best quality on the planet and cruelty free!  YES! Highest recommendation by me!
1,"I have used this product for 32 years now. I am 76 yrs old and everybody always remarks how beautiful my skin looks and I know Iowe it to this cream and it is so reasonably priced and of course it is available on Amazon, bless them &#9829;"
1,When you have a cloged nose or just want to relax in general it's a great. It helps you think and unwind. Great product and well worth the buy!
1,"So great to use such a small amount & feel as if it's working!  Great price/excellent product, but I'm not expecting miracles @ 60+..."
1,This is my third set in 10 years.  But understand my first 2 sets I used almost EVERY DAY plus my roommate used it and eventually it stopped producing steam.  Everything has to be replaced.  Having said that I LOVE IT.  This is the best thing to curl your hair.  It is not damaging because it is steam and the curl lasts much longer
1,"I purchased this after reading reviews on multiple sites and seeing this toner ranked as one of the best when it comes to drug store brands.I've been using this every night for three weeks (I've skipped it by accident roughly 4 times) and my skin is noticeably clearer. Within a few days I noticed some of my trouble areas looked better and while the clearing process has been slow its noticeable and the progress steady. I also haven't seen a ""new"" blemish since adding this to my regimen.It hasn't done much for blackheads so a few days ago I purchased an exfoliant to address that issue around my nose.Overall I am very happy and will likely repurchase this when it runs out."
1,Great standard beauty product that you can't beat! This is one product to order while the new ones fall by the wayside.
1,I've been searching stores for months and can't seem to find it anymore. My BF loves how exfoliating and the clean feel he gets after using this. I should probably order in stock bc with out this he uses normal body soap! ugh

1,"I bought mine in Bed Bath and Beyond a couple years ago and use it 2-4 times a month. It comes with a pouch of gray clips which you insert onto the heated rack. It is lined with sponge to protect hair and doesnt do damage. The rollers take about 10 min to fully heat up and if left in hair for 7-15 min, the curls will last all day.Now for the negatives. The slit design on each roller isnt good for long hair that gets tangled in it. Also, the pink edge to the roller cracks and hair gets trapped and pulls. The roller gets hot to the touch and you'll find yourself saying ""ouch"" when rolling onto hair. The clips heat up and do cause indent in hair. If you put too much hair onto the roller and try to clip it, it will fall out.I never use the small rollers, only the large and medium to get loose waves. Small rollers gives really tight curls and its not enough to do an entire head, so its pointless. Buy the conair with large rollers if you're only looking to do sexy loose waves."
1,"OPI is the best nail polish, in my opinion.  It goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and is very durable.  It doesn't chip as easily as some other polishes do.  This particular color is a very deep, dark charcoal gray."
1,"I have combination skin that is prone to breakouts. I use this wash in the evenings only to remove my makeup and the gross-ness of the day. It has a very light scent that is refreshing and I also love the texture. It doesn't suds up too much and a little goes a long way - I have had the same bottle for probably four months (the 8 oz). I use it withPhilosophy Hope in a Jar Daily Moisturizer, All Skin Types, 2 Ounceand usePhilosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash, 8 Ouncesin the mornings. Love this!"
0,"This eyeliner was completely useless. It felt like the inside of the bottle was dried out or the liner was just so light and useless that you couldn't even see it. Also, the brush sucks. Overall, terrible."
1,"I have to echo the other two excellent reviews of this product. I too have been using this for about twenty five years off and on, but I always come back to this. The scent is great, yet light not at all cloying, the coverage is excellent and very thorough, really tones down the pinky brown color that is my skin after cleansing and applying makeup. The colors do tend to run on the light side, just as a warning if you have darker skin. I would recommend the non color adding Translucent if your skin is darker. I use the light-med. and it is perfect for my light skin. The result is flawless, smooth, lovely and a luminous complexion. The one I trust and will use forever. Note* While I love the looks of the vintage packaging (hasn't changed since 1935), it can be hard to control the stuff from the inside. I recommend poking holes in the plastic, so as to control the product coming out. A few years ago, they put out a sifter with this and why on earth they discontinued it, I haven't a clue. Other than that small technical defect, this stuff continues to rock!!! Best powder out there."
1,I am very loyal to using Dermalogica  so the toner is an important key to making sure your skin is clean after washing and it really does the job.
1,This product is totally amazing.  It allows me to extend the life of my adhesive bra so I get many more wearings than I would have.I don't like bra straps or strapless bras so i use these adhesive cups. After a few wearings the adhesive wears off.  I apply this adhesive to my skin and the cups adhere  without any pulling or stretching of the skin.  It''s also great for  your tops to keep from revealing too much cleavage.  The price  and the product is great.  I will certainly be purchasing more when I need it.
1,"I've never been disappointed with Vidal Sassoon products...this brush is no exception.  I use it to just brush my hair, but because it's thermal, I also use it to blow dry my hair when I want a straighter style.  A must buy for those with medium or long hair lengths...it doesn't tangle and that's a great advantage over other similarly- designed brushes!!"
1,"I agree that it is hard to find this kind of heating iron with the brush teeth, so I ordered this thinking it would be more up to date than the v. old slow-to-heat conair I have.well, this Helen of Troy heating iron is not any better than the old ones I have.  it is sloooow to heat up !!!  it also feels cheaper than my old versions.  and although it has a plastic cap on the end of the heated part, it seems a little on the skimpy side and I would feel safer and less nervous if the protective cap was more generous.  also, the teeth of the brush are rubbery, bendable...makes it feel even cheaper.All in all, I wanted to return it --- but then I realized that by the time I paid all the postage, I would only get $10 back.  So I kept it.  But seriously, if I had bought it from a store, I would have taken it back."
1,"Trying to get away from awful parabens in my products and have tried other naturals versions, even pure henna (what a stinky mess!) I really like this brand, herbatint, and the color lasts a long time. I color every 3 weeks because of so much grey and don't want chemicals. One note - this box does not include a bottle to shake it up & apply (like I am used to with more traditional hair color boxes) but I got one at Walmart super cheap (designed for ketchup I think, but it's clear) and I rinse it out and re-use. WAY easier than mixing in a bowl. I'm very happy with this product."
1,I have used this product before from a Health Food Store.  It gives your hair volume and a very clean feeling to your head.  I do recommend this product.
1,"I found this color to look very nice and professional, yet a little bit snazzy.  I would definitely purchase this again.  It doesn't provide as much white coverage as Happy Anniversary, yet it is a nice polish."
1,This stuff makes my skin smooth and silky. I use it morning and night after I wash my face and it has significantly improved my skin since the first use. A must have.
1,"I read so many good reviews about this deodorant I decided to order some my favorite is green tea by Elizabeth Arden it is a cream and it hasn't stained my white shirts that was a plus .Smells so good has a very light scent nothing over powering  the only difference I find between the two is the scent ,I like the green tea scent better but I like this Blue Grass also it does last along time on I know it gets me through at least 8 hrs who knows mybe it could for another hour. I sweat alot at the gym and so far this product hasn't let me down I just ordered more so I think this deodorant is the one for me."
1,I love queen helene products. Never too harsh for my sensitive skin and always works extremely well. Will continue to buy this again and again.
1,"Great to get back to hot rollers...much better for my hair and styles better!  My only negative is that there is not an &#34;on/off&#34; button you have to unplug the cord yourself and sometimes I forget to do that.  However, at this price, this is well worth it."
0,My mom used Natural Instinct for many years until they changed their formula. The worst part of it all was the 2 week color refresher! Turned my mom's hair into a fireball!!! IT'S PURE RED!!! (she used a dark brown hair coloring) She was very furious that she didn't leave the house for many weeks.I'm going to do a research for another ammonia free hair coloring.  She won't be buying this brand again!
1,"The bomb.com! detangles like a charm hunty! hahah. Good for african american hair, or anyones hair that creates a tangly mess from time to time."
1,I've been a nail tech for 27 years and I've been using this on and off for a long time. I was surprised to see it in 4 oz. It's a great quality product and priced better than many of the professional top coats. Works well to preserve your airbrushing and nail art. Highly recommend.
1,"Get one of these for yourself or someone you know who does not already use Burt's Bees products. There is just enough for you to see if you like something, so you don't have to waste money on a full-sized product you may not like! A good holiday gift!"
1,We bought the ylang ylang version which does seem to strip your hair. I only use it about once a week although my hubby likes to use this for every day (he doesn't have much hair!).  My hair is too long and dry on the ends so I have to definitely use conditioner with this.  Otherwise it smells fantastic and rinses clean.  Good basic shampoo for men or for a super squeaky cleansing day.
1,"but very glad i did.  during the dry winter months i use to coat my face in cetaphil when i went to bed.  but getting older (almost 40) i wanted something that could assist with aging.  have only used a few times, but i really like the quick absorption of this stuff, and i woke up and my face felt great."
1,"Helps, nothing kills acne all together.  I got this for my son.  I know when I had acne as a teen, I went to the dermatologist for years.  It comes and goes no matter what the treatment but these products help a little.  Nothing is a miracle cure no matter what the ads say.  Well, age is.  You really will outgrow acne where it gets to the point you might have a zit every now and then."
0,"Is plastic getting expensive?  Because the plastic that the hinged cover on this is made out of is SO THIN...I would describe it as ""fragile.""  In fact, there's already a small crack on one side.The on/off switch was also faulty - I had to jiggle it back and forth to get it to turn on initially.  It would only stay on if I kept the switch positioned in the middle.This is by FAR the poorest quality set of hot rollers I have ever bought.I only gave it two stars because it DID heat up evenly, and the rollers themselves would be nice in a better ""house.""Thank goodness the switch was faulty and part of it arrived cracked, since you can return defective items and not pay for the return shipping on Amazon!"
1,iT COVERS REAL NICE.  IT LASTS A LONG TIME. I WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS ITEM FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR FACE MAKEUP
1,"I want to start my comment this way: there's many people who believe there is another people exaggerating on their comments, just because there is a product good for me or others that doesn't mean is good for everybody, no everybody is the same, my hair for example is a very good hair, thick, abundant, curly, but it is coarse and dry, it cannot tolerate protein on any form...that's why I want to make a comment about this conditioner. I could not believe a product without a big name, professional brand or expensive price could be so GOOD, I mean if someone goes to my shower and see all the different brands of hair products that I have been using would understand of what I am talking about, some with good results, some others are a complete waste of money from expensive brands to a ok brand and price. This is one of the best conditioner I've used, it is not a joke!!! the price is not even right because the results I obtained using this conditioner exceeds it's value. My boyfriend thought I was joking when I bought this conditioner for himself, after he used it then he realized why I bought this brand and this kind instead something else. I didn't buy this product from amazon because I can find it any where, from supermarkets to any pharmacy near by paying even lower price. I do recommend this conditioner Suave Natural Conditioner Tropical Coconut, I love it...hopefully Suave never ever will change the formula in this wonderful product."
1,"This stuff really does work. The hype is real. I have been using Crabtree & Evelyn's gardner's hand therapy for years and have really liked it, but this stuff just plain works better. The other stuff is good though, if you need an alternative, but it's more expensive and frankly isn't as good.I live in the Pacific Northwest, which typically doesn't have a very dry climate. But we are having a very cold spell right now with no moisture in the air and my skin is drying up something awful. And, this stuff has saved my hands and, believe it or not, my face! I use argan & maracuja oils on my face typically and they do wonders, but this magic potion is taking care of a pesky dry spot on my face as we speak.This stuff is fragrance free too, so any of you sensitive folks will have no problem. And a little goes a long way as it is very concentrated."
1,This lip balm leaves my lips very soft.  What I especially like about about it is that it has no taste or smell and is not &#34;waxy&#34;.  The sunscreen is an added plus.  I will definitely buy this lip moisturizer again and I am very happy to recommend it.
1,"I absolutely LOVE this color!! It's like a greenish grey - so HOT! I often pair this with the matte top coat, and it looks totally tough!"
1,"I wasn't sure about Frownies, but tried them based on other reviews.  They work..plain and simple.  I used to wake up with deep sleep lines on my forehead, but not any more.  I will continue to use these every night."
1,I used this once and i didn't feel it did anything. I stopped using it. I wanted more of a tough scrubber then a soft sponge.
1,i love the scent of lemon; i use this in my homemade bathroom fragrance to spray in the toilet; it leaves a clean smell.
1,"I am in a nursing home and the No Rinse products are fantastic for bathing in bed. I am going to use it at home for those ""I need a quick bath and or hair wash"" moments. Good for anybody that's sick, laid up or disabled and showering and bath tubs are just too difficult and dangerous. The shampoo is really fantastic. Just need a towel to get clean hair."
0,"color is way too black, not mixed wel  in container, messy, discolors fabrics, don't recommend this except for possible halloween contume product,"
1,"My partner uses the green Neutrogena face cleanser but I find that is too harsh to my skin and makes it red. This cleanser is perfect for me and I use it twice a day in the shower. I find it strips the oil from my face, especially in the morning, whilst not drying out the skin too much. Perfect.Of all the Neutrogena products, this one travels the best and you can close it and it doesn't make a mess in your bag.I would like it if Neutrogena offered a foaming head, because it comes out as a gel and you have to foam it in your hands."
1,"Received the product promptly (which is a plus!). It's easy to use, even for a beginner like myself. Glides easily through hair (mine is very long and fine). Does as described. Great quality. Very pleased!"
1,"I have not given this item three stars because there is any defect in it, but because I had assumed it was a large shampoo comb. My disappointment came from the size of the package and even more disappointed once I removed this comb from the package. If you're expecting a large shower shampoo comb this is not what you're looking for. This seems to appear to be better suited for short hair or a young child's hair. Not suitable for thick curls as from the looks of it , it would not last very long. Again nothing wrong with the product itself, it's just not a large shower comb."
0,"Do not buy this piece of garbage. It does NOT do what it claims to do. If you want to clean out your pores, you're better off using your own fingers, biore pore strips, or the tweezerman face tool. The only thing this piece of crap will do is give your face hickeys, not clean your pores or anything beneficial. You've got to be an idiot to buy it."
1,This definitely stops hot flashes and makes me actually feel like I use to before menopause. I highly recommend this product.
1,"I love these because they moisturize, but don't smear and color everything else in the vicinity like regular lipstick does.  They are ideal for wearing to the dentist, or the chiropractor's office for that reason, but I wear them all the time.  They give you some color, but not thick or intense color, so you look like you're not wearing lipstick, but just have pretty lips."
1,ONLY brush that I can use on my 5yo and 8yo that does not make them scream in pain. This brush does a great job of navigating through knots and no ouch factor. I now have one in every room of the house. Downside Not easy to clean.
1,"If you like to use natural products and enjoy the scent of roses (which is not overpowering), I think you will enjoy this as much as I do.  Witch hazel is a natural astringent and this product has the addition of rose petal water, aloe vera and vitamin E, and it is very nourishing and non-drying (in fact quite the opposite, softening!) to the skin.  It is also Certified Organic.  Don't think you can go wrong with this one, folks!  Thank you Amazon for having this available on Prime, too!"
1,"I much prefer this &#34;jar&#34; version of the Bare Minerals blush product to their newer compact version.  Still the same great colors and powder quality, but with the jar, the powder seems to be better contained than in the compact."
1,"Its benefit is that it is less harsh than other witch hazel brands, yet while pads are convenient, they can be a bit harsh. It is best to buy a bottle instead and get pure cotton swabs or splash it on your face. It has the same texture as an oxy pad, which is very inappropriate for the product."
1,"This product has become extremely hard to find in the stores in my area - lucky for me, I'm an Amazon shopper !  I use it everytime I wash my hair, it tames the brassiness of gray hair."
1,"Love this toner, smells awesome and there is a lot in the bottle. Works for acne without drying your skin out, and alcohol free."
1,"I tried MANY products before this. Worked well to calm and contain my son's cradle cap. It did not cure it but it definitely lessened the severity.  We eventually went to a dermatologist and were prescribed Ovace, which works even better."
1,"Of the thousands of moisturizers that I've tried, this one has got to be the best. It goes on lightly and doesn't feel at all heavy. There is no funky scent. It does the job and it makes your skin better. I even recommend this moisturizer for peels because it really helps speed up and clean up the peeling process. Overall, a great addition to any night regimen."
1,"Love this cuticle oil. My nail bed and cuticles look better than they ever have since I've been using this for about 2 weeks now.Put it on twice a day and it nourishes your cuticles and nail bed, I haven't had a hang nail since I started using this!Oh and it smells like cherries and almond. Yum."
0,"After reading all the positive reviews I was so hopeful. My nails have always peeled, been weak/thin and brake/chip easily. Used this product for several weeks, as directed and it did not make one bit of difference. No change what so ever. :("
0,"I was surprised to see the other reviews about stinging, because I thought it was just me!  I have very sensitive skin and allergies, and was able to wear this mascara, but often experienced stinging and burning.  It also flaked off under my contact lenses, and smeared easily.I love Maybelline products, but must give Great Lash Mascara two stars.  Try L'Oreal's Million Lashes or Cover Girl's Clump Crusher instead."
1,"A few people are complaining that this stuff is thin. But, if you've used this product for a while, you know the thinness doesn't translate out to mean ineffective or ""watery"". Also, it takes a few more rinses to get it completely off of your skin and away from your eyes. It will burn the crap out of your eyes just like any other soap. I may try what one reviewer said and dilute it. Sensitive areas on my face temporarily turn red, but doesn't sting. Also, this stuff cleans very well and is pretty drying. So, if you're like me with dry and sensitive skin, dilution may be necessary. I repurposed a dial soap pump bottle for use with the refill bottle. It works fine and only takes about two pumps to wash my entire face. I sometimes use it as a body wash, as well. It is very refreshing. The smell is something to get used to - like everything earthy, raw and natural - like sticking your face in tea tree mixed with mud and grass, and nothing sweet or synthetic. This is the real deal."
1,"I love love love love this stuff! It smells amazing, it feels wonderful on my hair. I mix it with the Giovanni protein infusion and leave it on overnight with a cap over my head. Leaves my hair soft and shiny!"
1,This shimmering color is just beautiful. I have had problems finding it in stores. I was happy to find it on hereD
1,"I've tried several facial cleansers, mainly drugstore brands. Aveeno, Clean & Clear, Biore, Neutrogena - you name it, I've tried it. I never had an issue with these brands until I decided to purchase Purity Made Simple. Normally, I wouldn't pay this much for a facial cleanser, but I've found success in other Philosophy products and came into a little extra money, so I thought ""why not?""I'm very impressed with this product. It doesn't make my face extremely oily or dry, but the perfect balance. It doesn't break me out. It smells pleasant. My favorite aspect of this product is that it removes all traces of makeup in ONE wash. With other cleansers, I'd have to wash 3-4 times to remove all of my makeup and I'd still wake up with residue under my eyes. A little goes a long way, which is great considering how expensive it is.Despite the price, give this product a try. I could almost guarantee that you won't wanna turn back."
0,Dried out my sensitive skin. Smell and texture are fine but it seems to strip too much oil on my face each time I use this.
1,I like this base coat more than any other I've tried. It doesn't peel off easily like other ones do and my polish stays on longer.
1,"Good, leaves hair and scalp dry and very clean. Not so sure if it really prevents dandruff in my case, but I feel OK with it. One downside it's its smell, But you can deal with it."
1,This stuff is great. So happy. My skin is smooth and so much clearer and younger looking. Well worth the purchase!
1,I've been using this stuff for years. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT ! It sets my foundation great.. & is even great without foundation & still has great coverage! I also use it for touch ups.. A LOT! It lasts quite awhile & doesn't feel heavy or cakey at all. I definitely recommend for someone who is looking for something that is JUST as good as high end powders! The only downside is the powder puff it comes with falls apart VERY easily. I bought my last compact just 3 weeks ago & its completely falling apart! But it's an easy fix because I just use my blush brush to apply it for touch ups. Just wish it came with a better quality puff. It's worth it though for the LOW PRICE! I just recommend tossing the puff & buying a better quality one that can be washed over & over or simply by using a powder/blush brush. Other than that I love this stuff!!
1,I bought this to cover a scar on my face.  It worked well for that purpose.  The reason I am giving it only three stars is that it is so thick that it feels like I have a foreign object glued to my face whenever I use it.  I realize that to completely cover a blemish of any type ther needs to be substance I just was hoping for something less pasty.
0,", sodium benzoate, benzyl benzoate, citronellol, fragrance (parfum). Fake fragrance and sodium benzoate.  Never understand why they sell this at whole foods and how it continues to pass as ""natural"".  I guess petroleum is natural, too.  Too bad they don't list the multiple chemicals that are in the ""parfum""."
0,"I got this to make my brown hair look darker.  It does look exactly like in the photo unfortunately.  It was way blacker than I was hoping for, it's a Jet Black.  I just hope it will fade away and be lighter over time.  I want to go lighter I think next time."
1,"I like Clean & Clear but I've never noticed any big changes from using this line. The cleanser is nice and tingly (a little, not much) and feels good but it's not anything terribly special. I have used it consistently only for a period of time and then stopped. I wanted to do the review and give it an honest rating and I'm afraid it didn't do what I was hoping it would do for me...."
1,"After buying Olay Regenerist Regenerating Serum Moisturizer at a local store, I found I liked it better than any other facial product.  It is not greasy, there is no fragrance that I can detect, and it easily allows a bit of makeup if desired.  EIght pumps of the bottle and that will cover my neck and face for the entire day.  For anyone who does not want heavy or expensive products, this is the one.  I like it so much that I added it to my recurring Amazon.com order list."
1,"I'm running low on my signature perfume, and I want to experiment with different fragrances but don't want to spend a crazy amount of money. Auric Blends perfume oils are perfect for this purpose. You may be able to find these at health food stores, wicca shops, even in a farmer's market; but the easiest place to find them is here. It's a bit of a gamble to buy things like fragrances online, especially if you don't get a chance to sample smells, but for $6 or $7 a bottle it's worth it. And if you don't like the smell, you can always give it to a friend.I bought Black Opium and Majik, and I really like both. Here's what they smell like:Black Opium- A floriental with touches of vanilla & patchouli, smells absolutely intoxicating, you can't go wrong trying it. It reminds me of a perfume my mom had, but I can't put my finger on it. It's gonna be one of my regulars. This is probably how Stevie Nicks smells--in a good way!Majik- A sweet woodsy, earthy smell with touches of amber & myrhh. When I first smelled it, it smelled kinda soapy, but on my skin it was sweet and a little spicy, with vague touches of cinnamon. It's not for everybody, some may consider it headshoppy, but it's a unique scent and I like it.Keep in mind that these scents will develop over the course of a few weeks, so give it a little time if you're not sure you like it. I love that these are quality, long-lasting perfume oils with no alcohol or chemicals. The packaging is also very convenient; a small and portable bottle, and the rollerball doesn't leak. These are great perfumes at a great price, and I look forward to trying more :)"
1,"I like this base coat. It does not leave your nails shiny. I like the natural, shiny look; so I purchased the top coat with this. I do not like the top coat as much. The base coat is strong, but it does take awhile to dry."
1,"I have horribly dry and sensitive skin that freaks out every time the seasons change. This year, as winter was arriving, has been the worst - too much unusual dry and cold weather. So, my face felt like it had been put through a meatgrinder (and kinda looked that way too - red, blotchy, flaky...). I have spent a small fortune on skincare over my 35 years - more in the last 10 as things have gotten progressively worse. I have tried all-natural solutions, expensive stuff, drugstore stuff...some work for a short while and then stop, some don't work at all. Some are great for sensitive, but don't do enough for dry - some are great for dry but sting when I put them on.Anyway - out of desperation this year, I thought I would try this (as well as the lotion). It has been WONDERFUL! My face looks better than it has in months - it is soothing and moisturizing, without being too heavy or leaving me with those crazy red bumps that some products are prone to. I have been using the combo for about a month, and so far have had no problems.I use it 2x a day, putting about a teaspoon on my face and massaging for a minute or two. I then wipe it off with a warm damp washcloth. I follow it with the lotion and I am good. At night, I just use extra.I can't say enough good things about this combo. I finally feel like my skin is reasonably ""normal"" - hopefully, this can be a keeper!"
1,"The quintessential red. Opi colors apply beautifully and are really glossy and gorgeous. Im happy with it, seems to be the genuine product"
1,"I only have to use this once every few months for maintenance.  Sometimes the seborrhea shows up on my nose or forehead, so I will wash those areas with this shampoo and it will heal it after a few days."
1,this is a gentle cleanser & i have oily skin - even at 51 yrs old!  the obagi system leaves my skin smoother and brighter
1,I purchased this based on the reviews but felt it was too heavy and greasy. I then switched to First Aid Beauty ultra repair and for the money this is a better buy and I had better results. I have oily skin and tend to break out with heavy creams which I think Olay is.
1,Great oil for nails. I have a hangnail problem and I use this a lot. It really helps to moisturize around my nails and fingers. I also use it on my hands and I drop some into my lotions also. It has great soothing ingredients. (vita E) Smells wonderful. The oil lasts along time and a little goes a long way too.
1,"Fluffy, fabulous, flawless brush. I use it for Bare Minerals.Sometimes a hair or two will free itself from the brush and get into my eye, but other than that it's perf."
1,"This scrub replaces the Neutrogena scrub that my daughter and I used. I bought the Neutrogena for myself and as she progressed into a tween she needed a scrub too. She didn't care for the smell of the Neutrogena but it did work very well. I had been buying the Aveeno acne pads for her and decided to get this for the night time routine. She loves the smell and the texture and I love the great price. It leaves a soft glow to her skin and her face never feels oily.This combined with the Aveeno pads, a daily moisturizer with SPF 15 UV protector in the morning, followed by this at night, seems to be doing the trick for keeping acne at bay and keeping her young face bright and healthy.Don't tell her but, dad is using it too now."
1,I love this polish! It's so beautiful and very long lasting! It's a bit more red than the picture shows but it's a must have!
1,"This body scrub is really good. It's a little on the pricey side but the lather makes a little bit go a long way. For an acne scrub, the lather is amazing, and the scent is not overpowering or harsh. It's a very light, neutral scent. After only about 4 days of use, I've noticed that tiny bumps on my neck, back, and shoulders are gone or nearly gone. I initially bought this scrub because I thought it would help clear up the marks my acne left behind so hopefully with continued use the acne scars will be less visible. The skin smoothing has been a welcomed surprised. I plan on using this scrub in conjunction with vitamin e oil so that my skin is completely clear of marks and blemishes.My only complaint is that it makes the skin on my back and shoulders a little dry, but nothing that a little moisturizing oil and lotion won't fix. I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for that though. If you have really sensitive or dry skin this may irritate. I would recommend a thick moisturizer or lotion after showering to alleviate this. I would recommend this product again."
1,This product is good.  I am natural and it leaves my hair soft and smooth. It has help my hair edges a lot. I will purchase it again
1,"I wanted a pinkish-coral blush for the days when I was wearing browns and fall colors.  This is a beautiful blush!  It truly IS a pinkish/coral..which is really hard to find.  A little goes a long way.  The pigment is rich and vibrant.  If you are looking for a fall blush, this is it.  6 stars!"
0,"I got a bad bottle. It didn't smell like it was supposed to, and dried down to a horrible waxy smell, like an unscented deodorant.It's irritating that Amazon won't let me return it!"
1,"None of the reviews here at the time of my purchase really answered what I wanted to know.  I'm reading about ""rough heels"" and thinking ""I think I need something more powerful than something that makes one's heels smooth.""Still, I was torn between this, the Diamancel #11 and the #20 callus device.  The ball of my foot has a major callus that I've tussled with all my adult life.  The #20 looked like it might be akin to a cheese shredder and I already have devices like that- they do work, but leave your skins ripply and ripped up looking.  Maybe #20 was not as unkind as that, but maybe the #11 would be quite enough.For those who want to cut to the chase, yes, this baby was able to work on a serious callus in pretty short order.  The UPS truck dropped it off and I literally sat right down and got to work with it.  Honestly, 5 minutes later and both calluses (the other on the outside of the foot, below the pinkie toe) were about halfway gone.  I can plainly see this works very quickly and will have these painful thick spots gone with a little more work, and leave my skin in much better shape.If you have a ball of the foot callus, you might want to read on below for more thoughts, but if you just want to know if this buffer will work on a terminal stage callus, the answer is heck yeah.- - - - - - - - - -The recurrent callus on the ball of my one foot is the result of a Morton's toe.  Not to bore you, but when you walk, the pressure gets transferred forward from your heel up to your big toe.  If that transfer doesn't happen correctly, you end up moving the pressure to the ball of the foot.  The foot then responds by building up dead skin, and mine gets thick quickly.  Left to its own devices, that callus would allow me to tap dance barefoot if it didn't hurt so much.  Since the transfer is sending pressure away from the big toe and outwards, I've also developed a callus on the outside of the foot below the little toe, like a little tripod balance.  Isn't nature wonderful?I have a freaking collection of files, rollers with blades, a flatter thing with a Solingen steel blade in it, a PediEgg, a knockoff of a PediEgg, acid laced callus discs and so on.  All have their merits and failings.  Most of the stuff files your skin, or acts like a cheese shredder.  For efficiency, the bladed items couldn't be beat.  Yes, the blades have cut me a few times, but they have been the go-to tool to cut off thick skin quickly.  Unfortunately the ball spot had gotten to the point where the skin was so smooth and hard that even the blades couldn't get ahold of anything, and slid right off.  That's why I turned to this ""buffer"" - which is an innocuous name for a file that works seriously well.If you get calluses on the ball of your foot, you might have a Morton's toe too.  A lot of places incorrectly say it's when your second toe (next to the big one) is longer than the big one, but this is wrong.  It's an internal thing that has to do with bone lengths and is not always visble.The ball of your foot hurts, so your instinct is to put padding where it hurts, as I did for a long time myself.  The answer actually is to put the padding NEXT to the callous - along the big toe down to the side of the ball of the foot.  Then that part of your foot hits the ground before the ball and takes the pressure in the right path.  I did this with thick moleskin and couldn't believe what a difference it made.  The thing is, it's easy to get lazy about doing this, as the moleskin gets wet with daily showering, doesn't stick properly, and is unsightly.  It's also expensive enough that you may not want to replace it daily.  I think the answer for me might be to get a full foot length insole and cut away most of the toe area, leaving just the big toe area down to aside of the ball, and shift it from shoe to shoe.Anyway, if that doesn't work well, no biggie, because this buffer is going to do a terrific job keeping the ball callus away.  Best wishes to fellow sufferers![If any issues arise regarding the longevity of the buffer, I'll come back and edit.]"
1,"I had bought Neutrogena eye makeup remover before and liked it very much. Since that time I triedtwo others, one with oil---never again with oil! and the ;other one not effective, so I came backto Neutrogena, and that's what I will stick with.  It works, removes all eye makeup and doesn'tirritate my eyes. I like Neutrogena products."
1,"For those of us with superbly dry skin, this stuff won't touch it. You'll HAVE to use an extra moisturizer with it to hydrate your skin.However, for the regenerating portion, it's quite outstanding. I've been using it on my face for quite some time but about a year-and-a-half ago, I had two moles removed on my upper arm and for some reason, they just wouldn't heal.  I've tried about everything and on a whim, I just put this stuff on them for the fun of it.  Well, not only did it start the healing process on the scars, it also got rid of a lifetime problem I've had with these little bumps on my arms.  Pretty awesome stuff, that's for sure!  In addition, I would think that it might work on pregnancy stretch marks too if it's able to mend scars.So, give it a try - who knows?  You might be surprised at what it can do for your skin!  Recommend!"
0,"I loved the idea of this curling brush, and the size. However, it just didn't get got enough to curl or allow a curl to stay for my 4A/B hair. I am 100% natural with very fine, dense, shoulder length hair, and wear my hair straight styled most of the time. Usually I use my SuperStar flat iron to curl by flipping the ends, it never causes damage or fries my hair and the the curls and style will last all day with those. I got this because I thought it would be a nice option and I could have curls more round and softer. Granted, I'm comparing a $100 flat iron to a $10 curling iron,, but I have used drugstore curling irons (e.g. Revlon) successfully too, and unfortunately, this product just didn't get hot enough to hold a style. On the highest heat setting, it felt like the temperature only got to about 285. I wouldn't recommend this if your hair prefers a professional level of heat (325-450) to hold a curl all day in very curly hair. I ended up donating mine to Goodwill after a week of failed attempts at styles. It would be nice if you could see the actual temperature the iron is heating up to instead of just number settings, but I guess for $10 I cant complain too much and am glad it works for others. :)"
1,"This is one of the best fragrances that has come in a while.Very fresh, refreshing, tangy and musculine smell. Easy on the senses.Highly recommended. It has even generated imitations by big names like Boss !"
1,I need this all the time to prevent my face from getting dry and  cracked.  I always use it many times a day and get good results.
1,"This perfume smells citrusy, more on the orange side, and a little sweet.However, this perfume is too simple for me. For example, J'adore is a sophisticated perfume with a hint of citrus, but this perfume is just orangy and sweet, which I liked when I was a mid-teenager (14-18) but not now.If you like a simple perfume that smells citrusy/orangy and a little sweet, then this is a good choice. If you'd rather have a sophisticated than a fun perfume, then I'd suggest J'adore, it is fresh, sophisticated, lady-like and with a hint of citrus."
1,"I wanted a regular moisturizing cream for men. Searched on Amazon and this was one of the recommended products. I like that it doesn't leave your skin oil. I am still pretty young, so didn't notice any difference in terms of anti-aging effects :P"
1,"I purchase a LOT of lotions and lavender is one of my favorite scents.  I'm picky about my lavender though.  I don't like fake smelling lavender.  I really really love L'Occitaine lavender lotion but the outrageous price keeps my from buying it regularly.  This lotion is almost just as good.  It's silky and smooth and absorbs nicely.  It's not a super heavy fragrance either, it's light and just right.  And this is a great price on Amazon!  I found the same lotion at Bartell Drug store for almost 3 times the price!"
1,"I do have good skin and take care of it exceptionally well.  This is a must go-to product for those times when my complexion needs some spot treatment.  Instantly reduces inflammation and redness, allowing the healing process to begin immediately.  Best price found on Amazon."
0,"This shampoo works as a cleanser, but it doesn't smell good, leaves my hair feeling dry with a very slight filminess that will likely build up over time. I will use it occasionally to purify my scalp with tea tree oil, but I will not use it very often."
1,I spray this in my damp hair or dry hair n then follow up with a moisturizer i cant tell if its doing anything or not.
1,"I chose this over the other Clean&Clear treatment because it also contains glycolic acid to fade marks. This isn't a bad formulation - its a clear gel that soaks in well. Burns a little bit going on, but nothing drastic. The smell is very overpowering for me and I wouldn't buy it again because its so loaded with perfume. But its not bad for a 2% salicylic acid product."
1,Yes my skin feels soft. I don't have wrinkle issues but I m using it as a preventative measure. I will not buy again.
1,"This sunblock provides great physical sun protection.  It is good for people who have normal or combination to oily skin.  It feels a little heavy on your face but not as gross or greasy as regular sunblock or sunscreen.  It actually provides decent coverage and evens out your skin tone quite nicely.  The concept of being able to adjust the color of the foundation is pretty cool.  I wish cosmetic companies would provide regular foundations with this concept.  The color is pretty neutral, neither warm nor cool toned.  I could see, however, that on darker skin tones it could possibly be a little ashy due to the mineral sunblock content."
1,"I have been using for about a month and I do like it.  The only downside would be feeling a slight dryness after using it, but I still like the product."
1,"I have to give this lotion five stars because it's the only body lotion that I've found is gentle enough to also use on my face and neck. I put it on at night and after showers, and it's kept my skin in great shape (no breaking out like I usually do from other body lotions). It's light but still moisturizing, and isn't like other body lotions that are heavy with scent or feel too thick to slather on your cheeks. This is my go-to lotion for everywhere: the gaps between your toes, behind your ears, and your elbows. It'll moisturize everything just the right amount.Be warned: there is a scent! It's not too strong, but if you prefer hypoallergenic lotions, this may not be for you.When I say it moisturizes everywhere, I mean to say it's a daily moisturizer. Don't expect this to heal your puffy eyes or hydrate your chapped winter skin."
1,"I like the big size bottle 6.7oz , but i dont know if i did get a fake item or not but the scent went away just in 2 hours.Plus the spray cap broke after a week."
1,I have used this cream for years and love the way it moisturizes my skin without leaving it feeling oily or greasy.
1,"I originally bought the lightest shade they had (Fair) and that was too dark, and I'm not even the palest person I know. If you have porcelain skin or are on the pale side, this makeup will be too dark on you!! Since I first bought Fair I've darkened a bit and now Fairly Light looks good on me. It seems though there is no in between. If you're not within a shade of any of these colors, the color will be too dark or too light. Now that I've found a color that matches my skin as best as it can, I do like wearing this product. It doesn't feel like I'm wearing a lot of makeup and doesn't cause my skin to breakout. I just bought my second jar and I can't wait to get it in!"
1,"I've seen a lot of people disappointed in this color. I however, completely love it!  It is NOT a pure white and some people seem to think that's what it was supposed to be (adjust your monitor settings).  It's a subtle off (extremely subtle off-white) and is the perfect accent color.  Even wearing this polish alone, it looks excellent! This is definitely not like other white polishes that look more like a gross, ""white-out"" color.  This is just a clean, gorgeous white!  The formula is excellent, maximum opacity in 2 coats using light, even strokes.  Love!"
1,"Every winter my hands get really chapped.  Even if I wear gloves.  They crack and bleed and are just not attractive.  Every year I try to find something that works.  I took a chance and bought this item.  It's amazing!  I put some on last night and immediately noticed that my knuckles weren't as tight and my skin was softer.  Applied a little more before bedtime.  This morning, my hands are silky smooth.  There's no cracking, no chapping and they look amazing!It is thick, and until it absorbs it leaves your hands feeling a little weird.  But it doesn't take long to absorb and that feeling goes away.  For the results, it's well worth it!I recommend this product to anyone who can't find anything that works."
1,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, and I know she'll love it.  The price was right, and I can't wait for her to open it."
1,"I bought this to add to my arsenal of natural oils that I use for my hair & skin. The conditioners you buy in stores have a minimal amount of the actual ingredient that will help moisturize your hair! For a fraction of what you pay for those high-end brand name &#34; deep conditioners  &#34;  , You can make your own. It's so easy!!  I use OLIVE OIL, GRAPE SEED OIL, AVOCADO OIL,  MACADAMIA NUT OIL, COCONUT OIL( a must!!)  & this APRICOT KERNEL OIL. You can add a teaspoon of ALL of these to get the MAX benefit or use 1-2 of your faves. Your hair will feel & look AMAZING!! No store bought product comes close !! Your hair will SOAK up the moisture & nutrients from the oils it needs & just RINSE ! Easy hah?  Now for a good PROTEIN treatment : Add 1 egg too your oil mixture , mix it in well. It will get stiff on your hair( it's suppose to!) just like those $expensive  &#34;protein pacs&#34;! After about an hour, rinse well in COOL TO WARM WATER, if you use HOT it will cook the egg & it's harder to rinse out!! But cool water & it's rinses right out- BUT, unlike those protein pacs where you need to buy or use a separate MOISTURIZER , the OILS TAKE CARE OF THAT IN 1step!!  If you just want the oil treatments- put some or all of the oils in your hair, saturate it good, I leave it over night but you can wash it out in an hour. You just rinse in warm water, but if you find your hair is still a bit oily, shampoo after the treatment- your hair has soaked up what it needs already. Air dry, blow dry, I put a small amount on my ends as a leave in ( any of them work well, olive oil is great!) . After you style your hair you will be amazed at how soft & shiny it is!!  These oils are NOT expensive & they come in BIG bottles to last awhile! Well worth it!The oils are also great to put on your skin after a shower! Coconut, apricot, fab moisturizers! & this one is a good one for your face ! No clogged pores!!  I use the olive oil to remove waterproof eye makeup, it wonderful & good for your eyelashes too!!Get NATURAL, or FOOD GRADE oil!! Some are in the grocery dept here. They are better & cheaper than oils with xtra &#34;junk&#34; in them! No alcohol, No silicones, no fillers, just pure oils!*IF YOU WOULDN'T PUT IT IN YOUR BODY, THEN DON'T PUT IN ON YOUR BODY!! :)Happy conditioning!!!  Jenn~"
1,without all the work.  At first I thought this was very blah.  It has grown on me and now is one of my favorites.  It lasts until I take it off.
1,"I bought this daily moisturizer along with the eye serum, face serum and and night cream.  I generally use Loreal daily moisturizer but figured I'd try all of the Olay Regenerist products.  The first thing I noticed is that Olay is thicker than Loreal.  The second thing is the fragrance.  Loreal has a nice, light lemony scent.  Olay's scent is much stronger and floral.  I've only been using it for about a week so I can't really judge the effects.  However, I am a little turned off by the scent.Update:  I've gotten used to the thickness and scent.  I think I still prefer the Loreal but this is a good everyday moisturizer.  I've definitely noticed an improvement in my skin since using the Regenerist line."
1,Love this Brown..it isn't red rather a softer look for mascara than full-on black.  I think it lookss more natural than black for daywear. Cheaper on site than the big box stores
1,"to use at night, after putting on lotion, does make my hands nice and moiste in the morning, however, one glove seems to always come off by the morning,but i till like them."
1,Feels great on my face. Love the smell. Not sure if it actually does anything for my face other than just create a calming effect for 15-20 minutes.
1,"This is, hands down, the best body lotion I've used.  I have extremely dry, very fair (w/ freckles) skin and have had a lifetime of being embarrassed over the skin bumps on my arms and legs that were bad enough to make me wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in the hot summer months.I started learning more about parabens potentially contributing to cancer (they've found parabens in the tumors removed from womens' breasts), among other things (I've gone organic/vegan wherever possible).  While there are other good, all natural lotions (Hugo's Naturals is great!), I am more than willing to give up the 100% natural ingredients to make Alba's Very Emollient Body Lotion, Maximum Dry Skin Formula w/ AHAs my go-to lotion for life.I have used PLENTY of lotions with AHAs and others that claim to be designed to heal skin bumps (there's a name for it that I can't think of, and if I could I wouldn't know how to spell it, and I don't want to look it up right now). I did not buy this lotion for my skin bump problem - I bought it because it was on sale, 100% vegetarian, and paraben-free.  Low and behold...skin bumps VANISHED within a week!!!  Not only is this a GREAT moisturizing lotion (I used to swear by Avon's Intense Moisture Therapy for skin moisturizing), it is light (but extremely effective), smells nice, and keeps my skin glowing and bump-free.I'm a customer for life.  Thanks Alba!UPDATE (1/8/12):  I bought the new, improved formula - twice.  The first time I purchased the new, improved forumla I found the lotion to be gritty.  I tossed the bottle without intending to ever try it again.  Recently I ordered another bottle on Amazon, hoping to be shipped someones leftover original formula supply, though I received the new, improved formula.  This time it wasn't at all gritty.I don't notice an awful smell or burning like some others who've posted reviews.  I also haven't had issues with my skin bumps returning, so I'm going to assume that the new and improved formula is just different.  It still seems to work fine, but I wouldn't consider it ""improved"".  It does seem, though, to be hit or miss regarding what you end up with.  Others have claimed ""faulty"" product, as did I with my first ""gritty"" bottle.  So, give it a try, but if you have sensitive skin try it on a small section for a few days first!With this update and because of the uncertainty of the product from bottle to bottle, I'm changing my rating from 5 to 3 stars.  It is now an average rather than awesome product."
1,"I'm just gonna cut to the chase:Pros:*do not cause headaches after 1-2 hours, though any longer and I do start to get headaches (i have a quite sensitive head though)*teeth on the sides keeps it in place all day*nice tortoise color*good price-------------------------Cons:*kind of cheap looking plastic*see ""pro tip"" #1"
1,I purchased this wig brush to help with detangling my wig. It is ok. It does not work any differently than the brush I was already using on my wigs.
1,Been using this non-stop and i guess this big big one is really value for money and able to save a bit on my pocket.

1,"it makes my skin so bright and smooth!! i love this product, I just wish it were in a larger oz bottle rather than having to order a bunch of small ones, but it does last quite a while if you don't use more than you need (like i tend to do)"
1,"very good ,I love it .It has great work to make face clear and soft,So I will buy it again ."
1,"This a wondrously heavenly sexy , light , aromatic scent.  I am rather smitten by Miss. Lopez. I simply adore her and I am very pleased with this perfume."
1,"Oh I so wanted to like these headbands, but... my head is too big.  But at this price, you can't go wrong because if you have a normal-sized noggin, you'll pay a small price for two nice headbands."
1,Love the feel and smell of it when you first open the bottle and with the cleanser and toner my face seems to be getting back to the ph level for nice skin. Highly recommend
1,"I purchased this Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle, Anti-Blemish Cleanser several weeks ago from Ulta for $6.95 shipped.  I LOVE this face cleanser.  I use it with theClarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System with Spot Therapy Kit, Whiteand have seen fabulous results (no miracles ... but definitely a clearer, smoother complexion).  I only use this cleanser every 2-3 days.  I alternate it with other Neutrogena cleansers so that I do not overdry my skin (especially as we are approaching winter).  So far, my skin looks much clearer and smoother.  I get those occasional blemishes in the T-zone area and this clears it up.  I have even noticed that my pores and those fine lines are less visible.  It even has a nice smell.  Overall, I'm very happy!"
1,When my favorite color for years was discontinued (don't you just hate that?) I turned to this one and just love it!  There is a perfect amount of &#34;pearl&#34; so your lips don't look flat and dry.  The consistence is nice and smooth.
1,"This oil smells smooth and it has a soothing affect for me ' A little bit goes a long way as well ' Great oil, I love it '"
0,"I've never gotten all the Philosohpy hype-it's overpriced cream, lotion, and other bath products. I got this as a sample with an online order at Sephora. It's terrible. It's runny not thick like other creams I'm used to. Maybe it's me but when I use lotion I like a creamy texture that soothes my face not something that's running down it. The smell is...weird. It's neither pleasant or unpleasant, it's just odd. And seemed to seep into the blanket I use when I sleep. Not to mention when I woke up I expected a moisturized face-another downfall of this product. This lotion did absolutely nothing for my dry skin. And what does 99% oil-free even mean (description on Sephora website)? Either it has oil or it doesn't. And I'm a 100% oil-free only kinda gal. My $6 night of olay jar does a better job in all areas mentioned above. Also, the purity cleanser by Philosophy is crap too. I also got that as a sample and had to use a TON to get it to lather. When I wash my face I like to see the soap/cleanser. It also left my face still feeling oily-like it wasn't fully clean. I'll stick to Cetaphil which is way cheaper, gentle, and cleans thoroughly."
1,"It was a little smaller than I expected, but that was okay because it lasted me for a long time. I think it does great coverage for the price I paid. It is heavy, and wears off within 30-1hr. It kinda dries your skin. I'd recommend it to people who are just looking for a cheap coverage, or beginners who are just learning to conceal."
1,"After washing, toner feels like it is the topper, takes the last of the skin and cleans it up, then proceeding to the next step your face feels refreshed and ready for the day"
1,"I bought it as a gift for my gf in Beijing.  The dusty polluted air there is tough on people with oil skin.  3 times a day and her complexion started clearing up.  It also worked great as a hand soap.  I poured it in an empty Aveeno Foaming Face Wash dispenser, and was quite satisified with the outcome.There is no substitute for proper diet and rest to treat your acne, but if you you want a nice smelling organic wash that cleans without over drying, give this one a try."
1,"Just as it states on the tube, you'll get need a dab. My hands go from dry and stiff to moist, smooth, and gorgeous. This is a get stocking stuffer."
1,"this shampoo is awesome, but it leaves my hair a little dry. I have to use wen as a conditioner after."
1,"I was lucky to get 2 tubes of this at an outlet store on sale for $15 (The ones that carry Lancome, Lauren, etc) and did not realize YSL was part of the L'Oreal corporate umbrella.  I had been using Chanel for years and pciked this up due to the price.  Love it.  Goes on  thinly enough that I could apply two coats.  My lashes were soft and naturel looking - and no flakes!  Wish I had bought more."
1,"After reading all of the encouraging reviews, I bought this.  I use it everyday on my chest and back of hands.  The difference it's made to the texture of my skin is wonderful.  I use it on my face and neck once a week, it's strong - which is good.  It works!  Great purchase!"
1,"I was using regular antibacterial soaps and my hands were always dry and chapped and cracked until my dermatologist recommended using Cetaphil products and changing detergents (free and clear), changing creams (sensitive skin and fragrance free only). Now, my hands are clean and moisturized. This soap (and Cetaphil products for that matter) are awesome! You'll notice the difference right away."
1,I adore this color. Fabulous neutral color if you're sick of the regular sheer pinks/light colors like i was. and since i work in an office i have to keep nail polish neutral. This adds color without feeling too boring.
1,"I used to use the Andrea EyeQ remover pads or the Almay remover pads which never got my waterproof mascara off all the way. I always ended up with black under my eye the next morning. This formula completely gets rid of ALL my makeup (and I use quite a bit). It does not irritate my skin, or my eyes. It does leave a slight residue but nothing that doesn't get taken care of when I wash my face. The only downside is you have to buy pads or cotton balls, doesn't come in a convenient pad form, but not a big deal to me since it works so well."
1,"I do like this for a body sponge, however, its hard to get all the excess soap out of it. Other than that it leaves my skin feeling soft."
1,"I'm 35 years old (soon to be 36) and I generally stay out of the sun, so I don't have to worry about wrinkles yet!  However, I'd like to KEEP my skin looking youthful, and I know that I do get some sun exposure just from doing everyday things like walking the dog or driving to work.  Also, several older relatives (70s and 80s) have had a basal cell skin cancer on their faces.  I figure if I start working on prevention NOW, when I reach that age, I'll be less likely to develop the same problem.Furthermore, I've been using some rather harsh salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide treatments lately, and these are drying to my skin.  Ideally, I wanted a moisturizer with some sun protection that could also help keep my skin from drying out.  This moisturizer was a quick (i.e., without any research), off-the-shelf purchase at a local drugstore.  I have not used any Olay products in the past.This product seems to be doing an excellent job, so far.  While I can't predict what will happen in 5 or 10 years, I'm very happy with the day-to-day benefits of using this moisturizer.  I put this on in the morning before going to work and wash my face again about 10 hours later.  During that time, my face does not look oily at all.  Further, I have sensitive skin and I don't notice any redness or irritation.  Also, this product does not have a fragrance to it (fragrances are particularly irritating to my skin).  So it truly is good for MY sensitive skin.One problem I have often had in the past due to dry skin is that when I dye my hair, the dye gets sucked into my skin and leaves purple stains on my forehead (I have a pale complexion and I dye my hair black).  I end up looking ridiculous for a couple of days.  I've had one hair appointment so far since I started using this moisturizer, and my skin is much less dry -- few to no purple stains on my forehead this time!I also think my skin is pretty soft since I've been using this, and I have not had any additional or unusual breakouts (the package says it is non-comedogenic), so that's nice, as well.  For what it's worth, it's easy to put on makeup (i.e., foundation) after applying this moisturizer.  Finally, you should know that a little goes a long way -- it really does not take much to get full coverage of your face; I expect the bottle to last a long time.Wow, I don't normally gush about skincare products this much.  I guess this is one of those rare cases when I really can't think of anything I don't like about the product.  At any rate, I'd definitely recommend this moisturizer."
1,"This is the best. I am a fanatic about my skin. I am also a fan of La Mer and gladly spend the $130 per jar, but I think of that as a true moisturizer and not really corrective. With this ROC deep wrinkle daily moisturizer you get visible results with religious use. (Of course, the idea that you can fix a deep wrinkle is stupid, so if you are 28 - 35 and thinking you need to take charge of your skin, buy this now. You need to start preventing the worst wrinkles with this, and not try to solve it later.) The tube is small, but you don't need to use a lot to get good coverage. I think it's actually quite a good value. I use it on my face, hands, neck and chest - where damage occurs - and for the rest of my body, I use Lubriderm which is cheap and effective. I just wish Amazon could keep this in stock. My local drugstore is also often out of stock. This stuff must have a cult-like following."
1,"I'm a huge fan of witch hazel, and I like the simple and basic ingredients in this brand. The alcohol content isn't too much for my skin, and it works super well as a toner and cleaner. I use it after washing off make up and it keeps me fresh!"
1,"This really is a good hair dryer, it gets very hot which I love and dries the hair quickly.  I have long hair and it didn't take me long at all to dry it.  The dryer itself is pretty heavy but that was not a problem for me, to others it may be though.  The reason I gave this product a 3 is because I bought it on Sept 4 2010 and finally just had to replace it about 2 months ago because it started to make the most god awful noise when I would use it, I can only describe the noise as slowly murdering a cat behind the engine of a plane.  I do like conair products and it was definitely a good dryer and lasted me for quite a while."
0,Products was a disappointment. I've used tar soap in the past for my skin care. This did not work at all. Guess you can't return a half used bar of tar.
0,"I have used it a couple of times, and it makes my hair look dull. I'll probably end up throwing it out."
1,"I love this mascara for several reasons.  First, it doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes.  I use mascara to emphasize my eyes--I don't want red, irritated eyes!  It also goes on clump free and makes my lashes look thick and natural.  Finally, it doesn't flake off, leaving me with raccoon eyes after a few hours.  It's getting harder to find...I hope it doesn't become discontinued!"
1,"I'm usually a huge OPI fan, but I was disappointed with the color after applying it on my nails. I was expecting a more matte finish, but it ended up being a berry color with shimmer. I recently found OPI's Big Red Apple, which turned out to be much better!"
1,This toner smells like clean roses and feels wonderfully refreshing on the face. I use this every morning and the bottle will last me a long time. I love it because it doesn't have any alcohol in it. I plan to repurchase after I run out.
1,"It's a very rich, deep purple that is glittery without being too bright in the light. I absolutely love the color; it's playful, eccentric, and cute without being too cutesy girly."
1,"This was my second purchase of the Caruso steam hair curlers system.  My hair is fine and lacks body and the steam curlers set the curl which lasts a couple of days.  The only thing that I'd like to see is that they allow you to pick the size rollers you order with your system because the jumbo rollers are good for long hair and my hair is not long so they are unused.  The system is sent with a pre-set number of rollers and sizes, some of which you cannot use.  People with long hair can't use the smaller rollers, short hair can't use the jumbo rollers.  Other than that, it's a good system and worth the money.  I would order online because at the local beauty stores the prices are higher."
1,I got this for a friend and he seems to like the way the soap works. It does smell but he said  it is working slowly. The service from the seller was super good and fast
1,This is the only lotion that helps with my dry itchy skin.  I don't believe that I could live without it!
1,"This powder reduces oil build-up somewhat well. Other than that it's got no use. 0 coverage, and looks somewhat cakey after used more than 2x during the day to absorb oil from my forehead and nose areas. It smells slightly strange, too."
1,"I've been using this file for the past 10+ years.  I would never use another emory board on my fingernails.  This files your nails down and doesn't file away the length away.  It's a magical life saver.  And you will notice the first time that you use it your nail will sprout out and your will see the whites.  I leave one of these files everywhere:  in my purse, in my bathroom, in my bedroom, in my work locker, everywhere..."
1,"It is all right if you sift it a few times, but it isn't as blendable as per say Henna Hut in Brown!"
1,Very convenient to shop for colors andline and not have to suffer through price gouging at the beauty stores. Fresh quality too.
1,"not recommend to sensitive eyes,i prefer those Japaness brands.there is no controlling cap on top,very likely to pour out too much liquid."
1,"This is my favorite Essie color right now.  It's more of a pinkish plum and looks great on toes.  I also use it on my hands occasionally and I like how variable the color is.  It reads red in darker places, hot pink in bright sunlight, and a sophisticated plum in medium light.  I chose it while getting my nails done and liked it so much, I bought a bottle.  I tend to only like true reds with blue undertones, magenta for toes, and maybe in the winter a really nice gloss black for toes.  If you're someone who likes a lot of pinks and pinkish-reds and nudes (like my mother) you may not like this color."
1,"I love that the bowl looks so nice on the counter. It holds the soap well. We bought Williams mug soap.  It looks well made, not cheap. Very happy with the purchase."
0,I am very disatisified with this product.  It comes on thick and chalky and did not leave my skin moisturized.  I would not recommend this product.
1,"I find that these q-tips are helpful when trying to be as accurate as possible with makeup application. One end of the q-tip is pointed to help create straight lines on your eyes, while the other is flatter and larger for removing makeup from bigger areas."
1,Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerationg Serum works great on my skin. I have been using this product for over 2 years and I would recommend it. Thank you.
1,"I bought this iron as an impulse purchase one late night a year and a half ago.  I wanted to get the Sedu Revolution but couldn't justify paying over $100 for a 1 inch flat iron when my Chi still worked well.  So I bought this (cheaper and smaller) iron instead.I'm black with a relaxer.  I also stretch my relaxer to over 12 plus weeks.  As you can imagine, that's A LOT of new growth.  I rollerset my hair every week, then will hit the roots only with my Solia.  It leaves my roots straight and very shiny.This little irons works just as well my Chi Turbo (without the problem of the felt wearing off and it being hot to the touch) and better than my maxiglide (which was a waste of money), my t3 wet or dry (even more of waste of money, i gave it away) and my FHI Platform (which is probably my second favorite iron after the Solia).Definitely recommend."
1,"I'm a product junky. When I'm not wanting to wear heavy makeup, I put on some BB cream and some powder. This looks pretty natural, not cakey at all, but has a bit more coverage than the ones I'm used to. I have sensitive skin, and this causes no issues. I ordered in Ivory, and my face is not pale white, it definitely has color. The color in the pictures is very true to the actual product. I would definitely reorder this."
1,"My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant 6years and I happened to come across some TTC blogs where people mentioned their doctors perscribing them progesterone to balance hormones. I decided to find out if I could buy it otc and came across this cream on amazon. I must say that I love how calm it makes me feel. I mistakenly used it one day before my ovulation and it spiked my temperature, which lets me know that it does work. The next day I didn't use it and my temp returned to normal. I haven't gotten pregnant yet but my cycles have returned to a consistant schedule starting on the same day each month. I can't say that my cramping is any less as I do still take aleve upon my cycle return. However. I've only been using it for 2 months, so hopefully we will see the results we're looking for soon:)"
1,"I work in Afghanistan and had a hard time keeping any time of make-up on in the summers because of the heat.  I would sweat it off immediately.  I got this in the hopes of it staying on a little better, giving me some protection from the sun and being able to reapply through the day without it looking like I just added another layer of foundation.  This is pretty much a very light foundation.  I don't think it moisturized my face at all and it didn't cover any red spots or blemishes.  I was disappointed because I normally love Aveeno products."
1,I like for the band to sit just above my hairline and cover my ears but by the time I am finished washing my face the band has slipped back and my hair next to my ears is exposed and wet.
1,"I am originally from Wisconsin, so I'm used to dry, cold weather.  However, I have lived in Texas for the last 3 years and my hands have never been as dry as they are right now.  My knuckles are red and flaky.  I have an office job, so my hands are not even in water a lot, but they are extremely dry and wrinkly.  I have tried jojoba oil and it helped better than regular lotion, but still not what I was looking for.  I came across this and love that it is organic and it works better than anything I have found yet.  My hands are still a bit rough, but nothing like they were before.  It does have a slightly funky smell---smells like pepto to me---but definitely worth it."
1,"This product works well for a regular facial wash. I do not suffer from acne but I do have combo skin, that has been leaning on the dry side lately. I used this every day, one bottle lasted a while. It is one of the better products I've used. I only have an issue or two. One is that it smells strange. It's supposed to be a natural product, so there are no dyes or perfumes (not the issue). Another issue I had is that it made my face awesomely dry.I owned a set so I immediately had to follow up with the Aloe toner; if I didn't my dry spots would flake.  I followed up with moisturizer (night time cream) that I used for both the day and evening. Overall, I feel the brand is average and while my skin had no irritations, I don't feel there was any huge improvement in the overall appearance of my skin."
1,I love this powder. I have been using it for a couple of years now. I use it because my face is a little oily. It controls the oil pretty good.
1,"The label on the box said ""Deep Bronzed Brown."" I love anything bronze; it looks great against my yellow toned fair skin (although, there is some red creeping in there).I've been coloring my own hair for a number of years. When I used to lighten it, I went to a pro. But now that I am merely adding or slightly adjusting my own shade, there are too many products available that do as well, if not better than salon results I've had.Even so, I used to sometimes pick a shade that looked great on the box, but then turned too dark for my tastes. My hair is naturally darkish medium brown. I'd tried some brownish red shades recently - and finally decided that those were not for me.I didn't, however, want a flat, mousy brown color. I wanted it to look natural, with some highlights. When I saw the L'Oreal Feria #45 French Roast / Deep Bronzed Brown and fell in love with the color - I still wondered -- will it even look close to that on me? I stood in the aisle for quite some time, weighing the odds. Staring at those little color boxes. Then I decided to take the plunge!When it was time to rinse the color out, I was nervous about what it would look like. Would it be flat and dark? So I decided that since the light in my bathroom always makes my hair look darker than it is - I would quickly turbin wrap my head and NOT look at it until I could see it in the window where more natural light pours in.  I did sneak a peak, just at the top of my head.... and I liked what I saw!I ran with a hand mirror to the kitchen, the only place in this depressing little apt. (that I will soon be leaving, thank God) to get a good look. I almost could not believe my eyes. It looked JUST LIKE the box, highlights and all!I could not be happier with my results from this product. So much so, that I will point L'Oreal to this review. They deserve to know how I happy I am. And so do you, which is why I am writing this.I cannot attest to whether it will look the same on you - but I should tell you about my hair. It is extremely fine, but there is a lot of it. In fact, hairdressers used to be shocked at how thinned out it looked wet. I have very little gray, so much so that I can go for months without coloring if I want. But I like to refresh the color every month, in any case. And I do not wash my hair every day. More like 3-4 or even (gasp!) an entire week, in winter.My skin tone is fair-medium with yellow undertones that often appear reddish. My eyes are an amber brown.So -- I can honestly say that this is one of the best hair color products I have ever used. And I have practically used them all! I would say, if you like this color. Go ahead and try it. You probably will not be disappointed -- in fact, more like delighted!"
1,This works great but is kind of heavy on the toxins/chemicals. But for very dry feet it really helps a lot
0,"I have thick, course, asian/caucasian hair.  My hair got stuck in the bristles and it was a total nightmare. I will just use for the bangs where my layers are shorter. Not for long thick hair- atleast did not work for me."
1,"i orderd 4  at first,then i think  few more,Did you know.. im 60 years old & been wearing these from day one?  YEP !!!!!they stayed on getting me threw a divorce crying,there Water proof for sure  LOLThese are the best.i can't remember the year they came out,but i tell ya,  i was almost the first one to try it out & loved it & nothing eles since then !!i suppose theres others out there,but AGAIN, have to look & buy & try it out  GrrrrThese Im buying should last  Ummmm  Hopefully a year?kinda doubt  it as i wear make up every single day,i have to fill in my brows  as i used to shave them years ago  haaathey don't look to bad now,  LOLits just im used to USING  Eye liners for a great Look !!Why in the world r they leaving  ?"
1,"This stuff smells awesome and gets my dog feeling great after her bath! I love the way it makes her fur feel. I know there are some concerns about it having &#34;suspicious&#34; ingredients in it despite it's claim to be all natural, but I looked up all the ingredients in it on my favorite site, paula's choice, and the ingredients in question are mild and gentle and can be derived from natural sources so I felt fine with buying it for my dog. Her skin has not had any bad reactions to it and it really does clean and condition her coat well."
1,"I've has this lipstick for such a long time, and you cant find it in stores anymore :(. I don't use this by itself, I use it for a perfect ombre lip. I take any lip liner and outline my lips, and hen fill in the sides. Then I take this lipstick and put it on the center of my pout. Then I smush them together, and I have a nicely faded ombre lip. I get compliments every time. I have found that my ombre lip works BESTEST ;) with this lipstick. I've tried it with mac ones and its never as good! This lipstick is a staple in  my collection. Very quick shipping !"
1,"This is a must have for all bathrooms. When i moved into my new house, i had one of these already there in the bathroom. I liked it so much i decided to buy another one for my second bathroom. I didn't think i could find the exact one but i was wrong. Amazon has everything.The quality is great, the dispensers work flawlessly and attaching it to the wall is very easy. Inside the dispenser there is two good size containers. It comes with all sorts of stickers: shampoo, soap, conditionar, lotion, etc. IT is very handy. Its annoying to squeeze shampoo and conditionar from a bottle."
1,When I mean okay it's okay it's nothing special I love st.ives way better it would be really good if you don't like a harsh scrub this is very little beads
1,I have very fair oily skin.  This is everything I need... not cakey at all and gives me a great matte finish! Best of all it is super affordable!
0,"I didn't notice any difference with my hair but my nails did grow significantly faster and looked 10 times healthier. I'm a bit disappointed because I was looking to strengthen and shine my hair, not grow my nails.Thankfully, there were no side effects. I do think it's ridiculous to expect people to take 8 pills a day. With the lack of research, I was then too worried to take my actual vitamins, other supplements, or painkillers on top of the 8 pills."
1,I have been using this now for around a month and have seen a difference. It isn't drastic but my skin has gotten clearer. The pads work and don't dry you out. The price isn't bad and they don't smell too funky. All good in my book.
1,"I love this product.  It is working.  I have used other progesterone creams and have had great results too.  After some research I decided on this one.  It has a great and long standing reputation.  It is paraben and soy free.First--because of my experience with other products, I thought I knew what I was doing.  I hadn't been using any progesterone cream in a while and was definitely feeling the effects of too much estrogen and packing on some weight.  It was time to get back on the bus.  I wasn't surprised by the sore breasts and sleepiness at first.  It takes  a while to balance out the estrogens that have run amuck. HOWEVER, I was using waaay too much of this cream initially. My other creams were like two tablespoons or something and were kind of watery in appearance.  This one is a very thick cream and it rubs in completely without a slimy feeling. It takes some effort to rub it in entirely.  The tube prescribes a dime sized amount.  My other creams took so much more that I misjudged this cream.  I probably used a silver dollar sized amount for the first two weeks.  Man, the impacts were noticeable.  The expected ""randiness"" was stronger than ever.  The erotic dreams became almost nightly.  Not bad side effects, but tough on the single girl.  The men around me commented that I looked as though I might snap them in half.  It is funny how our primal instincts protect us...I suggest getting the single-use packages at first so you won't make the same mistake.  It really is a tiny amount.  And MORE is not always better.  It isn't terribly dangerous to use too much now and then; your body has a way of regulating some of those errors with ease.  But the point of this product is to balance your hormones.  Using the little packages helped me get used to how much is reasonable.  Now I have moved back to the tube.  The tube lasts a LONG time when not used like an after-bath-splash.When I first  start progesterone creams, they make my boobs sore...as mentioned, and they almost immediately lengthen my monthly cycle between periods.  (I have a luteal phase defect, so this is good).  They also initially make me feel insanely ""friendly"" toward the opposite sex.  All of those things level off over time.  Now I have started dropping the little pudge I had acquired...and the sex drive is back to normal so the neighborhood men no longer clutch their robes tight and run back indoors when they see me looking at them.Talk to your doctor.  Get your saliva tested.  After you've decided that bio-identicals is the best option for you, I suggest this cream highly."
1,"I wear Urban Decay 24/7 eyeliner and Diorshow Iconic Mascara, so basically an eyeliner and a mascara that are very long-lasting and hard to take off. Before I bought this, I used to just let the shower get rid of my makeup and then scrub at my eyes with a lotion napkin to get rid of the remaining stuff. That was pretty painful and definitely not good for my eyes.This stuff is pretty good so far. I use about 3 cotton balls for each eye, so 6 in total. I use the first to get the majority of the makeup off, and then the last 2 to get any remaining makeup off. My makeup comes off easily with this so I'm really happy so far with this product and will most likely keep with it"
1,This color is gorgeous for the summer/spring. Its the most beautiful coral and i receive tons of complement every time i have it on! Definitely a must have.
1,"Super for easy quick root touch-ups.  Leave on hair just 25 minutes.  No mixing.  No need to toss unused product in the trash, so it's a good money saver.  Easy to apply.  Kinder to your hair than peroxide products (but will not bleach your hair to a lighter shade).  Lasts a long, long time on my hair so I seldom do my whole head of hair.  Blends in just fine for root applications.  It's a winner all the way."
1,Doesn't completely cover my hair. Works well to keep hair out of shower or protect from dirt outside. Might do better if the closure were velcro and not a button.
0,"I've come to the conclusion if the product is advertised as Anti-Wrinkle it ain't going to work and more than likelydo nothing but lay on your skin like a mast.Olay Regenerist  is the same way it actually feels like heat on your skin.  This one doesnt feel like that, it just feels like you are wearing a mask and the pores in your face are clogged.After seeing the horrors of plastic surgery and the Contour debacle where threads are inserted into your skin to pull the face up... frankly just face the fact your never going to look like your were even in your 40's.Time and nature will have their way with you.  Matter of a fact if wrinkles are all you have got, be glad there are so many ills and deseases to confront you as you make this short journey in your life, just be yourself."
1,"Bare Escentuals carries nice brushes.  I bought this one to replace one that was gooed up in our move (you don't want to know).  Otherwise, I have kept these brushes for years and years.  A side note: their brush cleansing gel has helped keep them in top condition all this time...one bottle lasts and lasts."
1,"Whenever I need an emotional pick-me-up I turn to Philosophy's line of feminine, light, perfect scents.  Whether it is the ""Amazing Grace"", ""Pure Grace"", ""Inner Grace"" or the ""Unconditional Love"" line using them always makes my spirits rise, the day seem brighter.This is a portion of a gift to a very special friend. Working with her these past 22 years has been an amazing journey and a privilege.  I hope she experiences many wonderful days as she explores the world of retirement.  How could she not?  She will be wearing this delicate, delightful scent.Enjoy the product!"
1,"I usually use Egyptian Musk by Foxcraft; in my opinion they make the BEST EMusk.  I'm no stranger to oils, I have tried many, and no stranger to Auric Blends, and I like their EMusk as well.  I couldn't remember if I'd ever tried Amber Butter or Amber oil, and decided to buy this product because of the glowing reviews.  I am not sorry!  While it's true the pot is small, and you don't seem to get a lot of butter, it is strong, so you only need to rub a bit on your finger then onto your pulse points.  If you don't know what Amber smells like I'll try to describe it.  The first notes to this scent are deep woodsy vanilla-ish, almost pungent.  When that fades you're left with a soft sweet musky woodsy scent.  That mights sound really odd, but I hope it helps a little.  If you like oils, and you like musky or woody scents you should give this a try.  :)"
1,"Never used this brand before, but as I begin to try more organic beauty products, this one stands out as superb!"
1,I hope they never stop selling this acne medication because it is the best and is great under make-up to control the oil... scrub is amazing too!!!
1,"This lotion is 6 oz that contains 10% glycolic acid. You do not need that much when you apply this lotion so it will last a long time, plus with the continuous skin exfoliation my skin has been so much softer."
1,"Goes on smooth and not at all oily. Especially good for around the eyes, hitting the crows feet. Reasonably priced, effective product. A little bit goes a long way."
1,I really believe that this product works and have bought here multiple times now. Good price for a great product that I believe in!
0,"I've been looking for a soap to clear my breakouts and this one was kind of a disappointment. I used it on my body and my face, and didn't get the results I was hoping for at all. It wasn't the worst soap I've tried, but it's low on the list."
1,Scent was a bit too strong for me. Very moisturizing though. I would buy camille beckman lotions again just not this particular scent.
1,"This hand cream was created for use by Norwegian fishermen working in the North Atlantic.  There is nothing glamorous about it. It doesn't have pretty packaging, there is no pretty fragrance, it tends to be a little slow to absorb and it is gooey if you get  too much on.  However...it is hands down, without a doubt, the hand cream that produces the best results over any other, in my opinion.  I use it at night (I use a more easily absorbed cream during the day) and the next morning my hands are kitten-soft and incredibly smooth.  Not surprising.  After all, if it can help those fishermen braving the icey waters of the North Atlantic, think what it can do with our hands!"
1,"it's just a normal moisturizer, nothing special. But what can you expect when you pay around $5. It gives you a sun protection which is the Best."
1,"It conditions nicely and has a great smell. Once the horse has dried, the tangles don't come back right away."
1,"so I love the convenience of finding them on Amazon at a good price.  I had been using Golden Blonde for years - but it started turning my hair a brassy color.  I used this and it removed the red cast to my hair and left it shiny.  It is lighter than Golden Blonde, but a good summer color.  I will buy again."
1,"I have to say this is my second Auric Blends scent purchase and I am now addicted. For only $7 and you get an amazing smelling, totally unique perfume oil that lasts all day?? Where can you go wrong?! This one smells very sweet, like flowers and a sweet ball of cotton candy, while you're being hugged by a maternal figure (if that had a scent!) Not my favorite scent, but still amazing and long lasting! Xxx"
1,I like this toner.  It doesn't dry my face out.  Other than that it does noting else for me.  It supposedly restores the pH of my face.  Why the pH of my face is important I don't know.  I probably won't buy again.
1,"This is a wonderful hand cream. I am a nurse who washes my hands at least 50 times a shift. My hands have gotten super dry and uncomfortable. I have been faithfully using this hand cream at night and have noticed a great improvement in my hands. Definitely improves dry, cracked hands."
1,"Works well. I have seen a change in my complextion. I would get ingrown hairs, and the product seems to keep them under control, as well as keeping my pores clean."
1,"This product works well, i have noticed a difference with the lines around my mouth, they are not as noticeable as they were."
1,"Have used Obagi line for years and love it.  Cleanser is the best ever.  Highly concentrated so you use a tiny bit ... lasts a long time, deep cleans without being harsh."
1,"This hand cream is just the best out there. My father has faithfully used it for decades. I rarely needed it until my mid-20s, but when my hands are dry it follows true to its motto, &#34;Just a dab heals dry skin.&#34;The consistency is, at first, something like vaseline. You expect it to be oily and slick. Rub your hands together for about 10 seconds, though, and they feel baby-soft with no residue. It's borderline-magical. It also works for me on elbows and any dry patch of skin. I wish there were versions of this for feet and face, though; it doesn't apply as well to those areas. Cracked heels and breakouts will have to find another cure.Still, this is the only brand of lotion I have ever bought twice. You should put it at the top of your list to try if you have dry hands."
1,"I have extremely dry skin...if I scratch my face in certain areas, like around my nose, skin flakes off, it's so dry. So of course I've tried every kind of moisturizer out there. This has worked the best for me. You only need a littlebit, I put it on and my face stays moisturized all day without my skin soaking it up and drying right back out. But it's definitely only for dry skin. Other people will say its greasy, but if your skin is truly dry like mine, It'll soak it right up and stay moisturized and it won't look greasy."
1,This piece piece is great. You absolutely need it for a great and healthy skin. j k k k k
1,"I switched to henna in order to stop damaging my hair with the mainstream hair colors produced by L'Oreal, Clairol, Revlon, etc.  The henna route is a little more messy and time consuming but it gets the job done.  For my gray hairs at the temple, I find I have to re process very soon after I have done my whole head.  However, I feel compensated by the fact that I am not damaging my hair.  I have African American hair and it is very fine."
0,"I chose to get the Egyptian Goddess since it seemed to have good reviews but I must have an extremely different idea of what good smells like. I opened it and without smelling it first just rolled a little bit on my arm, I smelled like an old lady all day (no offense intended). Right after I put it on this really sexy guy I work with walks in and says it smells weird in here what is that!? I showed him the scent and the disgust on his face said it all lol. Then of course I figured it'll fade soon enough but no I could smell it for hours so I said screw this I need to wash my wrists. Even then I could kind of smell it and I don't have smelling like a dog it was just that bad. When I got home that night I had my grandma and mom see of they liked it and the look on their face was priceless haha, I need to send this crap back. Otherwise its one of those gifts you give out for xmas to someone you don't exactly like."
1,"This is my new Spring/Summer color.  I found it at a Nail Salon when I was on vacation. Since my home salon didn't have it, I ordered a bottle to take in.  I found it's nice having the bottle at home for touch-up.OPI has the most unique names for there colors.  It took me the longest time to catch the play on words.  Beautiful nails and brain challenge all in one!"
1,"After I came to America, I'd tried different brands of shampoos and conditioners, which deeply harm my hair.I was thinking I have to bought shampoos and conditioners from my home country. However, I tried this conditioner one year ago. It surprisingly works so well for me! It is so smooth and smells great. I love it!!"
1,Although this says that this item is a Curling combo I use this to straighten my hair. I find that straighteners pull my hair out and cause it to be flat and lifeless and times.  However I find that when I use this to straighten my hair I am able to have more body and volume.  I found it easy to use and it did what I wanted it to do!
1,I got the 32 oz. bottle around 3 months ago and I've barely made a dent in this thing. It's concentrated so I just dilute it with a little water and get a perfect lather. It really smells like almond and my sensitive skin has no bad reactions whatsoever which is exactly what I'd hoped. Reading the label is amusing too. I highly recommend this soap for people with sensitive skin and / or who want to avoid unnecessary chemicals found in more mainstream cleansers.
1,I broke me out horribly and my skin became very sensitive after a week... And i didnt have much acne to start with I just wanted to clear some pimples i occasionally get due to stress but i didnt react well w this
1,This is a great product at a great price.  Hopefully it will be back in stock soon.  We use it in place of soap to wash in the shower.  Leaves no soap scum and works just great.  It's also wonderful as a shampoo from time to time to clarify hair (it's original use).
1,No perfume smell or irritant to scalp. Hair feels clean and not weighted down from conditioning. Very happy with this product and will continue to use.
1,"Finally, I found something that words nicely on my skin, keeps it soft aftercleansing and works on those stubborn blackheads. This works great, and althoughit is more expensive than some facial cleansers, I would recommend it to anyone who is wantingto hone in on those problem areas."
1,This brush is amazing! I can now blow dry my hair at home and it looks as if I paid 100$ to do at a salon! Highly recommended and blow drying became so much less frustrating and faster with this hair brush. One thing though the little spikes are hard so it will take you a few times to get used to it if you had a soft brush before like I did! But soooo worth it!
1,"This has to be one of the best mascaras I have ever tried (and I've tried many!).  My lashes are both thin and short, and I've found that this mascara adds plenty of fullness AND a bit of length, too.  Plus, there are absolutely NO CLUMPS when I use this mascara; the unique brush deposits just the right amount of product on my lashes, unlike other products that claim to be ""clump-free.""  I've tried both the regular and the waterproof versions of this mascara; I prefer the latter, as it stays on great yet washes off easily.  The only thing that I think could make this product better would be a curling brush to give the lashes a bit more lift.  Although Full 'N Soft isn't a dramatic mascara, it is perfect for everyday wear, and I would recommend highly to anyone."
1,"What can I say, this perfume is amazing!  It's rich, spicy, sexy and very womanly.  It's a mature scent without being old lady-ish.  Think sultry bombshell draped in rich brocades and silks."
1,"Nice color, looks really awesome with Crown Me Already used as a sparkly top coat.  Nice color, especially in the fall/ winter."
0,"This note of alert is intended for those who care:  Amazon includes this soap in its category ""cruelty free,"" a choice on the left side of the page that narrows results within ""soap.""  That is flat-out incorrect.  The ingredients listed on the package include goat's milk, but the main ingredient is tallow--in other words, animal fat.  It might or might not be tested on animals (I don't know), but it is definitely MADE of animals.  I ordered this based on its good reviews and Amazon's categorization of it as cruelty-free.  Since the ingredients are not listed in the product description as of this writing, and because repacking and returning items is a pain in the neck, I am mentioning it for those who might, like me, want to know."
1,"I have been penciling in my eyebrows for years. My eyebrows have always been two-toned with brown and blonde hairs, and the blonde hairs always threw my eyebrow shape off.  I finally did some research about brow dye and it was my first time doing it since receiving this product, it def takes some practice, but now I no longer use a pencil everyday. You really have to try n get the dye on your brow hair and not your skin, but if you get it on your skin, it goes away after about 3 days or so. In the end I am very pleased to have this product."
1,"This color is so bold and edgy, it is fantastically vampy. The color has blue undertones, which I learned after dying it over a few errant bleached blonde strands. This color does fade very quickly, and it should be noted that there is nothing natural looking about this color. L'Oreal Paris Feria has several natural looking shades of black--but this is NOT one of them. This color is simply too shiny and far too stark to be considered ""au natural"". Fortunately for me I was craving something more dramatic and quasi scene-looking. I'd recommend this for anyone desiring an edgy look. For those just wanting to touch up on dark strands--seek another product."
1,"I anxiously awaited and received this product in a timely manner via Amazon.The scent from the bottle is ever so &#34;soft&#34; and welcoming, but like Bath & Body products it is meant to be layered with the other items, lotion, body spray, etc.  I'n not looking to invest in those that this time.I've used it 3 or 4 different times and have noticed itching the next day...I'm doing a process of elimination currently, as this is really the only &#34;new&#34; thing I've added to bathing, laundry, lotions...so time will tell."
1,"I liked the product. It works like a blush too. Gostei do produto. Nesta cor, tamb&eacute;m pode ser usada como blush. Estava com receio, pois nao gostei do batom da Nars, aquele em forma de l&aacute;pis. Felizmente, o iluminador nao decepcionou. Tamb&eacute;m gostei do vendedor. Recomendo a ambos."
1,I use this product to keep my face clean and from getting BIG pores. I gotta say it helps a lot this item is a must try for yourself.
1,I use this in combo with my hair gel and never have frizz and my hair is easy to comb through when wet! I've been using this now for years.
0,"Ive bought several of the Auric Blends perfumes and loved them but this one I just don't like it.  More of a masculine scented oil bordering on aged powder.Its not a disgusting scent, just not what I thought it would be.It would probably smell nice on an older gentleman though."
0,"This so called nail polish thinner actually doesn't work. I used it to thin many of my nail polish and at a glance, it seemed to work. However, when I actually used them, they were thickened again. It kind of ruined my favorite nail polishes...so disappointed."
1,"I've tried the following night creamYves Rocher Bio night creamHildegard Braukman chamomille night creamAveda night creamAnd neutrogena light cream is still the best- it is fast absorbing, light, creamy, leaves no residue, and leaves the best light scent.  The only set back is that this product contains paraben.  I hope the company improves its formulation so it no longer contains known carcinogens."
1,"Not long ago, I started putting oatmeal in a little bit of cheesecloth and added it to my bath. Then, I added rosemary and other herbs for variety. The combination of oatmeal and rosemary seems to be very healing.While this soap contains oat flour, it doesn't contain herbs. It is a nice soap to use in the tub but it has to be put in a dry place after your bath because it gets very creamy and soft and can be used up faster than you intend it to be used.Aveeno products heal the skin and are comforting, soothing products. You will start to notice your skin looking much more smooth and healthy after using products with oatmeal.If you love this product, you might also enjoy using the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion, Aveeno Stress relief Body Wash or Aveeno Stress Relief Moisturizing Lotion.All the Aveeno items calm and relax. I especially love the Stress Relief Lotion in the 2.5 oz tube that can be kept in your purse. The burst of Lavender, Chamomile and Ylang-Ylang is healing at any time of the day.~The Rebecca ReviewLover of Long Baths with Essential Oils and a Poetry Book"
1,"I'm currently researching what I could use on my hands. The best things the I've discovered are: coconut oil; shea butter; and then, a distant third, this thing. It does protect the skin with some sort of covering layer (probably wax); it does not contain anything chemical, like the ubiquitous parabens; it has, supposedly, some amount (undisclosed) of vitamin E; and finally, the empirical evidence is that it's fairly good on the skin, for whatever reasons. These are the pros. Now the cons:1. Stinks like hell (doesn't last, but the fist blast is overpowering, like a cold medicine you're supposed to smear under your nose -- this prevents me from using it outside of home since I'll annoy coworkers).2. Way too greasy for my taste.3. Obscenely expensive. Wth? What is in it that makes it so pricey? A retro-styled bearded buy on cover? My as.4. Doesn't have much persistent power: meaning, it's fairly easily washed off (my other options proved more lasting: they tend to survive a handwash or two; this one doesn't). This wouldn't be a problem (just re-apply) were it not for (1) and (3).Bottom line: functionally it's OK, so if you're rich, you can use it at home.PS. Btw, the reports that it's hard to open are untrue: it's amazingly easy to open. The tin it comes in is remarkable: it's tight and doesn't leak anything, yet it opens smoothly and w/o effort, like if it were greased up (which it isn't). Neither is the stuff too hard: it's hard but it easily melts at the body temperature, just rub a finger over the surface. If stored in a warm room, it becomes even softer. It's exactly what you'd expect from ""a salve"", so no problem on that end.Added on 10/28/2011: Just FYI: I finished my researches into moisturisers, and the results are somewhat anticlimatic: the best moisturiser for face is L'Oreal's aftershave; the best all-around moisturiser is Cetaphil (both lotion and cream; I like the cream better but both are fine). Everything else I've tried isn't quite as good (even though it was all two-to-four times more expensive). Go figure. L'Oreal has all the usual crap including parabens in it; Cetaphil is pretty harmless (no parabens, no fragrances, no grease: a pretty neutral product), but not too natural either. Yet these two are the best: not greasy at all, and with good humectant properties; neither one clogs pores."
1,"I  have been using this product for several weeks and can definitely see an improvement in my facial and neck skin.  It isn't at all harsh.  I've experienced no peeling, but the results are there."
1,"I have very, very oily (asian) straight hair which I wash every day. When a shampoo is drying I can tell because at shoulder length suddenly I get this litter of one inch broken ends every time I brush. This shampoo is gentle enough for me to use every day. It doesn't leave any residue so I don't bother with clarifying shampoos. And the fragrance is wonderful and pretty intense while you are using it but washes clean so you're not committed to the scent all day. Not that I would mind...The shampoo is also faintly more concentrated than others so you can back off a little when you apply."
1,"Beautiful color, looks great on. creamy and shiny.  Color stays on and looked good between nail appointments.  Highly recommended - does not disappoint"
1,"For me it is way big for the hand to hold.  I also have a problem when it stops as the wire turns, that was strange but I guess some people really like it that way.  It just doesn't seem exactly what I thought it would be but yes I am keeping it and trying to work with it."
1,"I have liked Suave's imitation Nexxus products for years but this has now been reformulated and is not as good. It's definitely not like Nexxus humectress shampoo. It's ok as a shampoo, doesn't lather as well or smell as nice as the old formula. So it's ok but if you want a Nexxus imitation, this is no longer it."
1,"this non soap , soap leaves the skin feeling ultra soft. I love that it's ph balances so I can wash my delicate hoohaa area without worrying i'll get irritated. good product."
1,"I absolutely love bareminerals. It doesn't irritate my skin and lasts a really long time, which makes the price more reasonable."
1,"I usually get the Sea Lipid day cream and I love it, so I thought I'd love this too. I was wrong. This moisturizer clogs my pores terribly. I'm going to stick with my sea lipids and leave this thick mess alone."
0,"Said a lot of times. This product is a commodity the failure I buy in the Amazon. After receiving the goods after using a period of time, will reflect the commodity problems. It is a little effect not. Give me the business then replied, differ from man to man the merchandise. I don't understand, how many people you need to feedback says this commodity not effect a little, you will recognize that it is really no effect. So, really do not want to how much of what, if you can, or give me a refund. This is useful."
1,I now get some other soap and it comes in 3 bars at a time. Cetaphil is a good brand but it is over $6.00 for just one with shipping.
1,"The best brushes for curly, thick hair.  Easy to control and it does not break the hair with a gentle stroke.  NICE!"
1,"I have used this product for years, plus another softer Buf-Puf for my face.Does wonders for taking off dried skin, and I just feel wonderfully clean afterwards. It also preps your skin well for your favorite lotion.I use the Buf-Puf handle and attach this sponge to wash my back.After many years, I am used to it, but for a first time user, stick to the softer white side and use a gentle touch.Overall a great exfoliate for the the body!"
1,I really like this oil for making homemade beauty products and as a deep conditioner for my hair.  I will definitely purchase this oil again.
1,"Let me say that I don't wear makeup all that often, that is until I bought this. I now wear NARS Orgasm every day, even if I am not wearing any other makeup. The color is so gorgeous and flattering. It's not just pink, but has these lovely gold tones in it without being sparkly. I threw out all my other blush colors, this is my one and only now."
1,"I have used this product 1 year ago. I would have said I loved it if the smell wasn't so annoying. This herb will make your hair grow so fast! When I apply this product to my scalp, after a few minutes I knew it bagan to work because I felt tingles. My scalp was awakening :). I saw result after a month. This stuff works!!! I am African American with 4b- naturally curly hair :). I would have gave 5 stars just don't like the smell left over on my pillow. Strong super herbs :). You must wash this out after a couple of hours smell lingers.. StrongBrahmi Oil - Ayurvedic Hair Growth massage oilHerbally smell."
1,"I hate that this product is difficult to find.  I love the smell and it does a a decent job of keeping my skin clear.  I know that other reviews say it doesn't work as well as the original, but the smell of the original is just to medical for me.  I love this stuff and will use it forever."
1,I wasn't optimistic but I have been pleasantly surprised.  The stuff is a little difficult to apply (it is like the consistency of water and takes some practice so it isn't constantly running down your cheeks).  I have been using about a month and half and see a lot of healthy new hair growth.  I am very pleased and will definitely continue to use!
1,This hair dryer is easy to use and dries hair fast but its a little too big so if you have small hands this hair dryer is definitely not for you.
1,"I was looking for a natural shampoo product that leaves my hair clean and fairly soft that I don't need to follow with a conditioner, because I don't want to add to my scalp problem. I have relaxed hair and be little generous, it's a pretty fine and healthy hair, one that has never been chemically-treated. I don't even straighten my hair or anything. So, switching to a natural product, I would have at least expect this product to leave my hair softer than before I wash it. But sadly, it doesn't turn out that way. First, you need to put A-LOT of this shampoo on your hair because it doesn't lather well. Also, it doesn't exactly give you the soft, relaxed feeling that the many positive reviews have suggested. Good thing is at least, it doesn't dry out your hair.So, apart from it being a natural product and doesn't dry out your hair, it doesn't really &#34;work&#34; in soften your hair or anything. Bear in my mind that I tried this product out WITHOUT the conditioner, so just some info for you folks."
1,"This moisturizer is lightweight and provides sun protection.  There is a slight white residue leftover if you apply too much, which is why I am only rating 4 stars."
1,"I like this hair tool so much I purchased another one to keep in my travel case. It's the perfect, easy to use styler for my hair."
1,"Let me first say that for the past few years I have straightend my hair because I did not know how to deal with my curly hair. Always frizzy, course and just plain unruly. Well I recently had my haircut by a Ouidad Stylist and she suggested this gel. I will tell you it is VERY expensive. But, so far worth it. This by far beats everything that I have underneath my bathroom sink. I normally would not spend this much on a hair product, but this is the first time in a long time that I don't feel the need to straighten my hair to make it look presentable. Apply this gel to soaking wet hair. Do not towel dry. Make sure to section your hair and coat every strand for perfect, frizz free curls. Your hair needs to be very wet when applying. What I really like about this gel is even if you over apply, your hair does not feel crunchy like most gels. Dry your hair with a diffuser if you do not have time to air dry. You will wind up with beautiful, soft looking curls. I am loving this stuff."
1,"Realmente esperaba mas de este producto por los buenos comentarios que lei! Este lo usare porque ya lo compre y no huele mal, solo pense que seria mas dulce y el olor duraria mas tiempo. Definitivamente el Cotton candy no lo compraria otra vez. Intentare con el Sugar Vanilla a ver si me gusta mas."
1,I usually use the Q10 w/o the spf and wanted to try the one with spf because I'm starting retin-A but they didn't sell it.. so I decided to give this one a try. I have pretty dry skin. It gets pretty flaky in the winter time so I need something that will moisturize deeply. This face moisturizer penetrates my skin to where it isn't flaky anymore yet it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy/oily. I can wear it under make up and my skin looks super smooth all day. I'm also prone to ocassional break outs and haven't had any problems with them so I like this product a lot. Fragrance free is also a plus.
1,"it works very good, i like it, it hydrate skin, put it on before make up or dry powder, you notice different, you notice your skin absorbs essential moisturizers faster and very well, i love it, it is so cool"
1,"Bought lipstick, believing reviews.I do not regret.All that is written - it's true.I generally like non glossy matte lipstick.This is exactly like that.Easily and gently applied, very beautiful color - closer to raspberries.Even a light layer will turn you into a charming girl.Resistant.Overall, I liked it."
1,"These brushes have a nice springy bristle pad. For just $6 a piece you can't go wrong. Great for my short hair, and the wife says they work well on her long hair, the flexible springy pad helps prevent knots."
1,"I first started using this moisturizer after a road trip... experiencing such varying climates in such a short amount of time really made my acne flair up... Before this, I had been using the neutrogena moisturizer for sensitive skin, which seemed to make my face really greasy. I decided to give this stuff a try after reading some reviews and finding it on sale somewhere.I really noticed a different in the redness. It helped to calm my skin down and made the redness a lot less noticeable. My face has some pretty bad acne and scarring, especially before trying this moisturizer. It really evened out my skin tone (though it still has a way to go, I try to be thankful for how much better it's gotten).This never makes my face feel greasy and absorbs well. I like the scent and consistency. Salicylic acid has never been effective on my acne, and I don't think the very small amount of salicylic acid in this product did anything for me. I really think it was the soy that helped even out my skin tone and get rid of redness. Before this product, I would see my reflection in low-light situations and think that my skin looked like swiss cheese or something. I felt like there were craters in my face from the scars and redness, and this product totally changed that. Unfortunately, my face still has a way to go before it's scar-free and although this product really helped me see a difference, it now seems like my face has kind of gotten used to it and it's done being beneficial. It hasn't made it worse compared to any other moisturizer, but I've been breaking out more since repurchased it after my first bottle ran out. I do still really like this stuff, though. It's the best moisturizer that I've tried on my skin, which is pretty dry and sensitive but was very oily in high school."
1,"Good shampoo. In the winter scalp can get dry & itchy, this so far is working nicely. Smell is fine - to me almost nonexistent. But it solved the dryness and itch."
1,This came quick and packaged just like I bought it in the store.Everything seems fine with it and I like that it has the turbo heat button. Great curling iron for the price.
1,using this for around 2 years...it gives great coverage...sometimes causes breakout but just regularly clean powder brush. no need for foundation with this powder.
1,This is a perfect must have tool for your bathroom. I love using this for making my large high buns. It helps and makes the job easier.
1,When I first received this eyeshadow in the mail I was disappointed at the size.  It seemed awfully small for the money. But this eyeshadow packs a wallop.  A little goes a long way and it is the perfect shade for day time.  I love NARS products.  They may be small but they are definitely worth every penny.
1,Excellent product to gently exfoliate the skin every day. Have used Buf-puf for decades; store brands just aren't the same.
1,I use this on wet skin after the shower.  It sinks in and starts working right away to keep my skin soft and moist.  It doe snot override my fragrance.  Feels wonderful.
1,"I have two of these towels, and I really like them.  My hair is thick and curly and used to take half the day just to dry.  Now, with my Aquis towel, I can towel-dry it about 75% of the way and not completely frizz it out.  Then it takes only another 30-45 minutes to air-dry the rest of the way, and it looks great.  (If I towel-dry that much with a regular terrycloth towel, I get major frizz, so the microfiber definitely seems to make a difference.)My personal routine is: get out of the shower, towel dry very minimally with my regular towel (or wrap loosely for a minute in my turban-style Aquis towel), comb product through my hair, and then scrunch with the Aquis towel.  It really does absorb a huge amount of water; I scrunch for probably 2-3 minutes and my hair is mostly dry.  This towel has really made a huge difference to the manageability of my curly hair.  I don't have to spend a huge amount of time styling my hair, and it looks great and not frizzy when I dry it with the Aquis towel.  I can't say how it would do for straight hair, but I can strongly recommend it for my fellow curlies.UPDATE 7/30/11: Just wanted to say that I recently had to throw out my Aquis turban-style towelAquis Microfiber Hair Turban, Lisse Crepe, Patented Design, Whitebecause it was old and worn out, and discovered that this one can easily serve the same function even with my thick and currently very long hair. It is long enough to be able to wrap my hair in it, bring the tail back over the top of my head, and tuck it securely underneath the back fold.  Excellent!"
1,"I have been using this mask for a week. The results have been so impressive that I've been using it at least once per day and sometimes 2. My pores were not huge but they definitely made my skin look older. I can't believe it, the pores on my cheeks are almost completely gone. On top of that even the redness around my nose where I have broken capillaries looks much clearer. It has removed blackheads around my nose that I didn't realize were even there. My entire face looks better and discolorations have diminished. I feel like I've taken a couple years off my face in one week. It's amazing such a fantastic product is so reasonably priced. I will continue to use the product indefinitely. I highly recommend it to anyone with oily skin."
0,"I had high hopes for this product due to all the great reviews but was only left disappointed. When i used this product, it made my hair come out in big clumps whenever I washed or brushed my hair which never happens! I have very thick, long hair and was very surprised when I saw clumps of it coming out whenever I used this product. Once I stopped, so did the hair loss. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,My hair was like a yellow and brassy color. I used this and wow a beautiful blonde.thanks Amazon.. I am so glad a chanced this color.
0,"I really need a body wash for my very dry , itchy winter skin. The reviews lead me to purchase this one, but so far it has made no more difference than my other regular body washes. I don't get it's appeal. I think I will maybe try something with ceremides perhaps next time. There are limited choices for extra dry skin from what I can see. I don't think I will repurchase this aveeno not to mention it is NOT sulfate free and I think it's the sulfates that keep my skin so dry after a shower.."
1,"I ordered this oil in high hopes that it would make my hair grow due to what was stated in the reviews that I read. I used this as a scalp massage once or twice a week. After massaging my scalp, I would let it sit over night or for an hour before washing. I experienced some shedding from this oil which was not normal for me. I am african american with relaxed hair. I immediately through it out due to the constant shedding i experienced.""Everything that works for me may not work for you"". I remember that quote and now I believe it."
1,"Fading at forty - that was my hair-dilemma several years ago (okay, eighteen years ago)...  Looking to refresh my color to that of my younger days - red-gold when hit by the sun, I began my quest for a great hair coloring product.Clairol Natural Instincts, from its inception, hit the mark when it came to gentle processing which left my hair feeling like hair and not straw.  However, I could never quite find the exact color I was looking for.  Many of the reds stocked by the retailers looked almost purple and the lighter reds were just not right for my skin tone.  I finally began mixing Natural Instincts Hot Cocoa and Natural Instincts Golden Sienna to achieve a color close to what I sought.  It was a chore to have to formulate my own color - particularly when the two colors were rotated from stock periodically.  I took to stocking up a year in advance, just to keep my color consistent.When Golden Mahogany became available several summers ago, I decided to try it.  The color was exactly what I had been seeking - it gave my dark brown hair the golden-red glow of my youth and didn't look artificial or dyed.  I've been stopped in airports and at malls by women who compliment the sheen of my hair and the color.  My hairdresser admitted that Natural Instincts is as good as anything she does - and she is an expert colorist - at a significantly lower cost.  She did suggest that I wash my hair with a clear shampoo and dry it just before coloring.  She also suggested I leave the color on as long as 20 minutes, if I had no reaction to the chemicals as it would through more shampooings.  As a result, Golden Mahogany lasts about four weeks, with daily shampooing that begins no sooner than 24 hours after coloring. I do use shampoo and conditioner formulated for color-processed hair.  The color will gradually soften until it is time to color again.I love the ease with which this product can be applied, and the conditioner included with the box is absolutely wonderful.  In fact, I wish Proctor & Gamble would market the conditioner separately so that I can use it more often.  This color is difficult to find - impossible in some areas of the country, so it was great to find it on Amazon.  I definitely recommend Natural Instincts Hair Color to anyone looking for a great product!"
1,"Great spot treatment, I found it to be ore effective than the one by clearasil."
1,"The iron heats up quickly and seems to be good quality.  The buttons are well built, easy to understand and use.Like any curling iron, it does take quite a while to cool down, which is frustrating, but true with any product like this one.The cord is probably about 6 feet, which is a nice length to work with.  The cord is a little stiff, so it has curled a little too much now that it has been stretched a lot.Overall good product for the price."
1,"I love this product The fragrance is beautiful, and i am so glad i purchase it. I definately will purchase it again"
1,I have tried numerous products to make my brittle nails stronger. This is the only one which did the job especially preventing my nails from splitting. I will keep buying it!
1,"This stuff is perfect in my hair. It's never hard or crunchy and it restores bounce, shine and ability to retain moisture and style. I love it for damaged hair as well as maintaining healthy hair."
1,This is such a great nail strengthener! My nails will finally be strong enough to grow out and put colored nail polish on!
1,"Wow, never thought I would purchase anything else but Origins and this product proved me otherwise.  So far it has moisturized my face very well during the day (I have dry skin and sometimes flaky on my forehead, chin area and lightly on my cheeks during the winter season in the east coast).  You would have to try it since everyone's face will respond to it differently and depending on what season and where you are residing will also make a difference.  This is my first time being in the east coast during the winter season so my face is a lot more dehydrated (it has not yet acclimated to the east coast winter weather, if it will ever be) in any case this product has done it's job and I have been very happy of it."
0,"This lotion seems to just sit on the surface, does not penetrate or soften. My hands just end up looking shiny."
1,I would like to thank Kandee Johnson for this purchase because she inspired me to buy it :) Took very long for this product to get here but once it did it was packaged well. I used it for the first time last night and I think it will take me awhile to get used to it.  You are supposed to put a little bit in your hand and then add 2 drops of water.  I did that and it just seems like you need to do something else; it's kinda hard to apply to your face.  I'm pretty positive that this scrub will work wonderfully though :)
1,"You can really never make a mistake with Essie nail polish. This is a unique color with great coverage. The vendor sent it quickly, and at a very good price!  Wrapped securely so there was no leakage from the bottle!"
1,This lotion is the best for the price.  You are still soft 24 hours after application.  I personally think its the best on the market and I've used a gazillion lotions over the years.  This just lasts.
1,"This product is truly fragrance-free and does not cause an allergic reaction on my skin like so many other products do. At first, I didn't care for the Cetaphil cream because I thought it was greasy, but with a few days use I realized that I was using too much. A little goes a long way.This winter has been brutal on my skin -- especially my hands -- but Cetaphil had made them soft again."
1,"This is the first red lipstick that I've enjoyed using - it's very smooth, and makes your lips look great!"
1,After having my baby I developed a rash on my hands from overwashing and extremely dry skin. I visited a dermatologist who prescribed me a steroid cream to get rid of the rash and samples of this hand cream. He insisted I use this every time I wash my hands to keep them moisturized so I would not have another rash breakout. I have been using this for over a year now and do not have dry chapped skin. I still wash my hands about 20 times a day so this is a life saver!
1,"I have suffered from chronic consitpation my entire life. I am 65 yrs old. I have tried many different types of fiber supplements and I keep coming back to Konsyl Natural Fiber. I usually do ALL my shopping at Amazon.com because I am a prime member and the products work out to be cheaper than me going 20 miles one-way to the nearest store and then paying sales tax. However, this is the first product that is overpriced on Amazon. Walmat has this product for $13.  So I will buy there instead of here. My review should be that if you suffer from constipation, then this is a great working fiber that is almost taste free."
1,"I've tried more expensive lotions and creams on my face, but I really love this one the best.  It leaves my face feeling and looking very soft.  I also love the way you just press the top and the lotion/cream comes out....you don't have to dip your fingers in a jar or touch what's left in it.  All creams and lotions should be this way...I hate having to dig out cream in a jar with my fingers not knowing if I've left any germs in the remaining cream.  I recommend this."
1,"I love that this headband doesn't pinch. And you can wear your sunglasses with it too! I hope I don't break them, being plastic. But I'd buy again if I do!"
1,"i went to the drugstore looking for queen helene's mint julep mask, but i couldn't find it, so i picked this up instead. i really like this mask as well, it leaves my skin feeling really clean and soft and it's very easy to rinse off. i have sensitive skin and i haven't had any breakouts or adverse reactions to it after using it. the only things i don't like about it are that it makes my eyes burn a lot if i put too much of the product around them, and it's a little itchy when it dries."
1,"I just love this lotion. It smells great, sinks in fast, hydrates well, and doesn't irritate or break out my skin. Perfection. I always get compliments on how soft my skin is, so i know it works!"
1,"I purchased two bottles of Acquarella polish (clear conditioner and Tickle Pink) and one bottle of Aquarella remover.  After removing my salon applied pedicure with regular nail polish remover, I rinsed my feet and applied a coat of Aquarella clear conditioner and two coats of Tickle Pink.  When about 2 weeks had passed,  I used the Aquarella remover to take off the Acquarella clear coat & Tickle Pink color.  It worked like a charm and without the harsh smell of regular nail polish remover (although my cat did not appreciate the smell of my fingers when I tried to pet her after using it, even though I had washed my hands).  I did not really like the Tickle Pink shade of Aquarella nail polish, so unless I buy another color, the remaining bottle of remover probably won't be of any use to me (because I don't believe this is intended to be used to remove regular nail polish;  I think it is specifically meant to remove Aquarella's own brand of nail polish).  I give it 5 stars for removing Aquarella polish.  I may buy some Pritti brand polish and see if it works just as well with that."
1,"This worked great! I had not cut my 5 year old nails in at least 2 years as he would eat them down to nothing. He stopped biting his nails after the first time we used it. I put in on every few days and after just 3 weeks, he stopped bitting his nails all together, even if I skip using the product for several days. Last night I had to cut his nails for the very fist time since he was 3! It does smell terrible when you first put it on but as soon as it dries (a couple of minutes), the smell is gone."
1,Love this hair wrap. I used it in the microwave the first time but I later discovered that putting it in boiling water makes the heat last longer. No more sitting under a stationary bonnet for hot hair treatments!! Love it!
1,This leave in conditioner is great.  It smells good and can be used to control frizzy hair during the day if the humidity gets to it (even though the directions say to apply to wet hair only).
1,"With the inevitable hormonal changes, my hair started falling out.... A LOT.  This line of shampoo and conditioner was one of the ways I began to tackle this problem.I really, really, really like everything about it... the no chemicals, the smell, the texture, the price, oh and IT WORKS!I highly recommend."
1,"The first one arrived & the facial sauna worked fine, but the little facial scrubber didn't.  Amazon replaced the entire package and everything works fine.  Is it like going to the spa and getting a facial?  No.  But then I didn't pay as much for this little device as the spa paid for the one they use.  The steam isn't a lot, it's gentle.  I did put a towel over my head & that helped.  The sinus attachment works well.  I am pleased with the purchase."
1,"This is a nice product , good toner and cleaner for face and neck. I would recommend use if this product."
1,"I do! This is my new daily moisturizer. I use it over the Jason Hyper C Serum. I thought it would be too heavy together, but it really ""soaks in"" and doesn't leave me feeling slimy like so many products do. I'm really a soap and water girl at heart, but am too old now to neglect the skin like that. Give it a go!"
1,"I love Opium oils, I am out and probably have to purchase some more, this is the company to go to for that smokey oil, I love it."
1,"I never thought a body oil would be so great.  When I hear ""body oil,"" I think, ""greasy,"" ""thick,"" and ""gross.""  Neutrogena body oil is none of those things.  I squirt a little in the tub when I run a bath, and it keeps my skin from drying out.  After I shower, I put it on my legs and they never get dry, either.  It's so light that you don't feel it at all, and the scent is very light too.  I did, however, order the unscented version for when my current bottle runs out.  My husband is hooked on this stuff too.  We keep a bottle in the shower, and when we turn the water off, we just put some on our arms and legs before we get out.  That way, we don't have to use a lot of heavy lotions instead."
0,"I found a recommendation for these in one of my magazines, and as I tend to contract my brow at night, thought they would be a good preventative against the furrows that I saw showing up in the mornings.  Boy, was I ever wrong.Firstly, these are made of cardboard.  Literally.  Just a very thin cardboard.  With serrated edges!  So, when I press one up to my head, the rough edges irritate and hurt my skin.Secondly, the glue is just plain old stamp paste.  I know that smell (and taste, yes, I tasted it).  My grandmother had a roll of this wet-and-stick packing tape when I was a kid and this is the SAME STUFF.  It's not going to hurt you, but - and I asked my family practitioner physician father about this - it is in ZERO ways better or superior to just sticking a plain old piece of tape on your head.  The glue on a piece of tape is no more irritating to most people's skin.Thirdly, if you do get these to stick on your head correctly, you have to soak them to get them off.  This means that they stick so hard that they will actually dent your skin around the edges of the piece.  Exchange one kind of set-in wrinkle for another (more weird looking) one?  No thanks.I'd highly recommend using a more skin-friendly device, since the physical method of patching the skin to inhibit muscle contraction works just fine.  I've been using Nexcare Acne Absorbing Covers (from Amazon), which are round, clear, and extremely skin friendly.  They also stick well and stay put through the night.  The oil absorbing feature is an added benefit!"
1,"I've been using this for about 2 weeks now. I got this product hoping it would be a huge turn around for my overly dry skin. And while sadly my skin is still dry, it is less harsh than regular body washes out there and leaves me feeling very moisturized after a shower. However, the relief only seems to last mere minutes. I'm still having to use lotion all over my body on a daily basis. Maybe my results will change with the season as right now its winter and the air is fairly dry, but I'm not so sure.  The smell isn't horrible, but its also not great. And when I received the package body wash had leaked all per inside the box and all over the bottle. That Was something I was most definitely not happy with. I will probably, however, continue to use the product as organic stuff is still healthier for your skin."
1,"I bought this for my strapless, backless bra (Invisible adhesive bra) & the adhesive works great!! Comes off easily with soap & water. I definitely recommend this if you buy the Invisible adhesive bra."
1,"I bought a few of them at General dollar. They costed $1 (5 packs or 10 packs) , they lasted good until last week. It was getting weak. I disliked because I wash my hair a lot. I don't wanna some weak plastic cap.I came to Amazon looking for high quality (better) plastic caps. They really are!I can't even get it to break if I stretch! The elastic around my cap will not break too, THANK GOD ! LOL....for real , I love it. It will fit ya'll I am sure because my hair is thick and it still fit in plastic cap. I can't believe it is only $3. I am gotta come back"
1,I like the item. But i def LOVE the Mint Julep Masque (by the same company) wayyyy better. This is a good masque but nothing special compare to other mud masque i used. Prob will not purchase again.
1,"It is a bit pricey but I've been using it a few days now and I see myself buying another bottle when this one runs out. Yes, I use this on myself. No, I don't use this on a baby. But it smells wonderful and dries quickly and feels great. Not sticky or oily at all. Dries on your skin in about two minutes. And did I mention it SMELLS WONDERFUL."
1,Way too much fragrance in this soap. It makes the dishes smell like 'honeysuckle' even way after washing. Not ideal. Will stick with the basic soap from trader joe's.
0,"I received this fairly quickly, but this product did *NOT* cover my grays. It slightly lightened up my already colored hair, but that's about it. It took me over an hour in the shower to rinse off the sand/grit/rocks/cement and even then I'm not sure I washed it all out. I am not happy with this product, and the fact it did not cover my gray (waited an hour and a half before rinsing,) was adding insult to injury, or uncolored white roots to impossible to rinse off product. Very frustrating."
1,"Okay, so I've been fighting mild to moderate acne since my teens. I'm almost 25, and still never have a perfectly clear face, especially during my lady times.But this still is incredible! After using it in the morning and at night for just 2-3 days, my face was feeling smoother, pores were smaller, and my breakouts are healing up and looking awesome. I'm very excited right now! I also cut the pads in half, half a circle is more than enough product to get your whole face generously.So if you have troublesome combination skin, this stuff is worth the cost, because it's a fantastic product that doesn't irritate or over-dry your skin. (Which is my usual issue with acne treatments containing alcohol)It does have kind of a weird smell, like they tried to cover the alcohol with a peach bellini smell... I appreciate the effort; but personally, this stuff could smell like a wet dog and I'd still use it. It's working THAT well."
1,my girl loves it. I like hard bristles but she enjoys this brush. It looks elegant. Unfortunately once it dropped onto the floor handle came flat off and we need to buy a new one now.
1,"I bought this cream one winter for dry skin and very drying tap water, but didn't use it very much because I live in a pretty warm climate where  super cold/dry spells are pretty rare. I nearly tossed it when I was moving but decided to keep it, and I'm so glad I did. I use Epiduo for my acne, which dried out my combo/dry skin even more and made it very red and sensitive. My entire face, and especially around my eyes, was so painfully dry and flaky. Even fragrance-free/sensitive skin creams and lotions still burned and irritated my skin. My skin was flaking so bad during the day from my makeup it was disgusting by the end of the day. I thought I was just going to have to stop using my acne creams altogether, my face was so bad.One night in desperation I pulled this out of the medicine cabinet, and noticed on the back it was non-comodegenic and said you could use it anywhere- lips, eyes, face. I bravely slathered this everywhere, and it was like a miracle for my skin. It didn't burn, there was no fragrance, and it soothed my irritated skin. After a few days of using it morning and night my skin was 200% improved, and my acne has almost entirely cleared up. My acne creams are able to work since my skin isn't constantly dry and irritated, and my skin is seriously glowing from how healthy and moisturized it is now. My makeup goes on perfectly! I use this every night, and sometimes very lightly in the morning if I have a dry spot. It's great on lips and, of course, hands and everywhere else. I carry this with me all the time now. Highly recommended!"
1,This oil smells heavenly.  It's rich and spicy and the longer you have it on the better it smells.  My husband was very pleased with the scent and he wears it too.  A little bit goes a long way and it lasts all day and into the next day.  I would absolutely purchase this oil again!
1,Bought this as a gift for a friend who loved mine so much she wanted one of her own.  Nuff said.  Great product!
1,"this is a decent face wash...nothing special for me...the consisitency however, is extremely frustrating...it is almost to thick to be separated or lathered, I don't know how to describe it lol, but it makes my skin smooth after use..i don't see any effectiveness concerning my acne problem though...probably works best on those with minor acne.."
1,"I've tried a lot of lip products, but this is the only one I rave about. The color really lasts a long time - like, I'll put it on in the morning and it will still look great at the end of the day. Like I can eat, kiss, drink, and I'm still the only one wearing lipstick. Like, I'll still be wearing lipstick after a shower.It doesn't get stiff or cakey, and I can just add some gloss to freshen it up. The only things I've noticed is that it doesn't work well with Burt's Bees or other waxy lip balms - it can get lumpy if you use chapstick over it.  Gloss seems to be fine. Also, it can be a P in the A to get off at the end of the night, so often I will look extra terrible in the morning if I'm too lazy to scrub at it."
1,"I have used this product for almost everything that is skin related and it works just fine. You know what's the best part? It never seems to end. I mean, the bottle is not that big but the gel keeps coming out when I squeeze it. I'm surprised that it has not finished yet. I've been using it for a year now.I've used it on sunburns, cuts, or just as a face mask to cool and refresh my skin. It is a good product to have just in case. I love knowing that it is all natural, which means it probably won't do any damage to my skin/health. I have no complaint."
1,"I very much wish that Maybelline hadn't discontinued this foundation, it's easy to apply and the color (#10) is just right for my very fair skin color.  It has a nice matte finish and provides sheer-medium coverage."
1,The case is excellent. Looks like its going to last a long time. It's my favorite - a must for me.
1,I really do love this color. I apply three coats to get a pretty smokey pink. The absolute only thing I don't like about this polish is how long it takes to dry. I feel like I have to give it a full hour and a half to ensure it doesn't look smudgy or scratched. I would wear this every day if I didn't have to worry so much about it.
1,"This cleanser comes with a lot of hype and an almost religious following. Not sure why. It's an average / okay cleanser that is no better than any normal cleanser, in my opinion. I don't think it does a good job taking off mascara, btw - which it's supposed to do easily. It doesn't."
0,"This product was delivered on time, however, it made me breakout more. I got more blemishes after using this stuff.It seems to have a greasy feel to it. I found that &#34;Suki pure facial moisture-balancing moisturizer&#34; works much better. It's very mild on the skin and did not make me breakout."
1,"My go to moisturizer straight after a shower.  Love it.  Light, absorbs quickly, no stickiness, and smells move too,  I have used it for years.  And it does keep your skin from drying out.  Love it."
0,"This product was somewhat difficult to apply and probably took around an hour for my eyelashes. The reason being is I had to repeat the process 4x over to get my lashes black. Also I could not get much color at all to take on my bottom lashes. In the end this only lasted a few weeks. I purchased in store and ended up returning the product. Not worth my time in my opinion, also not worth the chemical fumes being near my eye. My eyes did not water or sting however you definitely know that there are bad chemicals near your eyes."
0,"These are a lot work to figure out how to do right.  Once that is figured out and use them, the next morning you have glued heavy craft paper stuck on the areas you treat.  When they first come off, you'd think these things are a miracle; 5 minutes later things go back to wear they were.  Have to say, maybe if used for extended periods of time they might really work but it's just way too much effort to get these things on right just before going to bed, and then getting them removed and the left over glue in the morning.  If you're OK with being around the house with these paper patches on you, give it a try. But if you're not, it's a lot of work before going to bed and when you get up."
1,"I've been using Borghese/Kirkland face serum for a few years and love it.  I decided to try the Regenerist products and purchased the eye serum, face serum and daily moisturizer.  I read all of the positive reviews about the face serum but wasn't expecting it to be any better than the Borghese/Kirkland.  I'm pleasantly surprised.  It has a similar gel-like consistency but seems to absorb more quickly.  For that reason, it feels lighter on my skin.  I guess I'm a convert."
1,I love this perfume and the price was awesome...I have paid more for it in the past and since I have amazon prime it was a great deal.
1,I bought these and I love using these on my clients when I give them facials. They are great for the price and I plan on buying more.
0,"As the title says, it broke me out really bad. I finally had figured out what worked for my skin and had a semi clear face with a pimple or two here and there (that time of the month, stress) but I needed just a bit more of moisture so I decided to try this moisturizer--BIG mistake. I usually brake out on my chin/jaw and in between my eyebrows/forehead so when I woke up the next day I had so many little white in those exact spots. I cannot tell you how upset I was and how itchy my face was. I hate this product and would not recommend this to somebody who has acne-prone, sensitive, oily skin.I only gave it a star because I could not give it zero stars!"
1,I heard about it so many times before. Always best mascara. So wanna to try it. But it's not seems what i thought. Not so good.
1,"This is my first time experimenting with jojoba oil and I really love it. This oil moisturizes my skin and scalp without feeling heavy or greasy. It absorbs really quickly and I'm comforted to know that it is USDA organic. My skin also remains moisturized all day after putting this product on in the morning. I am very sensitive to product odors and this oil carries a very very slight smell. However, it is not offensive at all and disappears after applying the product. I would definitely purchase this product again and recommend it to others."
1,"Nice and light, though it does leave me skin a little oily. When used with a primer, it works just fine. I recommend Revlon's Photo Ready primer."
1,I prefer the lavender soap but wanted to try orange too. It's very fresh. Def try lavender if you haven't.
1,"I have spent hundreds of dollars on lotions and have a cabinet full that just didn't seem to do the job. Rich and creamy this lotion is the only lotion I will use now. I have bought the lavender and the vanilla for my mom.  My aunt saw my arms and legs and asked how do I keep them looking so great! Ecco Bella i told her.  Now Ecco Bella is the only lotion she uses also.  A little goes a long way so although it may feel expensive it is worth it.  The vanilla scent stays all day long.  Even when I use a vanilla based perfume like Shalimar, it will fade but the lotion scent will come though.  I have found i get the most compliments when I use the Ecco Bella Bouboun Vanilla Perfume along with the lotion.  I use this every morning.  My skin does not feel the dryness I used to always experience.  My doctor told me to take care of my feet as they were cracking.  **blush** Last time she saw my feet she was impressed and is now an EccoBella lotion fan herself. My skin is so soft and supple.  Really the best lotion i have ever used."
1,"The SA at David Jones, Australia, told me that this is a great fragrance for people with allergies. So I guess that makes it hypoallergenic? Well, I truly love the smell of this fragrance. I read somewhere where some people described it as an old lady scent. I don't get that at all when I use it. It smells very soft, clean and modern to me. The first time I tried it on, it lasted for a long time but that was during the winter. It will probably evaporate faster in the summer, but I still absolutely love it. I hear that the deodorant/anti perspirant is the best, so I plan to buy it sometime. Truly lovely fragrance. No regrets!"
1,"It doesn't rub in that well and it's not just because of the zinc. It kind of peels up or something. Hard o describe. I wouldn't wear it to work, but would wear it in the yard. You can't put makeup over it well. I only wear powder, but it does not like a coat of powder on top."
1,"I have always had awful nails.  They peel and chip and crack constantly. I tried just about everything made to strengthen them.  I've use OPI nail strengthener on  them. I tried the Artificial Acrylics, which seemed to be doing well.  However everything I put on entailed removing it once a week with polish remover.  I used non acetone but my nails were awful.  They were so dry they were actually white.  Sheets of nail would peel off because I just can't tolerate any of the polish removers.  Nothing I put on them to moisturize them helped at all.  And anything painted on them would occasionally peel and that took layers of nail with it.  I remembered my manicurist using solar oil when I had acrylics and decided to try it again.  After about 2 weeks of constant use my nails were no longer white or peeled.  I've been using it daily for a while now and this is the best they have ever looked or felt. They also don't seem to bend as much as they used to and seem harder.  I am very pleased with this product.  It moisturizers the cuticles as well and the skin on my fingers.  In the winter my thumbs especially crack open and bleed.  It's extremely painful and has happened year after year regardless of how much or which hand cream I  apply.  Not this winter.  That was a first. Can't recommend this enough. And I have to say. My nails are, for the very first time ever, hard.  They barely bend anymore. I used to be able to bend them completely over and every time I bumped something, they broke.  I can't believe that this simple oil actually made my nails hard for the first time in 54 years.  I use it after every time I wash my hands, before bed and several times while watching TV.  I keep it on the TV stand.  This product is amazing."
0,"I have thin fine hair and I am always searching for the ""miracle"" to a beautiful head of hair.  This is not it.  It may be organic and have less surfactants but, it's the thinnest shampoo I've ever used.  Can't get it from bottle to hand to head without losing it down the drain.  Stupid purchase.  Oh well, next time."
1,I enjoy the entire line if Alpha product. These products allows your skin to repair and the products glide on leaving your skin so soft.
1,This product is great for use before putting moisturizer on. It give your skin a bit more moisture to hold on to. I also love to use this product after I place my make up on for the day. I spritz it on and it help set the make up and will also help if your face feel a bit dry after your make up application. If you ever have the frustration of flaky skin ruining your make up this will help those as well! You can also use this product through out the day if you want to freshen your make up back up and also revamp your skin.
1,I bought this for my grandson ..not sure if he loved the fragrance or the bottle lol ...he loved it
1,"I ordered two of these, in different sizes,  because the price was great.I have very long thick hair. I use this on the med/highend of the temp range.  I brush, spray section lightly with hair spray, start winding near the top of my hair, squeeze the release and curl down the section, (youtube has instructional videos that are great) I release curl into my hand then spray again.It takes"
1,"If you suffer from dry skin, this is a good lotion.  If you simply want to reduce small cracks in dry skin, this is the lotion.  It's a bit pricey, so I use it sparingly, but I keep it around because it's useful."
1,"I used the reviva 5% cream prior to this one for the problem area on the back of my arms. I was happy with how smooth my skin felt and the gradual lightening of the hyperpigmentation from clogged pores, pimples, whatever that was on the back of my arms. The 10% cream is helping to clear the issue up even faster and of course I appreciate the natural ingredients incorporated into the product. I plan to continue to use this until the back of my arms are no longer a &#34;problem area&#34;."
0,"The lotion just like sat on top of my skin, didn't really get absorbed.Not a fan of the smell either. Thought it would be a heavy lavendaer smell, but that wasn't the case."
1,"These are perfect for making my own flowers and bows.  Line with grosgrain ribbon, attach a no-slip liner on the inside, and all is great."
1,"I love this dryer - it does what it says and conditions the hair as it is drying.  I originally bought this one for my daughter and she liked mine better, so we traded and I am happy with it."
1,I use this conditioner solely for co washing purposes and it works fabulously on my hair!! And the smell is wonderful!!!
1,"Works great to keep straps and clothing where they should, and it washes off in the laundry (mostly)! But don't expect something miraculous- it'll sweat off, and the ball applicator is kind of annoying. It can dry out and get stuck very easily."
1,Love these facial sponges on the with the Avon Clearskin Professional Deep Pore Cleansing Scrub or your favorite cleanser. Lather up and try them - they work!
1,"I used to be a big fan of those Proactiv-style kits that contained multiple products (i.e. cleanser, toner, lotion). But I always used the products at different rates, and ended up having to purchase new kits to replace one product when I still had a whole bunch of the other products left. I didn't have much choice but to throw some perfectly good products away, and this made me feel like I wasn't getting a good deal for my money.I decided to start buying skin care lotions, cleansers, etc., separately. I knew I wanted at least one of the items to contain salicylic acid as the active ingredient, so I chose this toner (which has 2% salicylic acid). I'm happy enough with it that I will buy more when my current bottle runs out.This toner gives my face that extra clean feeling that washing/cleansing alone can't, and I do believe it cuts down on oil. I don't think it dries out my skin (although I am also using a moisturizer), and it doesn't cause any sort of reaction, even though I have sensitive skin. It also works well as a second-pass makeup remover. I wear a Neutrogena foundation that is a bit difficult to remove, and this toner really seems to help get those last traces off that washing has left behind (judging by the appearance of the cotton pad I use to apply the toner, at any rate).The only drawback I see is that this toner has some fumes (possibly because it contains a large amount of alcohol). This sometimes makes my eyes water a little bit. (I don't get it in my eyes, but just getting it near my eyes is enough.)  Update: after using this for a few months, I don't notice this effect any longer.My preferred method of applying: pour a little on a cotton pad (dispensing is easy to control, by the way) and wipe it over my face. I do this twice a day; I've been doing so for close to six months now, and my skin has never looked better.  Pair this with a good moisturizer so the alcohol isn't drying."
0,"I should have known better than to purchase a dish soap that had a high fragrance, I thought this would be a nice change and allow me to actually enjoy washing dishes (no dishwasher) yes it smells great but leaves a bad residue, which you can taste on everything!! It's especially bad with plastic, it soaks up this soap like no other and even when you rinse it a million times, you can still taste it. Awful!! And yeah they're not green, this stuff gots chemicals too, just look it up on ewg.org."
1,"I was very happy with this product for several reasons:1) It came with PLENTY of dye. I have very long hair and I had enough to cover all of it with only the one bottle.2) Pre-conditioning treatment, after-color shampoo, after-color conditioner, and smoothing cream came with the dye package, and they all seemed high-quality.3) My hair was left feeling very soft -- hardly noticeable damage, if any, and my hair is extremely fine and fragile.My only complaint was that the dye didn't blend with my roots very well. I naturally have medium brown hair, but have been dying it blonde for a few years now. Most dyes seem to lighten my uncolored roots as well as the colored blonde ends; however, this dye left a weird darkish stripe where my roots met my previously dyed hair. I was a little disappointed with that, but figure a toner will even it out. I didn't notice any brassiness like other reviewers mentioned, and my hair normally does turn brassy/yellow-orangeish with most dyes that claim to be ashy. The color was pretty darn close to what was shown on the box, just a little darker.Altogether, I was happy and plan on stocking up. I feel that since this product has been discontinued in stores, there may not be much left from this seller."
1,I really like this Rose Water smells really good I use it with my oils for my hair and skin I wish the smell would last longer though.
1,"It did change colors as specified but it dried my lips out. The color was a nice rosy pink, not very bright or overwhelming. If not for the drying aspect, I would have given it a better review."
0,Maybe I just haven't perfected the roll brush technique but my hair is super curly and this does nothing but hurt my head... I have found that the really small roll brushes work best.
1,I wish they had more attractive headbands in this shape. No pressure; no pressure headaches. Very good product. Four stars for the boring plastic tortoise and black as only choices.
1,"I do love Revlon lipsticks, and I have used only Revlon lipsticks for many years.The lipstick stays on well,and like most Revlon products, I think they are tops."
1,I am cautious about what items I put on my skin and always check the EWG before purchasing. This has a really good rating and is a good price so i purchased it.  My skin is definitely softer and overall i like the product.  But it does have a greasy feeling to it when i first put it on.  But i'm willing to get over that because it works well.
1,I love OPI nail polish and this color did not disappoint.  It is very rich in color and gets a lot of compliments.
0,It won't curl my hair. I set it at 15 and I wait and wait and wait and my hair falls flat. My hair can curl with curling irons but not this one!
1,"I bought this about 7 or 8 yrs ago, but stopped using it bcoz coworkers are allergic to colognes and I never really go out.  I ran across it cleaning out my cabinets and sprayed some on.  It smells as lovely still as the day I purchsed it.  It has a very clean, crisp, ocean breeze kind of thing going on.  Very nice."
1,"It is a temporary fix that works  with the principle of stretching or ironing out the wrinkles in the skin either overnight or for several hours.Its effectiveness depend greatly on the individual age or/and skin condition.  For anyone over 40, I would say that realistically it is one of those fix that you might want to adopt before an event, a photo shoot or such.  Best results are seen if you use them overnight.  Once Frawnies comes off the skin  the lines will slowly return to the point of origin, example 11 lines and marionette will get deeper as the day goes on.  Thus, you need to  plan your treatment 24 hrs ahead by wearing Frawnies overnight and then again during the day. The longer you keep them the less of the ""Cinderella"" effect your wrinkles will have on you.They work best on the 11 lines, forehead and marionettes.They are useless on crow feet for two reasons:1. the skin in this area is too sensitive to host the paper.2. if you can tolerate the discomfort, in order to pull them out you will have to wet the eye area to discover that the paper is too rigid to stretch the crow lines.Gel under eye patches are best for this area.GOOD featuresA nice addition to a make up kitNon invasive light fixNaturalBAD featuresVery uncomfortable to wear at night (think about it you got paper with glue stretching your skin while asleep).Not lasting.Paper is a pain to cut to correct shape in order to eliminate sharp edges of it that will dig additional lines."
1,"My fiance has really bad eczema, so I've been trying to find a product that doesn't irritate his skin for a while. This smells nice and clean. Good size of bottle. His skin seems to be doing fine (for him). I would definitely suggest this to others."
0,"This hair dryer is heavy. And pretty huge. Also, it's hard to hold it by the handle because the rocker switches for power and heat are in the way of your fingers, so you have to practice in order to not change the settings during use. When set on hot/high, the velocity of the air is very good, but it's not hot at all -- the air is barely warm -- which is fine for drying, but certainly not good for styling. It did minimize my static flyaway hair, but since I had to use my old &#34;hot&#34; dryer to style, I lost that benefit and had to add leave-in conditioner to de-electrify my hair. The price was good, hence the two stars, but I don't recommend. Probably better for short hair."
1,"really thought the reviews SOLD me on this product. So I bought this, only to be less then impressed. Waited for the &#34;tasky&#34; ness to arrive , It did within the 30 secs alotment. Problem was...it didnt keep my eyelashes staying. Then too boot, My upper lid got a nice reaction ( I  must be alergic to this glue!!). If anyone can recommend a Hypo allergenic kind, please share. I want to beleive this product (or manufacturer) is worth the praise, yet my personal experience states otherwise...."
1,"For an inexpensive mask, this does the job for my face, especially when I have a small breakout.  I've been using this for 14 years and hasn't let me down since.  I use it a few times a week to keep the acne down with a minimum time of 20 minutes.  However after removing it, tone (if needed) and moisturize (if necessary) I have recognize it can be somewhat drying, but it's not too bad, in my opinion.  Still the best mask I use for breakouts."
1,Ok so I just put this on the small zits and it dries out. It has to be re applied more than once but it does the trick.
1,This is a scent free solution for inexpensive body wash. This product is also good at keeping skin soft and moisturized for both sexes and any age. I highly recommend this product to the general public as an alternative to cheap scented products that give you a headache - use this instead.
1,"I have really fine hair, that is often very flat. It refuses to be back combed, and mostly just lays flat... unless it's humid, in which case it lies flat and does that annoying wispy curl thing. Usually I try flipping my hair over, drying from below, or using a vent brush of some sort, or a round brush, but they all caused static, which would turn into the annoying wispy curl thing. So, when my friend (who is also my hairdresser) recommended this, I figured &#34;why not?&#34;I absolutely love it. I can get volume with no static, and without having to flip my hair over in the morning. The vent design helps my hair to dry faster, and actually keeps it pretty sleek at the same time. Occasionally I'll have to use a spritz or two of Kahm hair oil, but most of the time, the brush is enough. It's a good investment, especially for folks who know how to style hair. Another plus is that it doesn't actually pull my hair, and detangles it pretty nicely!"
1,I have been looking for a product to help reduce the apperance of the pores on my cheeks. This stuff is awesome! I noticed a difference within a week. I have gotten compliments that my skin looks the best it has in a long time! I highly recommend giving it a try. I use it with the daily face wash. Will continue to use!
1,"This works great for a basic face wash.  I usually let it soak in for a minute or two (while I brush my teeth) and when I rinse it off, my skin is soo soft."
1,"I like the smell and my face feels fresh and clean after using it. It produces many bubbles and it's easy to use!But when your face is really dry, don't use it because it hurts."
1,"I use this both night AND morning and have never experienced a break out, rash, or any such thing. I used to use Clinique oil-free ""moisture in control"" because I would frequently break out. While I didn't break out after using it, my skin didn't feel moisturized, and after turning 40 that is key. I've been using Neutrogena Light Night Cream for over a year and love that it also contains few ingredients, no fragrance and NO sunscreen. Personally I don't like the idea of rubbing sunscreen into my face every morning, especially when I don't spend much time outside during the day. So I recommend giving this a try for both morning and night applications for sensitive skin. It makes my skin soft and moisturized but never greasy feeling. I use this in conjunction with Regenerist for sensitive skin."
1,This does not make my skin feel greasy. It absorbs very quickly and has helped my skin so much. Since I have been using this I don't have any cystic acne which is a major plus.
1,"Soft, luxurious cotton pads. They are the ultimate in the perfect cotton pad for everything you would use a cotton pad for. I'm totally spoiled now."
1,I use this product almost daily. It really helps with my brittle and dry nails. When I miss more than three days I can tell a big difference.
1,This color is by far my favorite nude. I have been using 2 coats and it looks great. Love this color. True nude color.
1,"No applicator?? The least they could do is include one!! What a rip off. You are basically paying for the name, the shadow itself is nothing special. I won't buy anymore. Now I have to buy applicators."
1,"I have acne prone skin and over the years I've used benzoil peroxide, sacyclic acid which is what most acne washes and creams contain and this one by far beats all of them. I leave on my pimples overnight, it's not harsh on my skin, literally dries my pimples over night. I have recommended to friends. Best of all, this product last a long time and is not expensive."
1,This product totally covers the redness I have on my face! I dont even need to use concealer with it. it's great for when youre in a hurry and you dont have time to do the whole concealer foundation powder routine. Good for oily skinned people. I suggest you wait a little bit before you apply this powder if you use a moisturizer otherwise it will may go on cakey. A little bit goes a long way.
1,"I've tried them all. This is clearly the best adhesive. It holds up well, dries quickly and is virtually waterproof. So cry a few tears of joy as you will not have to worry about your lashes coming loose. I like the dark rather than the clear as the dark fills in any little spaces between your own or the false lashes."
0,Will never purchase again.  Zero results and I was very disciplined in taking these tablets.  No difference in nails or hair.  None!!!
1,"Although the smell seems to have changed (it used to remind me of play-dough and I loved it), it still works great.  I use it on myself and my daughters as a detangler/ leave in conditioner and it does provide a lovely shine.  I will continue to purchase this product - it's one of those I have realized I just prefer to keep in my cabinet over most other!"
1,"This is a very cool product. I have dry skin, and I even used to have dry patches on my cheeks, which didn't look good at all, especially with makeup. This creme does make skin much smoother, and much fresher. It is not scented- it has a little bit of unpleasant chemical smell, but it's very faint, and you can't smell it on the skin (and I'm super sensitive to smells).It stings quite a bit when you first start using it, and my skin looked pretty red too, but that doesn't last more than 15 minutes. Also, the first week or two after I started using this moisturizer I started to break out a little- that is a temporary effect too. I guess, this is how this stuff works- that must be some sort of cleansing process for the skin. Now that I've used this for about a month my skin is MUCH smoother and is much more clear, I can even skip the foundation, but if I do use foundation it goes on nice and smooth.I have been using Alph Hydrox nourishing cleanser with this. For daytime use, I apply just a thin layer of this creme, wait for about 5-10 minutes, and apply my spf moisturizer, and then makeup (sunblock is  a must after this product, cause AHA is an exfoliator, and makes your skin more sensitive to UVA/UVB). For night use if my skin feels dry, I sometimes apply some Alpha Hydrox nourishing night creme (it doesn't contain AHAs).I'm not sure if this does much for lines and wrinkles- first, I don't have many, and I haven't used this long enough, but this creme does a wonderful job for dry skin with patches, and for uneven skin, through faster renewal, and dead skin cell removal.I definitely recommend this product, it's a great, truly effective creme, and you can't really beat the price!"
1,"I used to use toners from the Body Shop, and after a while I noticed that my skin dried up and become tougher, so I stopped using it. I use this toner just a couple of times and feels my skin softens and even more clear. It's a beautiful toner, I will continue to use it and hopefully it will be this way forever!"
1,"This is probably a personal preference on mascara, because it's not a bad mascara. I just find I prefer a thicker, heavier mascara. I've always prefered Maybelline for mascaras over any other brand, but this particular kind isn't my style.The brush is big and bushy, which leaves the lashes very clean of any extra mascara. As a result, you get a light and subtle look."
1,"Just like the shampoo, I bought this quickly for travel.  I wish it had more fragrance and was a bit more conditioning but other than that, I would buy these again."
1,"I love this product!  I've gotten my mom, grandmother, and sister hooked on it too!  I used to use a moisturizer then foundation, but now I can combine it into one step!  I'll never go back!"
0,"This product not only didn't cover gray, but it didn't grab my hair at all.  Not worth the price and special order."
0,this doesn't help my dry sensitive skin.  i was using it often and whenever i go for a facial or to a makeup counter they tell me i need to exfoliate so I know it's not working for me.
1,"This really is as good as they claim! Apply on cuticles, and they will appear soft and moisturized. It also has a really good lemon smell. You also don't have to use much each time, so the box will last long."
1,"This was recommended by a make up artist and I don't regret purchasing it! I purchase 4 shades - Taj Mahal, Orgasm, Sex appeal, Torrid and I ordered two more through Amazon and anxiously waiting on their arrival- Luster and Douceur! I cant wait to get them. It is more expensive than MAC but it is worth every cent!  It is pigmented,goes on smoothly and the finish is wow! Wearing this blush alone looks beautiful!"
1,Can't beat that.  It's thicker than other moisturizers but it also has the light makeup in it.  It goes on nicely and is not a heavy coverage light foundation.  Very nice and smooth.  My skin is quite fair and this provides just enough color.
1,"I love setting powders or finishing powders as I think they give a more professional edge to a look.  They also help it last a lot longer, which is essential if you work 16 hour days and don't have time to do touchups.  The Derma Blend setting powder is completely white meaning it doesn't compromise the color palette you've already created.  Trust me on your skin it doesn't look white.  The container is the standard shaker container, where you tap it out into the cap.  But what is nice about this one is that you don't get too much in the cap, which makes it a lot less messy to close as you don't need to use a lot.  It does have a slight matting effect, but this can be countered with a very light hand and/or the use of a setting spray.  I have a tendency to use this not just for foundation, but also for cream eyeshadow or to create lip stain out of lipstick.  I love the texture that it leaves your face with, I catch myself touching my cheeks because it feels some nice."
1,"I got a slightly different assortment of things in my kit: I got a Lemon scented Vitamin E bath and body oil, orange essence soap, and peppermint soap instead of whatever that are in the kit sold here.I would say that my favorite is the banana hand creme! That just smells way too good-- it smells better than a banana, in fact, it smells like banana bread fresh out of the oven! I put this stuff on like every other hour just to sniff it. Thats why I went and got a full sized = )The soaps are kind of small, they go quickly...but I love the peppermint one.The cuticle creme I would say is the most useful, because I also use it as lip balm (if you compare the ingredients with their lip balm, it's not that different), and it works well on lips because it smells delicious and is very thick.  I don't have problems with my cuticles, but I imagine it would work well on those too. Seriously, that little tin of creme lasts a LONG time.The milk and honey stuff is my second favorite, I also went and got a full sized bottle of that. It seems watery at first but it forms into a nice protective thick creme as soon as you spread it around and it leaves my face and body soft for hours. It also smells like heaven, my cat keeps wanting to drink it.The honey lip balm...ugh. I cannot stand the strong perfume-ish musky smell. It does not smell that natural to me. I gave it to my bf and he likes it (thats what boyfriends are for ^_^).The hand salve is useless. I would say that's the only thing in there that could be replaced. It does not smell good and it is way to greasy.The lemon scented oil works very well on dry skin, better than the honey milk lotion, so I am using it carefully = )Over all, this would make a great treat for yourself or your loved one."
1,"I have been using Mustela for both of my two children for over 4 years. This is one of my favorite products from it. Baby smells so refreshing and skin feels so soft after bath. Both of my two children have quite sensitive skin, and they never have any issues with  Mustela."
1,"this iron works great, and this is the advertised prices on other sites such as folica.com . it heats up in less than 20 seconds, and can reach up to 450 degrees farenheit. the higher settings work better on ethnic hair. i have blonde hair that is long and over processed, but it looks great. my favorite feature is definately the fast heat up, now waking up late doesnt keep me from straightening my hair"
1,"I always come back to this product - -others I've tried are heavy, don't seep into the skin or flat don't moisturize.  This always makes my skin feel and look good."
1,"I have used this product for years, and I have also had temporary fillers in my lips, the last time being about 4 years ago.While the fillers may have stimulated my own collagen, since I have used this product I don't feel the need for injected fillers. It does really work - but it is subtle and it takes time. You may see a slight difference immediately but over time if you use it consistently (best at night), you will see a difference in your lip fullness, but it will never approach what you get from injected fillers.It won't take someone with very thin lips and render them with a totally juicy pout, but it will add a bit of volume for sure with regular use(I would estimate 15-20% increase).It is pricey but I have tried the other similar products from department stores and drug stores and this is the best of its kind - except for the paraben issue.I have also used the XL version and the new 'infatuation' line (that does NOT have parabens) and I haven't found either as effective as this version.I have also noticed - as  has others Ive talked to- that the tinted versions aren't as effective as the clear. I don't know why, but that has been my experience."
1,At the stores this is about 25 or 26 bucks you can't beat this price great product I also got the matte one to I will be buying again with these prices
1,"I love this one of Revlon. The colour really suits me - I have brown hair, fair skin, and blue eyes. I would recommend it to anyone!"
1,"I started buying this as a lighter option for both sun protection and moisturizer. I also wanted to even out the ruddiness in my cheeks. It wasn't awful, but I felt like my skin could be more even. I've been buying this product ever since.Not only has my skin become more even toned and better moisturized, I've actually found that daily use reduces the number of pimples I get. I've never had full-blown acne, just the occasional pimple or two in my t-zone, especially around my nose and mouth. With this moisturizer, my skin is able to relax a bit with oil production, or at least produce it more evenly throughout the day, and I almost never break out anymore. I think it also helps keep me from getting mild sunburns, which dry the skin out and then cause it to overproduce oils to replace it.Basically, this lotion is awesome and you should buy like 10 of them.For general reference: I'm a 23 year old female with fair, combination skin."
1,"Great intense dark red but the color fades quickly, you will definitely have to keep on top of a monthly application."
1,"I recently got many ance. After I use this product, my face generated more oil, which made my ance even serious."
1,"This is priced a bit on the expensive side but is definitely worth it. This will last you between 2-3 months with daily use (I use 2 squeezes per day) You do not need a large quantity to fully moisturize your face. The best part is, it lasts all day."
0,within 2 weeks of my purchase this item stopped working. contacted customer service and was SOL since i had disposed of the box already
1,This face makeup I have used for many years and have always been pleased with the color and the staying effect of the makeup over a long day.  I used a face powder to set my makeup and the face powder is also L'Oreal.  In this price range this is a good makeup.
1,"L'Oreal Preference 6R Light Auburn is a rich radiant red hair color that is easy to use and comes off just the color that is pictured on the box. I've been using this for several years, and it looks so natural that most people think it is my natural hair color. ( I'm really a mousy brown.) It only takes about twenty minutes to develop, and I use it once a month. Very nice!"
1,just a drop is all you need cause this stuff goes a long way.I use this to stretch my ear lobes.I would buy  this again.
1,I have a busy life i am in front of the cameras with hot lights and tons of make up 5-6 days a week so its inevitable that i will get acne and this stuff not only gets rid of existing acne but keeps new acne from forming its a life saver
1,"I'd prefer not to use products from companies that do animal testing. I've used the Rainbow henna in red, but I was suspicious as to whether it was real henna since it didn't stain my hands at all and it only called for leaving it on my hair an hour, which high quality henna I've used stained my hands terribly and took hours on my head to take. I'm not complaining on the price, though. It did leave a reddish stain, but lightened my hair a bit. I'd like to try the blonde to see if it lightens even more, but again, I'm wondering what other dyes or ingredients are added to this product as it doesn't seem like real henna to me. I'm also wondering about animal testing esp. since this henna does not seem 100% natural as it claims."
1,Does what it needs to do and travels well. The compact has held up well in my bag and is great for quick touch-ups.
1,"Out of all of the current Pond's cleansing products, this is the best for removing eye makeup.  It takes off everything, and leaves your skin moisturized.  Please note the size of this particular container - it's very small."
1,"I've bought many of these over the years--not because they're so awesome, but because this is what I chose to begin with, and I break a bottle or so a year, and I've found it cheaper to buy the 4-chamber model with free prime shipping than order replacement bottles.Because the spout is at the bottom and the fill hole is at the top, you can't set these on a flat surface to refill, you have to hold them, which is awkward and makes them easy to drop. 75% of they time a bottle is dropped, unless it's completely empty, it will break. It's closer to 50% with empty bottles, still pretty crappy. If you're lucky, just the tip will break and you'll still be able to use it, though it will gt clogged and make a big mess on the wall. If the neck breaks, it's a goner.Aside from that (which is a big con--I would probably not choose the same design unless they changed the type of plastic in use or the design of the bottles), it's a nice dispenser and makes for a  clean shower without a bunch of cruddy-bottled half-filled bottles. I have the 3-bottle and 3-bottle with mirror versions."
1,I absolutely love this color. Very fun to have on during the spring and summer months. And it goes on very smooth. OPI nail color is always the best.
1,"Adore the smell!! I like putting it on at night....goes on smoothly and just smells yummy (French Vanilla scent). I'm not sure how much it really moisturizers my skin, so might switch back to Aveeno, which is a fabulous winter body moisturizer, alas without the delicious scent that this one has. A nice product."
1,"I always use this. It's fast and gets even waterproof mascara off quickly & completely. I use one side of the pad for one eye, turn it over and do the other eye. I do add a couple of drops of water on the pad and it works just fine, staying moist enough to do both eyes."
1,I use essential oils for washing my hair because I do the &#34;no shampoo&#34; thing which involves washing your hair with apple cider vinegar and baking soda. Washing my hair with essential oils ensures my hair smells nicer. I used peppermint oil before this and I liked the smell a lot better. I used the lemon as a air freshener as well (put it in spray bottle with witchhazel and water) and it just smelled okay. So many people commented that they love the lemon smell because it smells &#34;clean&#34; but it just makes me think of cleaning products rather &#34;nature.&#34;
1,"I love these hot rollers. They're easy to use and give my hair body. I have straight hair and it usually doesn't hold a curl long, but these work great on it.I haven't used hot rollers for probably 25 years, but now that I'm going to look for a job again and want some variety in my look (and for going out too), so I bought these. I just have to say that I like this new technology, with the fast heat up, the ionic ceramic rollers and the slit in the clips. It just makes things a lot easier.I did find that the heat-resistant plastic clips are a little ""saggy"" when they're clipped onto the roller. This might be because they don't have long teeth. I do like that they warm up and fast too, though. I don't want tight curls against my head, I like the look of curls and waves more towards the lower 2/3 of my now shoulder-length hair.So the way it works is that the unit is plugged in and then you can switch it on or off. The rollers heat up in 2 minutes, or so it says and they're flocked so they're warm to the touch but not scalding when held. They have a slit in them to hold the ends of hair in place. The hair is rolled up and the warmed clip is put on. I didn't have a problem with the clip not holding, but it doesn't hold hair tight against the scalp. It kind of sags a good inch or so down from the roots.I leave mine on for 10 minutes and then unroll. This is more than sufficient to give me curls. I was surprised when I first started using these, because the curl was pretty tight. I like waves so use the two largest rollers. The warmed clip heats the other end of the hair that's not held on by the rollers and keeps the curl intact from start to the clip."
0,"My experience was not like any the reviews I read. The packaging, the product - it all came the way it was supposed to. New. It only took a little over a week for it to be clumpy and gunk up my lashes. After wearing it all day I would have super cute dark rings under eyes. So obviously it couldn't even stay put. After a few weeks of daily use its almost gone. I only paid maybe nine dollars, but I was hoping for something better. I'm not sure what it would take for me to try it again. Overall , this mascara was a stinker."
1,Sadly I have to report that I am not using my frownies....I vought them for some deep creases that had developed around my mouth.  But they are uncomfortable to wear and don't stick as well as I hoped when used with face cream.
1,"So i have been using the Avalon Organics both Shampoo and Conditioner for a few months now. I have seen a pretty good result. My hair has definitely gotten a bit thicker and stronger. I notice less hair falling out. I have combined this shampoo/conditioner with also taking Biotin Supplements so i do not know if its solely because of the shampoo/conditioner or a combination between the both, but improvement is there. My only one complain is that the conditioner doesnt give you that soft conditioner feel other conditioners give you.. Its a little rough as oppose to soft. In conclusion, if you have thin hair i recommend both products as well to supplement with a daily Biotin vitamin."
1,"I love Burmax line of products . It is an investment well worth the money. These brushes can be used for to detangle hair, smooth hair , as well as blow dry. I have 4 of these brushes and use them on my clients as well."
1,I use the purity with a mia clarisonic.  The 16 oz bottle is more affordable than the clarisonic cleaner.  Saves me money and works great.
1,"I bought this because it was on the top ten colognes for men on some site i went too on google. Anyways, it smells really great and lasts all day. I work in a corporate office and its 8 hour days and this scent lasts well pass the time i get home. Warning: you dont need a lot of sprays for this, a few well placed squirts around the neck and the wrists and your good to go. I recommend this, it came well before the estimated delivery time, nothing was tampered with and it smells really great. Get this fragrance and smell like a BOSS!"
1,this was nice till it got too thick to apply and eventually turned green in the cabinet. not sure if it was just this one since it was old.
0,"Great idea, Seemed to be just what my doctor ordered but hard to position toes in loops.  Just get it right then time to take it off and wash.  Easy care, just wash and dry but then start all over fitting iton your toes.  If not fitted right, not too confortable.  Have used better items to straighten my toe."
1,"I love this stuff.  I feel like (after 2 months), it really does make a difference in the smoothness of my face and has reduced (but not eliminated, let's be real) the fine lines and wrinkles.  I feel like this has a bigger impact that the red moisturizing lotion from Olay."
1,"I picked this up since my daily Clinique moisturizer wasn't working for me in the winter time.  I have clog-prone skin with some sensitivity. I cannot wear products with mineral oil at all.I cannot say enough about this product! I wish I would have known about it years ago. My skin loves this stuff and is not breaking out - that's a miracle in itself.  It's fragrance-free which really is essential. I don't understand why other companies continue to put fragrance in skin-care products.This face cream is more of a rich lotion and it's hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic and fragrance-free. It has what you need and doesn't have what you don't need. I hate to have to rave, but I think it's perfect (for me at least). It plumps my skin and has properties that attract moisture and hold it in.  Over time it works even better and restores the delicate mantle of the skin.Apparently, this is often recommended by dermatologists and now I know why. It's a bland, yet highly effective face cream that really does what it says."
0,"I typically love Neutrogena products, so I was really disappointed in this. My biggest issues are:-It's kind of watery, yet leaves your face looking/feeling very greasy. Almost like applying sunscreen.-It has a really nasty, cloying smell (like sunscreen).-Doesn't seem to really moisturize, just sits on top of your skin. This makes it difficult to apply make up over it.I now use Clinique dramatically different lotion, and I LOVE it. I do not recommend this product."
1,"As long as you don't over apply and focus on getting the glue right on the ends, it is great product!"
1,"Love love these! I use them everyday not just for travel, nice and compact, heat fast enough for me tho maybe not quite as quickly as others and the curl they give is fantastic. The grooves on each one seem to grab onto the hair and separate to give more curl and don't get the loose ends to retrieve onto the curler like others I have had. I have always liked the metal holders better than all the newer style ones as they leave no ridges and keep the curler in place really snugly. I had an old one by conair that only had 8 curlers which were never enough nor did they curl so well and twelves is perfect for me at least. Shipping was super quick as always with Amazon."
0,"I'm in my early 40's and have started to get laugh lines (not so funny), and I tried these. They actually feel really hard after applied to y face, and don't hold as well as they should. In the morning, it kind of hurts to pull them off. I went back to my mom's method of using the clear bandaid tape."
1,"I put this lotion on for the first time 5 minutes ago. It is AMAZING! It absorbed immediately, with no greasy residue. It smells incredible, feels incredible, and I love that the first three ingredients are water, coconut, and aloe. Consider me a customer for life!"
1,I love this lotion. I buy it in bulk and use nothing else. I use it on my son after his baths. It is gentle yet very moisturizing. Not greasy.
1,"I'm not sure I would call the fragrance, basil, but it has a wonderful herbal smell that I love.  While it isn't overwhelming, the fragrance stays on your hands for a while after you dry them.  I'll probably try the dish soap in the basil next.I've been buying Mrs. Meyers products for several years and love to buy them by the case on Amazon because the price is more reasonable and I don't have to worry about running out for a while.  I've also used the Geranium, Lemon Verbena and Lavender and love them all.You can't go wrong with Mrs. Meyers products and will probably want to try more of their cleaning products after you experience this one."
1,"I ordered this product because I wanted to try to grow my hair after having some hair issues.  I researched and reviewed this product and decided to give it a try.  I took these for about 3 months and I must say I saw growth!  The only issue I had was that the dosage required so many pills (with the hair vitamin and the mineral booster) and the pills were big - and I am an awful pill taker - a big baby really :-) But I forced myself to be consistent and I was not disappointed. In the 3 month I took this, I saw about 4 inches of growth!!! So that is above the .5 inch a month I normally see!!"
1,nice subtle scent
1,"that is Rok's saying...their promise so to speak. i do have to say i have just been using it around my eyes, and around my mouth for fine lines and deep crow's feet. i would have to say...i thinnk it works! it is so hard to tell without a before and after pic, but if i had to guess i would say it IS working!  i am going to bye some retin a, and use it like every 3 sdays or so along with this product to maybe speed up the process. very happy.pnly complaint is it is a small tube that is why i use it on spot places only!"
1,"I just colored my hair with this product this morning. It came out better than I expected. I thought that it would come out looking dull since it is such a dark color, but it is shiny and looks great. I am hoping it doesn't fade quickly. Only four stars since I am not sure how long it will last as of yet."
1,Its just what I needed. Its a simple blow dryer but it works just fine for being so cheap. I like how its effective in the mornings after a long shower.
1,"I have been using this sunscreen everyday for about 1 year.  I use it everyday, rain or shine.  I hike about 28 to 35 miles per week, mostly in the southern california SUN, and it works.  I have oily skin, and it does not cause breakouts."
1,"Pros:  Burt's Bees makes some great products and this is one of themProvides good protectionCons:  Size is sort of small - opt for a larger size, if availableFlavor was okay, but not the best - there are better ones out there.Burt's Bees products are legendary and while this would normally get 5 stars in relation to competing products, Burt's has set the expectation bar high and as a result slips in at 4 stars based on the cons I listed above."
1,"The rotator button got stuck and at first, it wouldn't turn on until I hit the try button and then took the plug out of the outlet and hit reset. The picture makes it look fancy, but once I opened the box, I could tell this was cheaply made. It does style much better than others, but it wasn't worth it compared to others."
1,It's a lovely light refreshing perfume. Lovely for daywear. Loves it guys!
1,I bought this particular mirror because the one I had was beginning to become loose where the mirror swivels. The 5X is just great for me. I love the color and the price was just right. Can't put my make-up on without it. Would definitely recommend it.
1,"This is great for the skin, it doesn't dry complexion out, makes it more even and pimple free. Also face looks refreshed and younger. Totally love it, so simple and cheap but better than more expensive pads I've tried."
1,"I love this product and plan to buy it again! Not only does this spray hold EVERY BIT as well as normal (toxic) hairsprays, but it also washes out 10 times easier!! The minute the warm water of your shower hits it, it dissolves. No more scrubbing and scrubbing to get all the gunk of normal sprays out of your hair (of course all of this scrubbing also ruins your hair by totally stripping it!). And its non toxic for the environment! What's not to like!!Later: I do note that if you touch the hair that has been sprayed when it is dry, it can create a white residue.....guess Ive found the downside."
1,"I have the oiliest skin and this is the only eyeliner that I have ever used that doesn't smudge.  Not even after a hard gym workout.  I love the soft tip applicator and the long last formula.Then, it comes off easily when I wash my face with Cetaphil at the end of the day.  This is the one makeup product that I own that I know will last all day long.  Thinking about buying this?  You should, its awesome."
1,"This product is not at all good for short hair.  The barrel is huge!  I know the description gives the 1-1/2"" measurement but nowhere does it say anything about hair length recommendations.  I have to wrap my hair around half the brush and hold it there with my hand (hot!) because it doesn't even begin to wrap enough to stay on there.  Slightly better luck with the curling iron attachment.  This will be a fine product if you have at least shoulder length hair.  Otherwise, look elsewhere.  Now I am hoping mine burns up so I can return it at Amazon's expense instead of mine."
1,"I'm still not sure how this product is working (thus, I can only give it four stars), but it seems pretty nice. I was using castor oil for a few months to try and prevent wrinkles and get rid of fine lines around my eyes. It was too thick for my skin though (I just turned 20, and have thin, normal/dry white-person skin). I remembered seeing jojoba oil in Trader Joes and buying some when I was around 17 for my acne...but now that my acne isn't tooooo bad, I'm going for anti-aging. I still have some acne/acne-prone skin, but jojoba oil doesn't make me break out.I wear a physical 55-70+ sunscreen everyday I leave the house, and since it is the physical stuff it makes my skin white and a bit dry looking. With jojoba oil in my sunscreen I can apply a 25 cent amount to my face and neck with no problems -- plus it makes my skin shiny, but not too much!The one issue I have noticed is that sometimes my skin feels dry/tight. I never experienced this until using jojoba oil. So yea...maybe in another 15 years or so I'll give an Amazon-update on how jojoba oil and my entire regimen has worked for my skin. If they don't have an anti-aging pill or something out by then, then hopefully my update will help people decided whether to take or leave what I used/jojoba oil. XDAnyways, this oil is very light, contains natural spf, and good as a conditioning-treatment for hair. :)"
1,"I have been using this brand for over 10 years now and consider it a necessary part of my makeup routine. I use it for highlighting my nose bridge, under my eyes to even out the skin color, and around my lips as a base to set liner. I blend it in with a colored liquid foundation and it blends well. The stick holds up for months and months - I usually go through 1 a year."
1,"I have this in our guest bathroom shower and it is perfect.  The bottles hold only about 2/3 of the full size one I have in our master bath, but that is fine since the occasional use it gets doesn't facilitate a lot of refilling.  I loath those wire shelving units for showers so I was so excited to find this and have everything off the floor and kept together for easy use in such a tidy little package.This comes with the silicone adhesive AND a few squares of adhesive foam backing, the idea is you spread the silicone on and the adhesive foam squares hold it in place while it dries.  You have to wait 24 hours before filling the bottles to allow the silicone glue to cure. I have one of these in my master bath for 3 years without budging so it is a very strong hold."
1,"Delightful shampoo works well AND looks good while it waits to be used.  I also transfer it into clear, vinyl liquid soap pumps to stand on my vanities--matching colors to decor.  As a hand cleaner, there is none better."
1,"Covers gray well, especially on the hairs of the beard and side-burns. I had to practice a little to get the hang of it. A little goes a long way. I learned to just apply it to the hair only brushing upward. I haven't noticed that the color runs when I sweat, so that is good news."
1,I've been attacked by dry itchy skin over the last few months and this is the only item that helps to soothe my skin. Thank you Aveeno!
1,"It's a really nice comb to use on wet hair.  It doesn't pull or break the hair.I like the two rows of the ""teeth"" on the comb.I love the tortoise shell."
1,I love this little set.  It heats quickly and curls my hair very well.  I have long straight hair.  It is nice and small and fit well in my suitcase for travel.
1,This is the third time that I bought this foundation. It does a great job hiding some imperfections. Absolutely recommend it!
1,I give up on every other cleanser. I've tried SO many. I have acne-prone skin and this cleanser helps keep breakouts under control in combination with the rest of my regimen (all Philosophy products except 50% apple cider vinegar 50% water as toner after cleansing). The smell reminds me of Earl Grey tea at first. Love it.
1,"I like this cleanserIt does burn your eyes, which is strange because it's natural, but I think it's the tea tree oil.The smell is rather strong- but I don't even notice it anymore.This cleanser cleanses very well (makeup came off beautifully, even eye makeup) and it doesn't leave my skin feeling too tight!Nor does it make my skin too red, which is the problem I have with most cleansers.My face has cleared up tremendously while using this cleanser and Alpha Hydrox AHA Lotion.TIP:Use a foam pump! This cleanser is made to be used in a foam pump, that's why it's so watery. I bought a foam pump that contains dial soap for $1.77 at my walmart, and emptied the soap out, rinsed the container, and added this face wash. It works beautifully!Whomever said in their review that coconut oil is bad for your skin must be mistaken, because everything I've read says it's a great oil for skin because of it's lauric acid and natural antimicrobial properties.I recommend you try this cleanser! The price is great and I truly love the natural ingredients over any store brand I have tried."
1,"This creme is priced well, very hydrating, is not perfumey, and it doesn't clog my pores. It won't make old wrinkles disappear, but since it's so hydrating I do notice my wrinkles stand out a lot more when I don't use it. Whether or not it prevents new wrinkles, I don't know; but, I do get told frequently I look much younger than I am. As a side note, I think it feels very nice and refreshing on the skin."
0,"It does remove most of my eye makeup but not all. When I use it, it seems to remove it all but then I wash my face and see black mascara rings under my eyes. I'm using as directed, so I feel  it's not that effective. Also, it is moisturizing but too 'oily' for me. I find myself wiping my eyes on my face towel but still feel a residue around my eyes. I think it's all right but I wouldn't purchase again. Almay's makeup remover pads did a much better  job but they were somewhat drying ... so I'm still on the lookout for an ideal mascara remover"
1,"Bought it to brush my beard. Works absolutely magnificently! Well made, comfortable, no prickly bristles. Keeps me looking like an outright respectable mountain man!"
1,I've used this cream for the past 10 years and I love it!I mix it 1:1 with my foundation and it gives my skin a fantastic glow. It's also great on its own. Highly recommended!
0,I should have known that this product would make me break out.  The scent is extremely strong.  People with sensitive skin should avoid this product.  I ordered 3 bottles of this lotion based on the reviews.  I gave the lotion to my insensitive friends and they love it:)
1,"No perfumes, no dyes, no taste.  This is a great lip moisturizer for someone who is looking for something simple and non-irritating.  I apply this less than I did when I used Burt's Beeswax (too minty).  It feels great."
1,"I really wanted to love this product.  I really did.  But I just didn't.  I really don't understand all the hype.  The reason I'm not a huge fan is for the reason that even though they tell you you only need a small amount, that wasn't the case for me to cover up my redness and dark circles.  I still had to use a lot, and even when I did use a lot, it still never covered my dark circles or my red spots from previous acne, not even when I used a green concealer over them first.  The only thing I loved about this product is that it didn't even feel like I was wearing foundation.  My skin could ""breathe"".  If you have naturally perfect skin that really doesn't need much other than foundation, you'll love this product.  If you have serious dark circles, or dark spots, or redness on your face, then this isn't for you."
0,"but i don't. the biggest thing is that it just doesn't dry. i put it on and then take my sweet time putting on makeup so that this thing has plenty of time to do its thing, but my hair comes out about as wet as if i'd wrapped it in a microfiber towel for a few minutes (which is to say, maybe 10 percent dry--not dripping, but definitely wet and not damp). there are other things i don't like about it, such as the hose doesn't fasten to the cap, just rests in the opening without any kind of clip or click or anything, which means paying attention to how much i move around to be sure the hose doesn't fall out of the cap; or that the hose is so short that the base has to be sitting pretty close to me the whole time. for now, i'll stick with my hard-bonnet dryer on a floor stand. doesn't allow for much mobility, but it's way more effective at actually drying."
1,"Used to buy this stuff at Pearl River Market in Manhattan but was so happy to see we could still get it when we moved!Great product, great scent, has been around for ages. Gave a few bars to my brother for Christmas and now he is hooked. Can't go wrong. Great scent for men or women. A case lasts a long long time :)"
1,"This the best face moisturizer that I've ever tried. I started putting it on after showering, and after just a couple of weeks started noticing healthier looking skin.I've tried quite a few different types of face moisturizers, and the only other two that match the effectiveness are hemp-seed oil, and coconut oil, but they both have downsides that the aloe doesn't. The hemp seed oil looks oily on your skin, and my wife hates the taste of the coconut oil :-)"
1,I love Aveeno lotions.  They have helped to keep my eczema under control in the winters.  They keep your skin happy.
0,"I used this dye on my sister who dyes her hair red a lot. She's currently out of work (recently had a baby) and hadn't dyed her hair in months (pregnant), so we decided it would be fun to do. She chose this color because it's a bit deeper than she normally does, and she wanted to have a more intense red than she can get away with at work while she doesn't have to work. Our plan was to use this and use something like Manic Panic over some pieces to make them even more red (which we've done before with her usual reds, and it always works out well), but this came out soooo dark it looks black until it's in the light. It's like purple-red black. It's lightened up after a wash or two, but still much darker than she anticipated. We didn't even bother with step 2, adding Manic Panic over sections, because we know it's so dark it won't make much of, if any, difference. It's a nice color, but not anything like it looks on the box. She's very fair (like me, which you can see in some of my other reviews of hair dyes I've used personally), so it's a much starker contrast than she anticipated.That said, the dye itself works well, processes quickly, and wasn't overly damaging to her hair. The shampoo/conditioner combo that comes with it seems to be working well for her also (she has very long, thick, curly hair). The dye starts out a deep cherry red which lead us to originally believe it would be much brighter than we expected, but it then turned purple-ish as it processed."
1,"I have used these rollers for many years and love them because they do create a long lasting, natural curl without damaging my hair.  Only one downside, if you have hard water, the mineral build-up will ruin the steamer after about a year.  Since we got a water softener I have had no problems."
1,I love this product!  I is creamy and potent so that it truly helps your hands heal when they are dry and cracked.
1,"This HUGE bottle works well, does what it should, and doesn't have an overpowering scent. It leaves my skin feeling clean, but not tight and dry, and does seem to keep the oil at bay most of the day. I love it and will definitely order more!"
1,"omg. i love this product so much, and it really works as well. the thing this product has that most acne products dont have is that it smells good for once. reallly happy about this product and worth your money."
1,"When I put this on, I can actually feel it working on my body. Kist fantastic! Thank you for creating this!"
1,"I have been very pleased with my purchase of Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Creme, Anti-Wrinkle Exfoliant.  I use it along with a moisturizer each night.  It tingles at times, but not to any extreme.  It is not greasy or too heavy, but seems to last on my skin throughout the night.  Happily, there is a notable difference in my skin!  I see fewer lines and my face is soft and much smoother.  For the price, it is a bargain that lasts far longer than expensive products of a similar nature.  I have found a product in Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Creme, Anti-Wrinkle Exfoliant that I will purchase again and again."
0,"For the price, there are much better options.  I was hoping for some good news using this product, but it actually didn't improve and got worse.  I switched to another product and it seems to work much better."
1,"I am an admitted product junkie, but it's back to basics with this stuff because it works better than anything I've ever tried. I picked up a bottle in my local health food store and a mere week later was astonished and very happy with the results. My face is softer and my extremely oily skin has become much less so. This product smells nice, is not at all harsh or drying, and is just the perfect toner after washing your face. I also wash my makeup brushes with it."
1,This is my second order for this product on Amazon. It is a high quality item that displays the best results when used in conjunction with small microfiber facial pads.
0,"Terrible medicine, unnatural smell.  And the soap dries out my skin after two uses.  I just can't get passed the smell"
1,I buy this because my pores are huge. Always have been. This product visibly reduces them. It's a bit alcohol-ly. It stings when it gets close to your eyes. But I like the product.
1,"I think how this stuff works depends as much or more on your hair as it does the product. Didn't do much for coloring mine, but is nice stuff, easy to use, smells far better than chemical color ants, and leaves hair super soft. Going to try a darker shade from the same company."
1,The Reviva DMAE firming fluid really helps to firm facial skin. The texture is non greasy and perfect for all skin types. I really like this product. I would recommend this product to Amazon's customers. Great price and fast shipping!
1,"at first i was hesitant to buy this because mNY says it fits for an old people...well, this perfume shouLd use by a LADY-or any woman who wants seduction, passion...the first time i used this i told myself,""what a strong smell""..but as time goes by, i am starting to like it and gets addicted with the smell... It is true that it will blend to your natural scent... Of all the perfume i used- this is the only perfume that a stranger told me i had a great smell and even though i was 20 feet away from him, he smelled me already... I also tried many pheromones perfume , i wasted lots of money but at last I found the right perfume FOR me... I also ordered destiny and it smelled awesome too... So far, i will forever use this perfume as long as i live...(:"
1,"Smells like fish, but does the job wonderfully. The smell goes away once it's dry and it worked really well!"
1,"I love this scent, reminds me of dating my husband in college. We all shared it in the dorm. The bottle is pretty too. I never pronounce the name correctly. Good price, good packaging, very pleased."
1,"This is a really great color for if you want something that does not stand out. My only issue is that it's very sheer - you have to start to get 3+ layers of it for it to begin being opaque, which can cause more chipping if it's too thick. Wish it was less sheer."
1,Aveeno is just a great product. It smells good and I gave to a friend and she loved it. Soft skin.
1,"This definitely helps get rid of stubborn acne and residual redness. However, be careful...particularly careful with your face. I only used it once a day and it made my skin peel a LOT and became very rough - my skin is usually normal (not overly dry or oily). It also gave me contact dermatitis in one area - which I wonder if that's what other reviewers may have mistaken for acne."
1,"Pretty great - gentle enough to use as often as you desire, it will keep your hair looking lustrous and never dry!! Extra benefits are... It's organic!!"
0,"I actually owned one of these and the bristles on it were cheaply made.  When ordering this one it looked like it was made better, but on arrival, I could see that the bristles on this were just as thin and cheap plastic.  The one I had the bristles burned due to the heat and was a mess. I payed $9.97 for mine when I lived in CA.It lookes nice and works for a while, but it ended up in the trash within 8 mths of use."
1,I really like this body lotion because it is very creamy and smooth when I put it on my skin. I like that it is unscented as it doesn't bother my allergies.
1,"I have never been unhappy about anything from NARS, with this blush remember alittle goes a long way, and I think it is a great shade for the summer months."
1,"I admit to being a product junkie.. From high end to low end. As with any product , you need to use the product for a long period of time to notice results. I liked the way the product felt and it does not have sunscreen . I like to use my own sunscreen , I have noticed that products that contain sunscreen , seems to clog my pores ."
1,"Good, safe product.  No harsh chemicals; no awful smell.Dark blonde shade is rather dark-pigmented but withtime and regular washings, the color lightens up."
1,"I bought this product a few months ago and used it religiously for about a month and a half. I would use it after cleansing morning and night. I can't say that I love the product, but I also do not hate it either. The smell at first was very odd and almost unbearable, but it quickly went away and after reading about the wonderful things it could do for acne, I sucked it up. After about 2 or 3 weeks, the smell did not bother me so I was happy about that; I think I just got used to it. After using this for a month and a half, I can say that it did not do anything for my acne. It did not make it better, or worse. The only thing it really did was clean up the extra things my cleanser did not and it dried my face out slightly (I do have a sensitive face so, this might be the reason. However, I am usually pretty oily). Also, for those looking for an ""all natural"" product, this one is not. It is 14% alcohol. For me, I am trying to find more natural products and go away from the chemicals and I was disappointed that a good percentage of this was alcohol. Alcohol can be an irritant for the skin so beware. I recently just bought ""Thayer: Witch Hazel Toner"" and it is alcohol free and seems to be working on my acne. It does not have the odd smell and I love it so far. It also does not dry out my skin. I would suggest trying that one instead of Dickinsons.However, I will keep this bottle as Witch Hazel has other uses besides on the face. I give them credit because it was a good price for a large bottle and it will last a very long time. I just would not recommend for the face or for curing acne as it did nothing for me."
1,"Nice cream, nothing special though.  I like Olay products, this one is not my favorite.  Claims to do a little more than it actually does."
1,My face feels so smooth and clean after I use this. Top it off with the lotion and you'll have great feeling skin.
1,"I really like these things.  I used to not wear any type of eye wear in the tanning bed at all bc I didn't want raccoon eyes that everyone was talking about getting with those little glasses.  But, after reading into how dangerous it was to not wear any protection for your eyes and after noticing that even with my eyes closed the tanning bed lights were super freaking bright and I really felt like it was really stupid for me not to have some sort of protection on my eyes so I started looking into eyewear that wouldn't be too bad and I came across these.  They work good they don't make u have raccoon eyes so they do the job pretty well...U def can't use them in a stand up bed but then again what kind of eye wear CAN you use in a stand up bed?  I don't use the laydown beds anyways so it didn't matter but I would recommend these to my friends or anyone that doesn't want to use the eye protection from the tanning places."
1,"Best fragrance ever!!!!!! One of the greatest body scrub's out there.  I use this at least twice a week to exfoliate and moisturize my over sunned legs, arms and shoulders.  This is wonderful for winter dry skin and summer sun and pool chemical skin treatment.  For the price--this product cannot be beat--It is every bit as good as the high dollar scrubs--and I have tried them all--and always come back this.  I hate to brag about how great it is too much--because I selfishly do not want the price to go up:-0  This fragrance blends perfectly with the body lotion and perfume & perfume I use.  It is a soft fragrance.  I think Lavender is a fragrance recommended for helping in relaxation:-0  I get compliments after using this on the glow of my skin and the fragrance.  Do be careful as it does make the tub and shower a bit slippery.  Thank you for offering."
1,Love this brush. My favorite. I purchased one for my sister and I can't wait for her to use it
1,I want to try out a new product. I have used olay. It was the best one. I wanted to  try something different. So I gave this one a try. I have liked it. I would use this for now. It is cheaper at amazon. Liked it so much. I would recommend it.
1,"I bought this product to get rid of the dark spots I had on my face due to acne scars and it did help a bit.My dark spots aren't quite as noticeable but they're still there.I saw a lot of good reviews on this product, I wish it would have worked better."
1,"My grandson was visiting recently, he has such bad eczema, I was desperate!! I had this soap for awhile, and thoughtit couldn't hurt to try. I'm so glad I did, he wasn't scratching/itching or crying( he's 18 months). I was DESPERATE, toget him some relief, I can't say enough GOOD things about this soap. Except left no residue, no itching afterwards andthe biggest reward: he slept through the night! God bless your soap! I will DEFINITELY be reordering!"
1,It really soothes my face.  I have cystic acne and it is one of the few products that helps.  Tea tree oil is my secret weapon to clear skin.
1,"I purchased this item for one thing only, cutting hair, cutting my hair to be exact. This mirror is big enough for me to easily see the back of my head. The mirror is very clear, the frame is sturdy but the handle is very flimsy so be careful with the handle. Overall this is a great purchase for the price listed."
1,"Practical loose powder, great to keep around for everyday use. I wouldn't say its the best loose powder out there, but its quite decent. I used it to apply under the eyes before putting on eye shadow."
1,"This is heavier than the lotions so I normally use it on my arms and legs, and a dab on my face at night with the lotion. It's fragrance free, doesn't break me out and helps with winter itching. I recommend for sensitive skin types like mine, because cold weather makes my life miserable. Always has. Dry skin, rough hair and five months of no light. At least there's a lotion line out there that cures one of those issues. Could the makers of cetaphil please destroy winter as we know it? I'd really appreciate it, if this global warming deal doesn't work out...thanks. Oh by the way, I think they changed the formula because it's easier to spread."
1,"From reading reviews by other customers, I thought this was going to be a fantastic product that cleared everything up.  Sadly, that was not the case, I gave it away after a few uses of no noticeable difference.  I rated as okay because I probably didn't give the product long enough but I didn't think it was worth the wait."
1,"I don't even know how to express how excited I am to have found this product.  I was having flashes at least 6 times a day and night sweats as well as being a bit on the mean and moody side, but I am symptom free now and have been for at least a month now.  I do use a progesterone (natural) creme too, but it never worked as well alone as it works with the promensil.  The promensil my be just enough too, but I don't dare change anything now that I am &#34;me&#34; again!  Give this a shot, you will be quite happy!"
1,"Someone with exquisite taste gave me Happy To Be by Clinique for Women Eau de Parfum Spray 1.7 oz.  What a lovely gift!  This person could not have pleased me more!The fragrance notes are Pear Natureprint, Hibiscus Flower, Bulgarian Rose, Cocoa Butter, Sandalwood and Sesame.  It is slightly sweet, piercing, youthful, and alluring.I highly recommend this marvelous fragrance."
1,"The best product or your money, glowing fresh skin! Give it a try so worth it, trust me;) I have been using for months great results!"
1,"I bough this brush because I was tired of using my old $5 walmart brushes that my wife uses on her long hair and my daughters long hair.  I was surprised at how much I enjoy the way it runs across my scalp.  It actually feels very nice.  The only thing I don't like is that it feels small in my hands.  Other than that, it's a good buy."
1,Most perms I can watch my hair going straight before it dries. This one holds well and I'm happy with it.
1,"I have really bad allergy/eczema on my hands mainly palms or between fingers during warm months. It gets little blisters with fluid inside and that's when it gets very itchy. It's such intense itchiness that I can't stop itching... Then blisters open and crusted on the skin, then it gets cracked open. This year is the worst, it spread on my entire right hand, which really makes it difficult to do anything. I went to doctors for this, probably couple times previously, only thing they give out is prescription strength hydrocortisone that works temporarily but soon enough stop working altogether. I tried homeopathic, herbs, all kinds of stuff but this is the cream that succeeded to moisturize the cracked skin without getting itchy. Other moisturizing creams even the kind for sensitive skin or natural kind, always made my skin even more itchy though it moisturize it okay. But this cream moisturize best, and if used on my kind of skin problem, it'll feel so much better after the skin absorbs it. If your skin feels greasy after using this cream, then this must be too heavy for your dry skin. So I recommend this cream to only those who have EXTREME dryness that cracks the skin and bleed, or you have allergy/eczema like me. I sleep with glove on after I put generous amount of this cream, then my skin feels so much better in the morning. Wonderful product!"
1,"Prid is perfect for when you have a boil, infected bug bite, or even a splinter that you can't seem to get out.  Simply apply a small amount of Prid over the area that needs to have the infection removed from and cover with a bandage.  Within hours the infected area will begin to health itself.  How does this work?  I have no idea, but literally for over 30 years now, I have used this Prid faithfully to have it work beautifully.  I can't recommend this product enough, the packaging isn't fancy, but the results are unmatched."
1,"I have been using Dr. Bronners soap for a few years now and this is the best soap I have ever used! I love the 3 scents Lavender being my top and then Almond and lastly Peppermint(be careful what you wash with it can tingle). You can use this magic soap for anything! I use it as a body wash, face wash and sometimes will wash my hair with it. I also use it to clean my bathroom and kitchen. You can feel confident that you are not using a posion to wash with. I also dilute it in a hand pump and use it for hand soap. I also highly recommend diluting it for body wash. The bar soaps are good too but I prefer a liquid. The scents are real essential oils and not some fake ""scent"" aka poison. This soap does not leave a residue on your skin which is awesome."
1,"I originally got this as a part of a baby shower gift, along with other products by Mustela. I have twins and they get daily baths. I use this shampoo only for their hair (and a Johnson bubble wash for everything else). This stuff lasts for EVER. I think the girls were almost 6 mo old when I finally had to order another bottle of this. It foams really well, keeps girls' hair super soft and clean. Never any irritation.My only complaint is that I think the scent on this product is rather strong, but the girls are used to it now and since it's a part of their bedtime routine, I don't want to change things up on them."
1,"Really good one,if you don't want to have a redness on your hair,just buy it and get some glamorous look."
1,"Shopping for perfume is always a pain coz there are so many of them and you might come across more than 1 of them that you really like. It's hard to pick. But this one is different, because it's different from any other perfume and it's got very distinctive smell, and it just pops up among 100 others and you know it's your favorite.I always wanted to get one but i was not too satisfied with the price in the malls, and I just recently found it on amazon and decided to buy it. The shipping was fast, and I'm really really looking forward to it.I really really like vanilla, and I also like Burberry Brit a lot, but after comparing these two, I decided to pick this one coz it's more unique, and less ""common""."
1,"Easy clean up and very handy. Before purchasing this product I was using the manicure sticks and wrapping cotton balls around the edge (super tedious work) and when I was done I would dip in the polish remover, this process would be repeated over and over until all nails were cleaned up.  I'm glad these were invented, definitely saves time!"
1,"Better late than never! This cream is amazing, it's rich without being super greasy and has vitamins (A, C, E), no oils, no parabens, fragrance free it's very gentle yet effective. I love it and its now a staple for me. I don't know why Eucerin dosent advertise this face cream especally since it has vitamin C and E which is all the rage in anti-aging face products.My only gripe is that it needs to be in a tube not a jar because of the vitamins.Ingrediants: Water, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Stearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Octyldodecanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ubiquinone, Biotin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Beta-Carotine, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol."
1,"Formula 2 plus has totally changed my nails, I had very thin flimsy nails that always peeled.  They would crack on the side right when they got longer than my nail bed and then the whole tip would just peel right off.  I have been using Formula 2 Plus for over a year now and for the first time in my life I have to trim my nails becuase they get too long, no cracking, no peeling.  I tried formula 2 and didn't see any improvement so I switched to 2 Plus, the directions tell you that once your nails get better to go down to just Formula 2, when I did this my nails went right back to peeling and thin nails.  So I am sticking with 2 Plus but now I only have to use it every other day or so.  You really have to be committed to using it EVERY day in the beginning.  It took about 6 weeks to see the real results, I had to wait until all of my old nails had grown out- so be patient!  I go through a bottle every 6-8 weeks, but for 10 dollars that's much cheaper than acrylic nails :)"
1,Bought this product before. I like it because it makes the face feel really clean and it only takes a little to do the job. Will be again.
1,"Good shampoo, especially for the summer it deep cleans, without stripping color from your hair, and gives you hair wonderful shine and body!"
1,"This lotion has a light, pleasant scent.  It leaves my skin feeling so soft the next morning - not oily at all - just soft and supple."
1,this is great when you need that sexy feeling...the paper flower that emerges from the bomb is beautiful...the scent on the skin will drive your mate wild...
1,"I ordered this for my boys to have in their bathroom. I was tired of taking them to my bathroom and using the big hair dryer on them. Now I can just whip this little travel one out to dry their short hair. Perfect timing for winter when the bathroom is colder than usual. Very powerful, light weight and compact."
1,"I have oily skin and what I have learned over the years is that the more alcohol-based products/drying products you use, the more likely your face will create MORE OIL.  So don't do it and use this stuff!  It is non-drying and smells great.  Refreshes after cleansing but will allow other products you might use do their trick, e.g. anti-aging, skin lightening creams, alpha hydroxy, etc.  I am a great fan on this product."
1,It smells wonderful and cleans my stainless steel and granite well.  I like that it is natural for my kids/dogs etc.
1,"My condition:I had red, blotchy oily patches on my scalp as well as scaly dandruff patches. My hair is dry and curly and I have fair, sensitive skin.After first use:One thing is for sure that this stuff really cleans your hair and scalp. After the two shampoos my hair was literally squeaky clean. You can feel it stripping the dirt and oils off your head.I paired this with the conditioner I always use which is Natures Gate biotin conditioner which is a really rich, buttery conditioner. This helped bring the moisture back into the ends of my hair.Over half way through bottle now:The red, oily patches are probably 90% better but the flakes are only maybe 40% improved. Which is still something I am very grateful for but I was hoping for a bigger improvement especially because this product dries my face and hair out quite a lot and I'm not in love with the smell.Results:I am going to see it through to the end of the bottle and then try some different products instead. If nothing else works better I will continue to use the T-Gel."
1,"I LOVE this stuff, eucalyptis and all.  Its great for tough workouts and sore muscles.  Really helps alleviate tired miscles but good for an anytime bath!"
1,"Another imaginative Valentine's Day gift for a patchouli loving aging hippie-really I should give up! Except he liked this. It has a tolerable floral scent that wafts from the downstairs shower bath all over the house. It likewise scents the skin. I'm not sure I could tolerate that scent all day and night. Odd that the essential oil dissipates in an hour or two, and this soap lasts so much longer, lingering if you like patchouli, this is worth a try."
1,"This does work. However you have to be careful.Start with a little product few times a week.Than use it every other day for a while.And if your skin does not react severely try to use it every night.Some redness and peeling are to be expected at fitst but with time my skin got used to it.You absolutely have to wear high SPF sunscreen while using this cream,at all times sunny or cloudy,summer or winter does not matter.But that's a good habit to develop anyway.And never use it on skin that is damaged,broken or sunburned.I do not now if it would work on deep wrinkles as I do not have any yet.It works on mine.I am 32.I also see improvement in my skin tone,it fades scares and dark spots too.I give it four stars because of it's strong smell.Wish it was unscented."
1,"I bought this product because it was one of the less expensive retinol products available, but it's turned out to be my favorite so far.. I had read that retinol can help keep acne at bay, and I can attest to that. In addition to helping to keep the breakouts away, I definitely notice a smoother texture to my skin. And the results are pretty fast&#8212;within just a few days I can tell that the skin on my forehead is a lot smoother.IF you are using this for acne, you need to know that you will get what a lot of people refer to as the &#34;acne purge.&#34; Retinol has the properties of increasing cell turnover, which is good in the long run, but it will usually cause your breakouts to be worse in the beginning. But tough it out! Because after your initial breakouts go away, this stuff keeps your skin sooo nice. Not to mention being able to help stave off wrinkles.The cream itself is fairly thick, and moisturizing. I imagine it is due to the product containing glycerin. It is just a little bit harsh, so I recommend keeping it far away from your eyelid area."
1,"I can't really put this wonderful product into words. I'm so in love with it that I, myself, would like to use this on my hair (but I won't, I'll save it for the princess who gets better shampoo than I do) ;-) My little Yorkie girl always sneezed with other shampoos, but not with this one. The scent is absolutely amazing, and not so strong or overpowering whatsoever. When I was towel-drying her, I thought for a second that there would be no scent because it was too light. However, now after blowdrying, the scent is absolutely WONDERFUL!!! and so unique.Unlike a few other reviewers, I thought this shampoo lathered really well and I used far less than I thought I would after reading other reviews, as well as far less than her old shampoo.The bottle doesn't look like the one in the picture; it is longer, in case anyone needs to know. Same amazing product :-)VERY happy customer and pup! ;-) Thank you, Cloud Star!!!"
0,I bought this Extra gentle sponge in search of a certain texture. I seems like a great sponge but it just too rough for my sensitive skin. I ended up using this as a body sponge so as not to waste my purchase.
1,"I love this hair towel.  It seems silly to have a towel specifically for your hair, but this thing allows me to dry my hair in a nice tight package.  And it definitely pulls more water from my hair than a traditional towel.  I'm buying a couple more for traveling, my gym bag, etc.Regarding the people who complain about the fit, I wonder if twisting it more or less would adjust the fit for your... more twisting and it's going to be tighter, less twisting and it's going to be looser."
1,"I love the idea of porcupine and the wood as the background (instead of metal), but talk about tangles!  This brush is not for long hair."
1,"I've used a lot of tinted moisturizers and as a rule I LOVE Aveno prouducts. To due skin cancer and using Renova, I have got to SPF my skin all year.I love Aveno products & my skin lady uses them after treatment. I am a natural platinum blonde so i go from very pale in the winter to a light tan as the weather warms.In general, this is a good quality product with adequate coverage & excellent SPF protection &  while transparent it also evens out the complexion. I believe it has a powder base as this seems to sink into large pores and deep lines. TO avoid this, I put 3 drops of a higher SPF &  mix it into the Aveno and then apply. This takes care of the problem.I also bought the light and medium and mix the two together to get the perfect shade. I store it mixed in a clean glass baby food jar & capped tight."
1,"This is hands down THE best product for dry hands! As it says on the front of the tube, ""just a dab"" rubbed into the back of each hand and, poof, scales, cracks, dryness, and pain are GONE. The effects last for several washings. It's amazing. One tube lasts a long time because you use only a dab at a time. Don't over-apply! Suggestion: draw a short, thin line of product across the back of one hand and use one finger of the other hand to massage it in from wrist to fingertips; after the gel turns white and then disappears into your skin, repeat on the opposite hand; then rub your hands together to get any remaining gel onto the inside of your hands. Apply sparingly. Don't use it like ordinary hand lotions/creams - it's not like those products; it's a one-of-a-kind product. Applied correctly, it will leave your hands smooth and soft without feeling wet or greasy. It's fragrance-free, so there's no obnoxious perfume smell. Enjoy!"
1,"This is a great mirror. Sturdy and reflective. Really helps when applying makeup or plucking eyebrows!We weren't expecting much, since it is so much lower priced than it's competitor brands, but it has been a wonderful addition to our master bath. We use it daily."
1,"I love this face cream.  I Have used it for decades.  It is just the right creaminess for dry facial skin.  It has a pleasant smell, but not too fragrant.  It lasts a long time and the price is very reasonable.  It only takes a tiny little bit once a day - under make up or at night.  Try it.  Your face will love  you for it."
1,"I've been using this for years. People say I don't look my age. To me that's the best recommendation. My only suggestion is be sure you start putting it on your cheek, not the nose to mouth fold. I have fairly sensitive skin and if I accidentally leave some of it from my starting point, I will feel it later."
1,Sometimes I cannot find these in stores.  I have used it for years.  The gentle one is not hard on the skin.
0,"I have naturally dark ash blonde hair that always seems to turn out orangy/golden when I dye it light ash colors. I was really hopeful that this would product would help produce different results with my last home coloring efforts, but sadly it didn't."
0,"If you have sensitive & dry to combination skin, DON'T use this product.PROS: Sorry, but none.....CONS: After using it for only 1 night, my skin got really red and itchy. It felt like I had a sunburn on my face and neck. I used a tiny tiny amount, so you can imagine how strong this product is. It is supposed to leave the skin soft, smooth, and younger-looking...not true. My mom also tried this, and the same result....she said it was not for her either. It is not suitable for sensitive and dry skin."
0,"This is the worst POS brush I have ever bought. Even those cheapies that you can get at a local drug store are 10X better.Pros- none!!!!Cons:1) the handle is for the size of a child or hobbit.2) theres weird extra brissles that you cannot tell from pictures. They make my hair frizzy.3) I have long, thick, wavy hair. This brush was a joke. I couldnt get past the first few strokes when I was ready to throw it out the fricken window. It was only brushing the surface hair only.Do NOT wast your money on this crap of a brush. This shouldnt even be considered a brush for humans. It looks like a baby doll brush or a brush you would use on a SMALL dog (but then the handle is still too small and awkward!)...maybe thats what Ill do...Use it for my 10 lb dog so its not a waste of money. Irritated. Last time Im a lazy a$$ and dont just go to the store to buy a brush."
1,"I just wish the tip was sharper. I can correct bigger areas like the sides of my nails, but when it comes to near cuticle, not so great."
1,"it's not greasy very good product, after a while - I see results (not no  wrinkles, but they are getting much smaller in depth)"
1,The smell is so sweet and delicious.  I put some drops in my raw Shea butter and it worked great.  It is not a very expensive product here and they even sent me a little gift! It was a neat surprise.  Will definitely recommend and buy again.  Thanks.
1,I had a allergic reaction to a new detergent and i bought this to use on my rashes. it helps stop the itches but if you mess with the rash no amount of lotion is gonna help. This stuff is pretty sticky too so try not to use it on your whole limb.
1,"I've been using this product for a number of years.  It's light and neutral and, as advertised, shine free.  Price and delivery were good and I'll continue to order as needed."
1,"I love this moisturizer.  I first heard of this product from the Oprah favorite things special and decided to give it a try.  I have dry skin and no other product has worked for me, except this one.  A small nickle sized amount on my face will last the whole day without needed additional applications.  I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone."
1,"Deep Copper Shimmer:I've been too afraid to use an at-home dye, so I've been forking over hundreds of dollars for salon color. I finally decided to try L'Oreal 74 Deep Copper Shimmer instead. It was the first time I have ever dyed my hair by myself, and it was easy! There is more than enough product for a test strand and then someone with long (though not thick) hair. My hair looks just as good as it does when I have it done in the salon and feels incredibly soft. The color is exactly what it shows on the box, even at my dark brown roots! I highly recommend this. L'Oreal--please don't ever discontinue Copper Shimmer! The color is outstanding!Champagne Cocktail:NOTE: This review is for L'Oreal Feria 91: Champagne Cocktail. I am going to cover in this review what I desperately needed to find before I tried this product and couldn't.Hair type: Colored blonde with reddish-blonde roots from a salon; previously highlighted blonde from being dyed red. Hair is thick and goes past shoulders to the end of the shoulder blades.When I dyed it with Feria: 5 weeks after last salon visit, on unwashed hair; 1 box of dye was all I needed.Review: I love being a blonde but was considering going brunette to save on money and salon costs, which in the area I live are upwards of $100 at almost any salon (unless you want your hair cut by someone fresh out of beauty school--which, no offense, is too nervewracking for me personally). Then it occurred to me--perhaps I could try highlighting or coloring myself from home. I used to color my hair red (the L'Oreal Copper Shimmer) and I got so good at doing it that I did a better job than my stylist. If you're unsure about doing it yourself, check out Youtube for Kandee Johnson's how-to-dye-hair video. This is the video that taught me how to dye my own hair in a professional manner.After comparing brands, I went back to L'Oreal, as I already trusted the line and it had the best reviews. I chose Champagne Cocktail based on the L'Oreal ""Find my color"" walkthrough; I chose a cool blonde since I have pink tones to my skin and my hair (being dyed red for so long) has a tendency to lift red. I did a strand test, even though the instructions do not say to do so. I wanted to be sure that my hair would not lift extremely red (no orange for me, though I did like being a ginger in the past.)I left the color on my roots for 25 minutes and then covered the rest of my hair for 10 minutes. My roots are still slightly darker and redder than my lengths (roots are strawberry blonde, and lengths are very pale blonde), so I would probably leave it on longer the next time I refresh my color; I think I will strand test my roots for 25-45 minutes and see how that works out.I am pleasantly surprised at how this dye came out; my hair is very soft after saturating with the conditioner, and I will probably use it again. However, tomorrow I think I will try the L'Oreal Brass Banisher to see if that can cut some of the strawberry blonde out of my roots. Hope this helped someone!EDITThe Brass Banisher cut the red out of my hair! I don't have to go to a salon to get my roots to match, and I don't have to bleach them. For full review, go to the Banisher product page."
1,Wonderful for sensitive mature skin. It cleans very well and no irritation to my skin after. I was happy with the reasonable price as well.  I will certainly buy this again.
1,"Orgasm is one of those shades that I can toss into a bag with a mascara, eyeliner, lipgloss, and concealer and have everything I need to make a quick getaway. If I only have a few minutes and don't want to weed through three train cases of my beauty essentials, then I always know I can count on this shade to give me a fresh, healthy glowing look. Definitely one I would replace if I ran out but this lasts a *really* long time!"
1,"I've tried so many hard as nails types of base coats, that didn't work, so had pretty much given up being able to wear polish on my natural nails, without them peeling and cracking.  That is, till I read the reviews for this nail strengthener.  There were enough positive comments, that I was willing to give this a try.  I'm glad I did, because this nail strengthener, truly works for me.  I've used it for almost 3 weeks, by putting on 2 base coats, then colored polish over that.  My nails looked better, even after the first week.  Even with the polish on, my nails that typically break and peel when I wear polish, are staying in remarkably in good condition."
0,"Color looked orange, smelled funny, but worst part was it stung and irritated my sensitive skin. I would not purchase if you have sensitive skin."
1,"Very nice natural toner with good scent!I recommend putting it in a refrigerator, really refreshing :)Gentle on the skin and moisturizing.  I am 100% satisfied.  Also, a better deal here than the Whole Foods.I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a natural, gentle toner."
1,"This product met my needs for Upper Lip shadow. I found it to be non oily, easy to smooth over skin and light on skin. You will need to use a press power for your skin tone after applying the concealer. Very please with the results."
0,same as all natural oils i think pure coconut oil works better then this i saw no difference using this product
0,"This stuff broke my face out. Maybe my skin is too sensitive or something, but this stuff didn't work at all for me."
1,"Great shampoo, has a minty smell but not too strong lightweight on the hair and feels nice, I like it"
1,"Love the toner itself, BUT when it arrived, my package was wet and the bottle was leaking from the lid. There was plastic around the cap, but the cap had become unscrewed somehow and about 1.5 oz of the product had leaked out. Not a huge deal, but a bit frustrating."
1,I've been using this product for a long time with GREAT satisfaction.  Now I've subscribed for automatic deliveries at an excellent price and no longer will I run out.
1,I just wish it would stay all day.....I work 12 hours shifts and by the end of my day the affects have gone
1,"I like Neutrogena products. Not pricey and work very efficient. I use this finding no big difference from other more expensive brands. And I also like their one-step gentle cleanser too. It does clean the make up, and I even drop it in water to wash brushes. In general, it's a very worthy buying brand."
1,"I use this to treat breakouts on my arms, chest and back. Using it once - twice a day has eliminated it completely. Be sure to pair with a good moisturizer that suites your skin type."
1,"The only bad thing about Neutrogena On The Spot Acne Treatment is that I didn't have it when I was a teenager, suffering from the worst acne ever!  I've had acne for years and have used harsh abrasive cleaners, creams that dried my skin out, creams that irritated, and creams that did nothing at all.  When I turned 25 I imagined my skin would clear up, but it never did.  Then came 30, 33, 36...and the acne was still there, not as bad, certainly, but still an issue.  Then I found this, and my life changed!  This product WORKS...and I won't be without it.  As I said, the only thing that could make it better is if I had it with me the week before the PROM!If your teenager suffers from acne, they just don't need to.  Give this a try, and I think you will see results fairly quickly.  It works for me just about overnight!Thank you Neutrogena!"
1,"Wow!  I have tried other brands with the flavor trigger to induce vomiting if fingers are put into mouth.  Kidding about vomiting, but the taste seriously lingers for a long time.  It's nasty.  My brain would automatically stop me when I started to nibble.  Usually, when I'm editing my writing on the computer.  Now I will need to purchase a nail hardening system since I can finally see the whites of my nails.  I was never a nail biter until I started this insidious habit 2 years ago.  Before too long, my beautiful, healthy and much longer nails were being nibbled to the quick.  I suggest anyone try it if they just can't stop biting on their own.  Or, for those kids who are too old for thumb sucking.  Wished I known about this while my daughter was growing up.  She actually sucked her thumb through the 4th grade.  Nothing we tried would get her to stop.  Even wearing gloves at night!"
1,"This is a nice peel mask and my skin does feel softer after using it, but it has a *very* strong alcohol smell when you first apply it and I probably would not purchase this again."
1,This is an excellent curling iron. I bought it two years ago and it's still working great. It heats up really quickly and is very easy to use. I'd definitely recommend it. This isn't to say I haven't burned myself a couple times - because i have. But only because I'm a clumsy little moron. Don't let that prejudice you against this curling iron. This curling iron has done nothing wrong.
1,"I first learned of this product years ago when I read an article written by a dermatologist discussing the best ways to banish dry skin. You apply a very thin coat of this oil while you are still wet after you shower. The oil quickly sinks into your skin and creates a moisture barrier which locks in the moisture and prevents it from quickly evaporating. It really works. In the winter I also use a body cream after I dry off and the results are great.The oil itself is very light with a very pleasant, very delicate but unisex fragrance. I admit it is counter-intuitive but there is nothing greasy or ""oily"" feeling about this product. A few pumps of the oil in your hand is enough to apply over your entire body. It is absorbed quickly and the effect is silky and smooth.This product in the 32 ounce pump bottle is almost impossible to find. I think Neutrogena mostly offers it around the holidays. When I run out of the product I save the pump bottle and decant the easier to find smaller sizes into it. The pump is a very convenient feature and I wish Neutrogena would offer it year round."
1,It help me when the weather is humid and my is frizzy.  It straighten my hair and gives me great results.  The sellet is prompt.  Excellent service.
1,"I use this every day and it works great! I first bought a small bottle at wholefoods and then ordered the 32 oz refill since its so great. It cleans without overdrying and keeps the acne from starting. It has a light smell like an ordinary soap that does not last and isn't distracting. I love organic products, they always work well while the  ""popular"" products out there like noxema and clearsil just make things worse. Makes you wonder why organic products are practically unheard of and are unseen unless you go to a health store."
1,"I looked in the mirror and saw glitter on my face, I was sad and thought my eyeshadow wasnt so great and was coming off. Then I noticed that the glitter was also on my palms... its this moisturizer, I suppose the natural light reflector... are like mirrors / glitter, Im actually wondering if it is seashell as that pops up in lotions sometimes, this is one reason I dont like the moisturizer so much... I'll only be wearing this on my upper lip, as soy is suppose to minimize hairs... and Ill see how that goes... Id wear this at the beach, or going to a night club... it does make skin feel soft, but Im not a total fan of the texture, beats olay though, but I think ill be going back to neutrogena."
1,"nice smell, it really takes all the dirt out of my face. it doesnt dry my skin as other toners do. i highly recomend it!"
0,"Only came with 1 mascara not six, very misleading!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Therefore, also made the product a bit expensive."
1,This cream soaks in immediately and leaves no sticky or gummy residue.  I break out quite easily and this cream has been great for my skin.  I was feeling a bit depressed about my skin at 60 because I was breaking out. . .with this cream my skin is much better.  GREAT CREAM!!!
1,"I tried many expensive creams. Nothing works like this one, just try for 1 month at least and you will see how your wrinkles get thinner and thinner."
1,"Bought this product to add to my summer collection. I recommend this product. It's a great color, you won't regret buying it!"
1,"Not only did I have severe glabellar creases, I also had pretty bad prefrontal sinus headaches.  I had been using Frownies and found that they helped but not enough.  Still got the headaches.  Decided to try Botox, which took care of both the creases and the headaches.  But the Botox lasted only about three months, and then the creases and the headaches returned.  I was hooked on the Botox but not happy about having to renew it every three months.  Decided to use both the Frownies and Botox.  Over the past five or six years, the intervals of needing to renew the Botox have steadily lengthened.  It now lasts six months, sometimes longer.  I cannot tell for sure whether using the Frownies has contributed to the lengthening of the interval, but I do think the Frownies and Botox have a synergistic effect."
1,"Anything that's natural and not made by man made chemicals, it's always best for your hair and body. If you read in the book of Genesis God tells us that I give you the trees and the berries all you'll need for healing."
1,"I want to know what all the hype is about...it certainly is not a bad cleanser at all. In fact, it is pretty awesome! Usually (with panoxyl(sp?)at least) benzoyl peroxide - the main acne fighter in this product - dries me out and irritated my skin. So, its gentle on the BP sensitive. Also, (I don't like it but) it does have menthol which gives the ""wake up"" cooling sensation. I suppose I'm not being fair as I haven't tried it as a mask yet, but the product doesn't seem to be that great on my acne (which is mainly stubborn blackheads and some whiteheads). It does an okay job of preventing new formations, but its not touching what I already have. That is why I went to try the Oil Free Grapefruit cleanser. BAD IDEA. Compared to THAT hot mess, this is a gem!"
1,"This face wash does not contain alpha hydroxy acids as it's brand may present that it may have. However it is not that bad of a face wash, it just is not what I was expecting."
1,my eyelashes don't come off or move until I take them off at the end of the day. duo is good quality and dries clear.
1,"This soap is just ok; it sort of makes my skin feel a bit like it has a film on it or something, but perhaps I just need to get used to it.  I quit using sulphate soaps, and I use this or Dr. Bronner's Tea Tree Oil soap.UPDATE: I really love this soap, and my skin loves it too.  I have VERY sensitive skin, and I can't even use soap with a wash cloth, because I will itch when I get out of the shower if I do.  I really like how delicate this soap is on my skin.  I slather my arms and legs in coconut oil after the shower, and my skin has no irritation at all.  I will probably use this soap forever, as it cleans, but it doesn't make my skin angry.  The bar also lasts FOREVER; I have been using it everyday now for several months, and it's only halfway gone.  Great deal for the money :)"
1,This will help you save money if you put oil in your hair.  I still have a half of bottle and bought this over 3 months ago.  I do not put it on my skin but I am African American and have  long hair and it can be DRY so I use it on my hair and it loves it!!! Plus I don't have to keep buying oil ever pay period. Thank you for having this product!!!
1,"So I never had acne as a teenager. Was on the pill for irregularities from the start of puberty. Finally got off the pill at around 23 or 24, and then my whole face went insane. Giant zits near my mouth, worse during PMS, present all the rest of the time. I tried every type of regular acne thing I could think of - I didn't think to connect the discontinuation of the pill with the rise of Myra (figured the zit was around for a couple of years and she deserved a name). Somehow or another I found out about hormonal cystic acne and about how retinol can help. I didn't really want to go to a dermatologist (no insurance), so I thought I'd try this. I really didn't want to show up at law school with Myra still hanging about. I used this every night, after washing my face and before putting on moisturizer. After about 6 weeks my skin started clearing up. Now I only use it during PMS to prevent Myra and her buddies from coming out to play. If I try to skip a month, it's back.There are other serums that I like to use better when I'm not worrying about the acne, but this has been the BEST thing for the acne and probably the #1 product that I could not live without.Update: I've since switched to Philosophy's Miracle Worker liquid solution. It is a stronger concentration than this and I've found that it works a bit better for me."
1,"This is light and feels good going on; it soaks in quickly.  I'm not sure that it is better than other less expensive brands, but I like it."
1,I love it . It really makes shower area organized and neat. For those of us who like to try new products specially shampoo and face wash and get disappointed after trying and don't know what to do use it as a body wash. Yes you heard me I have pour all my left over shampoos and face washes in one of the dispenser and used it up all. Very functional and easy to put to gather.
0,"I thought this was a more powerful dryer...my bad. I'm going to keep it since I like the color (LOL) and it dries well  with a high and low setting and 2 speeds, and has concentrator and attachment for curls. Both attachments are very tough to take off...I'm so afraid I'll break one of them....they need a better system to get them on and off. The dryer is only 1275 watts, not exactly powerful. And, very important, the buttons for high/low/off/ and heat settings are very small, and placed badly. I keep accidentally turning off the blower!"
1,This has really been helping me with some new acne I have been getting.  Its clearing it up quickly.  be sure to wear sunscreen with this product.
1,"I'm writing this review for my father who isn't very computer literate.  He spends a fair amount of time outside and suffers from terrible dry skin in the winter.  Though he wishes this worked even better, he says it's the only thing that works for him.He uses it as directed but also applies a layer to his skin after drying off and just leaves it there.  He's tried the various Aveeno lotions but says leaving this wash on is better for him.Personally, I've not had as good a luck with the Aveeno products as I have with applying pure sweet almond oil to areas that get dry while still wet from a shower and WEN by Chaz Dean's texture balm on dry skin (yes, made for hair but also works great on dry lips, noses and hands -- portable and smells amazing too!)"
1,"Omg this toner smells sooo good.Ive never used a toner before this so I have no compare,but this make my skin look so good and smell good  and I thought I did a good job of washing but I used this after I washed my face and the cotton ball was dirty.I was surprised.On the ingredients it says theres Methylparaben but I checked the back of mine and it isn't there and I checked the website and it doesn't show it either so I guess Amazon has ingredients wrong which I'm glad cuz I'm trying to be as natural as possible and I don't want bad stuff in my skin care.I will most definitely be buying this again."
1,"After much fretting, I finally obtained a sample from the local Sephora store...and am glad I didn't buy it, cuz I'm a floral, clean type of girl.The first word came to mind is ""sweet"", a sweet, sugary smell, with a hint of musk. If you like your perfums sweet and musky, then this is good for you.Some perfum are too strong when just sprayed, this one is not. It is subtly sophisticated, and smells nice (cheap perfums always have a hint of chemical smells, and this one does not).It is good quality perfum, but if you don't like sweet or musky scent, don't buy it."
1,"Best blush I've ever used; high in pigments so the container lasts at least 6 months; goes on smoothly, lasts, and gives a very natural blush look."
1,"When i ordered this i thought it would be a caramel/light brown color. It looks grey-ish once you put it on. It is still a pretty color, just not what i expected."
1,"Our piercer recommended this and we are so glad we listened. This has sped up the healing process and even works on boils and skin sores. It's all natural as well. If you have a piercing or an area you need to keep clean without harsh chemicals, this is WONDERFUL. Highly recommend. I recently pierced my nose and I'm going to keep a bottle of this around for continued cleaning."
1,"Highly recommend.  Will leave your skin silky smooth after a shower, with a very delicate scent.  Not greasy at all.  Highly recommend. Also real bang for the buck."
0,"I was excited to finally have a facial cleanser to melt away makeup and it worked wonders at first...HOWEVER, I started to break out...BAD! I could literally connect the pimple dots on my face! UGHHH! Then I discovered that it has IMIDAZOLIDINYL UREA(found in urine)! Which I have researched and it is toxic for your skin! I cannot express how angry I am, not just because it's expensive but also because it's supposed to purify your skin. I'm never purchasing from Philosophy again."
1,"I've read that glycerin coats the enamel which prevents the natural re-mineralization of teeth, and that it takes 12 to 27  brushings without glycerin to remove what is left behind by toothpastes that contain it.Ingredients in: Weleda Children's Tooth Gel 1.78 oz toothpaste (INCI); glycerin, water (aqua), silica, algin, calendula officinalis flower extract, foeniculum vulgare (fennel) oil, mentha viridis (spearmint) leaf oil, esculin and limonene.So far I've only found Xlear Spry Tooth Gel to be free of both fluoride and glycerin:Baby Banana Brush And Tooth Gel Combo PackIngredients: Purified water, Xylitol, Calcium Glycerophosphate, Cellulose gum (thickening agent), Natural Strawberry and Banana flavoring, and Grapefruit seed extract (as a preservative).I usually just dip my grandson's toothbrush in a little coconut oil and/or Xylitol. The Xlear Spry Tooth Gel is much more convenient, especially on the go.Note: I have not seen ""independent studies"" (who would pay for such?) regarding glycerin's reputation of preventing mineralization of teeth. If anyone reading this should ever come across such, I'd be most interested. In the meanwhile I'll stay clear of glycerin to err on the side of caution."
1,"I wish I'd known about this long ago.  I used to get those cystic type blemishes that take forever and ever to go away.  If one starts, I dip the handle end of a makeup brush into this, dab it on, and my skin is normal in the morning.  Even my husband uses it, it's that effective.  It's pink and dry, like Caladryl lotion."
1,"It takes a lot to get me to spend more than 10 bucks on something for my beauty routine and if you've actually convinced me to spend that 10 bucks, I probably have a coupon hidden away somewhere to make the cost less! But, when a friend started raving about Hope in a Jar and all the good things it does for her skin, I was tempted to try it and was able to find a small jar for only $15.00 at my local Sephora store. I cannot tell you how fast I was hooked onto this moisturizer!I have oily skin and am prone to breakouts along my chin and I've tried tons of different moisturizing products, but all are too heavy and/or greasy for someone with an oil issue. This one is super light and non-greasy and absorbs into my skin within just a minute or two, rather than the 10-15 minutes I would wait with the heavier creams. I only use the tiniest bit each day, so this really small jar has already lasted me about 3 months and it's not even 3/4 of the way gone.I liked the scent, it wasn't perfumey or overly medicinal, it just smelled like unscented lotion, which was nice. And though it doesn't matter for the use of the product, the styling of the jar is cool and modern, which makes these Philosophy products great for gifts.My only ""complaint"" is that this particular formula does not include sunscreen. I've since been informed that there is a ""High Performance"" formula that includes SPF 25, but it's more expensive. Sunscreen is pretty necessary these days and most moisturizing products and makeup products automatically come with it, so that was disappointing.Other than that, I'm very happy with my purchase."
1,"this is the best mascarra remover on the market as far as I am concerned.  It immediately removes even water proof mascarra.  While it feels really greasy, that is easily removed with a good face wash"
1,good for every day wear. good neutral color. what i was looking for. easy to apply on your own. no need for salon
1,"This stuff is great.  I got a heat rash and couldn't wear a bra for a few days, so I used this to glue my bust to the shirt and it held great.  I will use it with strapless dresses instead of a bra, yeah!"
1,"I have always loved the Mason Pearson boar bristle and nylon brushes.  They are, however, far too expensive to replace when my 6-year-old and 9-year old daughters keep losing them!  I searched high and low for a good alternative.  Some didn't actually brush through my hair, just made it frizz out.  Some were too hard on my head and fine hair.These brushes are fantastic- I'd give the brush itself a four star, but because they come in beautiful jewel tones that my daughters were delighted with, I give it a 5 star.  When I gave my girls one apiece, they spent the next couple of days hugging and thanking me over them.  Seriously, if I knew an inexpensive brush would get me that sort of gratitude, I'd have given them one long ago!The brush has short, brown bristles interspersed with longer white nylon bristles with a little plastic ball at the end so it is gentle.  The long bristles really comb *through* the hair.Also, my daughters are *so* picky about brushes because they are mixed Caucasian and Japanese and very thick but relatively fine hair.  They love how these brushes feel when getting their long hair brushed out.  I highly recommend these brushes!"
0,"i didn't care for this product.  It felt heavy on my face and after a couple of hours, it kind of pealed of my face. It also felt like it dried out my skin."
1,totally sold on this and I don't usually like expensive makeup. winner.Will continue using this even though it's more expensive than drug store stuff.
1,"I usually break out in the summer. I sweat a lot while gardening and my pores get clogged, especially on my forehead. Since, I've change my skin regimen, my breakouts have been minimal to nil. Here is what I do. 1) Wash my face morning and night, 2) Use witch hazel pads, and then 3) finish off with this moisturizer. I always thought washing my skin too much would dry it out, but it's just fine, and most importantly - pimple-free. Since I am now using this moisturizer as part of my regimen, I guess I will give this product some of the credit. I just re-ordered."
1,"I am very impressed with the results which happened after taking this just one week. After doing some research about safe methods to reduce hot flashes, I came upon this product. There are many studies done mostly in Europe, and they are very positive. I had 5 to 6 hot flashes every night, robbing me of a good night sleep. Now I have maybe 1 hot flash every 3-4 nights. This really worked for me. I will be taking this for a very long time. Studies also show that this supplement helps retain bone density, and helps with mood swings."
0,"I ordered Cocktail Bling but received Bobbing for Baubles.  Seller was going to exchange for me and sent me a prepaid label but it was just too much work so I kept it.I hate the bobbing for baubles colour , however.  A lot.  It's way too dark a blue and I'm not thrilled with the formula.  Oh well, I can always throw it in the box when I do my next nail polish round robin swap."
1,"I have used this stuff for years and I love it.  It smells nice and works great.  I'm pretty sure it helps my hair grow faster too, not just thicker and fuller.  It lathers nicely and I like that it is clear and seems so natural.  I really recommend trying it.  The hair spray and conditioner are great, too."
0,"Goes are great! Unfortunately, the tip isn't a felt tip, its more like a mini-paint brush, so it tends to get all over if you're not careful.Pros:*Great color (for a little while)*Dries QuicklyCons:*Smudges*Rubs off easily*Don't recommend with OILY eyelids"
1,I discovered the benefits of using an exfoliating towel while reading a health magazine.  I bought one to try and returned to Amazon to buy 4 more to give to  my husband and sons. I love how clean and healthy my skin looks after showering or bathing using this towel.
0,Seems to rub in well but after about an hour or two my face is greasy all over. After a long time I realized it was this product. I gave it away.
1,"This product is perfect after shaving, it leaves the skin very soft and hydrated all day long. I really enjoy it."
1,"This is the longest lasting, most gentle perm that we've tried. It appears to be pretty easy on the scalp as well. Best around!"
0,"First of all these say that they're Ardell lashes. They are not. The package I got has black marker scribbled over the name of the lashes, and they're Andrea lashes. Also - the glue is removed from the package. I haven't tried the lashes on yet, that's not what I'm writing this review for. I'm writing it because it's not even the product in the picture! What are these people doing? AND you sent me an opened package? So kind of you. Boo. Hope these lashes were worth it, really do."
1,"This is so refreshing, but toning after I shave!  It is thorough enough to tone, but offers moisture to the beard . and helps to moisturize the face, so my serums go on smoother!"
1,I bought this product at local drug store... It is a disappointment...Cheap and does not cover my under eye circle or any other spot. It is so dry... very difficult to blend with skin...
1,"The soap arrived promptly and it smelled wonderful. I used it several times and the scent was great; at least to me. Some people I know don't like that scent. However, about half way through the bar the scent had faded and I didn't really like the smell of it at that point, so I threw it away. I would have been happy if the patchouli had lasted all the way through the bar, but, to me, it didn't. I think the purchase was too expensive to have turned out this way."
1,"The best soap I can find for sensitive skin, I just add glycerine to it because it can be drying. This soap will make you squeaky clean, not kidding. Just did not care for the Almond scent."
1,"UPDATE 10/11/07:  Unfortunately, I need to downgrade my rating of this product to just 3 stars.  As I say below, this product does a GREAT job of not leaving any white streaks on clothing.  However, after using it for several months, I was quite disappointed in the actual deodorant abilities!  At first, I chalked up my increased underarm wetness/odor to having a very hot summer, but even on cooler days, this product failed me.  Eventually, I got fed up and gave up.  I've recently switched to Secret Platinum, and so far so good, although I won't be writing any reviews until I'm sure!For years, I've been on a quest for a deodorant that would do a good job of controlling wetness AND wouldn't leave white streaks on my clothes.  I've tried them all:  clear gels, clear solids, ""little black dress proof"" versions, and I've never found something to meet my needs.  Sure, some products were better than others, and I stuck with them for awhile, but I wasn't completely satisfied.Then a friend recommended Almay Clear Gel.  I was reluctant to try it at first for two reasons:  1) I gave up on gels a long time ago because I didn't like the wet feeling upon application, and 2) I generally prefer lightly scented deodorants, as I've always thought these help to control odor better.  But I decided to give the Almay Clear Gel a try anyway, especially when I saw that it was very reasonably priced, and I'm so glad I did!  Being a gel, it does go on wet, which did take a little getting used to for me.  However, it dries fairly quickly (about a minute), and I've found that once it dries, I can no longer feel it at all, unlike solid products.  Plus, it does an amazing job at controlling wetness, better than ANY other deodorant I've ever tried--and as I said above, I've tried a lot!  We've had a lot of very hot (90-degree) days this summer, but even during the most sweltering weather, this deodorant has kept me completely dry; it's like the gel bonds with the skin to form an invisible layer of protection against wetness and odor.  That's right, odor too--no fragrance is needed because there is no sweaty smell to cover up!  And finally, because Almay Clear Gel totally disappears once it is dry, there is absolute ZERO chance of it leaving any streaks on your clothing."
1,"i like most of the 'healthy skin' line of products and this one was no exception.  however, i prefer lotion to a cream for daytime use, therefore, i would not likely purchase this again."
1,My daughter is wearing make-up for the first time and this has been a great product for her.  I will buy it again.
1,This stuff works...I purchased both the small and large sized bottles so I can always have a supply as I use this product every day.
1,"I have been looking for a good leave in conditioner. When I first used it I didn't like it, but I put some Argan Oil in it  that I bought from Watts and made it much better."
0,"I purchased this item in September, only to have it burn up in less than 4 months. I used the hot air brush only occasionally, perhaps 2 times a week. It did a nice job styling my hair, and I think the anti-static ionic feature made a difference. Unfortunately, the motor never ran an even speed. The second to last time I used it, I thought I smelled smoke. The last time I used it, I definitely saw smoke. That was enough for me to throw the item in the trash. As a result, I just can't recommend this item.For a period of over twenty years, I had 2 different hot air brushes from Conair. Unfortunately Conair no longer makes the model that I used. I took a chance on this Hot Tools item as a replacement, but this Hot Tools product was more expensive AND failed in 4 months.This was my first time with a Hot Tools product. It also was my last.I just purchased a different Conair product. At least I know it will last."
1,"Works well to gradually relieve itch and flaking. The mild scent is also pleasant, kind of like eucalyptus. Though not a perfect cure-all, I would recommend this over Head and Shoulders."
1,I love the color. The lipcolor lasts but it is very drying especially after wearing a hour. I find myself needing to wipe and reapply.
1,Im hooked. I bought the taj mahal which everyone said goes with most complexions . They were right. The pigment is super strong. Just need one swipe and thats it. Has a golden effect as well. Definitely a must have.
1,"This is the most wonderful shade of sheer pink I've ever used. It looks like a vivid blue-pink in photos and in the bottle in person, but really it's sheer almost to the point of clear. OTOH, you can definitely tell that it IS pink on your nails and not colorless. It's super glossy, and after applying, if you look at your nails in the right light, you can just aaalllmmmost see the slightest bit of metallic shimmer, but it's so faint that it really looks like a shiny gloss. You really don't need more than one coat if you just want a simple, buffed-looked manicure, but the pink becomes more apparent with each coat. It became a favorite from the first time I applied it."
1,"I have IC and can't wear underwear and have to wash clothes with unscented laundry soap or it will irritate me. If you have any sensitivities or IC, try this soap. I can wash with this soap without it burning or irritation."
1,"This is the only cosmetic product I've stuck with for over 25 years.  This powder has been around forever and there is a reason for that.  It has a very fine texture which applies perfectly.  It is also very inexpensive.  Most people would be able to use this powder without foundation, since it enhances and perfects the complexion so well. Unless you really need extra coverage, I recommend the basic translucent shade if you wear foundation, which should work with nearly every complexion.  The other shades are heavier and, if used with certain foundations, might not last as well for over 8 hours without caking.  On the other hand, the heavier extra coverage shades work very well without foundation.  I've tried Christian Dior, Lancome, Elizabeth Arden, and a million other loose powders and none of them compare to Coty."
1,"I have tried EVERYTHING and nothing seemed to help my splitting nails.  I read the reviews and figured I had nothing to loose.  I use it every night, while I'm watching t.v. and now my nails look great.  For me, this has worked when nothing else did."
1,"I'd been seeing people rave about this on hair forums forever but I never wanted to pay what they were asking for it.  I finally saw it for cheaper and I bought it.  I used it a couple of times as a reg moisturizer on dry hair and it was horrible.  Not bad, not okay, but horrible!  I decided to try it on wet hair as a leave-in before giving up on it and it worked best that way. I wouldn't buy it again though."
1,"Sensitive Skin? Check.  Irritated by Perfumes and Scents? Check.  No bad reactions to this product:? CHECK!  I love Olay and their fragrance free products.  This one keeps wrinkles in check, keeps my skin looking young and doesn't irritate.  I will continue to purchase again and again."
1,"For starters, my hair LOOOOOVES color. Soaks it right up and does great with almost all cheapo home kits.I got to the color on the box from very dark brown in about 3 colorings that were spaced out, hence the 4 stars. I have a lot of red in my hair and it really kept the brassiness to the minimum while I worked on getting to a lighter shade. there is a lot of really nice dimension to the color as well, making it look naturally blonde.I also ignored the timing instructions. I always apply my color the same way (roots to ends) and leave it on for 45 minutes no matter what. I also cover my hair with a plastic cover to keep heat in and help the color set.I finally got bored of the upkeep this color required as far as roots go and went back to my natural, but it was a fun (and cheap) way to go medium blonde for a while."
1,"Great, quality brush and great price!  I should have purchased a few of these.  Much better than then the brushes you can buy at the drugstore and costs 1/2 less than what you could expect to pay at a salon or Ulta3."
1,"I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. This is a good product. Makes your skin feel smooth afterwards which i would attribute to the dimethicone, which also slightly helps fill in lines and plumps the skin (what some people noticed in their review of the product). Moisturization wise, it is okay. This is also good as a makeup primer."
1,This soap is mild and has a pleasant clean scent.  Very nice and I like the way it leathers up.
0,This thing did nothing for me.  Cheaply constructed and did not solve the problem I wanted it to solve.  Won't buy this again.
1,"I really liked it, but then my black headband broke after three months. But, I did wear it almost every other day, so probably my fault. It really does not give you a headache, unlike other plastic bands. It's also looks nice. So, definitely worth the $2.50."
1,"This is a very affordable brush that helps control static, fits the hand, and is neither to soft nor too stiff. My other choice was a very expensive brush that I know is high quality. But I'm glad I opted for this one. It is up to the task and at a tiny fraction of the cost."
1,"This is a great, natural line of lip products that feel great and wear well. The color is wonderful, too. It is a tad intense, but looks great on a gal with dark hair and eyes. Go for the Watermelon shade if you want a lighter look. I especially like the peppermint oil zing."
1,"Bought this for my niece, I haven't heard anything negative about this item, so I guess it is working well."
1,"I love the smell of this product. Very minty and fresh. I use this more for clearing blackheads instead of clearing up acne. It leaves my face feeling refreshed and soft, but doesn't do much for the blackheads."
1,"I have suffered bad skin allergies and eczema for years.  I only use aveeno to soap my body with.  I don't think I am allergic to scented soap, but the benefit I know I get from Aveeno is that it keeps my skin moist (but not greasy), which is really important if you have eczema.  I also use Aveeno's eczema lotion to pair with this soap and together they keep my flare ups at bay.  I would give this a sixth star if possible because of the price here on Amazon.  It is nearly half the amount than the regular store!"
1,I have medium/thick super straight hair adn the teeth of these headbands broke a little bit. they don't cause headaches but do cause a little discomfort behind the ears for me. but I do have a big head so that might be a reason why :)
1,"I needed white powder for shadowing below eyebrows, eyelids and under eyes...Althought this color is translucent it still leaves a faint white color which is what I was going for...So this will work for my needs...Powder is very light weight, no smell and goes on nicely...I was hoping for more white than clear but this will due..."
1,I like it but would like it better if it lasted for more than a few shampoos on my very gray hair. It is good overall.
1,"That is right - I just love this color. I feel very shamexy in this :) It seems to look nice on a lot of skin tones, also."
1,"I got this to replace expensive dermalogica toners and expected it to work just as well.  It kinda doesn't.  Its fresh feeling and smells light and clean.  But it doesn't keep my skin soft enough to clean blackheads away.  I've noticed dermalogica toner after useage, keeps the skin soft enough to keep it clean while exfoliating and daily cleansing.  Its good enough for after the shower or cleaning to keep you moist, but thats about it."
1,I love using all different colors on my nails and I went through a green phase.  This is very nice because it's not too bright or light.  It's a nice in the middle shade.  I find a lot of bright greens and some darker ones so it's nice to have ones in the middle.  Application is smooth as always with Essie products.
1,i am 52 yrs old and have tried every cream possible.  i love this cream!  i am italian so my skin isnt dry but it does seem to fill wrinkles.  it is a bit thick so i use it sparingly and truly found this cream makes my skin look great.  it also smells fanastic!  i wish they made this in an eye cream.  ive been using it for a yr and this is my new face cream.  happy face!
1,This works great as wrinkle cream and just lotion. I use am and pm. Sometimes mixed with sunscreen. It is pretty thick so does not take much. Does not irritate my skin like a lot of lotions do. Will buy again.
1,"I would order this product again.  It does exactly as stated and I have sensitive skin, so do not be worried if that is a concern."
0,"This product feels great when you put it on. However, when I went to comb out my wet hair afterward, I found that it was a tangled mess, especially at the ends. I would have probably broken off half my hair while trying to comb it out if I hadn't used a leave-in conditioner to help de-tangle it. So even once my hair is dry, I won't really be able to tell how well this product worked since there is so much leave-in conditioner in my hair now . This is going in the garbage. My hair is too fragile to risk more breakage."
1,I've got mixed hair texture.... straight... thin in the front... grows a lil thicker in the middle with baby hair on my neck... but gets frizzy sometimes... i'd been using the same shampoo for over 15 years until they stopped making it (creme of nature - orginal version)... pissed me off because i'm crazy picky about what i use on my skin and hair... theres usually only one thing or couple that works really good...  thought it would take me a long time to find a natural shampoo with almost the same ingrediants that would leave my hair looking like it used to...  bought this just so i'd have something to wash my hair with until i thought i'd have to go looking for a shampoo that i really wanted.... but this stuff made my hair exactly like i wanted it... didnt have to go looking for anything else... this plus organic wheat germ oil i bought on hereWheat Germ Oil - 100% Pure and Organic 8 Ozactually left my hair shinier cleaner and straighter than creme of nature... i just wash it with this shampoo.. leave a lil in my hair like a conditioner and add a lil organic wheat germ oil and my hair looks like salon hair.. crazy shiney... straight ( after using curling iron)... soft and light... leaves my hair cleaner looking than creme of nature.. this shampoo probably makes any texture hair look good but if you have mixed like mine nothing better than this with a lil wheat germ oil rubbed in after (adds even more shine).. smells good too.. just like limes... not like a stinky perfumeMAYBE A LIL DULL (without oil after) BUT NOT DRYI See some people saying it leaves their hair dry...  if that happens just use hair oil after.. it'll leave it shiney ... i never used this shampoo without rubbing a lil wheat germ oil on my hair after.. and it did get super shiney after that... shinier...  plus i leave a lil of this in my hair like a leave in conditioner which probably helps it shine... when i got it i thought it might dry my hair out because of the citrus in it but it turned out shiney with the oilTheres nothing drying in this shampoo except for some fruits like lemon (and maybe green tea)... but the citrus or tea in this shampoo wont damage your hair dry it out and break it off like alcohol will... like a lot of other shampoos have in it... it might just leave it a lil duller if you dont put a lil oil or leave in conditioner in it after... alcohol will leave your hair really dry and break it off... like Jasons Naturals shampoo.. i used that shampoo and it looked shiney the day i washed it and the rest of the week my hair got so dry it started to break off really bad (Kiss My Face shampoo is actually saving it right now)... turns out that one has 2 alcohols in it plus a stinky perufme (perfumes another alcohol).. that will kill your hairWith this stuff all you have to do is add a lil hair oil on top of the citrus if it ends up looking a lil dull or dry looking... best hair oil to use is wheat germ... olive oil.. jojoba.. almond... grapeseed.. organic aloe vera all left my hair a lil oily looking and greasy.. the wheat germ made it crazy shiney and healthy
1,"Hands down, Solar Oil is the best cuticle oil on the market.Somehow, the blend of oils in this are the best at healing and preventing split cuticles, hangnails, dry nails, chipped polish, broken nails, toe fungus, separation of acrylic overlays, all kinds of problems. I never find any other oil, lotion or cuticle oil works as well, especially on my problem hands which really get dry cuticles and sometimes even eczema around my nails and under the nail edges.I worked in a salon for 15 years doing skin care & nails, and this was the number one product I recommended to all nail clients to buy. Not only was it good for the skin, it actually sinks through the polish and artifical nails so that these things stay on better.I actually buy multiple bottles at a time and keep one in each room of the house so wherever I am, I can put some on - after doing dishes, while watching TV, and right before bed. Otherwise, I get painful dry skin. Amazon has great prices on it so I can afford to store them around the house. Most people could probably just keep one by the bed and do it before going to sleep. (also a good time for intensive foot lotion, which I also keep next to the bed - right before going to sleep, I lotion up hands and feet so it can sink in during the night; Aveda makes great therapeutic hand & foot lotion).A note on application: Brush on cuticles and under the nail edge, massage the oil in to the skin, the nail, and the end of the finger under the nail. It won't work nearly as well if you don't massage each finger/nail. Also, do the oil before lotion because the oil is applied with a brush that could get contaminated by a greasy lotion, and the lotion will seal in the healing oil."
1,It made my hair shiny and healthy. It seems a lot easier to manage now. Glad I found this.. I will buy more when I run out. This is quite a big bottle so its nice it goes far.
1,"I've found this cleanser does a great job of removing light to moderate oil/dirt from the skin without overdrying.  It is a cream based cleanser with no abrasives in it, so it's very gentle on the skin as well.I usually rub a little bit on my skin with my hands, then wash it off with water.  This is good for when you just need a light cleansing.  You can put a little on a wash rag, then rub your skin with the rag if you need a more robust cleaning.Overall a great product."
1,"I bought this fattener 2 months ago. I have been trying to decide if it really works or am I just hoping it does. Should I buy more, or forget about it. My hair is curly, not long. I have some thinning hair, especially at the crown of my head where it swirls.  On the product it says to use on wet or dry hair.DRY: First I tried it after I finished drying my hair. I thouht it might be heavy and ruin my curls, so I let my curls form from drying first. But it made my hair dry and dull. I did not like the look or the feel.WET: I tried it when my hair was wet, in just the area of my crown, twisting it a bit. I wasn't sure it really made a difference. One day I'd use it, the next not. I felt the crown area was always a bit dry and coarser when I used it. Not thicker or curlier. It didn't seem that much better. Maybe some. Not what I wanted.WHAT WORKED FOR ME: I wanted to retain my curls, but that they look thicker. I was ready to decide it doesn't really work. Then I though I'd give it a try with my hair not wet, but not quite fully dry. I dried my hair as usual, but stopped before it was fully dry. Then I put some Fattener on my fingers, rubbed my hands together and fluffed up my curls. I found it worked! My hair looks thicker, and it is still soft and curly. Also,(as a note) my hands did not feel greasy or oily after the application. I guess if you buy it, you really have to try it different ways. I see from other reviews, that it seems to work for some people and not for others. I took off 1 star because it took me so long to find the right method for me."
1,"I like this shampoo. It does not have all that suds that run into your eyes but it cleans your hair very well and when used with the conditioner, it is the bomb."
1,"I can't afford botox so I started using frownies many years ago and they work. It's not permanent, you have to wear them everyday or at least every other day (I wear them over night while sleeping).  It really smoothed out my brow furrow to where you can't even see it any more. They also helped with the lines that run from the nose down to the mouth on both sides of the face. One thing about removing them though, hold a warm wet washcloth on patches for easier removal, or it might be uncomfortable. With consistent use I have seen a dramatic change."
1,"This product is much more watery than I expected. It would be nice if it had more consistency that you are used to from face wash as I find a lot of it going through my fingers when I try to create a lather. This also makes it difficult to wash around your eyes when it runs all over, so it ends up stinging your eyes and creating a little redness. The smell is great though and feels extremely clean."
1,"I have been using this lotion for quite some time - probably about 9 months now, and I absolutely love it. It's lightweight and oil free and it makes a great base under foundation too. I love that it contains SPF too. A nice feature this product has is that it doesn't leave that whitened look on your skin after application as a lot of lotions with sunscreen do. As far as the wrinkle prevention Q10 is concerned I haven't noticed any lessening of my lines of my face, but I also haven't noticed any new ones either so maybe it's preventing new wrinkles? Anyhow, this is a very nice lightweight SPF that feels nice on your face and won't break you out."
0,"I read the reviews on this item and I wish it would have worked better for me.  I am gray/blonde and my hair needed some conditioning so I read the reviews and one person even said they kept it on all night.  DON'T DO THIS.  iF your hair is really dry or brittle and you put a softening agent like this one on it, it will make it soft alright, it caused pretty bad breakage at the crown of my hair.  Now, some could say, it wasn't this, but I know it happened right after I washed it out.  It was very very soft but so soft it broke since it was dry.  I have never had a real case of breakage or split ends so I was pretty shocked.  My husband noticed it and said, you better check out your hair.  There's got to be something in this product that softens too much.  I am living proof.  I take good care of my hair, and I will never put anything Neutrogena on my hair again.  Glad it worked for some people.  I recommend Purelology shampoo, conditioner, and when you put the conditioner on, dilute it so that fragile or dry hair isn't overweighed by the thick substance of recovery mask and breaks.  This was not recovery for me, it's going to take a long time and lots of babying to work with this breakage.  I hope this helps people who really need their hair replenished."
1,I really enjoy the Aveeno line.  Nice products.  Now if I could just look like Jennifer Aniston (spokesperson for Aveeno if you didn't know.).
0,"I REALLY, REALLY wanted to like this.  Was so anxious to get it.  Other reviews were great so I am wondering if mine just got messed up or something.  It stinks.  Really stinks.  Nothing musky at all about this.  It smells like hand soap but not the good kind.  So disappointed.  Cant even describe the smell - just a strong flowery scent and smells like cheap soap / lotion."
1,Bought this for my son who is 11. My  esthetician recommended his product. Easy to use and love how it foams up. Easy to use and wash off. Smell is good too.
0,"I didn't realize that 5x magnification was not very much. Following cataract surgery, I now do not have any close-up vision and hoped this would be good for putting on mascara, but NO."
1,"Fuzz free precision. I luv luv luv these. For mani cleanups and eye makeup, they're wound tight and get in corners. Absorbent without oversaturating. I needed these.My local drugstore has a tapered swab, but they're nothing close to these in quality or application."
0,"I recieved this and put it in my hair, the color turned out really odd, and the conditioner that came with this was gritty and didn't really condition. It looked so odd I had to go to a stylist to get the color evened out. I have used bottle color before and have never had this happen."
0,"I've been using the roC Deep Correction Wrinkle Cream morning and night now for about a month.  I apply only to my forehead, between my eyebrows, to my nasolabial folds, and my neck.  I'm 40, so my wrinkles are not deep or pronounced but I definitely have them.  The pros: my skin sometimes reacts badly to skincare products, but this did not irritate at all, which is why I started applying it in the morning AND night.  The smell is pleasant, and the texture is fairly light.  The cons:  nothing is happening.  After about a month, my wrinkles and lines have not diminished or softened one bit.  I was really hoping it would work on the frown lines between my eyebrows, but there was no improvement at all.  I'm about halfway through the tube and will use up the rest.  If anything changes, I'll edit my review, but I really don't expect any results if I haven't seen any by now.UPDATE 3-22-12 I've finished the tube, applying it both morning and night, and still NO REDUCTION in wrinkles, fine or deep.  A waste of money."
0,"The pigment on this color blush is so heavy and thick. If you make the mistake of putting on too much it is definitely a clown color on fair skin.  Consistency is also poor made me break out.  If this is NARS, it is highly overrated and definitely overpriced."
1,"I've tried many toners and I have to say I love this product!  After cleansing my face, I apply with cotton swabs and my skin feels so great!  In addition, there is no overwhelming smell.  Once again, Olay lives up to their own standard of quality products . ."
1,I was perfectly happy with this purchase & good price!  I have used this exact product for years .. the ONLY curling iron that  heats up fast & hot enough to do the job for me .. plus has a nice long life  On and on and on!  Once I found this brand I have never switched .. have used it for years .. have it in just about every size for all the different hair styles I've had over the years! You won't be disappointed .. IF you are comfortable with a Marcel curling iron.  Great Product!
0,"I really hoped to like this but it is just o.k. I've tried all the top department store mascaras and this isn't anything special. This is over $30.00 and it doesn't compete with Lancme or Dior. I have found my favorite so far, Benefit they're Real. It makes lashes super long and thick."
1,"I loved this one, I used it for many years all thru highschool because it covered all my acne and flaws.Unlike the cream liquid foundation this press foundation doesnt take too long to put on.Its really easy and you can carry it with you if you need to reapply it in the afternoon.I dont like the newer maybellines liquid foundation dont bother buying it."
1,"This is one of my favorite scents of all time.  I had to get it as soon as it came out a few years back and I have loved it ever since.  Nowadays, every celebrity has their own scents and they all start smelling the same.  Jlo is one of the originals and I am never disappointed with her fragrances.  I've tried a few others but this is by far the best.  It has a very light, fresh scent.  It doen't smell grandmaish like others have stated but that is just my opinion."
1,"Everything about this soap, except its shape, is terrific.  I love the fragrance, it lathers moderately well in hard water, it leaves my skin soft and lightly fragranced, and I have had no allergic reactions as has happened with other soaps.  That said, the square shape can make the soap difficult to hold (I have small hands) when it's slippery in the shower.  I would prefer an oval or rectangular shape, which I did not know until I purchased and used this soap.  Lesson learned in a mostly-pleasant way."
1,Feels and smells great
0,"I have long, fine hair, greasy on the roots but dry at  the ends. I  was looking for a good and cheap moisturizing treatment. I read many reviews about Nutrogena Triple Moisture at the web and Amazon. Every time i use it ( i just put it from the middles through ends) my hair feels greasy and heavy  as if it were dirty. I think it most be for very dry and damaged hair."
0,I used this once before.. it dried out my face quite a bit.. And Look at the ingredients this item contains methylparaben! All paraben's are bad for your skin and are known to cause cancer. Its is in many makeups and its slowly being taken out of the products we use. try to find something with more natural ingredients that WONT give you skin cancer.
1,"I have been using moisturizer from all stretches of the earth. NuSkin to dead sea to japanese products to Exuviance. This one moisturizes very well. The thing about less-expensive moisturizers are that they do the same job, but they are thicker. I have been having drier skin, overall after using this for a year, so I'm not sure if the long term benefits are good. My skin looks older but I don't think it is due to this product or just aging. This product is a bit too much for summertime, if you have an oily/shiny t-zone."
0,"I have used Olay regenerating serum for years now. This is the first time I bought it through Amazon, I always bought it at the store in the past. It came in a different package than the serum I always bought in the store. It also has different consistency and feels different on my skin. I will not be buying it from Amazon again. At a store, at least I can see what I'm getting."
1,"Works great and I got it for half the price as I could have from CVS so I'm definitely happy with that, I use it as a toner."
1,"I cannot believe how great this moisturizer is, especially for the price. It is such an excellent deal! I use this every night after I wash my face, and my skin looks fantastic (if i do say so...) I don't have any breakouts, which i used to have occasionally, and my skin is so smooth. I've recommended this to so many of my friends and family members, and they all love it too."
1,"As a body oil it's just fine.... I like to use a cap full in a bath. It makes my skin very soft. It will make your bathtub just disgusting though, you will have to clean it after.But the smell.... It's not my favorite to begin with, but it's ok. It's just SO strong!!!!! I give it 3 stars because it works well and does what it supposed to, but I actually don't use it. I can't handle the scent, or its strength of scent I guess."
1,"These patches really work to prevent forehead and in-between brow wrinkles.  If you have them, they at least will help them from getting worse and with good use of wrinkle creams, it will help get rid of them.  It's cheaper than getting Botox injections and of course, it's pain free."
1,LOVE IT! GREAT SIZE FOR TRAVEL AND CARRYING WITH YOU.WONDERFUL FOR SENSIVE SKIN - WORKS GREAT ONECZEMA AND MCS SUFFERERS.
1,"I use it on my part where new hair growth appears white every 3 weeks. It works well, you just need to wet the product before smearing it onto the hair."
1,This file is a plain piece of stainless steel.  It is fairly long.  It has a cleaner tip on the end.  It does what it is supposed to do and should last a very long time.
1,"I love AHA Lotion. Here are the reasons why: No#1. This is 10% AHA in it which is the most percentage I've been able to find in a face lotion. No#2. I noticed a difference in my skin over the course of 3 days of using this product and No#3. It does not dry out my skin. I just love this stuff. I have hyper pigmentation and lots of acne scars around my cheek and chin area and this product has lightened those areas a lot since I have first used it. No other product has came close.. I've been using neutrogena, aveeno and those horrible harsh chemical peels in vain for years thinking it was helping my skin but... I got a wake up call when I started using AHA, it's awesome! I use it about two times a day. In the morning and I leave it on at night. I love how it feels when I first put it on because I can feel tingling and thats when you know it's exfoliating. I used something similar to this years ago and I loved the results but it dried out my skin way too much. I'm glad they came up with a product for people with dry skin! I love this stuff."
1,"This brush is designed for thick, long or medium length hair. When I was naturally curly I used this brush all the time to smooth and shape my hair into perfect curls. The trick is to put conditioner or gel onto wet/damp hair and to section it off before you use the Denman brush. Since you're brushing your hair while it's wet, it's important to take your time using the brush. Also, the brush does well with straightening your hair while you blow dry. I never had any problems with my hair being tangled in the brush. As for durability, it depends on where and how frequently you use it. If you use it in the shower, the pink rubber will loosen, making the pins appear shorter and therefore less effective.  I've been using the Denman brush for 6 years and it's the only brush I'll use for my hair."
0,"This Black Opium scent reminds me of those cheap Chinese plastic goods you get at the Ranch 99 or those Chinese markets that sell plastic goods - plastic cups, bowls, lunch boxes, etc. I bought it from Amazon but I am very displeased with the scent. I'm more into floral and berry scents like Victoria's Secret. I don't think this is suitable for women in their 20s. It has a deeper, earthy, somewhat ethnic scent. I wouldn't call it a fragrance good to wear. Maybe as a soap fragrance for the hands, but definitely not for the body. It doesn't smell that inviting."
1,I love this brush!! I have had other curl brushes in the past and by far this beats them all!I have very thin and long hair and needed a brush that wouldnt a) get all tangled and b) had quality enough to be used every day. This brush met those standards and some. I chose a bigger barrel because I like the volume that produces.
1,i mix this with Booster C Powder and i've notice a big difference in only two weeks. No foundation Needed.
1,"Neutrogena is a great product, but it's pretty drying which was expected.  It's just too expensive to be a regular purchase."
1,"i use this towel every single day for my breakage prone fine hair. Unlike other reviewers, it doesn't totally soak the moisture out of my hair and for me isn't too much more absorbent than a regular towel. It just somehow FEELS different running it across my hair and I enjoy not having a ton of weight on top of my head pulling on my hair. I am able to wrap up all of my hair in this and it stays up just fine wrapped up like a turban."
1,This OPI color is really great and subtle for summer wear. This is great polish that is well worth the price.
0,"This item doesn't adequately moisturize and is greasy for my combination skin. I only put it on my dry cheeks, avoiding my t zone since that's oily. It makes my dry cheeks greasy and I don't need that. However, it works well for my mom, who has normal skin."
1,"I'll start by saying I have very sensitive skin, and this did not bother me, so that's definitely a positive! My skin is also very dry, and this is a nice thick, unscented cream that moisturizes without leaving a greasy feel. As far as the wrinkle reducing power, we'll have to see. It claims visible results within 5 weeks, so I'll have to wait a little longer. In the meantime, it's a great moisturizer for sensitive skin for before bed and under my makeup in the morning."
1,"The color payoff was pretty good on my previously dyed hair (Asian virgin black to dark auburn, then faded to a brownish color). It is definitely not a natural color obviously, my results came out similar to the picture, but a bit darker. Overall I'm pleased, but would probably go for a less orange color next time."
1,This is my 1st time trying PCA's Blemish Control Bar. I love PCA products and needed something to help with hormonal body acne. This worked surprisingly fast to reduce inflammation and clear small bumps. It did cause a little over drying but PCA's Protecting Hydrator helps with that.
1,"If you're a fan of girly soft pink shades, this is for you. It has a slight shimmer, and a powdery pink color that's perfect for Valentines day or a sweet date night."
1,"I keep coming back to this mascara. Not due to superior coverage or lengthening, but due to the fact that is never clumps. I have other mascaras that I like for a while, until it starts clumping. This mascara never seems to clump, even after you have had it a couple of months. I will say that with the waterproof, you need to let it dry between coats. I have tried many brands and types. This wand works very well for both top and bottom lashes and there is a reason it has been around for so long. It is cost effective and just performs well."
1,"Works really well on my natural Afro textured hair. Makes my hair soft and smells amazing, I do recommend to EVERYONE"
1,"Since I've turned 20, I have had problems with blemishes. So, for the last few years, I began to try many different face cleansers and lotions to solve the problem, and finally stumbled upon this one. It's lightweight and definitely moisturizes just enough. I never feel like my face is oily or greasy. My blemishes haven't completely gone away, but ever since I began using this lotion, my skin has been noticeably clearer. I assume it's because it doesn't clog my pores like my old lotion must have. The only complaint I have is about the bottle. When you squeeze it, you either get no lotion, or the lotion explodes everywhere. I wish they would put a pump on the bottle or something, so that I wouldn't be wasting so much lotion when I barely squeeze it and it all comes flying out."
1,I love this.  It's not to heavy.  Especially in the summer.
0,I wanted this to work so badly since it's natural but it didn't do anything for my acne. It's a waste of money.
1,"I bought mine after a salon facial and have been using it ever since.  I agree with others on the design and how it gently exfoliates, especially on my problem nose and around my mouth..  My face looks and feels healthier and I've had several periods where I stopped using the brush regularly and later regretted it, going back to my gentle daily scrub.  I also agree that the design doesn't allow for soap or bacteria build-up at the base of the bristles, as long as you rinse well. Someone mentioned the expense. . . well, I've had close to 10,000 facial washings over the years - I think it's paid for itself!"
1,Seems like a fairly decent moisturizer. Nothing special.
1,"I have tried facial creams priced from 200 dollars to 4.99!  Aveeno is the very best without question.  It hydrates, smooths, lightens dark areas, and is never greasy.  Just try it once ~  you wont regret it!NOTE:  I recently discovered I have a wheat intolerance.  SOME, not all, Aveeno product use wheat and oats.  Even on my skin, I had problems with reactions.  If you do not have wheat issue...  The Aveeno line is excellent in both results and social responsibility."
1,I was expecting it will help my acne ridden back but it had no effect at all.No special experience.
1,"I've tried allot of these types of products (should mention I'm a hair stylist & can get many hair products at half price or less) & even the so called ""expensive brand named ones"" to me I hated. They all stunk & looked like I dumped a bottle of baby powder all over my hair. With allot of good reviews on here I decided to give this one a whirl. Loved it! Yes, you do have to lather it until your hair is pretty wet but it WORKS (for me anyways) & I have very fine/kind of oily hair. Sure beats washing it every day & styling it over & over each day. Not to mention doing that every day really drys out & damages it. This doesn't. I recommend it for sure."
1,"I have been diagnosed with PCOS, and am aware of where my hormone levels are through blood panels.  After using this product (and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and working with a naturopath) my progesterone levels are in normal range (along with the rest of my hormone panel).  Which means, no more constant ovarian cysts!  For the first time in my life."
1,I purchased this cleanser and am quite pleased with the results.  The item is now one of my regular purchases.  Thick cream and if you put it in the fridge it is great to put on cold and then wash off or wipe off after it warms to regular temperature.  This little trick also keeps the product shelf life longer and is so soothing after a hard day.
0,Really stiff bristles. They are very painful if you scratch your scalp with them and they pull your hair. Get's caught easily if you aren't careful. Not for fine hair.
1,"I would not expect this product to solve any ongoing problems for you (i.e. acne, pores, blackheads), but it IS a great mask. I have sensitive skin that is acne prone, and I try to use this once/week to rejuvenate my skin.  I love how clean, fresh, and glowy I look after using it. In fact, I have taken to using it for special nights out and such because my skin looks a little brighter and feels much softer.Word of advice - wear a headband/pony tail when putting this on, or those little hairs that sweep around your face will end up stuck to it.Cleanse your skin well before using this, with warm water to open the pores.  Blot your skin dry and apply a thin layer to your face. Yes, it's goopy and sticky, but it's not bad once you get used to it.  I usually put a grape-sized spot right in the middle of my cheek, then use my fingers to spread it around.  I apply only with my right hand so that I don't end up with TWO sticky hands.Leave it on for at least 10 minutes; a few minutes longer if it still feels damp in spots. At the end of my time, I get a few fingertips barely damp, then rub them near my temples to loosen up the mask enough for me to pull off.If the whole mask won't pull off, just use a warm washcloth to gently wipe it away.  Moisturize after!"
1,"If only I could keep it in my purse!  It's purple, which means it should be mine.  However my contractor husband has confinscated it, because it is the best file ever!  We won't buy any others again. This is the cream on the top!"
1,I have been using this soap for years because it doesn't have the harmful chemicals regular soap has in it.  It has a pleasant scent.  I feel cleaner using this soap.
1,"It works, and clears your zits but not fast enough for me. It also dries out your skin like crazy so I recommend using a moisturizer afterwards."
1,If you use these religiously they will help.  Be realistic though.  They're not a miracle cure.  They're not an over night success story.  But they do work.
1,"Initially I began but putting this on my face after washing it. I must say that it can't be used alone. The product dries (not absorbs) pretty quick but after a minute it feels like my face has a mask on it and it looks like my skin is peeling. I put my regular moisturizer ( which is olive squalene or shea butter) over it and everything was fine.I've been using the product on my face and now my body for more than 2 months and I'm on my second bottle and its really working. My skin heals faster from acne scarring and hyperpigmentation  , it prevents my skin from getting aggravated if i use something harsh on my skin, and it doesn't aggravate my eczema (but it does not prevent it flare ups from other factors). I also must say that since i've been using the product my eyebrows, eyelashes, and some other unwanted facial hair grows back a little faster... its slightly annoying but not enough to stop me from using the product.Other random things about the product... I don't refrigerate it and it lasts. It also mixes well with oils and natural moisturizers but if you use it/mix it with lotions that are thin (not creamy and absorb quickly) i find that some of the flaking will still occur.I would recommend this product but you have to use it under a compatible moisturizer."
1,"I purchased this brush to use on a wig and it works much better than a congenital brush, which I had used until this purchase.  My only concern would be the firmness of the bristles, which I think might contribute to the loss of wig fibers over time."
1,The brush applicator makes it way easier to apply to eyelashes to ensure that glue gets all over the lash strip. However be very careful to close the lid tightly or else this will dry up.
1,"I'm nowhere near menopause but use this to aid with estrogen dominance and the PMS I experience monthly. I'd be lost without this stuff. I no longer suffer the crazy mood swings, irritability, difficulty sleeping, emotional highs and lows, and all the other fun PMS-related things that I used to contend with. This stuff is fantastic. I've been using it for years and have no plans to stop. I've tried many brands of progesterone cream over the years, and this is the last one I tried. I intend to stick with this brand, because I feel it is the most effective (at least for me). This stuff is a lifesaver for anyone suffering from estrogen dominance and/or PMS.It has a really light scent to it. Other brands I've tried never smelled bad, per se, but this is the most pleasant-smelling of all the ones I've used. It's also not greasy and washes off my hands easily after application.My boyfriend loves it too, because it prevents me from turning into the lunatic that I used to become every month. :-P"
1,I USE THIS AFTER EVERY WASH AND AFTER EVERY DEEP CONDITIONER. YOUR HAIR WILL LOVE THIS STUFF. USE WITH THE ENTIRE APHOGEE LINE LIKE I DO.
1,"and this natural deodorant is so far the best!! Remember..it wont keep you dry..but I actually dont stink! lol...If Im being totally honest, it doesnt last the entire day, but, Id say about a good 5 hours. For me, thats pretty long for a natural deodorant to work."
0,"I bought this product for my 4-year-old so refuses to stop sucking on his index finger.  I applied it on his finger and it didn't bother him at all.  I kept applying it hoping that eventually I would start seeing results but nope,  I didn't.  I ended up sawing a glove to one of my son's long sleeve shirts and that finally helped break the habit."
1,I use this moisturizer with my Clinique acne solutions clearing moisturizer. It works really great for my moderate acne. I love it!! I use daily in the morning n night.
1,"I have tried tons of mascara, yet I always come back to this one.  This mascara is amazing.  I almost NEVER get clumps, the brush is PERFECT so I never end up with thickly caked lashes and the mascara is thick enough to coat each lash and not coat groups of lashes in to one bulky mess.  I just love it!  I just wish Amazon carried more of the brownish shades of this mascara... I would highly recommend this mascara to anyone.  I've been using it for about 15 years now and have never found a decent alternative."
1,"I am an african american with 4a hair and bought this brush because of all of the rave reviews for it on natural hair blogs, thinking it would be the end all and be all or brushes. Even after removing every other row the brush still pulls my hair out, I mostly use it now when my hair is straight to wrap it."
1,This is the best shampoo for my English springer spaniel!!!  In minutes her hair is soft and detangled and the scent is beautiful!!  I won't ever buy anything else for her coat!
1,"I LOVED this shade on me...wish I didn't have to shell out $11+ for it...if it ever drops to a $7 membership auto ship, count me in!"
1,this moisturizer is amazing.. it never make my face oily but it moisturize it is a perfect way that I can use my primer and foundation without having oily spots on my nose or chin... go go go
1,"This is good It never ceases to amaze me how well I clean my face, and then these pads still pick up dirt! Must be one ingredient in here that does a good job picking up excess dirt. I ordered from yolo beauty through Amazon. Not sure how other people are having issues with this seller, or maybe others? I am sure there are some fakes online. Always are. Honestly it does smell more alcohol -like than peachy. Up close pure alcohol but as it fades, you can definitely smell some peach. So, if the seller I got is not genuine, they are doing a good job hiding it. Mine was sealed. The only negative is the textured side. I was mostly doing the cleanse side. Today, I really used the other side (I can have sensitive skin). Too much for my face. It got a little red. Will stick with just using the other side. All in all, good product."
1,this product is so light and smooth feeling i use it every day and i love it i would buy again
1,"I've found this shampoo in Mom's grocery stores, but they are almost always cheaper online.  It has a gentler formula than let's say selsun blue.  It also has a &#34;fresh&#34; smell.  It does not smell like tea or mint.  However, it is a little on the &#34;runny&#34; side for shampoo and may leave a little &#34;dustiness&#34; to your hair.  I'm not sure if it just makes my hair attract dust, if it's shampoo residue.  It's not noticeable unless you examine your hair under a microscope - which i do."
1,I Love it! I brush my hair out with this in the morning and go from bed head to beautiful.
1,"This hair dryer is nice and my hair is left dry and bouncy for the most part, but for some reason the bonnet doesn't reach the back of my head. I wear small rollers and I have to hold the bonnet up to dry the end of my hair. Just know it's worth the money, if it suits you."
1,I used to use a moisturizer from Yves Rocher but it got too expensive and it was only 1.7 oz.This product is amazing and is much better than what I was using. It makes your skin so soft but yet the acne is kept at bay. I haven't had any acne since I have been using this product which is an amazing 2 weeks!This product is very affordable and I love that it is 4 oz.I use this moisturizer with the Aveeno Clear Complexion Bar. These 2 products are really great together.
1,"I just completed my first tube of this product. I first saw it on Allure's magazine product of the year, and bought it. Is the best night cream you can use. Evens out your skin and protects it. It will also make it looks healthier with time."
0,"UHG. How did I fall for &#34;100% Gel.&#34; Yuck. As another reviewer pointed out, that does not mean 100% Aloe... I tried to use this once, but it just didn't even feel right. Waste of money!!!"
1,"This used to smell like coconut, doesn't anymore. It used to get tangles out much easier than it does now. I wonder if the product has been changed? It's ok, but I am going to look around for something that works a little better."
1,I  have discoloration on my check and it disappear slowly but surely --I will definitely add this to my subscribe listyayReena
1,"after reading reviews on several products I decided to go with Camille Beckman.  I'm happy with the product, and as others say in their reviews, the scent is not strong.  I use it before I got to bed as it seems to linger a bit on the skin so if I use it during the day I almost feel as though I'm washing some off when I wash my hands.  I purchased the Secret Sea and the scent is fine, not floral, but hard to describe.  Overall, happy with the purchase."
1,"I have been using this cream for the past 6 months and I noticed how radiant it made my skin look in just days!I wanted that summer glow and smooth skin, and it works perfect! I always loved aveeno products!"
1,I used to break out on my back (esp. since I have very long hair) and ever since I started using this body wash my back really has cleared up.
1,This detangeler works well for my hair. Amazing is a good way to describe this comb. If your looking for a  detangler that will reduce hair lost this is for you.
1,"I have used this mascara for more than 10 years.  I have tried different and more expensive ones over the years, but this one is the best!  I am glad they have it on subscribe and save now."
1,this is good as we have one is our trailer and so we are able to take the ones from there and place in this for winter storage.
1,Good for both males and females.  It works well and we hope it continues to perform as well after time.  Arrived on time.
1,Good quality product! I love it and I would recommend this product line to everyone who is in need of natural oils.
1,"I will definitely buy this product again. It shipped moderately fast, just in time to keep me from going crazy about my hair color, haha. I have naturally auburn hair, so it made my hair nice and orange. :) I love it and I would definitely recommend it to people with any hair type, it makes it nice and shimmery just like the name. Hah."
1,I love this lotion! Good moisturizer and it smells great! I bought it to help relieve stress and I'd say it definitely makes my mornings more relaxed!
1,I had a terrible skin ailment that only seem to get better with this soap.  Ended up using the whole bar but have not had a problem since.
1,"Vanilla Sugar is a nice colour for me. (I have blonde hair, blue eyes, and very pale skin.) I go for a natural look, and it highlights nicely and fits nicely for my &#34;no-makeup&#34; Makeup style. It's easy to use, and it'll last me a good long time."
1,This product is wonderfulIt came fast and it makes my skin moisture and smooth.I am really satisfied and happy.
1,"I have tried many different lotions and this is the best one I have ever tried. It keeps my skin moisturized without being overly oily and sticky. It doesn't dry out my skin after and it is fragrance free. It doesn't leave a noticeable residue or layer of oil on my skin. It is well priced too. I have used expensive brand lotions that only dry out my skin more, leave my skin too oily or irritate my skin.Cetaphil is amazing."
1,"Despite the cheap price this is one of the best mud masks I have tried. It's a product that actually leaves your skin feeling much tighter. I wouldn't apply this product liberally, just doing a nice thin layering and letting it dry. I find that ocassionally it will make my skin feel tingy. I would only use this product once or twice a week thought because it is very drying to the skin."
1,bright crystals reminds me of Victoria Secrets Gorgeous fragrance mist. its a very fresh smell. i bought the .17 oz bottle. i wont buy it anymore. i get a large 8.4 ox body mist from Victoria secret that smells just as good.
1,It would scare a person to see their actual skin with the build up of what some cleansers leave.This cleanser is gentle yet highly effective. It is a definite must if you are using the other ObagiNu Derm products and to me a must even if you weren't.
0,"This thing doesn't actually deserve ANY stars, but that's not an option here, so it gets the requisite one star.Don't waste your money. Within fifteen minutes (I kid you not - I timed it, prompted by the negative reviews I saw on this site) of starting this thing up, the stoopid thing overheated and shut itself off. This thing spent more time off than on. With the quantity of hair that I have, I normally spend easily an hour and a half to two hours under any dryer in order to completely dry my hair.I'm going to buy another Lady Dazey dryer as soon as I can get my hands on one - I've had one of those for over a decade, and only recently has it started acting up!Do yourself a favor: find a Helen of Troy brand Lady Dazey soft bonnet dryer - those things are more dependable than anything else out there, and worth EVERY penny!"
1,"Love,Love it. I came across this product by accident. i read the reviews and decided to give it a try, well i&#34;m in love! My skin is so soft and even. I can't say enough about this magic in a bottle."
1,"If you like Great Lash, then you will like this. It's a pretty, rich shade of blue. It does show up on my brown lashes but doesn't look silly. It's subtle, they only people that noticed were ones talking to me face to face. But from a few feet away, no, it's not noticeable. If you want a bigger pow, try layering a white lash primer underneath. It's a nice change from everyday black or brown."
1,"Love this cleanser! Not only does it remove everything - it's gentle, doesn't sting, and suds up easily. This cleanser would be great for all skins. I have normal skin and just love it."
1,"It's hard to get this butter out from the can. You have to scoop it out and then microwave it. Also, it is not easy for skin to absorb, you get that sticky feeling after applying it. It did not work for me."
1,I remember using this as a kid. It has a light scent and makes your hands feel so soft! It's great for dry hands and you only need to use a little bit.
1,"I have extremely sensitive skin, as well a huge pores.  So, I was really happy when this mask not only made my face look more refreshed and healthy, but didn't even irritate it a little bit!"
0,"I did not love it. There are better and less costly products available. So, pass this one up . From now on, I am."
1,"I have been using the product for about a month. I can't really say I can tell a difference in my skin but I will continue to use the bottle and report back after more time. I will say that it says it is odor free on the bottle but it has a very strong, not very pleasant smell."
1,"I have tried several concealers over the years, especially recently (getting older and have more to cover).  I have pretty bad under-eye discoloration and have used dermablend for probably 15+ years.  It does tend to cake if you don't use the right powder and a primer, but is BY FAR the best and longest lasting concealer!  Other brands do not cover my raccoon eyes at all, or if they do, the effect has warn off after an hour or two.  Dermablend lasts, even through sweat (for a reasonable amount of time).  But it comes off easy once I wash my face with soap or use a make up removing towelette.  You should definitely try this product.  To avoid caking, I finish with laura mercier's translucent setting powder, and use her primer to start.  Also, dermablend has great skin-matching colors.  I'm pale and somewhat yellow, and their &#34;ivory&#34; comes off as very natural.  Can't even tell it's there."
1,I purchased this product to alleviate symptoms from seasonal allergies. Every spring  my eyes itch and I'm constantly sneezing. Most allergy medications are too expensive and/or ineffective or cause drowiness. After researching the benefits of steam treatements for people like me I purchased the Conair Facial Sauna. I realize this product is designed for cosmetic reasons but it does the same thing the more expensive allergy/sinus steam machines do for a third of the price. I used it at night for 5 minutes and my eyes stop itching and I get restful sleep. I don't know if this product makes the skin glow as some other reviewers have claimed but it couldn't hurt. I would purchase again.
0,"My sister had one and I did too.  The dryer would turn off on everything but the low setting right out of the box. Both units did this. Do not buy. No, you're not going to be one of the lucky ones...don't buy this piece of junk."
0,"Never got a chance to rip the benefits of this oil. It smells just like a fuel (my friends confirmed) and I can not put in my mouth something that smells like a gasoline... I using it as a moisturizer for legs for about 3 weeks, but do not see any change :("
1,"Awesome lotion for anyone suffering from dry skin. It works especially well for dry cracked heels and feet.  If you're having problems with cracked heels just apply a thick layer before bed and don't forget to put on some socks, otherwise you'll get the sheets all messy.The reason that the neutrogena takes so long to dry on your skin is because of the high percentage of glycerin in it. But that's also what makes it so good for your skin."
1,"I am fair, and oily and this is the best powder i have found for my problem.  I love love love it!"
0,"i have really sensitive skin, and this was really harsh on my face. it burnt every time i applied it."
1,"I am a cosmetologist and I only use Marcel Irons.I was so thankful to know I could purchase on Amazon.This iron is fantastic!,It heats up quickly, it has a long cord and I use it daily at the salon."
1,"I bought this for 1/2 price at Marshalls recently and will never be without it or the conditioner again. I consider my long straight colored layered hair to be healthy, but using these products makes it healthier then ever. The smell is great and the product works really well Love it!"
0,"I like the size of the barrel on this iron and I like the results I got with it.  However the design of the kickstand and its location are horrible and unsafe.When you heat the iron up on the higher settings the kickstand gets very, very hot and it's very difficult to use the iron without touching that kickstand because of where it's located.  I burned my hand on it while holding the iron and then I burned my face with the kickstand while curing my hair.I'm not at all happy with this product and I'm returning it after using it only twice."
1,"This is an amazing night cream. I wanted to try a mild retinol product to see how it affected my acne prone skin and I am happy to say that there are only two products in the world that do not make me break out after using it and this is one of them. I noticed my skin was much smoother after just the first application and only improved afterwards. No tingling or burning as with other retinol products and I even applied it around my eyes without any negative reactions. There wasn't any significant improvement with the fine wrinkles that I have on my forehead due to sun exposure but it is still a wonderful night cream. Overall, I definitely recommend this product."
0,"I purchased this as I love Olay regineris.  I was hoping this would be similar.  It is nothing more then a night cream.  While it is thick and creamy it didn't do anything to firm my skin, diminish fine lines or even out my skin tone.  Disappointing"
1,Not that great a brush. It pulled my hair and did not really assist in drying my hair quickly. Not the best brush I ever purchased. It's okay.
1,"To start, I will say that I have very sensitive, acne-prone, quite fair skin. However, living in Florida in the summer like I am right now, my complexion is on the fair side of light. I also have trouble with freckles and sun damage. Now that that it's out of the way...I recently began a skin care routine with an AHA exfoliating cleanser, and soon realized that for once in my life I would need a moisturizer to prevent dryness, even though I usually skip moisturizers due to oily skin. Figuring I might as well kill two birds with one stone and treat my sun damage, I went to the store to buy a dark spot correcting moisturizer and walked out with this. There are three reasons I ultimately chose this product:1. It had the highest SPF (30), which of course helps when attempting to fade sun damage.2. It has the Aveeno soy ingredients, which I personally trust a lot for fading dark spots (I believe hydroquinone probably works best for this but my skin is too sensitive for it)3. It is tinted, which I figured would help me want to apply it daily which is necessary for the soy to fade sun spots.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase. This product has basically replaced foundation for me. It covers more like a foundation than a tinted moisturizer and is easier to apply than foundation; I just quickly apply it with my fingers and never have to worry about streaking or caking. It doesn't sting my sensitive skin like so many products do, even though it has SPF and fragrance which my skin is extra reactive to. It also doesn't break me out.Now the shortcomings. Luckily these drawbacks don't affect me too much, but I want to address them. First of all, the shade. I bought this in the Fair to Light shade, but it should be sold as Light or even Light to Medium. The tone is a little orange, but doesn't look bad on my Light skin as long as I do a light application. However, this product definitely won't work for me closer to winter. A tip from beauty school for those who have a hard time with this or any product not quite matching her skin: try blending the product onto your ear lobes and down the center of your neck for a more natural look. If you do this carefully, it can help a bit.The other drawback: greasiness. Guys, in shopping for SPF products you're gonna deal with some shine. It's a property of some common sunscreen ingredients and this product does have more sunscreen in it than most similar products. I already struggle with very oily skin and notice a little shine from this product but as long as I do a light application and follow with a finishing powder it doesn't bother me. It is worth it for the SPF and I think this texture helps prevent streaking and caking, which I mentioned earlier.Overall I am very satisfied with this product. It serves its purpose as a moisturizer, it is a convenient alternative to foundation, the SPF is high enough to actually help protect against the sun unlike most similar products, and although  haven't been using it long I have faith in the soy formula to eventually help with sun spots. But do be careful with the Fair to Light shade If you are pretty fair, and be ready to deal with a little bit of shine (again, worth it for the sun protection If you ask me)."
0,This comb does not detangle your hair wet or dry. I do detest false advertisement. Keep your money in your pocket.
1,"yes, yes, it can happen to the best of us (and I cringe as I say this) --dandruff.this gets rid of it. sure, if you're a female like me it will leave you smelling like a pine tree but it gets the work done. just work in some nicely scented conditioner after and you'll be fine.great price, easy to travel with and it does the job. good stuff."
1,"This is great eyeliner.  I'm terrible with eyeliner pencils.  I find it way easier to use cake eyeliner.  It's much easier if you're like me and aren't very good at drawing precise, straight lines.  It helps make my eyes look a bit darker as well so they pop."
1,"This product will do everything it claims to. However, the first few days of use I was dissapointed because I was not seeing many results. What I was doing was washing with Purity at night, applying a thin layer of Help Me, and applying a good layer of Hope In A Jar to prevent dryness. I didn't know why it wasn't working, so I decided to try it by itself without HIAJ on top. Just the retinol alone. This was not a problem because it did not cause any dryness for me at all anyway. I also liked this a lot better because the two combined was making my skin too oily.Well... I woke up the next morning with crystal clear, glowing skin!!! And these results are continuing, as long as I apply it by itself. I now believe this is because, according to what I've read,  Alpha Hydroxy Acids deactivate retinol, and as far as I know HIAJ contains AHAs. In fact, I'e read that retinol is very unstable in general, so I wouldn't apply it with anything else. If anyone else has had similar experiences using these two products together, please let me know. Perhaps do an experiment one night leaving out your HIAJ and see if you get better results.Here are some other tips. I've found using it every other day is best, or else my skin gets used to it and stops seeing results. I've also found that if I skip washing my face on the mornings after I apply it, the retinol keeps working and my skin looks great. If I wash, it sometimes looks as if I washed all the benefits off. :( As much as I hate not washing my face in the AM, my skin looks amazing if I just leave it as it is, applying only a high SPF on top for the day."
1,I like this a lot. I always use this right before I get out of the shower and put lotion afterwards. It will make your skin feeling soft and smooth and it last really long.
1,I used to buy this product at ultra.  So glad that I found it here at a better price.  I use this weekly and it works great.  No streaks at all
1,"I have been using this product for years now. Good moisturizer for day or night. If you use on a regular basis, I suggest that you get a subscription through Amazon to get discount on product."
1,"Let me first describe my skin: a lot of scars from acne and sun damage (used to be a sun worshiper), combination of oily/dry skin, large pores&#8230;.all-in-all, bad news skin.I do take care of it now; I clean it every night- I don&#8217;t care how tired I am, I&#8217;m doing mini facials, I use Proactive on regular base so it balances PH of my skin and I use Olay moisturizer at night/ L&#8217;Oreal BB cream at day.I like mild glycolic acid; it does my skin the way that if feels new and refreshed. I used 30% glycolic acid for mini peels at home and I was very happy with the results. However, THIS cream is just fantastic. I put it on every night and my face is peeling especially on the places around my nose and at the corner of my mouth. It&#8217;s gentle and even though it stings a little I don&#8217;t mind- I know it&#8217;s working when it does. I already can see the results and I&#8217;ve been using it for only 2 weeks. I cannot wait to see my skin in a month. The pores on my face are visibly smaller and blemishes are lighter. I had a huge patch of sun damage on my forehead; it&#8217;s almost completely gone.I&#8217;m getting ready to order 2 more jars."
1,"Another great color pink by Essie, Im thinking I may have all the shades of pink that are possible by them! lol Dries quick as can be,  just as any other Essie product!&#9829;"
1,I absolutely love this color! It's perfect for Spring and Summer and the formula is awesome. OPI polishes are great.
0,"This lip ""moisturizer"" dried my lips out sooo bad after using it ONCE. I hate leaving bad reviews, but I honestly hate this product. My lips got so dry and they looked so gross. I'm sticking with Blistex chapstick."
0,"I didn't like this.  It seems very watery and my face always felt wet after using it.  I didn't see any changes, so given the price, I won't buy it again."
1,I love this product too.  This product will make your nails grow long and strong and healthy.  Nails do not break easily.  I will keep on using this product on my nails.
1,"You wet it and rub it on. It will also color your scalp, if you are not careful, tho it rubs right off. That's another thing. If you are going to be out all day, you will need to reapply it. Cheap, quick fix, and better than nothing, but don't expect fantastic results. It will look greasy if you overdo it. Also, I bought dark brown and it's not dark enough. My hair is not the darkest brown I've seen, either. Note that you will need to wash it out before you do color your roots, or the color won't take well. So, this is a cool emergency measure, imo, not an everyday-use thing. But for those times when you are going somewhere and don't have the time for a touch-up -- excellent! I'm going to look around, tho, in case there is a better item out there."
1,"I have had this one before and I loved it and got it again 2nd time, my mother had it before me and she got me one, then It lasted me about 4 months and I got another!"
1,"This comb does work, although it just does a basic job and I don't understand the claim that it creates ""volume"" in the hair. I see these claims advertised on combs and it seems like a gimmick to me. The plastic is somewhat cheap feeling and after a long time of use it did break a little but was still usable. I ended up losing mine though and bought a different brand. Also the design is not very visually appealing."
1,Love essie and love this color for the fall! I believe the key is to do lighter layers and then to apply essies three way glaze top coat to provide some protection and increase the length of the manicure!
1,"Is it thick? Yes, but so lovely and rich that you only need to use it sparingly. Amazing how long this little bottle lasts. I like to use it around my eyes, and on my various scars. Great pure product, wish that it was on Prime!! And also would like to see larger size bottles!"
1,"I have pretty sensitive skin and have tried a number of different masks through out the years and they almost always either make my face itchy, or cause me to break out after using them (in those horrible, big and painful zits!)...this one doesn't! It seems like it both dries out the extra oil in my skin, and moisturizes at the same time. After washing it off my skin is always a lot softer. If my skin is a little dried out I tend to get those little bumps on the outer edges of my cheeks, but they always clear up when I use this. It has a good consistency and is easy to apply, though if you wash it off with a wash cloth it looks sort of nasty, but no big deal. It does have a little bit of a scent to it, but it's not a fake perfumey type of scent, it's a more natural one. And one of my favorite things about this mask, it's cheap! Definitely recommend!"
1,I love this powder it is great. It does what it said its supposed to do. It does take away shine. Product is as described. I am happy with this product.
1,"I'm in my fifties, my facial skin always protected at night with a moisturizer. This is one of the best. It is not greasy, and absorbs immediately into my skin, making it feel soft, smooth and silky. It does not irritate, very gentle."
1,"I don't think this color can be dupilcated, it's unique and I wear it all the time. It's a laid back color, but feminine and really pretty."
1,"This mirror is not a bad deal economically.  But I'd pay a few dollars more to have a real handle.  It's frustrating to hold because it bends, and you have to brace your thumb against the backside when using it."
1,"Since I prefer to travel light and still need to carry my neck ties for business meeting, I have always been on the look out for a convenient travel tie case, just functional enough to hold my ties. Then I came across this Travel Tie Case with Accessory Pocket Black Ramie from Household Essentials which can hold up to 6 neck ties. Its padded cushion lining keeps your ties wrinkle free while the elastic straps hold them in place. It comes in black color and is reasonably priced too. The product is just perfectly suited as a household item or a travel accessory."
0,"Very fancy bottle, when you pump it out comes that thick, greasy, white sunscreen everyone has run into before. Maybe it has crazy good ingredients or is good for your skin, but I will never come to enjoy putting thick, greasy feeling, white sunscreen on my face or body. I do use it, but I don't like it."
1,"I try to either protect my skin or stay away from the sun, but in the event that I can't, this is unburn treatment that I swear by. Whole leaf Aloe makes a huge difference. Highly recommend this product for quicker-than-average healing of sunburns."
1,"I love these. Minus one star because they are almost either too large, or too soapy. I cut them in half because I feel like I am wasting product at the end because their is a lot left in the pad. The cleanser is very gentle, and I really like the exfoliating side of the pad. Very useful for when I am in a hurry and don't have time to do my whole skin care routine. I also like to use them in the morning if I need a quick cleanse or if I wake up and my face is a little oily."
1,I have used it only once.  I don't know what the results are supposed to look like but I didn't mind using it.
0,"this soap was a completely waste of my money, first of all it does not moisturize at all,it left my skin ashy,dried and pretty much upset. I would not recommend this soap, the soap smell like palm oil soap instead of olive oil soap."
1,"I love the idea of this product,and I used all the product in the starter kit.  I am in my early 40's and still have very oily, breakout prone skin.  This product did NOT aggravate my acne, in fact I did not have a break out while using it.  Mostly, it was comfortable and very easy to apply.  I can dash some on before going outside, for extra SPF.  I sometimes choose to go to bed without cleansing my face (a habit I learned while raising small children, yet to be broken).  So, for all of these reasons, this is a super product.  However, I have two caveats:  One, I find this to be somewhat itchy on my face during hot, humid days, when I am active.  In Texas, this is all summer!  I wonder if it is the brushes or the product?  I don't know.  Second, with my over-40 eyes, I thought I was looking pretty good, but my 4th grader complained that my skin looked ""papery"".  This made me feel bad, and I went back to liquid foundation when I ran out of BE.  Some time later, he said, ""Mom, are you not wearing make-up anymore? 'Cuz your skin doesn't look papery anymore!""  That sealed it for me.  Maybe this is just not for the over 40 crowd.  I really have pretty good skin for my age, use sun-block religiously, and only really have noticable wrinkles on my forehead...and I have oily skin, so I don't know what the deal is.  Which brings up a question:  How do we know that we are truly getting good sunblock coverage?  With liquid makeup, I could see where it went on, and know that I am getting physical sunblock.  I feel mildly concerned that I need to wear sunblock UNDER this product, which was one reason I bought it in the first place, to avoid putting oily stuff on my face...So, as for applying it:  It is as easy to use as described, and I really like that.  It does have a teeny bit of reflectiveness, so for any of you guys out there, you might look for something else.  Buy the starter kit, so that you get all the brushes.Brushes:  They are really nice, but mine DO lose bristles.  They are great brushes, natural bristles, but I find several bristles on my face every time I use them."
1,"I really like this oil because for 1 it has helped solved my problem of itchy belly syndrome from pregnancy lol, its like my skin just got REALLY sensitive my last month, and lotions and cocoa butter weren't really doing the job but this stuff has me itch free. Plus my boifriend always tells me i smell good after i put this on both in the morning and at night before i go 2 bed. AND you dnt need a lot at all, a nickel size drop covers my big belly (haha) hips and the top part of my thighs so i will hae my two bottles for a LOOONG time.Also i heard that vitamin e is supposed to be really good for stretch marks, and i have dark ones on my hips, and i plan on using this oil in conjunction with my derma roller and mederma stretch mark cream after i give birth, since some say derma rolling isn't good on areas near the tummy while pregnant,I hope it works tho"
1,"Okay - I agree with others that this face wash can be drying.  I would not use it.  However, my husband swears by it and I see his results.  He has been cursed with horrible problem skin that can have bad cystic acne breakouts even though he is in his fifties.  If he goes even a few days without using Deep Clean he will begin breaking out.  He is a firefighter and is usually very good about bringing all of his grooming items when he works a 24 or 48-hour shift.  Occasionally he forgets an item.  If this is the item , you can tell even if he had to use a different product for as little as one day.I have to believe what I see and his testimonial."
0,"I was able to do this on my own. I can't say it was easy...cause I stained some of bathroom cabinets.At first, my hair color came out SUPER dark. After a few days, my color starting getting lighter and lighter. Now, I like the color on my hair...but it wasn't the color I originally intended to get from the box.I would purchase this product again but in a lighter shade and have someone else color it for me."
1,"Very well absorbent by the skin, no smell. I would recommend this product to people with very dry skin, works perfect."
1,I have been using this product for a few years.  My skin tends to dry out more in the winter months and this has really helped but I can still use it during the warmer months also.  I would not say that it cures wrinkles but it is an excellent moisturizer so that probably is helping with improving the appearance of the skin over time.  I even use a little bit around my elbows and heels also.  It is expensive but you do not need very much so it lasts a very long time.
1,...this soap is wonderful for dry skin...because it is not soap...try it...you'll like it...get a few bars as they go quickly...
1,"Since I tend to have acne scars and dark spots around my face, I decided to try this after so many good reviews. I wasnt disappointed only except for the fact that it needed a pump. Other than that, its light, absorbs quickly and does what its supposed to do and my skin looks more even and soft."
1,"This stuff helps me with my zits.  It works !And there's more in the tube than the moreexpensive stuff,  and it's the same thing !I recommend it."
1,"Two, actually. Glad to find it at this price.The last time someone asked my age, I told them, and they said they thought I was 25 years younger than that. I'm sure heredity plays a part in that, as does sleeping each night hanging from the closet pole by my knees, but the Alpha Hydroxy hasn't hurt either."
1,"I discovered this color (Cajun Shrimp) while treating myself at a salon while traveling. It was just fantastic! I tried to find it back at home, and many places had a spot for it, but it was always sold out. I ended up just ordering from Amazon - the price was about the same, but I also saved on sales tax. Great product!"
1,I purchased Revlon Professional Fanci-Full Color Styling Mousse in Sweet Cream on Amazon and liked it so well that I ordered the same product in Bashful Blonde. I highly recommend this Mousse.
1,"I have dry skin with the occasional zit, and I use retin-A creme at night so I was hesitant to try this at first. But I decided to try it after hearing all the good reviews.  This leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry, unlike all the other acne cleansers I tried. Great product!  I bought 3 tubes and have been using it for over a year."
0,"I got these to help reduce the amount of wrinkling I see when I first wake up in the morning, but they didn't stick very well, and when I could get them to stick, then they hurt to take off.  These went back since they didn't do what they were designed to do.  I had realistic expectations and these still didn't fit the bill."
1,"I've been using the Herbitant Hair dye for a couple of years and thought it was great until I started getting allergic reaction to it like itchy scalps. Otherwise I would of continued using it since it covered grays well. Then I decided to try this product ""Naturtint"" in Ebony Black. Love it. Used it for the first time over the weekend. So far so good. My scalp hasn't reacted to the dye so maybe that's a good sign. Continuos use, cant say. As for some women whom commented on not covering grays? If you follow the instructions on coloring stuborn grays which is 40/45mins...did the job just fine. That's all I can report for now."
1,This cream is very unusual.  It goes on thick but I have to say it does it's job and moisturizes.  I even don't mind how it smells and smell will eventually fade.
1,"This nail conditioner is shimmery, not a plain clear polish. But the shimmer is fairly subtle. I don't mind it at all. I think this is a good product, and it seems that water-based polishes create a smooth finish more easily than conventional polishes, which I like.The first time I applied this conditioner, I wore it for about 12 hours before showering. When I washed my hair, a lot of the polish peeled right off. The second time I applied it, I wore it for almost 24 hours before shampooing my hair. Much more of the polish stayed on. It was okay for some of the polish to peel off, though, since I was about to remove it for reapplication anyway.I think that waiting as long as possible before subjecting the nails to rough activities (like shampooing) is really helpful. In addition, the polish is supposed to last longer as your nails adjust to the water-based polish."
1,"After several love affairs with other well-known lip balms, I wanted something that was actually moisturizing my lips instead of making me feel like I needed to constantly re-apply.  This lip moisturizer is unscented, does not make your lips tingle, is long lasting, and is great on its own or under lipstick. My lips no longer crave lip balm, nor do they have dry spots or cracks.  This is now my go-to balm and I have to buy it in multiples to ensure I have them in my bag, in my car, at work, at my bedside, all over."
1,"Ah, finally, a hair color that didn't leave my scalp burning and red!  Just keep in mind that what they call &#34;Dark Blonde&#34; is really a nice lightish medium BROWN.  I brought this to my hairdresser, who applied it only to my roots, and the color blended well with my previous Natural Instincts light brown.  Just don't be fooled by the natural name and package design -- this haircolor certainly has chemicals, but in my case, the chemicals were non-irritating.  What a relief to know that I won't have to let myself go gray due to the inability to tolerate color products."
1,"I love this serum, it absorbs well and defiantly helps with the appearance of ones skin. This can easily be worn under you day or night cream, it is not greasy. Reviva makes really great skin care products that are not tested on animals and don't contain animal ingredients."
1,I am glad that I bought 1 sets as I don't know how long one would last. It works well but .... Be careful when placing in on your head as it is very fragile!
1,"First, Essie is the best nail polish I have ever had. I would definitely recommend it if you want a sleek and chic look. It is very easy to apply because when you spread it onto your nails, it spreads out into the right place and almost never gets on your skin! I also love the color and it's thick so you can't see through it like some polishes."
0,"Not only did I get sent the completely wrong color (ordered 8C Copper Blonde, a ginger color, and got sent 10N Light Dawn Blonde, PLATINUM?!), but it was so poorly packaged that one of them (ordered 2) exploded. Now Amazon wants me to go out and purchase another box, bubble wrap, and tape, print out a label, and send the other one back. Um, the cost or those materials alone will be more than the worth of the item! Looks like I'll be going to another popular online drugstore to order my hair color. At least those people can read and use common sense that LIQUID items need bubble wrap!"
1,"Honey Almond: Really a lovely, sweet, warm scent - very true to life. It stays on my skin for most of the day and I've gotten quite a few compliments.Black Opium: A very complicated scent; sweet and warm and just a touch floral. It's rather 'fancy' to me - I'd think of this scent as the 'little black dress' of the group of oils I purchased.White Musk: Light, beautiful, and gentle on the senses - always gets lots of compliments.Sandalwood Vanilla: Sweet and earthy but very light to me... however, I've had people ask me ""what smells like cupcakes/cookies/marshmallow??"" while I'm wearing it.Lavendar Dream: Very soft, clean, light and flowery."
1,"Dermablend doesn't market itself for the covering of psoriasis or eczema, but I've read some reviews that have stated it good for coverering both. It does help tone down the redness a bit, but doesn't offer the sort of coverage I was hoping for. Still, a decent product."
1,a nice cosmetic for a woman.a nice gift and not to expensize. a nice color for lashes and works good.
1,I cant tell its really doing much. Ive been using it for a month now and see very little change. Maybe some overall evening of skintone but nothing dramatic. No reduction in lines. No reduction in old acne hyperpigmentation. I have had a few minor blemishes pop up but nothing horrible. I dont experience burning or itching when using it. Use once a day.
1,"I have been using this scrub (sensitive skin, original, and the acne varieties) for over 10 years now.  It's a great basic scrub that is inexpensive.  I use it every morning in the shower and my makeup goes on a lot more evenly once I've exfoliated with it.  My best friend tried it out when she stayed over my place and has been using it ever since as well.  Even my boyfriend loves it and says that it prevents ingrown hairs on his face and neck from shaving.  This is a great scrub and I'm going to keep buying it as long as St. Ives is making it.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!"
1,Love this. Ordered after reading many reviews and it really does the trick! I'm used to having cystic acne and needed something to lessen the severity of some bumps. This product helps the bump reduce in size overnight and it's awesome! Glad I have it when I get some bad bumps! Sometimes it does sting and you do look like you have pink lotion all over but hey it works!
1,Absolutely love these sponges.  Long lasting and stay clean.  They give a slight scrubbing to feel clean and exfoliated.  The best shower tool to use with shower gel.  Have used them for years and will continue to use them.
1,"Ok, first off,  I dont work for Lorea'l and i have tried it all.  LOL..  My hair  has gotten very dark brown with age.  So i have been highlighting since i cannot even remember when.  This is the first time i have ever tried a drugstore product.  I was in a jam and had to cancel my professional salon appointment, however i had somewhere to be and needed my roots done!!!  So i took a chance.  This product was easy to mix,  shake it for about 3 minutes to ensure the powder disolves fully.  i started at the crown of my head, which seems to always be the darkest and longest to process.  Take small sections and apply with your finger spreading it onto roots and regrowth.  Trust me ladies, i have been sitting in that chair long enough to know how to do this.  If your hair is dark like mine, leave it on for 45 minutes.  or even an hour.  Do not listen to the box.  This is the best color i have had that i didnt pay 150.00 for in a salon.  I would go every 4 weeks faithfully because i hate roots!  i will be saving a lot of money, i am so glad this happened.  The color is not like the box,  it is more natural looking blonde more yellow but not fake yellow.  You want the yellow and NOT ORANGE...  My friend used this, and her hair turned Orange, very brassy,  so we bought another Loreal product the platinum excellence product 01 an ash base, as ASH takes out orange, and waited a few days and did this over the Feria, and it took the brass right out.  So if anyone ends up brassy try that it really worked.  Not everyone's hair takes the same to dyes.  and to be blonde its a hard thing to accomplish, so if you get brass,  try this.  I dont do well with silver shampoo's.  i find it turns grayish.  just leave the product on longer.  its not bleach so it wont damage like bleach.  happy coloring.  I am so happy to be saving money!!!!"
1,"Easy to use, but I honestly find that the covers are not the most convenient I've used on a roller system. Still worth it for the price and the steam is not damaging, gives a nice curl, and leaved my hair so soft."
1,"I bought this product before I received my hearing aids.  I used this product, as recommended prior to receiving my hearing aids. I now use it if my ears start to feel itchy."
1,"I've bought all kinds of products looking for something to help my acne prone skin.  It's hard to believe this gem was hiding right up the street for literally a fraction of the price I've paid for less effective products.I bought this after reading the reviews here.  I knew something good was happening as soon as I put it on.  It tingles in a pleasant way and you can actually feel it working.  It took about 30 minutes to dry completely.  I rinsed it off and my face feels CLEAN. There's no other word to describe it.  It really feels like my pores are breathing a sigh of relief.  I don't know that my face has ever felt this unclogged.  A lot of the gunk in my pores and on the surface of my skin has been sucked up and rinsed off.  My skin feels smooth and soft.  It is a little dry and tight, but I know my skin will eventually adjust to that and the dryness will lessen after a few uses.It's a little tough to rinse this stuff off because it's thick and clings a bit.  I recommend using it before you shower.  That'll be the fastest and easiest way to get it off.The smell is also quite strong and minty.  Some people will be turned off and/or simply unable to stand it.  I started getting a headache after a while from the smell, but it was well worth suffering through.  (At least it's not as bad as Mario Badescu drying mask, which smells like tires.  I actually had to shove balls of tissue up my nostrils with that one.)All in all, read the reviews and believe them.  I hope the effects continue and that it doesn't stop working after a while.  We'll see.  I'm already looking at other Queen Helene products, which you'll notice also have stellar reviews."
0,I really wanted to notice a change in my face using this serum but I did not. Now I have happily moved on to other products.:)
0,Was not impressed with it at all.  Teeth were too far apart and the heat was really very hot.  My hair is a little fine so this did not help me at all.  My hair would slip through the teeth and made it hard to use.
0,"I bought this mascara and right from the get go there was nothing in there.... only the minute traces that something may have been in there. Waste of money, and the worst purchase I ever made on Amazon."
1,"I had used this years ago, and didn't like it because it was too thick. The formula must have changed, or I am more intelligent and used it properly this time! Yes, it is more like an ointment than a cream, but it goes on creamy IF your skin is fresh from the shower or hand washing. Just use a little. Do not glop it on. My dermatologist suggested using this as a night time hand cream for my dry hands. It works really well using it this way, and if I need to I can add a little extra and put on gloves."
1,"Smells pretty good, but it doesn't really seem to be doing much for my hair. My hair is really damaged so maybe thats why."
1,Much better than your usual emory board.  It doesn't tear nails - it gently files them.  A friend had one and I used it and it operated sooo much different from those emory boards one buys from drugstores.It's a great help for aging nails.
1,"This lotion was recommended by my pediatrician and sister who also uses it on her child. I love it! It is very soothing and moisturizing, especially when you are washing your hands a million times a day after changing diapers. It keeps my baby's skin soft and my hands from drying out. It's great for the whole family."
1,"The product arrived quickly and the packaging was great. I was a bit disappointed in the size of the comb!!! I expected it to be a little bigger. It does get the job done, but my hand covers the entire handle and I don't have big hands"
0,This stuff smells like someone rubbed you down with clothes. The cologne only lasts for 30 minutes. Not worth the money. Clubman original and clubman reserve are 10x better!
1,This conditioner makes your hair so soft. I love the cream and the smell is amazing. I think that this is one of the best conditioners out there. I like that the container is air tight I can keep it in my shower and it is readily available.
1,For those with sensitive scalps this is a very good product.  It holds well.  My only complaint is that it comes out not in a mist but in large drops of liquid.  This does not work well on my fine hair.
1,"I have really dry hair that often gets tangled and breaks off easily. So after hearing from a friend, I should try this hair mask. I thought okay and was very surprised. It really made my hair soft and I could tell that my hair had improved through one use when I flat ironed it. Gone were the tangles and dryness. My hair no longer felt like brillowpad and seemed to be recovering. However, I would not buy this product again simply because its too expensive. You only get 8 ounces which is a small amount. With my thick hair, I could be finished with this jar in 3-4 shampoo uses. I believe that I can find an equally good deep conditioner with much more. It was good but I'll probably keep looking for something with a greater value that will last longer."
1,"It does remind me a bit of the well-known perfume, Opium, which I loved. It has a very strong scent, so I would recommend that you try just a little at first. For the low price, it is quite nice. It makes me feel a bit sexy, which isn't easy when you are my age!! My husband doesn't like strong scents, though, so it would make his eyes water and nose plug up, but not with endearing emotion!"
1,"As I have curly hair, I've been advised not to brush it when dry. It seems to loosen the curl and create frizz. I've also been told not to brush it after a shower because wet hair is easy to break. So what do I do? My compromise is to use this detangling comb right before a shower, when my hair is at it's oiliest, so it's not dry but of course it's not wet. This is very easy on my hair, I do not hear horrible little snapping noises when combing at the ends, so I believe it is less damaging. I like it, 5 stars!"
0,This product feels okay on the skin but leaves a highly visible white film on the skin.  I'm not sure if it is apparent on other races but it is very noticeable on African American skin tones. It looks like I've applied cheap foundation shades too light on my face.I cannot wear it outdoors in front of people during the day (and I'm cheap! :) ) so I use it as my night time moisturizer before bed. Imagine using an SPF moisturizer only to bed...Will not repurchase once I've used it all.
1,"This soap is one of the best ones I've used.  Unlike most soaps it doesn't leave your skin feeling dry.  It has a clean fragrance and rinses off easily. Since it's a gentle soap,  I use it both on my face and body.  Great product."
1,"I love this blush.  I am light skinned and wear mostly browns in make up.  This is a light brown with a hint of shimmer.  It is very nice for day wear.  Not too overpowering.  Goes on smooth, does not look cakey.  Cant wait to try some other colors."
1,"It's ok, I was hoping to use this for extremely dry skin /eczema.  Moisture does not seem to last and does not seem to help.  I will just use this for dry cuticles so as not to waste the product, but there are better products out there.  I will not repurchase."
1,MY LASHES ARE RATHER FINE & THIS PRODUCT GRABS HOLD ONTO THEM GIVING THEM VOLUME!  LOVE THE BRUSH & THE PRODUCT AND IT DOESN'T FLAKE OFF.  IT HAS THE PERFECT NAME~ LEAVES YOUR LASHES LOOKING FULL& SOFT!
1,"I sample tried this same perfume at the department store in the mall, and I loved it.  But when I went to buy this online, the scent is not quite the same.  I'm not sure why... maybe the seller had an old supply and therefore the scent faded?  I'm not sure, but definitely noticed a significant different in the scent.  Much weaker and also not the exact same scent.  I'm not super happy about it, since it was over 40 bucks."
0,"I usually use luxury products. A beauty book convinced me to try this. I found it sticky and smelly. Didn't use long enough to see if it worked or not. Back to my Kiehl's, Lush, Dermatologica, and Origins staples."
1,"Okay, I have been biting my nails since I was a little kid. Nothing my parents told me stuck and I just kept going until I got into this interesting habit of improving my looks. So, I'm going for my nails now.I have been using this since February and it's doing great. Granted eating finger foods is a little difficult but if you really want long nails then you get past the bitter taste and just eat the food and learn ways to avoid the nails, like a fork! That's what it's for! I have figured that its better to eat fries with a fork any way. No salt left on your fingers.In short, this stuff is amazing. now i just need a strengthener because my nails are a bit weak and have broken once already. Mavala makes a great shiny coat over nail polish too so it looks nice!"
1,"I love how my face and neck feel after having done the exercises.  I'm starting third week with the 8 oz band, doing 2 sets of 50 reps."
1,I bought this oil to make bath bombs.  It is a good oil to use as there is no smell or greasiness to it.  It was reasonably priced. I got it quickly thru Amazon.  I would buy again.
1,"This is an oily formula that doesn't seem to cause any breakouts.  I use it at night, but it doesn't fully remove the makeup until my shower the next morning (for waterproof mascara)."
1,"We had a bunch of bottles that were always being knocked over.  It was also annoying to move them all for cleaning under.  Now we just have this mounted on the shower stall wall.  It is easy to keep clean and operates well.  The only difficult thing is that you have to pour products from one container to another, an extra chore, but worth it to me."
1,I was nervous to try these but desperate because I would be on my period on my wedding day. It definitely takes some proper placement technique but I'm getting better and better at it and managed to breeze through the wedding without any problems. I have major discomfort with tampons yet with the soft cup I don't even notice it's there. I am very happy with these and will continue to use this product.
1,"I recommend this brand to all my friends and family members. My daughters and I suffer from acne problems. This toner does not dry out our skin and it helps with reducing pore sizes as well. My skin has never been clearer in 47 years of using acne products. My friend went to a dermatologist who also recommended this toner, but at a much higher price."
1,"This product smells great. It has a coconut/beachy/light smell that fades so it is not overpowering at all. I wash my hair with shampoo and conditioner, then spray it on my dry hair and comb thru. It leaves my hair super soft and smooth. I even used it a day after washing my hair when I woke in the morning to smooth out bed head. It does not leave your hair greasy or weighed down at all. Not sure how that is possible but I love it. I have atomic pink hair and it does not fade my color."
1,It goes on the skin easy and will close my pores sufficiently which is great because I have large poreswhen not using this product.  So it does what it's supposed to.
1,This is the best Mascara as I have long lashes that touch my face.  It lasts a long time on my lashes..and doesnt make a black eye on my eyes.
0,I didn't really like it... :/ It didn't meet my expectations. It just felt too rough on my scalp and hair. Ended up giving it away.
1,These work great on acne but they're way too strong. I prefer the gentle version of this product. It really dried my skin out too much.  I won't buy this version again.  I'll stick to the gentle version.
1,My daughter has never used any other lotion since she's born. After almost 2 years i still love how it smells and feels. I use it myself as well. great find.
1,"I can't find this in the stores.  My skin is so fair, I use white for conceler and highlights.  This is perfect"
1,My nail polish stays on a week longer than usual I love it! If you are debating about buying this product you should definitely get it here because the price is cheaper than in the stores (actually it's sold out a lot of the time in stores).
1,"Just the kind of color I'm searching for. It pops and it's perfect for summer! If you're a girly girl, this is the ultimate pink for you. Trust me!"
1,"I received this product yesterday.  The color was perfect for my skin (olive tone).  I first put it on as only foundation powder, but was disappointed that it didn't cover up as well as I thought it would.  Being 50 my skin is very young looking skin anyway.  Though it might be just me but I prefer a foundation that covers up imperfections.  I didn't like the way the powder only looked.  So I took it off & put on my regular foundation, then added the power to soften & give that smooth skin look.  That worked perfectly.  It's a really good powder that last's all day long.  It doesn't take much to cover your face and I found it to help smooth the looks of my skin. It gave it a more &#34;youthful&#34; look.  It's perfect for blending contour if you use it for that. I'm pleased with this product but not sure if I'll order again, since I was looking for just a foundation powder.  I wanted a cover, yet natural look and this didn't do it for me. I guess using liquid foundation is such a habit, I prefer that instead of just powder.  It didn't do what I had hoped it would."
1,"I bought another, cheaper, brand of this stuff - for my son that kept chewing his nails.  I ended up finding/buying this and it's worked wonders!  You should apply it daily, but it's clear and you can't see it.  My son has since stopped chewing on this nails altogether!"
0,"Was recently at a salon and bought a bottle because I have trouble with breakage and split ends. I like the smell, but was pretty disappointed with the performance of this product. Didn't notice any difference after using."
1,Vanilla sugar and cashmere are my only two eye shadows!!  Vanilla sugar brightens my eye area perfectly!  I can't be without it.
1,I've been using this cream for two days now. I use this as a spot treatment for acne. I can already see the pimples going away and I'm not tempted to scratch or pop them like I usually do because they're not itchy. I also used this on the back of my hands yesterday and the dryness went away. It smells like tea tree oil but it doesn't linger. Overall I think this product is worth trying if you have any skin problems.
1,"as always, essie polish is high quality. this color is a peachy sand color and is very neutral and looks good with everything. the seller shipped the item very quickly and it was cheaper than buying it at a store. love it."
0,"This product is great in concept and I was looking forward to using this tween coloring.  Sadly, I had to send it back, I've run the product several times along a few strands of hair.  No color was deposited, just had tiny pieces break off onto my hair and scalp."
1,"I agree with the reviewer below me..I have used nothing else but this product for over 15 yrs. I have tried so many $$$$$$$$$$$ nothing works better than this.Some products are much too aggressive for the eye area.Having very sensitive skin/eyes, everything I have ever tried irritates my eyes, or is to heavy & greasy.This removes the dark circles, feels extremely cool when applying, is not greasy, but moisturizes & keeps those lines in control .I use it morning & night, can be put in fridge also for hour or (2) before if your eyes are puffy, works wonderfully for that !It's perfect, I hope it never gets discontinued I would be lost without it.Thanks"
1,awesome product  it tightens my faceexcellent customer servicei appreciate  all theyve done for me when i lost my packageA MUST BUY
0,"This product is as close to useless as it can get.  It's a waste of money.  First of all, it falsely advertises as  it doesn't ""peel"" anything.  Normally with a face masque of any kind, you will see a remarkable instant ""glowing"" or ""brightening"" of your skin because it deep cleans.  This product is too thin to be of any benefit.  It does not deep clean and the slightest bit of perspiration will immediately start to dissolve it.  After one tube, I would never buy it again and I do not recommend it."
0,"First off, I am 26. I have pimples and I have big pores, no wrinkles, and a jawline that can't handle even slightly perfumed cleanser, yet my reddest pimples are there. I was in heaven when I got the original foundation. I couldn't find an exact color match, (which they recently released!) but dusted on very, very lightly you can make your pimples a shade lighter. I would not recommend piling on on any of these products, this one included, especially if you're anything like me.But for the part of my skin that shines, I decided this would be great! I mean, it doesn't have that shimmer like the original, something my t-zone doesn't need. Well, disaster. It makes imperfections look worse, even with a light dusting, doesn't really combat oil if you have a problem with it, and inflamed pretty much everywhere on my sensitive skin where the original did not. Be careful with this, and test it on a small part of your face at an Ulta salon. It's free, and you can see if you'll have a reaction-- this is true for all of these products. It's worth the trip.I wouldn't buy this again, and would not recommend it to anyone with any skin problems, and suspect it may give problems to many who have good skin. However, in spite of my low rating I wouldn't say you should just give up. Some of those 5 star reviews may end up being you, if it works."
1,"It's very black, very waterproof, very much clump-free....it's just very good! My favourite mascara, it does volumize the lashes, and even curls it, in my case, without even an eyelash curler.It comes off with a little bit of effort, using a good eye makeup remover (I use Neutrogena oil-free) but it's okay. In short, does what it says, at a great price."
1,"I used this product a lot at first, hoping for results. I didn't really see anything noticeable so it found a place in the cabinet under the sink. My pores aren't &#34;large,&#34; but I can tell when they're clogged. This product might make more noticeable differences if you have large, noticeable pores. It did make my face feel cleaner, but I'm not sure if that was just a placebo effect!"
1,"Stickey works just as it says it will and really does keep polish from chipping.  I gave only 4 stars because I use light polish, and often there is a blue cast from the Stickey.  It would be perfect for you if you used darker polish"
1,best all around warm tone color. hope they never discontinue this color. I am addicted to it for everyday use.
1,Soft bristles and close together; doesn't scratch the scalp or leave markson my thinning scalp.Good every day brush.It is my second purchase of this brush so I would recommend it.
1,excellent product
0,"If you didn't study Geology and you don't know what &#34;cleavage fracture&#34; is, look up Micah. This stuff took off the top layer of my nails pretty far down almost to the quick. It doesn't last and doesn't effect the quality of the nail polish."
1,I have been using this mint julep masque for many years. It feels so refreshing and good when you put it on and leaves your skin so soft and smooth.
0,"I am pretty disappointed in this color. I was looking for a soft, pale pink shade and thought this might be it. Unfortunately, it is rather nonexistent in any color at all. In the bottle it looks pink but once applied it is little more than a clear color, maybe if I applied 5 coats I would see some hint of the shade. I will continue my search for the right color."
1,"I wear some kind of lash extensions at all times. I either do them myself or have them done professionally. I like them very exaggerated (""gaudy"" I guess some people would say!) Ardell's lashes are a nice product, but there are two drawbacks to these particular lashes. First, the ""long"" length are so long they are difficult to group together and to get all pointed in the proper direction. You get a half-crazed looking ""Twiggy"" (supermodel) effect, with clumps of super-long lashes pointing in various directions. I have used & do recommend the ""medium"" length instead. They are still long & dramatic, but ""sit"" next to each other better, and don't lack control on the ends so that they end up pointing off in random directions.My second criticism is that this brand of lashes are a bit too thin. The lashes I have applied at the salon (I don't know what kind they are) take tinting (mascara) and thicken up nicely. These lashes do not respond favorably to mascara, and so there is no practical way to make them look thicker and darker. Applying more lashes just gives you more lashes - they are still very much on the wispy side.These lashes do work, but I recommend the medium length. This pack is also a good buy."
1,"I really enjoy this curling iron, it is really fast to use and my curls stay all day. I have to mention that my hair is not curly, but not straight, still pretty easy to shape. The curler is really easy to use, heats up quickly and it was only 10 dollars. I would definitely buy this again."
1,"I got this as a gift for my father and he really likes it. it does a great job in cutting hair. Although, I would prefer that manufacturer will sell this item with fewer pieces for hair trimming. Very often 90% of them not needed.Bottom line is that I would definitely recommend this item to anybody!"
1,I love this nail color so much Im on my 4th bottle they stopped selling it at the target near my home so I looked for it on amazon and was so happy they carried it. It's the perfect pinky nude tone for medium skin tone and it only takes 2 coats to get the color on the bottle not like other nail polishes where you have to apply tons of coats to get the full color pay off
1,"I've been using this off and on for a few years and I always find that it works really well.  The only drawback for me is that it has a sort of gardenia smell that is not my favorite.  I prefer to switch up smells and this one is a bit boring to use all the time.  I do use it more in winter when it is super dry here.  Overall, a nice product that does what it  says it does."
1,This polish did not disappoint! I love the color! Essie is aquality product and they have great colors to choose from.
1,This is still one of my favorite lotions.  The scent is still the same as it was years ago.  The scent is light and not too heavy.  I love smoothing it on before bed.
1,This face wash is just strong enough for my combination skin. Other cleansers either don't get my oily zones clean or make my dry cheeks feel really tight. This one works just right. It also removes MOST makeup. Don't expect a lot of lather though.
1,"You have to be dilligent in putting it on like the instructions say. I tried a number of different products but 7 years after I had my son, I can finnaly see the difference in the texture of my skin where all my stretch marks are. I'll keep going and see how much better it can get."
1,"This is a very good herbal hair dye. I've tried one other one, and the color would come out dull, and would not last more than a month before lightening dramatically. I've had this on for 2 weeks, and so far the color is still pretty noticeable. It did come out darker than I expected/wanted, but after 2 washes, the color was exactly what I wanted. Loved the fact that the dye didn't keep washing off. After 2 showers it pretty much stays on. It's best to skip washing your hair for about 2-3 days right after the application, but after that every other day is ok. I also go swimming 3 times a week, and I haven't noticed it affect my hair, which is another plus. I would definitely buy this again. Another color perhaps? :)"
0,Sent it back. Clips kept flying off. I used the proper clip for the size. It reminded me if one I had in the '70's
1,"I've been using this for 6 months now and cannot tell if it's working.  I have thin hair which is also fine.  Even if its it growing hair it makes my hair feel coarser. However, I don't think I will keep using it as I don't want to put chemicals on my head just to make my hair feel fuller."
1,I purchased this to replace one that I had that wore out.  When I received it I realized that I had one before of this brand and loved it.  It worked for a long time and I was very happy with it.  It has just enough heat to make my wavy hair behave but not enough to burn the skin so it is a great product for its use.
1,"I've tried all kinds of hair color, and I used to use a semi-permanent, but now I need more grey coverage. To give you an idea, I have shoulder-length, thick, wavy brown hair that is at least 25% grey. I color at least once a month, or I have a very visible ""skunk stripe"" which I hate.I've tried professional color (who has the time?) and also the more expensive ""box color"" brands like Loreal Excellence. Although I was happy with the color results, the smell made me want to gag, and my scalp was red and itchy for days after the application. I really wanted a PERMANENT, ammonia-free hair dye.This is a great option. I had to leave it on for an hour, but I got complete grey coverage, and there was no foul odor (it doesn't smell fantastic or anything, but it doesn't smell awful, either). After I shampooed with the non-sulfate shampoo that came with the color, there was no lingering odor in my hair.The only drawback was that the color was at least one shade darker (perhaps because of the longer developing time) than other dyes that I have used. I always use color ""5N"" which is basically supposed to be a medium brown neutral. I felt that the final result was a dark chestnut brown, although it did get a bit lighter after about 5 shampoos.Anyway, I recommend it because there is no harsh smell, and I had no scalp irritation. Just be aware that stubborn greys will need a bit more time to cover (it does a great job as long as you give it enough time), and realize that the color is not going to be identical to other store brands. This definitely tints a bit darker."
1,"Why waste a lot of money on a toner when this one gives you all you need? It is a perfect toner to use before make-up or after you clean your face, right before you put on your moisturizer when you go to bed at night. You won't regret buying one."
1,This body wash has a nice scent and you don't need very much for a good lather. A good value and lasts a long time.
0,"I actually think this makes my skin blotchier/reddier. Would not recommend! I have combination skin with an oily t-zone. This would be perfect for dry/normal skin, but it did nothing with mind and only made it blotchy."
1,"I can't say anything bad or good about this product because, I don't know if it worked. I used it for a few months, but didn't see any improvements in my hair growth. I was also using other hair growth prodcuts as well so...I just don't know. To each it's own."
1,This is great witch hazel but honestly you can get the same product at the dollar store for a lot less $$.  I wouldn't buy again.
1,"Ingredients are not that harmful (I've checked its ingredients on a cosmetics database website, the level of its harm is very low. Though I won't totally believe that website, but it makes some sense). I use my cotton ovals to do mask with it twice daily after cleansing, it feels so comfortable and gentle after applying it. I ran out of it within 20 days due to my large amount of usage every day. So I ordered the cucumber toner a few days ago (even less harmful than rose one by the database website). I highly recommend this toner. A great try!"
1,"Scented soaps, just like perfumes and colognes, are a subjective matter and as such; I cannot actually criticize or say this is a bad soap, because in and of itself- it is a quality soap-just too strongly scented.If you like Patchouli or know others who do and would like to consider this as a  something for your personal use or a gift, keep in mind that this soap bar is heavily scented.I bought it and the response from those who used it, was that the scent was too overpowering for their taste(it actually permeated one floor of the home after someone used it in a shower).Now- if you like this scent and you like it on the strong side- this could  be a good thing.If you like it more subtle, than this bar of soap is going to smell overpowering to you.All in all- if you consider buying this, think of the Patchouli scent and how strong you enjoy its essence, because this brand is  definitely not subtle."
1,"Warm, lip color-enhancing neutral. Not-too-warm, not at all cold, so if you need a warm, natural not-too-light/dark shade to swipe on this is one you should have in your handbag. Great price, rapid delivery. Non-drying when you use it over balm and if you take care of your lips."
1,"I felt a bit of a tingle with this mask. Not bad though.  This is exactly the stuff I was looking for.  My mom used to use this when I was little and we would have fun peeling off together.  Great product. Fresh and light and love the softness of my skin afterwards.I like to alternate Freeman's grape seed peel off one night, clay/avacado/oatmeal 2nd night, cucumber peel 3rd....rotation.  Always using a moisturizer and spf and occasion retinol eye cream by ROC.  People tell me all the time that I look 23 and I am 36. Skin needs to be babied."
1,"I use this hair mask as a conditioner after shampoo for the last couple of years now. It does a great job for me. I have a very oily scalp (dandruff), thin , fuzzy and curly hair. I use a very tiny amount in shower, keep it on for a couple of minutes and rinse. It doesn't wear my hair down and doesn't leave a oily residue after my hair is dry. It smells very nice. I tried many many other conditioners, none of them was comparable. Only a tiny amount is enough for all my hair so 6 oz lasts very long time. Great deal, highly recommended."
1,I use this on my face when I take my shower in the morning.  It doesn't dry my skin and has no scent to irritate.
1,"This perfume smells simply amazing! it has pretty good staying power, and you don't need a lot. It is a very clean scent and i have received many compliments on it. Highly recommended!! &lt;3"
1,"I desperately hated it when my favorite maybelline lash stiletto voluptuous waterproof mascara ran out. So i went to walmart and looked at their mascaras. At my walmart, lash stiletto was about $8 so i decided to try something cheaper. So i quickly grabbed the cheapest maybelline mascara i saw, which was the great lash (it was $4.88). I didn't really expect much from it, but after using it twice, i actually fell in love with this mascara. I like to use one coat and thats all i need. My lashes look fuller, darker, and still looks natural and soft. way better than my former mascara. This is my ultimate favorite. I love it! :D"
1,"I like to switch up my beauty routine and usually mix fruit-based facials for myself, but I like mud as an alternative as well.This is a very good, cheap, basic product to use once a week. It will leave your skin feeling tighter and will give you a glow.I usually exfoliate my face and neck, then apply this for 30 minutes (yes, a little longer than recommended) and after washing it off, I use my night cream (Olay). That combination leaves my skin looking perfect for 3 days+.I recommend it for once a week use for normal to oily skin. If you have dry skin, this may make you feel a little too dry. I have used it on my body (dry skin), and I wouldn't use it there again."
1,"I've been using this wash for years since I have sensitive skins and my back breaks out bad.  I use to use the regular wash but when the grapefruit scent came out, I've been hooked.  I love the fresh scent of grapefruit which is a great smell to help wake you up in the shower in the morning.  Also, as I've been using Neutrogena since I was a teenager (like 15 years now)...I am a huge fan of this wash and works great!  I rarely break out and I attribute it to Neutrogena.  The price on Amazon is comparatively priced to my local box stores but I have Prime so it's a nice now to able to buy and have shipped directly to my house without having to make a special trip to the boxed stores.  Thanks Amazon!"
1,"Good EWG score, no smell, works well for me (middle aged female) but then I don't perspire a lot unless its quite hot or I'm exerting myself. Probably wouldn't work well for someone who perspires alot. Its not heavy duty."
1,"Absorbs immediately, completely non-greasy after a couple seconds. Very impressive! And smells nice! Wish there was more inside the tube!"
1,"Love the color. Just a warning, when I was first putting this on, I was disappointed because it almost looked like more of a coral color. But be patient! When it dried, it was the pink color you'd expect. Love it!"
1,"All other red hair dyes look fake and harsh- this is the only red hair dye that I have used which looks natural and truly beautiful.  It is getting harder to find too.  I have used this color on someone who looks lovely in carrot red hair and no other color will do.Fades out to a lovely strawberry blonde as well, which is a big plus."
1,"I have combination oily/normal skin, and I have recently (within the past month) started using Philosophy skin care.  Hope in a Jar is part of my nighttime routine.  I love the feel of it; it's lightweight and non-greasy.  Even though parts of my face are oily, I have not had any breakouts since using the product.  Surprisingly, I do not wake up with oily skin in the morning.  The only drawback to this moisturizer is the smell.  I don't think I'm overly sensitive to smells, but it really is awful.  I try to avoid applying it near my nose for now, but I'm sure I'll eventually get used to it.  The smell wears off relatively quickly, and it isn't so offensive as to keep me from using the product.  Hope in a Jar has made my skin much softer in a short amount of time."
0,"It was not at all helpful to my skin. I am a person that used to look for answers to skin problems and this was not it. I found my answer but, it is not Rosewater. This sits under my sink and maybe i'll mix it with my Indian clay or something. May work for some but, not me."
0,"This stuff must be made of unicorn poop and diamond chips because when I saw the size of this bottle I nearly sent it back. It is less than two ounces, people. I used it once on old sagging skin and the bottle was 1/10th gone. NO LIE. So please stop buying this and maybe they will lower the price. I have no idea how well it works because at that price it would have to be like a scene from Death Becomes Her for me to ever buy it again."
0,"AHA products break some people out terribly, and that's what happened to me. At least now I know to be extra wary of AHA. I used it for a month, and reduced the number weekly applications once my face started freaking out. Unfortunately it did not get better from there. Based on the research I did prior to purchasing, this is probably a good product to buy if you already know AHA doesn't give you evil acne, and you don't mind a bunch of parabens."
1,"I love Dr. Bronner's castile soaps, and use them religiously for body care. Almond is my favorite; it's refreshing, cleans really well, and is gentle on my sensitive skin. I used to have a tendency to break out when I got out of the shower; not quite a hive reaction, but an uncomfortable itchiness. Dr. B's almond soap doesn't bring out the itch, yet deep-cleans and leaves me feeling super fresh.Though I like all the scents, I've found that peppermint and tea tree are a little too harsh and drying. So if you have sensitive skin like I do, stick with the gentler scents--almond, orange, lavender, and the unscented baby soap.Bonus: Dr. B's bottles have trippy ramblings on the label about God, love, the universe, and the All-Father that you can read while sudsing up. Never understood what the guy was talking about, but it's amusing nonetheless."
1,"Ordered this for a change of haircolor. The color turned out pretty good, except that it only lasts a few washes."
1,"color really nice consistency great,it was solid in two coats and if you put a good top coat every other day it will not chip.Ladies stop using your nails as tools and please wear gloves when your cleaning you will be able to maintain them just by being careful with them."
1,"I have the smallest bathroom known to man.  It's so nice not to have shampoo, conditioner, and body wash bottles sitting around the tub.  This dispenser was super easy to assemble, and the chambers never clog up.  I've had to refill a couple of the containers, and pulling out the chambers is very easy.  I love this thing; it looks nice, too.  Plus the chambers are a good size, so I don't have to be constantly refilling them."
1,It goes on really smoothly. It keeps my face well hydrated. I have mature skin so this is really important to me. It's really a great product!!!
1,The steam roller set I bought came with small and jumbo. There were only a few medium (the size I'm sure most people need).  I was horrified when I realized that the type I bought didn't sell individual curlers. I saved so much money with this. Fabulous product and fit perfectly with my steamer.
1,"I enjoy the fragrance of ""CK One,"" and am female.  It was a little difficult to find in stores, since they don't really know where to stock it (Mens, or Women's fragrances?) I bought mine at a ""big box"" store (found it in mens area) and paid around $25 for 1.7 oz (50 ml.)"
1,"I have natural hair and this is a must have product as you are transitioning, I would recommend this product"
1,"I love this scent, it is not perfumy, just a really heavenly scent.  I don't think it would be possible to use too much.  I will be ordering again.  I wish my whole house always smelled like this scent!"
0,"I tried this because honestly it wasn't that expensive, but I found the brush applicator to be a DISASTER to apply, it went all over my eye except where I was aiming it to go, not good!!!! its like a long thin nail polish brush tip at the end, I had no control over the brush because of that! this is a disaster in a bottle for me"
1,I love the color.  I have also used Essie nail polish for several years.  It is very high quality and does not chip easily which is a wonderful quality if you have natural nails.
1,"Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash for Clean, Clear Skin, 8.5 Ounce works in the shower for clean, clear skin all over your body. It is good for those who do not have dry skin."
1,"I like this blush and it's a great shade, but the only complaint I have is that is has a lot of pearl shimmer in it. I don't like my cheeks to sparkle... Otherwise, it's a great color and stays on for hours."
1,"I used to use this product before Peri-menopause hit and yes it does work the way everyone says it does.The pros:  1)Helps clear acne- They cannot support that claim but many woman , including me have said it cleared their face from acne.2)Is easy to apply. I never needed a mirror when I used Bare Minerals. It's that easy.3)Even natural look4)Great make-up for teens to start using .5) Cost efficient.6)Last along time even w/ everyday use.The Cons:1) Can get messy if you are not really careful.2)does not have a good staying power.3)not enough color variations.4)Coverage is sheer to light and if you go to far , it looks bad and you can tell.5)Not good for dry skin. Once I hit Peri-menopause, I could no longer use this product . My skin had dried somewhat and this product was making it worse.I would recommend this to anyone wanting to learn how to apply make-up correctly. I learned how to apply liner this way and had never worn it before because I didn't know how to apply it correctly.I would recommend this for anyone w/ acne or sensitive skin. It doesn't irritate the skin and can clear it up.Great for teens and their starter kit and other kits make it a great value for beginners or pros."
1,"This is exactly what college in upstate New York smells like. It's very familiar, a perfectly lovely oil and very well made; but a bit too dated for me. When you walk into a shop of essential oils or health food store, this is the scent in the air most of the time. It's not off putting, in fact it's a bit comforting. At this stage of my life however, I'd prefer to radiate a bit more modern chic and less earth mother. : )  Other than that, my package was expedited quickly and wrapped very well."
1,"I'm so happy I found this Opi Nail Lacquer. Finally I found a colour that I have been looking for.I stopped & applied this lovely Bogota Blackberry yesterday as soon as it arrived, laugh.Very fast delivery & thanks to Amazon too.You won't go wrong on the great colour.Hope this is helpful &#9786;"
1,"I have tried my share of lip balms and have a collection of half used sticks that I might as well just throw away since I now plan to only buy Neutrogena's Norwegian Formula lip balm! It feels great when you put it on and the feeling lasts! I like to apply it before I work out and it lasts through a run or other activity where I will breathe through my mouth. Feels good to finally say good-bye to dry, flaky lips :)I also recommend the hand cream by Neutrogena's Norwegian Formula.. it is a great line!"
0,"I've written off Barielle as the most high priced gimmick products I've ever tried.  This doesn't do a darned thing.  It's greasy, oily, and if it worked, I'd deal with it, but it does nothing.  I'm sick that I spent the money.  Don't spend yours on this.  There's another product sold here on Amazon called Carmichel's Cuticle Cream.  I've used that for 20 years or so and it does work.  I was experimenting again, and I should know better.  So I bought two little tubs of Carmichaels (or Carmichel's) and my nails are better again.  I just don't know how this brand stays in business.  They won't be getting mine again, that's for sure."
1,I've tried many facial cleaners and this is by far my favorite.  It feels slightly warm when you are applying it and smells like a fresh orange.  Leaves me feeling energized for the day or re-energized for a night out.  The cleanser has a nice smooth texture and feels soft.
1,"I've definitely noticed a difference after using this product - especially right out of show or after exfoliating. I have been using this product for about 2 months now, and have noticed more of a &#34;glow&#34; to my skin, and a reduction of fine lines. It does burn/sting when you first put it on, I have sensitive skin and definitely felt the prickles the first time I have used this - nothing intense or painful, but you should be aware.Value - I have found a very small amount of this cream goes  a LONG way, which is nice. A lot of small cream containers seem to empty so quickly, so it's great that this product has a silky glide that seems to cover your entire face in no time. One caution is to make sure to use sun screen with this product as it can make your skin more susceptible to the sun."
1,"First I am known to love my Margaritas! So when years ago I discovered there was a shampoo/shower gel named after such, I had to get my hands on it, It wasn't in the stores that I could find at that time, so I ordered it on a whim thru my fave Drugstore.comnot knowing if it smell like the real thing, But took a chance on it.Yes omg It smelled yummy (I could have drank it it was that close to a real Margarita!I LOVE this product so much, The only downfall is the price, which is why its a treat for me when I do buy it which sadly is not to often enough for me! I wish they would lower the price, because its such a shame to miss out using it.I love this stuff."
1,"I know it sounds juvenile for a 40+ woman to be raving about a cotton candy scent. But I just love, love, love this scentand I love cotton candy. It smells sweet and fun and reminds you of summer. My teenage daughter loves this too. And the staying power is awesome I can smell it on me all day long. I'm stacking up on this lolz."
1,I put the cream on my hands as many times a day as I can remember especially before I put my rubber gloves on to wash dishes and I think it has really helped.
1,Works fantastically. I use it every day and my cuticles are feeling great! There was a time when I stopped using it for a week and at the end of the week I had dry crusty cuticles - once the oil was used - it was all gone again and my nails looked great!
1,"I have been searching for something to help my fine hair have some type of style.  I love this product, it helps my fine straight limp hair. It defines curls, adds shine and makes my hair bouncy.  I hope that they do not change this product.It is the best for what I need, I have very fine hair which curls when I use this product."
1,"Okay, how great can a blush be?  How often do you see this one referred to?  ALL the time.  I tried it.  Rosy medium skin (touching on rosacea).  This works perfect for me.  There are flecks in it but I wouldn't call it glitter at all. Just light reflecting partlcles. No harsh lines on this, just a great shade.  LOVE it.  Leans towards pink but there is a warmth to it that is almost peach if that's possible.  Not a cold pink anyway."
1,"Asombroso producto,de gran calidad, muy pigmentado, con un toque de shimmer, Madly blush es de un color rosa marr&oacute;n muy hermoso. Recomiendo usar una brocha tipo yachio para la aplicaci&oacute;n y obtener un color m&aacute;s suave.-----------------Amazing product, high quality, highly pigmented, Madly blush with a touch of shimmer, a very beautiful brown pink. I recommend using a brush type Yachio for the application and get a softer color."
1,"This shampoo does not smell like strawberry. It smells like Jolly Rancher or Starburst strawberry flavored candy. Perhaps a bit like Marie Callender's frozen strawberry pie.  It is sweet and artificial, but not too strong. Nevertheless, I love it. It takes me back to junior high almost instantly  (when I was 12, I purchased any personal care product based on the way it smelled...bonus points for fruity). It lathers well and removes any conditioner product you might have used the prior day/week/year. If you have dry hair and are looking for conditioning shampoo, look elsewhere. This is a shampoo for stripping your hair of excess product. It is not organic, it is not eco-friendly, and it is not really natural. I use it when I need to clarify my hair (and take a nostalgic return to 9th grade)."
1,"Gorgeous deep navy color, beautifully saturated, easy to apply and lasts the longest for me without chipping.  I'm an OPI junkie."
1,"be very careful to match the shade with your hair.  I had used this product many times and it leaves the hair in wonderful shape, bouncy, shiney.  But..it can turn lighter colored hair red.  Brassy, otherworldly red.  I have dark brown hair, but my ends have bleached because of the sun and being outside a lot.  I am just waiting for the color to fade away.This is also a great product because it is all vegetable base.  No added chemicals.  It is a tint, not a dye, so it will fade in about a month and a half.  But worth it to not put harmful chemicals on your head."
1,"I love it ..its amazing how light my falselashes feels after applying this glue it stays throughout the day and I almost forget that I'm wearing them, the glue is super easy to remove, no need for makeup remover or anything like that.oh but I would've ordered two if I knew that the size was going to be that small.anyway I recommend everyone to try it and if you're wondering what brand of falselashes to get I'd recommend Red Cherry lashes! :)"
0,"As much as i do not like to be negative I have to be honest, This body spray straight up smells like medicine. It doesn't even get better. i would not purchase again. But hey, someone else might like it?"
1,"for those of you who don't like heavy collognes that saturate the air...buy this! I bought this for my boyfriend fro Christmas and it is masculine and light and he and I love it. He smells so good! And it's not a heavy, overly perfumed smell (yuk). It's just right. It's light enough to wear during the day (which he does) and that scent stays on him all day. NICE."
1,"It's a sorry state of affairs when your doctor points out dry skin to you! Because my hands are so smooth, I hadn't noticed my ""shedding"" legs. When Doc commented about it, I hung my head in shame. As a person dubbed ""Legs"" by certain old friends, that would never do!So when I saw a trusted Amazon reviewer praise Body Lotion With Pump-Vanilla - 8.5 oz. - Lotion, I decided to nurture my skin with this yummy lotion. I've been using it for three months now and I love it. It's not only rich and creamy, it smells good too: VANILLA, one of my favorite scents. But best of all--it actually works!Thanks to reviewer Kasia for pointing this out to me. I can't wait to see the look of appreciation on my doctor's face; for once, I don't dread my routine appointment. Perhaps by then I'll begin to look more like Kasia too. That would be a huge bonus. ;>)Reviewed by Betty Dravis, February 2009"
1,"I have little new short hairs. This is my second or third try with this product. The first time, I wasn't diligent about using it twice a day or even every day. The second time I was a little more but not totally diligent. Now I'm in there morning and night and it's working. They used to have an Extra or Super Strength but I haven't seen that in a while. I'm a fan no matter the strength."
1,"love it, love it. I buy all the time. great with dark hair. give pretty highlights.i will keep buying it."
1,This is a nice light scent. You just roll a little on and you are good to go. Nice light fragrence
0,"This dryer doesn't blow hard or hot enough to straighten the waves out of my hair without a lot of extra styling, which is time-consuming. I have pretty fine, thin hair, so I think this dryer should only be good for people with very straight hair that only want to dry it, not style it. I tried using a styling brush, but the style didn't hold due to the air from the dryer being too cool. I had to use a curling iron. It does leave my hair soft and fluffy, but I wouldn't buy another one."
1,"I use this brush to blow dry and style my hair. This brush has all wood handle, it feels comfortable in my hand, and feels solid. The bristles are made out of a mix of boar bristles and nylon bristles. The bristles are relatively stiff, but not as hard as metal bristles of some brushes, and I find it pretty gentle on my scalp. I like that the bristles have no knobs which I found tangle and tag on my hair.Passing on a tip I got from my hairdresser: she told me to never to brush my hair when it is very wet. It is better to wait a bit until it just slightly damp. When hair is plumped up with water it has an ability to stretch like elastic, but it if you pull it too far it will snap. She told me to use a wide-tooth comb if I need to comb it right out of the shower.I really like the results I get with this brush, I recommend it!Ali Julia review"
1,I bought this because of the rave reviews but I am not sure if I like this product coz the coconut smell is way too strong.
1,"I love this moisturizer. I have very dry skin, and it makes it really nice and smooth without being heavy or greasy. After my girls were born, I had some weird patches on my face that wouldn't go away. I was told it was rosacea and tried many many things that didn't work. I randomly got a sample of this moisturizer and loved it immediately. Normally it takes my skin a while to get used to a new lotion, but not this one. This one is for me!"
0,"I bleached my hair to a mostly yellow, slightly orange color and then applied this product to take it to the next level, to the color I wanted my hair to be. Instead, my hair is yellow-blond. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice color, just not the one I was hoping for. For that reason, I would say it's not worth the time or money. However, I gave it 2 stars because the conditioner it comes with is FANTASTIC! It's a nice purple anti-brass conditioner that works like a miracle at toning brassiness (to some degree anyway...)and leaves your hair feeling healthy and smelling like heaven. But other than that, I'm disappointed with my result and I'm sure it's human error to some degree but I wasn't that far off and expected the tone of my hair to cool somewhat to be closer to what was on the package. Will not purchase again."
1,"My mom has been looking for this color for months and when I found it, I just had to get it for her. The color is so beautiful. One coat is not too sheer but gives the nail a light wash of color. For full opacity, two coats would do. Like all OPI Nail Polishes, it dries fast and doesn't chip quickly."
1,"This soap feels better on my hands that any of the usual store brand I have bought. After using the soap my skin actually feel smoother and healthier than it did before. Sort of like if I put lotion on my hands, but without any residue that lotions normally have. The scent is nice, but not overbearing. The bottle says that the product is an aromatherapy hand soap, but I don't feel the scent is strong enough or last long enough for any sort of mood enhancement or stress relief. Even though the two bottles cost a little more than the store brands, I figure it is worth it. For how much better this soap feels I don't mind my annual hand soap budget going from $10 to $15 dollars.Overall 5 stars for a great product at a great price. I will buy again if the price remains the same."
1,"its the best nail treatement i have tried so far, i have seen the difference on my nails within 3 days, now they are strong and grow !!"
1,This product is good for surface whiteheads only.  Only use pinhead amount on the very spot.  Do not spread on more skin than that or apply more than one time.  It works to dry it out - but does not heal the skin beneath - so as soon as you can stop using and apply healing moisturizer to the tender new skin.  (sorry for the graphic descriptions) This product is good in a pinch / not for large areas of the face or any kind of longterm solution.  But it works well.
1,"This face wash came with something I ordered and after the 1st use I knew I was going to like it. I waited 3 weeks to write this review and I must say I will never EVER be with out this.  EVER!!  I have decent skin, which can be oily sometimes.  This wash is amazing. I'm a guy so don't need it for make up removal so am purely using this to wash my face.  I strongly encourage everyone to try this.  I really don't think you will be disappointed."
1,olay product are allways so good if you have sensitive skin. their product line are so good. i have seen a different in my skin. my skin feel so good after i used it. will buy this again.and the fact that it cost less at amazon than at other stores
1,I adore this color. I have gotten plenty of compliments while wearing it too. I cant place the undertones in this grey though Its a beautiful color that compliments many different skin tones.
0,"I ordered this based on all the customer's reviews that seemed great.  I tried it once on my dog and it seemed to really dry out his fur.  I don't know what the big deal is with this product.  There are way better products out there (i.e., Dermabenss).  I really didn't like this product, and returned it."
1,"It's not just an ad campaign, a super-absorbent towel really does speed up hair drying. I spend less time with the hair dryer when I use this towel. Less time with the hair dryer means my hair looks less fried out and feels softer.I liked the idea of the hair turbans that came out a few years ago, but realistically they never quite fit. For me the loops and buttons and such were not in quite the right place for my particular head. A flat towel works much better for me. It is nice and long so I can make my own turban.I have two different brands of these hair towels. The Aquis one is much softer than the other one.I confess that I pretty much ignore any special laundry instructions. I figure it lives in the bathroom, it must be laundered with the other bath towels with no special care. So far it is holding up well under that arrangement."
1,Saw that the came out with anew face wash and though i'll try it. After a mouth of use I saw no brightening..... Boring I went back to my old face wash and gave this to my niece.
1,"This is a true blood red polish. Goes on smooth, it's just gorgeous! Will work great for anytime of the year. A must for anyone who loves red polish!"
1,I like this polish and its a super cute color but its not coral! Its almost a cherry red!I was looking for a coral but this was cheap and 3-free so I wont return it... just annoying. Still looking for a 3-free coral!
1,I love it!The rose smell very good! Not too strong!And it nice to use! Easy and quick.Nice
0,"Most of my reviews are positive. There are a few that state my dislike. This would be one of them! I hate this product because it did not live up to my expectations&#8230;at all!  It was watery; not at all like Duo adhesive in a tube. In addition, it had a strange blueish iridescent color and had absolutely no hold! If I put a piece of chewed up gum on them-that would have held the lashes better than this product!"
1,"Good value. While this has many uses, my favorite is removing makeup while moisturizing. However, this cream is NOT for those with oily skin due to the hydrating components. It is definitely meant for normal to dry skin. This is unscented and the consistency is perfect. I used Ponds for years until I came across Jergens while shopping, and I will never go back. Half the price and a better product."
1,I love this nail color...always get compllments on it...my absolute favorite!!  Great service too.  This color works anytime of the year.
1,"I purchased it for it's heaviness. I used shea, olive, and other oils. I have to reapply them to my dry skin and hair. I had so many plans for this 32 oz bottle after reading the great reviews. I wanted to use it in my hair and on my skin. I just knew this is what I needed to add to those dry area such as my elbows, knees, and heels. Oh my it's so sticky and smelly. Yes, it works great for those areas only but as an all over moisturizer NO...too sticky. I was hoping this would be my next all over oil...no way. I wear my hair natural so I just knew this would be a great moisurizer for my thick mane. Yes, it moisturizes well, but it's so thick to rub in and not to mention the smell is not something you would want to leave on your hair. I'm sorry this is not going to work for me. I will use it for problem areas until it's gone or to use as an hot oil treatment. More than likely won't buy again. I will stick to my Hot Six Oil, olive, or shea oil and it's much cheaper."
1,Control yourselves. I know most of us have scaly and dry hands from the weather and certain occupational hazards but only a little will do you right. Palms are no longer itchy and looking like a crusty tomato.I can no longer use my hands as sandpaper but hey now I can touch my face without peeling it off. Great product! I no longer have sand paper for hands!
1,Works fine does what it's supposed to no string so if you need one these are not for you. I like em
1,"This handwash is fantastic.  Every time I go to the States, I restock on more because of course, it's unavailable in Australia.  It feels like you are really cleaning your hands as opposed to using fragrant soaps that don't really remove that grimy feel or dirt.  It foams well and when you towell your hands, they don't feel tight or dry so I get the feeling like it's not drying out my skin.  Also, to top it off, the scent is devine.  It's not overpowering but subtle, and yet you can still smell it faintly for a while later.I hate using bar soaps for my hands and I love this wash.  I wished it came in bulk to use as an all over body wash.  I highly recommend this soap especially if you get dry hands.  I find myself washing them a little more frequently throughout the day just to get that gorgeous smell back in my nose.  It's a great cleanser and it looks after your skin."
1,soooo mild and moisturizing  especially in a desert climate or in the wintery midwest this is a godsend.  no lather  but no super tight face either
0,I followed the directions and it just doesn't keep my hair curled. I have thicker hair but I tried only a small section and that didn't stay either. :( I would love to use hot rollers instead of a curling iron but they don't ever seem to work!
1,This works great and best of all it has no strong odor like so many. Have not used it but a few times but am hoping it will help to strengthen my nails like it said.
1,I bought this after I read that wheat germ oil provides ceramides and elasticity to your hair and skin. It smells weird but I use it in small amounts and mix it with products that smell good to mask the smell(I heard sweet orange oil works well too). It definitely worked. After using wheat germ oil in all my hair mixtures I noticed that my new growth stretched out and stayed that way even after airdrying.
1,"I'm a fan of OPI: the brush is easy (though not as easy on my small toenails), the color is pigmented (I have no problem with using two coats of polish, although some people do), and I love this slightly muted pink. I've been drawn to it this spring, it is a beautiful color."
1,"I bought these headbands based on the reviews I read on Amazon and I have to say, ""these headbands are AMAZING!!!!!"" I love wearing headbands but the sides always stick behind my ears and i immediately get a severe headache and have to remove the headband, but these are super-comfy and the little combs on each side stick into your hair and not right behind your ears to hurt.  They were also delivered super fast (2 days, normal shipping) so that was another plus.  All in all, I am loving these headbands and would definitely purchase more (price is right)...."
1,"Lectric shave makes it easier to shave with an electric.  It seems to prepare your skin by sanitizing it (i.e. with alcohol), and making it easier for the blades/foil to glide over your skin.  Good stuff and it lasts quite a while."
0,ugh money wasted... just too small dissappointed. I should have known better. anyone want a brush? hahaha lol other than that love spornette brand
1,I only wear OPI nail polish and use it on my clients as I am a nail tech. This color was not at my for professionals only store so I ordered here. Not much difference in price and NO Sales Tax which is a big deal. I will only shop here.
1,Absolutely love Blackberry 640.  It is a deep rich color.  Goes on smoothly.  I prefer Revlon over the Est&eacute;e Lauder lipsticks that I get as a gift with purchase.
1,"I really wanted to love this product because of the rave reviews and the history of the product but it just doesn't clean as well as a toner with alcohol does.  While toners with alcohol dry out my face however, this hazel toner did not and it smelled very pretty."
0,"While this was moisturizing, I used the entire bottle- 2 applications per day- and it did nothing to lighten my darkened elbows and knees."
1,I like Mrs Meyers because its natural and it has aromatherapy too. I cleans up with a pleasant smell to boot.
1,"I have been purchasing this from walmart, but I live 35 minutes away from it, and these are rather small bottles. So technically this is a pricier bodywash, there are many others that are more affordable I am sure, I just haven't found them yet! However, as a mom of 3, I still get occasional breakouts on my back and chest, but what mostly drives me crazy are the bumps. I have a mild case of Keratosis Pilaris (small white or red bumps, on backs of arms, legs, knees and elbows) and a aggravating fight with ingrown hairs on my legs...Since I started using this, (about 2 months) I have not had one breakout and my keratosis is almost completely gone, as is the ingrown hairs. My legs haven't felt this 'bump-free' since high school! I use this in conjunction with my clarisonic pro, so maybe it is a combination of the two, but I am hooked for sure. Some people have said that it dries their skin out, I just be sure to coat myself in a good lotion after I scrub and I haven't noticed any drying."
0,"At first I thought this smelled like peanut butter, but than after awhile it seemed to smell worst like so bad and too strong it was making me sick, if you can stand the smell, go for it, but it definitely made me want to throw up."
1,"Avalon makes fantastic products. i have had acne all my life and now even in my '50's get blemishes on my nose, though the rest of my skin is drying out due to age. I switched over to Avalon from very expensive line (Yonka) after my sister (dry skin) recommended it. I now use the CoQ10 as well as the Vitamin C (orange bottle) cleansers, toners and moisturizers. Really lovely scent, and lasts a long time because all you need is a little bit for cleansing."
1,"This is really good stuff for keeping those cuticles in good shape so they do not dry out and cause problems. It has a good scent -- not all girly, so it's good for guys (like me) who wash their hands often and gals who like the lemony freshness."
1,"I have trouble with sunscreen causing breakouts and this almost never causes blemishes.  I also have come to hate the smell of typical sunscreen and this doesn't have that smell.  I have light to medium tone Caucasian skin with some yellow undertones and this is so thick it can double as foundation makeup.  It says it dries clear, but it's a little chalky and would probably really look bad if you have dark or ethnic skin.  I have read that the tinted kind doesn't blend well with Asian skin."
1,This product smells really good! It leaves my hair feeling really soft. I really like it and would definitely buy it again. I would recommended getting a spray bottle to put it in so it does not spill all over the place when you are trying in your hair.
1,This is an overall good product at a good price.It's oild free remover so gentle on the eyes and can be used with eyelash extensions.I would prefer a smaller opening to control the amount of product dispensed.Other than that I'm pretty happy with it.
0,I am very disappointed with this product because I see nothing great. I used to use Bulgarian rose water purchased from amazon as my toner. It used to tighten my pores and give me a good fresh feeling. Also my skin looked great when i was using it. I tried this for a change and nothing great infact i broke out after using it. Not liking this product
1,I have very long hair and love using this conditioner. I used to use this over 20 years ago and forgot about it. I can leave this in a little when wearing my hair curly. This is the perfect conditioner for my hair and it loves it. I also use it as a deep conditioner when I wear my hair straight. It is hard to find a conditioner that works perfectly for straight and curly hair all the same. This one is it.
1,I've been looking for a nice basic day product to use under make it during the winter months in MN. I like the feel and finish of Obagi and will definitely look at the other products offered by this company.
1,"Very good makeup remover, I'd like to use it, not too greasy, but after using the cleansing is very clean."
0,"This product is a wast for me. I was so excited to get it after readying all the reviews.  I applied it to the areas that needed it,  and it does nothing for me. I don't see any difference the next day, or even the next couple of hours aftering applying it, nothing. Wast of my money."
1,Hard to get used to applying with a tube (messy) to false eyelashes and getting the proper timing between application to lashes and placing above eyelash so it stick quickly. Application might work with practice and more steady fingers BUT it would be less messy if not in a tube and instead applied with a brush.
1,"I alternate between the Body Clear Body Wash, and Body Clear Body Scrub for maximum results. I do not have issues with body acne but my skin tone is not as even as I would like it to be, and my skin is oily all over-so I use these products to control both. My skin tone is a little more even, but it is definitely less oily. This body wash is mild for a body wash, it does not irritate like some do. It also does not lather or foam as well as some other body washes. Because of the 2% concentration of salicylic acid, it should not be used in sensitive areas. As far as it being a body wash, it does not deodorize or neutralize the way I expect most body washes to.I have used this on my face when I have been all out of other products, and even though I have sensitive skin this didn't irritate like I assumed it would.I continue to use this because of the salicylic acid in it, which has been found to have anti aging properties with acne fighting properties.I give this a three star because as a stand alone product (when not used along with the body scrub) the effects are diminished significantly."
1,"Pretty good stuff.  I used it for about a year and had good results until I found Meaningful Beauty, which I like better.  Would recommend this product though.  Great fragrance."
1,"I have bi-racial hair, it's curly, fine and has medium thickness, Finding a brush to keep my hair smooth when I straighten it, has been a ongoing battle for 5 years until I found this brush and it was an 'aha' moment (thanks Oprah). I use it to wrap my hair at night and groom my hair during the day, no more puffy hair. Great buy - yummy mummy approved."
1,"Usually with reconstructors my hair ends up a little hard, so I have to end up deep conditioning with a moisturizing conditioner. However, this conditioner absolutely turned my hair around. I used to have lovely, low porosity (I actually liked the fact that it wasn't very porous) hair that became damaged through my physical activities -- wearing helmets, swimming in an overchlorinated pool, etc. My ends were an absolute mess. After a few trims and this treatment, my hair turned around. My hair was moisturized from the inside without it feeling coated, or leaving a film. It felt supple and healthy. I used a lot of conditioners before I found this one. Definitely a staple.One more thing, I see some reviews that say this conditioner isn't for Black hair, or for natural hair. I am African American and my hair is natural, so it really depends on your lifestyle, hair needs, etc. more than the texture of your hair."
1,"I wasn't expecting much from such a simple ingredient but I think this stuff has really turned around my skin.  And it smells wonderful.I've used this rosewater by itself, with witch hazel, and with witch hazel and glycerin.  Each time my skin has come out touchably soft.  My pimples have dried out faster, and my skin just looks better.  Plus, now that I've started using this, I can add other skin care products to my regimen and I don't break out like crazy, which was the result before.I'm so glad I read a review for Burt's Bees Rosewater & Glycerin toner that explained the benefits of using toner.  It convinced me to finally get this rosewater to make my own toner.  Before that, I had been planning to buy rosewater for some time because I read that French women spritz it on their face to keep moisturized throughout the day.If my skin could talk I think it would say it loves this stuff."
1,"I always look for this type of purple but never find the right shade to strike my fancy unless it is cheap .99 polish and aint nobody got time for that mess (lol I used bad grammar there to get my point across.) FINALLY something very fairly priced in the color I crave!!! LOVE IT. Essie glides on smooth, lasts and is better than OPI. thank you so much for this!!"
0,I've heard so many good things about this product but my hair didn't take to well to it. It made my hair very stringy and dry. Used it twice and both times it was just disgusting.
1,"I just opened a celebratory beer & had to write this...as another reviewer said if you are reading this you must be having some serious hair troubles.  Don't freak out just read this. I hope it helps as much as the other reviews helped me.I'm 39 & am a natural brunette, level 7.  I had my hair highlighted & colored since my early 20s & after too many highlights took the plunge & went blonde-on my own about 10yrs ago using Loreal Preference anywhere from level 8 to the level 10 Le Blondes (found that I'm best as a 9 natural blonde or beige blonde) with some highlights added here & there either professionally or on my own.  I've loved their color & it works beautifully.  So this fall as I'm getting older I think I should tone it down & add lowlights.  I go to a friends girl & show her a pic of who else?  Jennifer Aniston (& while you're at it can I have her face too??).  She notes that Jen has some intentional outgrowth..you know a little darker roots to make it look more real.  Well okay I'm good with her painting it in, I've seen her work so let's do it.  Um, not such a good idea!! She paints my entire head (roots) in a 6N & leaves it on waaayyyy too long & I'm looking like some old trashy gal that needs a root touch up REALLY bad!! UGHH I can't tell you how bad it was!  I was a level 9, some lowlights & BLACK roots (you pull my hair in a pony & I'm wearing a black band around my head--seriously.  My boyfriend later tells me ""Wow, your roots were BLAAACCCCKKK! Leave it to men to be honest about the wrong things...anyway there's the damage, here's the repair....I go to another friend that can barely fit me in, she's good with color & is booked solid but does me a favor.  She highlights (not what I wanted in September) to break up the color but the roots are still there.  Great, thanks, tolerable but later I decide this is just not good enough for me.  I grab my Loreal in 8 natural blonde(I figure if I try to pull it too high at one time I'll go orange) & try it on my roots only even though she warns me it won't work.  Guess what?  It didn't work.  Barely put a ding in that damn dark color.  Ugh.  I know if I keep going (color, highlights, color...and so on) I will be doing some damage.  SO....I look on Amazon, I love Loreal color & consider the color oops thing & hey maybe it IS great but I see the reviews on this product here & think I should do it.  I try the shampoo method (you will see there are two ways to do it) 1/2 oz #1 bottle, 1/2 oz #2 bottle & 1 oz of shampoo.  I apply to my roots, leave in for about 20 mins. & it looks good but a little bit orangy at the roots (nothing I haven't experienced for a day or two when I've colored to light too fast before & I know it fades (at least for me) with a few washings.  But it says you can try 2-3 times so I go for it again...same method for about 10 minutes & this time all over my head.  Guess what?  I'm back to what I was before this whole fiasco, a warm level 9 that looks as natural as fake color can be. :) My hair does feel a little dry but only in the spots that I just had the highlights, I'll be deep conditioning under my dryer once a week & using the night repair from Redkin & I'll be fine.  Also, I barely went through any of the product but will keep in on hand in case I get stupid again.  Holy c**p.  Longest 4 days EVER!!!Keep in mind:*Do NOT run out & highlight hair that is too dark unless you wanted to do that anyway.  Money & damage to your hair that is unneccessary!*Do NOT let a stylist or cashier at Sally's talk you out of buying this (woman at the register said all knowingly ""This will turn you orange"".  I may go back there & say...REALLY?? While flipping my hair*Do NOT try to color over, you run the risk of no change but more damage, uneven color, going ashy grey-green or brassy or even better as I did once MANY years ago kind of burgandy (thank God I was young!).*Try this & if after the first time it hasn't done much you may not have left it long enough (I sat under a dryer for 10 of the 20 minutes the first use & about half the time of the second run. End result...better than I hoped!Best of Luck & Sorry this was so long, I'm running on the adrenaline of relief!"
1,This is my second like this.  I like it for daily re-styling and not bad for on the road.  If you want to use it as a regular styler you need patience.  I still prefer my round brush and blow dryer to do my weekly blow-out.
1,"A co-worker brought in some items that didn't match her skin tone...she gave them to me, i tried them and the rest is history!"
1,"I don't have wrinkles to begin with, but I'm definitely using this to take steps to help prevent aging skin in the future. This product goes on well and does not clog my pores. Other night time face lotions will usually have me break out from time to time, but this has yet to. The fact that it has Retinol in it, is great. This is a perfect cream for anyone wanting to try a Retinol, safe product for the first time."
1,"I've been through 2 tubes of this product. It's a gel, and it smells sweet and minty -- very nice. Refreshing and makes you feel clean.But be careful though, just in case you're like me -- when you open it each time and squeeze it it can squirt out really fast so make sure you've got your hand over the nozzle and not just like, your pinky or something. But one dot or 2 is plenty for your whole face. In my case I had acne all over my torso. After like a week or two of applying this product every day, this stuff really made a difference. By the end of the first month the acne was gone -- just had to find a way to get rid of scars which is perfectly fine as far as this product goes.I'm very fond of the ingredients list, how it's not made of all synthetic chemicals, and how it smells.A good way to help this product in getting rid of your acne in a few weeks is to make sure you don't eat too many greasy foods or at least take good care of your diet. This product is great, but I think you have to meet it halfway as well -- which makes sense. You can't just go to the doctor for heart disease and then go back home and keep inhaling burgers soda and potato chips and then blame the doctor for your next heart attack.So long story short, this product is great for clearing up actively volcanic acne, leaving nothing but acne scars (which is okay to me -- I use aloe or coconut oil or good lotion for scars).The last star is for price. This costs a ridiculous amount for 1 measly fluid ounce. ONE. After I got rid of the acne on my torso, I just eat better, eat cucumbers or slap the cucumbers right on my skin with some aloe. In my experience, the key to preventing/getting rid of acne is to not eat too much greasy stuff, or make sure you de-grease with hot tea and/or cucumbers... internally and/or externally :P"
1,"I while back my doctor (reluctantly) prescribed progesterone cream for me from a compounding pharmacy after my insistence on having my hormones tested.The cream changed my life. My night sweats disappeared, I was no longer prone to fits of rage, my family actually enjoyed being with me again, I was able to think clearly again and the brain fog was GONE (essential because I am the sole supporter for my family), and my energy levels, while not quite what they used to be, moved back into the acceptable range allowing me to actual have something of a social life again.The pharmacy and provided me with a cream I ended up having a severe allergic reaction to and weren't able to provide the cream in a formulation that was safe for me.So I turned to Amazon to find an over the counter cream. I have tried a number of creams trying to find the right one for me. Reading the other reviews available, it is quite clear that the cream works for most people, while there are a few for whom it doesn't work. Since there are plenty of reviews about whether or not the cream works, and I know what the cream can do for me based on my experience with the progesterone from the compounding pharmacy, I decided to write a comparison of the creams I tried. I had a hard time decided which cream to use soI tried several to find the best one for me. Following is my assessment of the different creams I tried.I selected the Source Naturals over the Emerita Pro-Gest because it is just as good as the Emerita Pro-Gest, but at less than half the cost.There were several factors that were important to me and on which I'm basing my reviews. You may have other factors that are or are not important, so please take those into consideration when reading my evaulations. The factors for me were1. Effectiveness/strength of the cream (MOST important, worth 3 stars).2. Ease of use (this includes type of packaging and ease/difficulty of self-dosing) (worth 1 star).3. Smell and feel (some of these products had a smell or feel to me that was just horrible), obviously the most subjective of my criteria (worth 1 star).4. Most of the products were close in price, but one was about twice the cost of the others (the Emerita Pro-Gest).  For me, if that were the only choice it wouldn't make a difference, but since there were otherwise comparable products out there, I subtracted a star from the expensive one for being close to twice the cost of the others.That's a potential total of 5 stars per product.To summarize what I've found, the best quality of progesterone cream in terms of how well the cream relieved my symptoms was found in either the Source Naturals products or the Emerita Pro-Gest.The easiest to use were those with the dosed pumps, but I didn't like any of those creams because they either didn't work well or had an offensive smell or feel. The one I ended up using regularly is the Source Naturals in the tub. I bought a dedicated measuring spoon so I can get a consistent dose. It's not as easy as the dosed pump because I have to clean the spoon after each use, but the cream is otherwise excellent, so to me it was worth the extra work.Here's my opinion of each cream, with my star rating. (For the Amazon ratings, I've rounded up since they don't allow half stars.)SOURCE NATURALS PROGESTERONE CREAM. Available in a tube or tub. 4-4.5 starsSource Naturals Natural Progesterone Cream, 4 Ounce (113.4 g)1. This is by far the most effective at relieving my symptoms. It works just as well as the pharmacy cream did. 3 stars.2. The tube is a little difficult to squeeze as it got emptier, and I was never sure if I was getting the last bit out. The purchase of the measuring spoon to use with the tub made it an easier way for me to get a consistent dose. 0 stars for the tube, 1/2 a star for the tub.3. Nothing offensive about either the scent or feel of this product. 1 star.4. This is the most reasonably priced product I've tried so far.Total: 4 stars for the tube version and 4.5 stars for the tub version.NOW FOODS PROGESTERONE CREAM. Available in a dosed pump, unscented or lavender. 3-3.5 starsNOW Foods Progesterone Cream, 3 OuncesorNOW Foods Progesterone Cream W/Lavender, 3 Ounces1. This worked reasonably fine at relieving my symptoms. I would have a frequent but mild night sweat on this but that's about it. The other creams did a better job of controlling my symptoms. 2 stars.2. Comes in a dosed pump. They pump often (every few pumps) seemed to get an air bubble and not deliver a full dose, so even though I really like the concept, it didn't always work so I'm taking off half a star. 1/2 a star.3. The feel is fine. There's an unscented version and a lavender one. The unscented had no objectionable odor, but I really didn't like the lavender scent (I normally really like lavender but didn't like this one. 1 star for the unscented, 1/2 for the lavender.Total: 3 stars for the lavender and 3.5 stars for the unscented.LIFE FLOW PROGESTA-CARE. Available in a dosed pump. No rating (please see below)Life-Flo Progesta-Care with  Natural Progesterone Body Cream, Women's Wellness, 4-Ounce BottleI can't full evaluate the effectiveness of this product because I couldn't use it for more than a couple of nights. The cream felt so horrible on my skin. It was sticky and tacky and wouldn't feel like it absorbed in. My clothes would stick to me after using it, kind of like the way they would stick to you on a hot humid day, which didn't happen with any of the other products I tried. I tried to tolerate it, but ended up having to wash it off in order to sleep. Not rated. Some reviewers didn't seem bothered by the feel fo this, but a few others did. I am not usually a princess about these things, but I really couldn't stand the feel of this. Please read the other reviews for alternative opinions and perhaps you might have better luck with this product than I did.EMERITA PRO-GEST CREAM. Available in a tube or single-use packet. 2-3 stars (3-4 stars if you don't care about cost)Emerita Pro-Gest Natural Progesterone Cream, Paraben-Free, 4-Ounce Tube,Pro-Gest Cream 48 Single-use Packets1. This worked fine. I would have a very rare and very mild night sweat on this, but otherwise no complaints about effectiveness. 2.5 stars.2. The tube offers no easy way to get a consistent dose, and, like the other tubes, gets harder to squeeze as it gets used up and I was never able to tell if the tube was empty or close to empty. The single use packets eliminated the dosing problem. 0 stars for the tube, 1 star for the packets.3. The cream felt fine, but it had a slightly unpleasant odor. 1/2 a star.4. This product costs almost twice as much as the others so I subtracted a star for that. Please add a star if you don't care about cost.Total: 2-3 stars."
0,"This shampoo works just fine, but doesn't have even a hint of peppermint scent.  I was looking for something to pair with the very minty American Crew conditioner, which has a really invigorating, intense peppermint smell--I was disappointed that this shampoo doesn't seem minty at all."
1,"I was looking for a good leave in and this had pretty good reviews however,I do not like it,  maybe if I was 13 actually I gave mine to my 13 year old niece.  The smell is too fruity childish I'm 36 I don't want to smell that fruity."
1,I got a bad allergy on my hands and need to keep Vaseline on them at night and this works fine.
1,This is the typical bond I have used for years but I recently found one on Amazon that last longer and adhears better.. Duo cannot compare to it.
1,good product
1,"I have thick curly coily AA hair and after almost 4 years spent and $$$ wasted of searching for the holy grail of conditioners, I gave up. I have a strict budget now and cam across Suave.This is hands down my partner in hair crime! Mostly because I leave it in daily and it has SAVED my hair. In conjunction I use Suave Naturals Everlasting Sunshine as my main rinse out and DC conditioner, and use Coconut for an occasional rinse out and DC. I'm working towards using Coconut as my one and only, though, since EV is harder to find in person and thus unreliable for me.I have absolutely no issues with this product and I will continue to buy it until it is no longer manufactured (which I hope NEVER happens)!I have used this stuff every day for the past month since Dec 2013 and I never intend to stop using it. It is a must buy necessary product for me.$1.50 - $1.99 in most brick and mortar storesPleasant, light true coconut scent. Thick in consistencyPerfect coils and curls after using this as a rinse out or leave inIt"" slips "" hair best when rinsing out under waterSUPERIOR as a leave in, great as rinse out conditionerComes in 22.5 & 33 ounce sizing!"
1,"This is the third round brush I have bought to blow out my hair. The first was Prego 275 and also a Remington Pearl Ceramic round brush. Both were ok.. or at least I thought until I received this brush the other day. I have thick, wavy, unruly shoulder  length hair that I have to blow straight and than flat iron. This brush did a wonderful job grabbing onto the hair and I didn't have to stop all the time to put my hair back on the brush. I normally work with at least two brushes but I just did my hair with just this one brush in half the time it normally takes me. I did order the two inch and it worked well for my shoulder length hair but I will be order at least one more of these brushes and I might try a different size to mix it up a little :) Also, this brush is noticeably heavier than my other two brushes. It felt good in my hands and didn't get heavy while styling my hair but that may be an issue for some."
1,"I never thought a soap could make such a big difference.  I switched to this soap about ten days ago and I can't believe how much better my skin feels, especially my face and hands.The Aveeno bar looks and feels completely different from any other bar soap.  It does not lather to any great extent, which may bother some people, but the fact is that lather serves no cleaning purpose.  It does feel creamy and pleasant.  It also has a smell that, well, smells like oatmeal, so that is an adjustment.  It is not unpleasant, just different.  It does not transfer to the skin, nor can I smell the bar when I walk into the bathroom, which is important to me as I do not like perfumed or flowery soaps that (to me) stink up the room.I was worried that it would not be effective in removing makeup, especially mascara, but it works just fine.Aveeno also has a new product, a moisturizer for people with eczema Aveeno Active Naturals Eczema Care Moisturizing Cream, 6 Oz, that I also started using a week ago, and the effects of the combination of the two is a marvel.  I occasionally have mild eczema outbreaks, so I cannot speak for those with more severe cases or itching skin, but this bar and the moisturizer have worked wonders for me."
1,"This works well for my long hair.  It is fairly easy to use (not that round brush dry and style is that easy to do on yourself), but it curls well."
1,"I've used Rose Water products in the past - all great, until I tried this. This toner IS THE BEST toner I've ever used! I don't use cotton balls to apply it. I use it as a splash after every wash. I even use it in my homemade Henna condition. I have always had small pores so I can't give my opinion on if this helps shrink them or not. But, I can say it helps keep my skin moist and soft. Another Ph.D. product!"
1,"nice color, but a bit on the boring side. Looks a bit dull. But the product stays on all day long."
1,"like the title, this was beautiful nail polish but slightly blue..very slight just not as minty. This is a very dependable brand, always has smooth creamy colors with nice brushes that are wide so it doesnt get all cruddy. I wish it had eco-friendly ingredients :/ but its so pretty that I will be a bad person for this brand. lame but honest."
1,"I've been using this for 2 years. Love it. All I'm looking for is cleanse without irritating my skin, and this one meets my need perfectly. It's affordable & simple enough. Will keep buying this."
1,I am SO happy with this product! I have seen such a dramatic improvement after years of using similar products by luxury and elite drugstore brands which work good but were not this strong. My skin is oily/combo and this has a fantastic matte NON drying effect. Via the Perricone skincare method goes great with his nutrition and supplement advice.
0,"I'm getting to the age where I could use some skin tightening, wrinkle reduction, spot reduction, smoother complexion...I'd be happy with any improvement in any area really.  This did NOTHING...It does have a lovely, soft pleasing scent, but it's really just an expensive moisturizer, not an antiaging creme."
1,"This has been one of my favorites for about 15 years now. When I can afford it, I try and keep it in stock. Very good price from Amazon."
1,"I bought this together with a thumb sucking guard. Let's just say that the combination worked wonders on my 3 year old!He's no longer sucking his thumb. He did throw up twice and he is a picky eater so I wasn't so happy about it. But I'd rather he lost appetite for a couple of days than having him suck on his thumb on his wedding night! jajaja!Anyhow, I have a lot of this remaining so I will give it to another child sufferer.It does work wonders for kids."
1,"I buy this sat Costco when it is on sale and went on Amazon to do a comparison price check.  I do not use this as my everyday body cr&egrave;me, even though my dermatologist wishes I would.  This is non scented and I tend to use it at night after showering before I go to bed as it very rich.  I turned on a friend to this as she has very dry skin and now she uses it every day.  Important to note:  scoop a small amount onto your hands and rub your hands together to 'melt it down' before applying to the body."
0,"Everyone reacts differently, and this product made me break out. I would test it out on a small patch of skin to see how you react."
1,"For the past year I have been covering my skin from hives. I hated the sight of the patchy itchy redness that would appear on my skin. Since I purchased Aveeno's Anti-Itch concentrated lotion, the hives have minimized and even disappear faster. I started applying the lotion after every bath. Within two days, the hives have been under control. I'm happy to be living a more itch free life."
0,"This product came damaged, two of the comb teeth were missing, and they weren't even in the bag, which means it was packaged damaged!!!!"
1,I'm 21 and deployed for 6 months. I purchased this product my frist month here in the hopes of growing my hair out longer for Christmas. I have been using this product for about 3 months now. I am horrible at keeping on a pill poping schedule so I've missed a day or two here and there. However my hair has grown nearly 1 1/2 inches. My hair grows dreadfully slow so for me thats something to be proud of especially in such a short period of time. Once I get back to the states I am going to order this product again because it actually worked for me. Unfortunately not ever product works for everyone. You have to keep in mind that you can't continue to damage your hair and expect it to grow (the more you damage your hair the more you have to cut so you won't see any results).
1,I have fine short hair yet this still managed to grab my hair and tangle it.  The release button does not rotate enough to release the curl. Not impressed.
1,I love this full flawless face brush! My foundation goes on smooth and blends beautifully. Ive been using it for quite some time and it still looks brand new!
1,"My wife loves this particular shade of lipstick and it's so hard, if not impossible to find locally... so much easier justplace an order and viola...I'm sure she'll be ordering again from this marketseller for they are excellent"
1,This is my other go-to moisturizer that is SPF 15. It has a perfect texture and works very well and I will buy again.
1,"OPI Nail Lacquer, Touring America Collection colors are my favorite collection.  I just love the different colors, I just OPI period."
1,"Years ago, I got the Body Fantasies cotton candy body wash and I loved the scent so much that I wanted to get more. However, as a gift, I had received the body spray instead. I was a little hesitant about it since body sprays and  body washes of the same scent and brand can vary significantly in the way they smell but the moment I caught the scent, I couldn't get enough of it! It smells sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. The scent is just as you would imagine cotton candy to smell. There's no 'artificial' undertone to it like you would find with other fragrances and it lasts a long time on the skin. As an added bonus, the price is very cheap so your wallet will be very happy, too. I will definitely be repurchasing this in the future."
1,"I absolutely love NARS lipstick. It just has a great feel on your lips. The color Roman Holiday is spectacular. I am not too crazy about the price and there are good alternatives. In particular, you might try L'Oreal Infallible LeRouge ""Beyond Blushing""(very similar to NARS Roman Holiday) or ""Perennial Pink"" which is a little lighter shade of pink. I like NARS slightly more, but I really wonder if it's worth the extra $15.00 when the L'Oreal is so extremely similar."
1,"This stuff SAVED my forehead, restored it! I love it and am so thankful for it. The best cream out there. Now what I do is with deep wrinkles really massage it into those wrinkles. They will go away. As for the strength I had not experienced the burn with this. I had used it for about 1.5 years then I bought a new one and that one gave me major sunburn feel so I dont know if I got a potent batch or my skin was so rough before it didnt burn. Either way touch on areas you need help with. The only thing it didnt help with is pores. I think this the best over the counter cream for an amazing price."
1,"I didn't realize this color was going to be sheer and shiny. However, it is still a very lovely color and I do like it."
1,"It says that you should see results in 2 weeks. Well, I didn't, but I guess we all have different skin. I could start seeing results within the first month (right cheek & forehead). It truly works.Make sure you use it with a sunscreen though. Fade creams can potentially damage skin when the profuct is on and the skin is exposed to sunlight.Along with the fade cream, I used Alba's Skin Lotion w/h SPF 15 as well as Palmer's Cocoa Butter Lotion during the night. On nights were it got really cold, I used Bio Oil on my face with the fade cream underneath.Will definitely buy a second bottle (well, jar) soon."
1,"I love Jason products because they smell great and are safe for me and the environment. It's not cheap, but it's a luxury that's worth it for me."
1,"I used this product a last year and noticed definite results to literally in my case remove the lines you have on your chest/ wrinkles from sleeping at night.I did discontinue the product and applied different retinol products for several month to see if they would make a differed a lce. Nothing.As Retinol is so highly claimed to be a huge help in diminishing wrinkles I felt like I should give it a try, one good product I can recommend is the Neutrogena Retinol Cr&egrave;me, comes in a tube, it helped a lot on the laugh lines and lines between my eyebrows. I even applied it under my make up , which works really good.But it did not help so smoothen out the wrinkles on my chest?So I am back to Reviva Firming Serum and can only highly recommend itFor me it did not work under my make up , as after a while when it dried it came off?Hope this will help someone"
1,I used this product for two days with sunscreen and noticed that where my glasses sit on my nose it started forming a scab. I suggest  people who wear glasses not use this on the bridge of your nose and sides where your glasses make contact. Just use a separate non-comedogenic moisturizer and then use this alpha hydrox lotion on places like your chin and cheeks and forehead.
1,I have tried every base coat on the market and nothing has worked.  I was so sick of polish chipping off an hour after applying that I was doing research on investing in a uv dryer and soak off gel polishes.  I found this sticky base coat and decided to give it a chance.  Amazing.  My nail polish stayed on for 7 full days two weeks in a row.  Even after putting up a x-mas tree and decorating the house.  Not a chip to be seen.  Great product.
1,My only complaint which I am sure has been echoed by many is I wish the lid was attached.  Other than that I find this to be quality product for the price range it is in.
0,I have a Revlon eyelash curler from several years ago that is wonderful and this is not similar. I didn't need to replace my old curler but wanted 2 curlers (one for my makeup at home and one for travel or purse). I thought this would be similar since it looks like my original Revlon one but it is not at all. The handle for your fingers is very awkward- I'm talking it's hard for me to use because the handles are so spread out and slide together weirdly. I am a fairly petite woman but I feel this would be a similar problem for most women. The handles themselves are at an awkward angle so it's weird trying to move the curler to get your eyelashes in it. I literally thought I was going to hurt my eye trying it. Very disappointing - just going to stick to my one curler.The product itself seemed well made and had extra curler pads. I guess that's nice if you replace them but I never do - I just use baby oil (buy small travel size at Target) to get the mascara off then rinse with hand soap and water. Then I thoroughly dry before using. I have used that method since I first bought my curler MANY years and it cleans the curler pad like it's new. No need to waste money on replacements and it curls just as great as always.I wouldn't suggest this curler for anyone. Seems like Revlon tried to improve their curler but it's been at the expense of making it difficult to use.
1,"I have used Bare Minerals for about 8 years and I have to say, it's time to give it up.  I first purchased this foundation when I was 24.  I was in love!  It has good coverage (sheer to full depending on application) and good lasting power (has lasted at the gym and club).  My complexion was flawless!  It was really quick and easy to apply, although it was a little messy with the sifter and lid, etc.  The reason I have decided to abandon it after so many years is because as I have aged, I have acquired a few fine lines, and BE foundation emphasizes this.  It is also pretty poor at covering dark circles (again, it sinks into fine lines when you apply enough and doesn't cover if you apply too little).  I seriously started thinking about switching when fine lines would show up only when I was wearing this foundation.  My skin has always been dry but now I feel I need a more moisturizing foundation to prevent dullness.  The shimmer in the BE foundation was increasingly starting to look ashy or chalky more frequently than radiant.  It might sound silly, but I almost feel I'm ending a meaningful relationship.  We were so good together for so many years, but it just isn't working anymore.  I am sorry to have to move on."
1,"I normally don't purchase eyeliner sense I always come across ones that aren't black enough. They are almost always watery black. So when I read reviews of this, I was intrigued to try it out and they weren't lying when they say this eyeliner is BLACK. The point is also very sturdy, so it is easy to control how you move it instead of it doing what it wants to do. I am a newbie at mastering the winged eyeliner and this has helped me out with that. The one thing I will say is that it might be impossible to go for a very thin line sense the brush on this is quite thick. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try something new, liquid eyeliner wise. The shipping was fast and the price is really reasonable. can't go wrong here."
1,I've been using a Grapeseed and Castor oil combination as part of the oil cleansing method for a few weeks now. I haven't seen a miracle improvement like others claim but I will say that this Castor oil arrived quickly and in excellent packaging. It does cleanse the skin very well and I am pleased with my purchase! :)
1,"I love Udderly Smooth lotions. I'm a fan. Maybe a more purse friendly size tube would be nice. It's thin but it moisturizes well. Scent-free. Still, I'm still more of an avid fan of L'Occitane Shea Butter Hand Cream. This is heaps cheaper though. I just happen to like the rich creamy texture of the L'Occitane better."
0,but once I got it it looked reddish so I couldn't use it - beware buying dye since when I tried to return itit came up as &#34;hazardous waste&#34; material and not returnable.  I have several of these colors now I have to throw out.
1,I love this product and I have done research to get outside reviews.  It is so smooth and feels like it's working when I apply it. It truly nourishes the skin and I will continue to buy it long term.
1,If you have had any treatments or not this is a good product for skin care. does not cause my sensitive skin any problems
1,"Aaaah, the delightful aroma of lavender...I just love it!  Avalon Organics has the delightful aroma of lavender with a hit of cinnamon, which is the warm component to the cool, refreshing lavender.  I love this lotion and it is gentle on your skin.  The price is reasonable and this is a gift that keeps on giving.  It makes a wonderful gift idea."
1,This color is too light for me. It really does look like clear nail polish. If you're looking for something a little more pink and still polished try Essie Sugar Daddy.
0,"I wanted to like this, I really did. I ordered Black Coconut expecting a natural coconut scent that would take me to a warm and tropical place and was convinced it would take me there from some of the reviews about this particular scent.It finally arrives and I excitedly open it and take a whiff and.. it smells synthetic. REALLY synthetic. I'm talking Glade plug-in air freshener synthetic. I was highly disappointed at how synthetic and artificial this smells! Because it was an oil, I was expecting it to be composed in a more natural scent (especially because coconut oil exists!) but this literally smells like a coconut version of car freshener and you know you can't expect a natural scent out of those.I received this roll-on three weeks ago and tried to give it an honest chance by wearing it on my wrist and allowing it to heat up (as Egyptian Goddess taught me, a little heat can create magic!) but even when my body warmed it up and let ts scent disperse, I was seriously far from impressed.If synthetic scents are your thing and you don't mind an artificial coconut scent, then I'm sure this will be for you. But in my case, I find this smells terrible. I suppose I got what I paid for considering how cheap it's priced..:(***COCO MANGO***I ordered Coco Mango and Black Coconut and received them 3 weeks ago in the mail. While I was seriously disappointed with Black Coconut, Coco Mango was definitely the winner of the order. It's great in comparison to Black Coconut but to be honest, the scent by itself isn't impressive either. You can smell the scent of artificial coconut in this roll-on, but mango isn't exactly what I smell along with it. I warn you, the scents are quite artificial so you may not receive what you're expecting when it comes to scents from natural sources like fruits and flowers.The scent is.. sweet, but overly sweet. Sickly sweet, if that's a good way to describe it. It's also very strong so if you get this, I recommend using it sparingly. I honestly don't really care for the overly sweet scent (and this is coming from a fan of Aquolina's Pink Sugar! Irony!) so I either use it extremely rarely and sparingly or not at all.I suppose I can't really roll with this roll-on because of how synthetic it smells; when it comes to smelling nice, I want to smell natural, even if the scent is far from natural- unnaturally natural! But when I used Coco Mango and Black Coconut, I felt like I smelled like one of those cheap car air fresheners you get while paying your gas money to a store clerk.I wanted to love Coco Mango especially in comparison to Black Coconut. But it has not wowed me. It's.. decent.I had way better success with Egyptian Goddess, though!"
1,"Okay, maybe I can use the 5 rollers when I travel, but I really wanted to get 4 Jumbo rollers to replace the extra jumbo (too large!)rollers in my other set that has 12.  (Now I have an extra one and heat it up too!)  This was the cheapest way to do it.  Conair hot rollers are as good and maybe a little better/faster/reliable than all those really expensive sets out there.  I have gone back to using hot rollers as these velvet covered rollers seem to protect my hair a lot better than the fancy curling irons.  And, I can do something else while they sit in my hair and they are a lot faster than a curling iron... (Of course, I grew up rolling my hair every night/day with about every kind of roller made... but these sure make my very long hair look really good... and that came from a professional stylist who commented on my ""do"" and the great condition of my hair... so, yes, I really like these Conair hot rollers! :)"
1,"Recently my allergies have been out of control, and with my symptoms it has meant that I've been itchy... all over.  Even my scalp has been itchy. So I decided to change shampoos. In particular, I was looking for a shampoo that was free of scent of unnecessary chemicals.Looking through all of Amazon's offerings my eye landed on DHS Clear Shampoo and the good ratings other customers had given it. And after dithering and consideration I went ahead and made my purchase.I'm pretty happy. I've have used it twice now and while I'm still not entirely itch free elsewhere my scalp is no longer irritated.  I credit the lack of perfumes and colorants and other chemical for my present state of happiness.Definitely recommend you try this if you have an irritated scalp. I saw definitely improvement after the second shampoo.  I'll come back and modify the review after I see how it effects my long hair --dries it out or not."
1,"great nail polish , this and china glaze r the only polishes that go on my nails , yes , i am spoiled"
1,"Daily used in the shower. I also use it on my face. Love the scent, and it helps to control my acne-prone skin. It does not make my skin sensitive."
1,I love ALLLLLLL of Aussie's hair products. but this has to be my favorite by far. it leaves your hair smelling amazing and helps keep it manageable.
1,"This is my signature scent. Not too cloyingly sweet, yet not too 'old person' smell. It's subtle enough to not overpower you yet pretty unforgettable once you smell it. My gripe is that it doesn't last very long, but every time I spray it on myself or pillow before sleeping, the effect is just wondrous."
1,"I needed a clarifying shampoo that didn't contain sulfates, so after reading reviews on various sites about avalon's lemon shampoo, I decided to purchase it. I used a bit of this in preparation for my Aphogee Protein Treatment, and it really cleansed my hair without making it feel stripped. I'm guessing what I got was a new formula because the label looks a little different than what I see here. I believe they added in more essential oils. Nothing bad...It smells really good too!"
1,very nice scalp scrubber/massage brush.  Made of strudy plastic.
1,"While I'm not a medical expert and can't comment on the product health wise, I can tell you my experience. I tried the Konsyl for Balance with Psyllium fiber and prebiotic with insulin fiber which is for everyday digestive health. This helps control constipation, diarrhea, colitis and IBS. Since this is already an orange flavor I figured mixing it with orange juice would be a good way to go about trying it. This definitely was a good idea considering I could hardly tell I had added anything at all. As I already said, I can't really comment on the health benefits too much since I hadn't had any recently problems *knock on wood* with my digestive health lately, but I can tell you that it's easy on the digestive system. I didn't get sick or have cramps after using the product, which I'm pretty sure is a good thing. Best part of this product though, if you're pregnant it is safe to use and if you're diabetic it's safe to use as it is sugar free and gluten free! So if you fit in either of those categories this is definitely a product that may be beneficial to you.READ FULL REVIEW: [...]"
1,this product is so good it feel so good on you face it not heavy. its very light. i can see a different in my skin.i will buy it again. on amazon
1,"It does not smell like sesame oil at all, which is good. Not like the smell of food. It actually has a very pleasant smell.  Oil is not too thick.  Nice to apply after a bath, but you can also put some on the tub when relaxing. Wife and I are using it especially more often during the winter.  It helps you to stay a little bit warm.  Helps your skin to keep it from drying.  Not bad to use for massage, but kinda expensive for that purpose."
1,"I'm giving it 5 stars because this clips do the job! I was looking for a small, nice and tight clip for pin curls, and this clips are awsome, are light weight so your curls doesn't drop down (like using regular aligator clips), also for a great price! Just Love it!I recommend this product if you're having issues setting up your curls!"
0,"Let me preface this by saying that this does not work with hard water.  I'm pretty sure others have mentioned this, but since it's the primary reason for this review, I have to say it again.  I gave this shampoo bar 2 weeks.  During that time, my hair was somewhat thicker, but it was also constantly filled with static, and just seemed really dry (which is weird, because I normally have oily hair).  The fact of the matter is that SLS was pretty much created to work well with hard water--and it does.  I pretty much have no choice but to continue to use my regular shampoo.  I'm sure this shampoo probably works great with soft water, but since I don't have soft water, I can't really say.  I only know it didn't work for me."
0,"I was excited to get this toner because I've heard so many good things about the Thayers face toner. I cleansed my face and then put some on a cotton ball and applied it and it set my face on fire!! I didn't understand because it's all natural ingredients, even pure Aloe Vera which is soothing and isn't supposed to burn. Witch Hazel is also soothing and it has all natural ingredients, even the Rose is a natural fragrance not like the fragrances they put in all other kinds of products. So I called Thayers and they said that it should definately not burn your face at all and could be counterfeit. I let the seller know about this and they are looking into their supplier. You have to be very careful about the counterfeits on here as I ran into some already."
1,I having been using Rosemilk since I was teenager to keep my skin soft after shaving. The rose prevents follicle bumps better than ointments like Bikini Zone and smells wonderful too.
0,"Really strong. i am 28 and this smells like what I think my grand kids will say I smell like in 40 or 50 years, when i have kids and they have kids. I'm not mad I bought it but it is more musk than anything else."
1,"This worked really great on my nose piercing, I used a ear gun to pierce my nose and have been getting the little bump next to the piercing all the time, once I started using this product I never got it again, I use it twice or three times a day, morning, midday and just before i SLEEP, it's really great and I will buy again"
1,"I love the smell of this facial cleanser - a refreshing orange scent that wakes you up (and is nice even at night!).  But I really started using it because it met my criteria for ""healthy"" beauty products.  This product has no parabens and no sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates, and it is compliant with the EU Cosmetics Directive (much more stringent than our own FDA regulations for chemicals in beauty products.  It is not, in face, a completely organic product, though at the top of the ingredient list are organic lavender, chamomile, and white tea.  A small amount lathers well, and my face feels so clean after I use it.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is that it does contain benzyl alcohol and some other ""unnatural"" compounds, but this will still remain in my rotation."
1,"This night cream is amazing!  I love it because it keeps my sensitive skin moisturized and nourished without leaving it greasy or icky.  It always blends in smoothly and my skin looks refreshed and renewed in the morning.  Honestly, this has helped my skin to look younger as well. Plus, a little goes a long way, so this is an extra great value!"
1,"I love this stuff. My wrinkles have &#34;faded&#34; and folks have been asking me &#34;what are doing, your skin looks so good!&#34; I've started using this plus drinking my water every day. It works!"
1,Retinol is one of the best over the counter anti aging ingredient. RoC is one of the best brands that have retinol in them. I have been using this product for about a year now. Make sure you wear sunscreen regularly. After using a few nights I have to skip a night else the skin becomes very sensitive because of the cell turn over. I definitely feel my skin is better now than what it was in my early 20's. (I just turned 30) The skin is smoother and more even toned.
1,"The GOOD:-No nasty smell/taste-Coverage lasts a long time-Excellent sun protection-SUPER moisturizingThe BAD:-Low melting pointLet me start by saying, this is the best chapstick I've ever used. Hands down. No questions asked. This stuff rocks!It applies very easily and smoothly. Unlike some others, it's not too thick, but also not too slimy. There is absolutely NO smell or taste, which is preferred by me. I used to apply chapstick about every 45 minutes, but this stuff keeps me covered for hours. It healed my chapped, sunburned lips in about 3 days and has kept them healthy for weeks. No more dry, cracked, chapped lips. The only bad thing is it seems to have a lower melting point than some of the more common chapsticks. It's never completely liquified on me, but if I leave it in the sun, or take it with me on a run it starts to get kinda squishy.Recommended: Absolutely"
1,So this is definitely a sheer VERY sparkly white. It is so pretty! If you do a few coats it looks like your nails are pearls! Very pearly white. I also used black shatter on top of it and it makes this polish look almost silver (which looks FABULOUS together). I like this polish much more than I expected to!
1,"Formula 2 is what was suggested to me by a manicurist - hopefully to give some strength to my easy to break, thin nails.  That it did.  I carefully followed the instructions to first use it every night than reduce to every other night, then remove, and start again if necessary.So, I'm happy with the results but not with the use.  First this product has a tendency to peel, which caused me to ""touch up"" even though the directions advised not use more than once a day.  It is also very difficult to remove.  The best success for me was to thoroughly dampen a cotton ball and then hold it on a nail for at least 45 seconds to soften the protein.Also, while the bottle is attractive the lid is a good one inch in diameter, which may be the reason why it detached itself from the brush portion after the second use.  Ever try applying a nail polish or treatment by holding just the top part of the brush?So, i give this product an A-  for results but a C- for attendant difficulties."
1,"I have been struggling with scalp issues since I was a child, and T Gel is the only thing that heals and prevents itching and redness. I love that it is offered through Subscribe and Save- much cheaper than the store and I'll never run out!"
0,Burned my skin intensely. This product SUCKS. IT has so many irritating ingredients in it. My dermatologist looked at the label and said no wonder you have contact dermatitis. She showed me that there are proven scientific studies that show ingredients like fragrances and lavender oils used in this toner actually CAUSE irritation which later causes wrinkles and think skin. THAT IS NOT WHAT I WANTED! This went right in the TRASH!
1,"I like the feel of this! however, it is causing some redness around my eyes! Not sure what to think of this yet.."
1,"I was hoping for a more solid color when applying it. I tried it last night and the color is so thin, so you would need a special base coat to get the exact color as it shows in the bottle. Not a  huge fan of this color and wish it were more bold. When I applied just one coat, it was too light, so I just took it off and used a completely different color."
1,Good adhesive for eyelashes and body jewelry. Does not irritate the skin or eyes like some products do.I will continue to use.
1,"I bought this product based on a BBC documentary about products that really work in reducing fine lines. Thankfully I have few lines, but figured it was good to get on top of the game, and I also liked the fact that it offered UV protection which is the number one reason for getting lines in the first place.I like the way it dispenses and feels on my skin at first, but I noticed that it does not get absorbed quickly enough for me. I consistently sweat the stuff off after applying it. I think it's just too greasy and thick for me. I usually have dry skin, so you would think it would be perfect, ...I will finish what I have of it and then go back to my Boots No.7 Protect & Perfect."
1,Feels refreshing Im not sure if its evening my skin tone yet but I love the smell and it does remove left behind dirt well.
1,"I just got this and proceeded to wash my face after a long day at work.  It definitely has a scrubby feeling but it's not like a brillo pad or anything, rather, you can tell it's sloughing off dead skin.  I'm going to keep using it, carefully (as in not scrubbing my face too hard) and hopefully it will make my skin even nicer than it is - which is a good thing at any age but at 45, I'm extra grateful for that."
1,I have been using OLAY REGENERIST for about 10 years and without a doubt it is the best anti-aging product for the price.  I just turned 60 and everyone tells me that my skin looks like someone who is more like 40.  Can't recommend this enough. I stopped being ripped off years ago by not buying into all the hype about expensive products.  It just puts more money in the cosmetic companies and less money in my pocket.  This is as good as it gets!
1,"I've never been into hair styling products, but I really needed help with my longish, layered, curly-like, hair. I wake up in the morning looking like Rod Stewart and it would take soooooooo long to try to look decent. Or I'd just have to put it up. Now it takes me under 10min. and the curls are so pretty. Very full and looks like I've worked on my hair all morning.It's fun to use too. I can't believe the difference. It was like magic... although I don't use that many tools so I'm no expert, but I love this one. It heats up quickly, the cord is long, there are a lot of settings, and it just works great!I think would work a little better on thicker hair given that it is a bigger barrel and the fact that it needs to have something to grip onto. Shorter, thinner hair may be more of a challenge. What's also a huge perk is that the large cap at the top is easy to hold onto meaning you're not burning your hands all the time.If you're looking for a product of this type you won't be disappointed. I like it a lot, if you couldn't tell."
1,"When I bought this I was looking for a flat retro red color. When this came at first i was disappointed that it was more shimmery than I had wanted, but once I tried it on, I fell in love. I'm forever looking for the &#34;right&#34; reds for my skin tone, and this deep, sexy blue-red looks amazing and the slight shimmer makes it more dimensional and classy."
1,"I started using the L'Oreal Advanced RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle Concentrate about six months ago because of my deep, long smile lines (hey, don't hate me because I smile a lot!) and my very deep forehead lines (I'm a mother, I worry a lot!). Although none of those lines got worse, neither did they diminish. About 2-1/2 months ago, I started using the Olay ProX Exfoliating Cleanser, Olay ProX Skin Tightening Serum, and Olay ProX Age Repair Lotion. The Olay ProX products have done a good, but not great, job so I decided I needed to try something else for the deep-set lines. Therefore, I started my usual Amazon.com search for products and their reviews. I came upon the RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream and, despite some of the reviews stating some scary results (burning, peeling, rashes, etc., etc., etc.), I decided to try it. I was very apprehensive because I have extremely sensitive skin, but I threw caution to the wind and ordered it anyway. AND I AM SO GLAD I DID! I ordered it very late in the evening on March 7th, it shipped on March 8th, and in the afternoon of March 10th I received it. I applied it that night and last night. I did not expect to see any kind of results any time soon because of how long I used the L'Oreal Advanced RevitaLift product without much change. I usually give a skin product at least one month before writing a review in order to give the product enough time to do its ""thing."" Well, I woke up this morning and, before I started my daily morning facial regimen, I noticed a marked reduction in all the lines on my forehead and the smile line on the left side of my mouth; these are no long deep-set lines. However, the smile line of the right side of my mouth is another story; IT'S ALMOST GONE!!! I'm amazed, shocked, elated, ecstatic, etc.! I purchased this on the Amazon.com subscription plan, so it was not even $10 (extremely less than any other store's price). I used such a little bit of the product and it's done in two nights what the L'Oreal product couldn't and didn't do in six months! As I stated above, I have extremely sensitive skin and was extremely fearful I would experience one, some, or all of the adverse reactions others have stated in their reviews. But, hallelujah, I have had no burning, tingling, sensitivity, blotches, redness, rash, etc. whatsoever, NONE, NOT A ONE! Thank you, RoC, for a product that actually does what it claims and for not charging an arm and a leg for it!!! I highly recommend this product and will be ordering another one right now so I will not run out! You should do the same."
1,I love Olay total effects. I use it every night. I am 74 years old  and I get a lot of compliments about my face skin texture.
1,"I originally purchased this after getting a Clarisonic. The face wash that came with it was great, but a little pricy, and everyone recommended Philosophy... but it was also too expensive.I knew I wanted a gel based cleanser and Aveeno is usually great on my very moody skin. This was perfect! It's hard to tell by the packaging, but yes, it is a gel.I have combination skin and this has really helped even everything out. My redness is gone (also with help from the Clarisonic). It's consistency and the way my skin feels immediately after rinsing are really similar to the expensive, department store brands.One of my favorite parts: I used this daily and it lasted me for several MONTHS. I couldn't believe it. You really only need one pump, maybe two.It's definitely an inexpensive partner to a Clarisonic system, but an absolutely perfect face wash on it's own. I'm usually not brand loyal in this area, but I won't be trying any others any time soon."
1,"Let me start by saying that I have tried every brand of permanent and semi-permanent hair colors with mostly disappointing results.  I have stuborn gray hairs that are very hard to cover.  I have been using 7r and 4n mixed 50-50 and it has covered the gray perfectly.  I left it on my new growth for 45 minutes and applied just the 7r to the lenghts for about 10 minutes.  My hair is very damaged, and Herbatint let my hair soft and without signs of further damage.  This is the most gentle hair color I have used.The reason for 4 stars is that it is difficult to find the right color. The colors all run very dark, as the pictures on the boxes show.  My hair is a auburn, medium to dark brown, and that is from using the Light chestnut color/ copper blonde color.  The color is long lasting, so try several shades lighter then what you want. Also, read other reviews, they have been so helpful.Also, you can get several applications from one box, so if you have your own applicator kit, (dye brush, applicator bottle, bowl! Etc.) it is helpful."
1,"I like this stuff. Smells so good. I also use it as a shampoo and it is gentle on my hair. Also makes it smell yummy! And, I use it as my bubble bath...many uses, great product."
1,"I had hoped this would impart more color on my hair and it doesn't really seem to do much at all that I can tell.  It does seem to give one's hair a little more substance,  but if your hair is fine like mine is it does seem to make it feel too heavy or dirty.  I thought it would also give it some body and hold, but the heavy feel pretty much counteracts that.  I will not buy again since it doesn't really seem to do anything I bought it for."
1,"Before you go running off to the doctor for those Botox injections, try Frownies, which also keep your forehead from moving, thereby lessening visible lines.  Specifically, the lines which I find these help to prevent are the long horizontal ones on the forehead and the two vertical lines just above the nose.  You just dab some water on the triangular-shaped paper patches, stick them on and wake up with somewhat smoother skin on your forehead.  If you work from home, you could also leave them on during the day, as long as you don't mind family members seeing you looking a bit silly with a triangle pasted on your face.  I imagine these would also be useful to people who receive Botox, to help lengthen the time they can wait between the costly injections."
0,"Colors and pictures there are some differences. Secondly, the paint is very hard to push. Not to mention even. Completely idle for the first time. Will never buy."
1,"I bought this brush to replace a similar one that had broken in pieces. I thought all roller type brushes were the same after trying a few types and brands. This brush convinced me there is a difference. I have no idea what makes this better or different but I noticed it the first time I used it to dry/style my hair. My hair lies smooth and dries faster.  Keep in mind, I'd just replaced a brush that was a metal barrel with openings, etc etc etc.  This one just works better. It was expensive but I won't buy any other brands now and will recommend them to everyone."
1,"Based on the fact that I'm currently using several anti-aging products, I'm not certain which are helping and which aren't, so I can't comment on the anti-aging claims of this product.However, I will say this: the product goes on without a greasy feeling and makeup is easily applied over it. Also, ""a little dab'll do ya"". Goes a long way."
1,"I just received this in the mail a couple of days ago and I'm already a huge fan.Like everyone else says, it smells like my grandmother. Personally, I love the smell but some of you may not; it sticks around for a little bit after use.Morning and night I have used this and I feel a change already. I have eczema around my mouth and I have to say that this is certainly helping it not be so dry. One thing I do have to say though is that it does burn my face. Now, I'm not docking a star for that because I feel like the outcome outweighs a couple seconds of a burning sensation. So, beware.Other than that I cannot say anything bad about this. I love the smell and what it does. Certainly have made a face routine with this and I can't see myself without it."
1,I bought this light color because it was at an awesome price and its a established product. I mix it with my summer (darker) foundation when applying and it works out perfectly.
1,I like this a lot.
1,"Covers well but still lightweight, dries matte but not cakey. Lasts all day, nice finish. You can layer it if more is needed."
1,"I ordered this Because the image shows a pump, which helps when U order a large bottle...NO PUMP is disappointing!  The scent is very light which I like and I know its a good product because my hair cutter uses it on my naturally curly, old, died long hair = its light weight and gives even my old hair bouncy curls + fights a little frizz"
1,Perfect color and perfect consistency.  It goes on nice and smooth and lasts longer than most lipsticks.  It also seems to have a little moisture in it so my lips don't feel dry when using it.
1,"Normally I avoid blush, I have enough natural flushing and don't want to look like a fever victim. I have very pale (NW/NC15) skin and copper/auburn hair at the moment.Very few blushes actually look good on my complexion, the NARS Deep Throat being a recent exception. I don't like smeary makeup and normally avoid cream blush like the plague, but lots of folks are raving about PENNY LANE and I had to have it.I applied this with the contour brush from this setreal Techniques Core Collection Setover my foundation, just lightly buffed it in. You barely have to touch the brush to the surface of the blush, to pick up any color. This color gives a lit-from-within glow, and is very buildable. For ladies who like the look of obvious blusher, this won't be for you. If you are of a mind that blush should look like a natural healthy flush of color, you'll like this. I'm not sure how well it will show up on darker skin tones. For me, it was love at first sight! I'll be going from once a week blush wear to every day blush wear! I even used it on my eyes and lips to try it out, and it imparts just a hint of color, very natural looking.It also doesn't fade, crinkle, or migrate! It lasts and lasts. I topped off my makeup with MAC Pressed translucent primer powderMAC Prep + Prime Transparent Finishing Powder / PressedLove this! I'd like to say it's a repeat purchase but this blush is so economical, I may never need to buy another again. I gagged at $28 for a blusher, but now that I've used it and see what a quality item it is, it beats any $5 drug store blush any day."
1,"I've used many Suave products  and I always tend to think of them as generic. Almost every product I've used has surprised me and has left my wallet in a healthy state.The Sweet Pea and violet body wash is affordable, definitely. It also has a wonderful but not overpowering Sweet Pea scent apparently borrowed from Bath and Body Works. While I've always like BBWs Sweet Pea scent, all their products have been far too overpowering, which this body wash isn't luckily. However, if you want to smell more Violet, this product probably isn't for you as I can't even smell it at all.This pretty pink body wash foams easily to wash your skin. I've found it feels nice and definitely leaves my skin soft and moisturized. My skin's softer than it has been with some pricier products; even my husband has taken notice.I also have some troubles with body acne which seem to not be an issue with this product, which is a definite plus.I'm not sure why I forget that Suave makes wonderful products for a great price, but it's always a pleasant surprise to be reminded of that fact as I was with this product that I highly recommend."
1,"I purchased Happy based on reviews of it here and from fragrance sites.  I've been using Estee Lauder's Pleasures on and off since they first introduced it, alternating with Philosophy Pure Grace and Amazing Grace, so my comparison is mainly between those and Happy.Happy is described a floral, citrusy scent, which is not exactly the way it smells on me.  I detected more of a synthetic sweetness to it, along with an almost grapefruit scent rather than the more rounded and definitely floral Pleasures and clean, fresh floral and powdery Philosophy fragrances.  I had a difficult time distinguishing the floral and citrus notes separately; from the time I put it on to several hours later and sniff tests from a friend, the fragrance never changed or warmed up enough to smell any differently than it did straight out of the bottle.  I also have dry skin and it's winter, and both could be the cause of the single-note results.Using the parfum spray alone and not layered with other related products like lotion, the fragrance was noticeable for about six hours on me based on my friend's nose; mine didn't detect it past an hour, which I expected since I only used a light application.  This is what I'd consider a day fragrance, it's a little sharp for my taste of perfumes for evening.Buying perfume based on others' recommendations is always a shot in the dark because what's the best scent on earth to one person is a horrible, sneeze-generating odor to another.  I didn't love Happy, but I don't necessarily consider it a lost cause.  I'm going to try it again in the summer when my skin isn't as dry and cold.If you have the chance, I would recommend trying out Happy from someone else or the beauty counter first to get a more accurate sense of what it'll smell like on you."
1,"I have no complaints about these hot rollers, I love them. This is the third set I bought. I bought one for myself and my sister and best friend kept borrowing it so I bought them each one for Birthdays and Christmas. I will never use a curling iron again! These heat up in 30 seconds and have enough heat to curl my hair in 30mins with really tight curls which my hair is down almost to my butt so it takes forever to curl with a curling iron. I would rate this item 400 stars if I could I love it!"
1,"It looks like lotion and has a mild scent, but I think the Loreal brand works a little better.  I'd still use both, as I just started trying this product about a month ago."
1,"I got hooked on using Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat because it not only dried my nails in under two minutes it kept my polish for about 5-6 days w/o chipping.  That fad didn't last too long seeing that my Seche Vite is thicker than usual and my polish will peel either the same day or two days later.  Without using the Seche Vite my polish will last about 5 days without chipping.  Unfortunately I'm in the process of teaching myself how to do acrylic nails and my nail beds are a bit damaged so none of the polishes I use for my nails will stay on my nails w/o chipping for about 2 days.  I needed another alternative so I read up on this CND Nail Stickey and the reviews it came with.  I purchased 4 bottles from eBay and this is my second time using this and the polishes I used this time(Wet-n-Wild and Milani) don't agree with this Nail Stickey.  I polished my nails this past Friday and have been touching them up since.  That's just how much my polish have been chipping.  I'm not happy about this at all. I polish my nails every week and post the tutorials on Youtube and I expect my polish to at least last 5 days w/o it chipping.  Maybe the next type of polish I use will work under this Nail Stickey because right now, I feel like I wasted my money on something that should work because it cost so high."
1,I really love how this product feels on my scalp. I really think it's helping to stimulate my scalp. I love it.
1,"This product was great for the price.  We use the buff pads every day, so I am sure that we will be ordering more from amazon again. It helps to exfoliate and make your skin soft and smooth."
1,I love this product.it works great for lashes either real or false lashes.The product came pretty fast too.thanks again.I will be buying again.
1,"Its good because it has a brush that is fine and delicate... it tends to get overly sticky though which disappointed me. I think they intentionally goofed up this new glue because when it first came out it was so fantastic, a pair of false eyelashes could last you a month with this stuff..... because its the glue that ruins them... but, as we know girls, the same companies make the lashes and the glue. Anyway I tried to outrun them and  I rushed to buy a half dozen of these before they realized they made a glue that was so good lash sales would drop,  but the formula was already changed.... profit before integrity: the american way... sad, stupid, but true.  Anyway... Its as good as any other lash glue. I still like it."
1,I couldnt find a peel off face mask in dept. stores unless it was just a one time application.  I looked everywhere. I finally found this on Amazon and it was reasonably priced so I tried it and I love it.  My face feels so soft when I pull the mask off and it will come off in one big piece if you want it to. They make my face feel so fresh.  I dont get this sensation with masks that you just wipe off with a washcloth. I will buy more of this.
1,"I use this product daily, as well, I mix it with my thick foundation for light sheer summer coverage. I have dry sensitive skin so this product has been perfect for me. I can't recommend a better daily facial lotion, especially for the price."
1,"I'm a product junkie.  I have bought every expensive cream, lotion, anti-aging product out there and spent tons of money doing so.  This cream is amazing.  Seriously!About my skin in case this helps:  I have very dry skin that is prone to break out.  I felt I had wrinkled prematurely because of sun damage so I was focusing mostly on the wrinkles when I bought products.  Often my forehead would be flakey and my chin would have breakouts.  Frequently I had red patches on my skin and a very uneven skin tone in general.Since using Cetaphil:  I have NONE of the flakiness and have not had one single break out.  Also, my skin looked more wrinkled than it was because it was so dehydrated.  Cetaphil has seriously taken ten years off my face and body.  Oddly the place that I can tell the most difference is in my neck as I don't have that crepeiness (Not sure this is a word!).  I've thrown everything away and have started stockpiling this stuff.I have NEVER had a product that made such a difference.  My make up now looks better, I actually glow and I don't feel like I look my age anymore.  I use it on my whole body and for the first time ever, I have an even skin tone.  I cannot recommend this highly enough."
1,"This is really great eye make-up remover. It doesn't leave your skin oily (even though many eye make-up removers are labeled &#34;oil free&#34; many still leave an oily residue on your eyes). Putting some on a cotton ball, closing your eye, and letting it sit on your eye for about 20 seconds loosens up dirt and make-up, making it so easy to remove.I like how light this formula is and how quickly it works.This is also terrific for mistakes. Dipping a cotton swap in it and wiping off the mistake is super easy. It doesn't disturb any make-up you've already applied, saving your time and work. I haven't tried it on waterproof make-up, but since it isn't specifically labeled for waterproof eye make-up I would try something that is. Awesome for removal of regular eye make-up - or even just lightening up that raccoon look."
1,I like this color on my nails. This color compliments my skin color and it goes with almost every outfit.
1,"This supplement tastes AWFUL!! I have to drink it quickly and try to ignore how gross it is. The texture is pretty unfortunate also.  It definitely does, however, what it claims to do. You pretty much cannot take it without knowing it'll work later in the day."
1,"I had difficult skin for many years before trying jojoba oil. This stuff is absolutely amazing, year round. Perfect for summer, winter, and every day. It's light, non-greasy, and leaves my skin feeling fresh and moist without any residue. I use it every day after I shower and it's the only thing that doesn't make me break out. It's also remarkably inexpensive, long-lasting, scentless, and natural. Highly recommended for anyone with skin issues or as a general purpose moisturizer for those with healthy skin."
1,"So I don't know, as I haven't heard back from her.  But when I do, I will be sure to let you know."
1,"I wear this to straighten my toes a bit. I can not wear this all day because it cuts off my circulation lol. If you want it to do the job, it was to be tight though, or else your toes will come back up."
1,"I have been using this cleanser for years now. I use it all year round without scrubs or any additional cleansers. On its own, I feel it does a great job of cleansing. Although it may not remove all the oil and grime, it does cleanse well compared to other deep clean cleansers."
1,"Many different ways to use this.As a toner after cleansing and before moisturizing.As a refresher (decant into a spay bottle and mist).As a cleanser (in the morning to awaken my face, I cleanse thoroughly at night).As a hair moisturizer (spritz into hair and then add coconut oil).As an anti-antiperspirant (it's an astringent, so spray under air before using natural deodorant, works fairly well in AZ)."
1,"I have oily scalp and hair along with being very sensitive. See my other hair product reviews.  I don't then obviously recommend it for oily hair otherwise it's okay. If you want better check my other reviews.  It definantly adds extra ingrediants unlike free and clear which some may  prefer- but, I don't."
1,"I absolutely love this oil.  When am at work at least one person compliments me for this perfume.  They usually say ""pachouli""  and the conversation continues.  They go on to say how they were as hippies, etc.  This was my first time ever using pachouli and I have gotten more compliment than when I used expensive perfumes.I will be ordering a second bottle in the near future."
1,"But I do not know if it gets rid of the main issue (whatever it is that you may have.)I used almost half of the bottle (it is small and even think a bit expensive.) The itching has subsided, that I have noticed."
1,"This cream is so moisturizing, and creamy. I use it on my face, neck, and d&eacute;colletage. It helps to soften the lines."
1,"desert essence makes so many great tea tree products. i love the pure oil. i use it for my face, as a feminine hygiene product, and as a blemish spot treatment. i NEED this product always it is a crucial cosmetic for me. it is best diluted with water because it is a very strong oil. i find it lasts a long time. just put a cotton ball on top, a quick turn upside down and run a little water on the ball. i'm sure there is an easier way but it works for me. (and honestly i like the burn so i dont always dilute it.) i really bought it at first because it was recommended as an acne treatment, and it was the perfect treatment for acne but there are so many other uses."
1,I have natural African American hair and using a wide tooth comb is a must. I tried two other regular wide tooths but they still pulled at my hair. Got this because the wavy teeth pattern seemed better for my curls and boy was i right! Works perfect and does not pull my hair out at all. Great if you have thick curly hair.
1,"I love this product.  I put it on right after I shower and so I don't have to apply lotion after that.  It makes my skin soft, touchable and non greasy.  Unfortunately, since it is a light formula, it doesn't last for a whole day so I do have to apply lotions that evening or night if I showered in the morning."
1,"I love this cream!!!  I bought it because Dr Oz recommended a retinal cream to stop the signs of sun damage, and although I am not ""wrinkle cream"" age, I spend a lot of time in the sun, so I am worried about sun damage.  On the Oprah website, they listed several that were recommended, and this was the cheapest and easiest to find, so I thought it would be the first I tried. I am so happy with the results, this is all I need to try.  Right away, I noticed my skin looked ""brighter""  hard to explain, but that is the only way I can describe it.  After about a week of daily use, my pores look smaller, and my face feels amazingly smooth.  I feel like I can wear less make up.  I don't have wrinkles yet, so I can't comment on that, but hopefully continued use will help prevent bad ones (I'm realistic, I know I'll get some, but maybe they wont be so deep)The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I feel that I need a bit more moisturizing on some areas of my face, so I end up using more that the pearl sized amount, maybe double.  I dont think the recommended pearl sized amount is nearly enough for most people with dry skin."
1,i love olay products because it works well.i ve been using the olay total effects daily moisturizer and the night cream for 3 months now and my feel feels good.this product cannot erase your wrinkles but it helps to reduce it.
1,"I've used facial flex for years, I gave one away, and lost another, which necessitated this purchase. With consistency and commitment you can keep a chin lift at bay! I use 16 oz bands, and twice a day, so long as I don't slack off on doing the exercises 2x daily, I've kept my result for years."
1,"I just brought this product yesterday at Walgreens for $4.29 and I love it. It smells great, it's a little sticky but it works. When I opened the top I wasn't expecting a clear gel like substance, I was a little hesitant at first but I followed the directions. It will dry fast so smooth it over your face fast and wait about 20 minutes and peel it off and then wash your face. 5-10 minutes is not long enough in my opinion and make sure to not put it on your eyebrows or sideburns because when your peeling it off it will be very hard to get it off your hair. If you do run into this problem do not panic just simply wash it off your face with warm water. Your face will be left feeling smooth and smelling great. The bumps on my face are smaller but not as noticeable but I will continue to use this product."
0,"This contains a bunch of soy, weird coating, and most importantly, did nothing for my hair.  Try the Phyto supps."
1,"This is the only sun screen moisturizer that I can find that features the physical combination of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide to provide true broad spectrum UVA/UVB protection without potentially harmful chemicals with adverse effects (like oxybenzone and octinoxate, which interfere with reproductive hormones and metabolism). Unlike chemical agents, physical agents are not susceptible to being absorbed into the skin after they are broken down by the sun. The product initially has a white tint, as if it doesn't have very good consistency, but this fades away within several minutes."
1,Not sure if its this product or the &#34;Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle with Retinol&#34; that is doing it but my 28 year old skin has more &#34;glow&#34; and people keep asking me what I use on my skin. I started out using just the Neutrogena night stuff but i kept hearing good thing about this product so now I use both.This is so light and it absorbs right away. No weird smell. I'd reccomend it.
1,"I used to have this brush until it disappeared into thin air one day and was never seen again. It was a nice brush. It was soft and applied makeup well. But when I was looking to replace it, I couldn't find it for less than $20. So I ended up buying an ELF alternative. It does the job just as well. So if you don't have a concealer brush and this one is still cheap on Amazon, go for it. But I wouldn't pay full price."
1,This has a bit more cream in it to soften your skin. Very close to the regular Regenrist in helping smooth out those crow's feet. This one you can apply to your all parts of your face/neck as you so desire !
1,I brought this for my daughter and the scent is nice and since she just started using it I can't give more info just yetbut so far so good
1,"I have been using this for years, love it, it is a mainstay as far as makeup goes, maybelline products are always good!"
1,"I use Reviva Labs 10% Glycolic Acid Cream as an exfoliant to help fade post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation on my acne-prone, dark brown skin.Reviva Labs 10% Glycolic Acid Cream is a lightweight, cream-colored, moisturizing cream. The oils  used in the formulation -- sunflower and safflower -- are non-comedogenic.Every other night, after cleansing and toning, I apply a small dab of Reviva Labs 10% Glycolic Acid Cream to my skin (avoiding the eye area). I do not apply moisturizer on top of the cream.After using Reviva Labs 10% Glycolic Acid Cream nightly for the past couple of months, I've noticed the following changes in my skin -- increased softness, increased smoothness, decreased pore size on cheeks, faster healing of acne and **decreased hyperpigmentation**.Reviva Labs 10% Glycolic Acid Cream works! It's a staple in my natural skin care routine. I buy it from Swanson Vitamins.FYI - You must use a sunscreen because use of glycolic acid makes your skin photosensitive. Also, use of glycolic acid is not compatible with waxing or sugaring as a hair removal method.Ingredients: water, 10% glycolic acid polymer (sugar extract & rhubarb extract), pumpkin extract, peach extract, sage extract, comfrey extract, chamomile extract, witch hazel extract, vitamins A, vitamin D, vitamin E, safflower oil, sunflower oil"
1,"I love this blush because it is light w/ just a hint of sparkle in it.  So nice and it lasts a really long time.  Gives me a great, fresh look."
1,"Moving to Arizona caused my skin to become dry, this product helps regenerate new and more youthful skin.  Great product to use with other moisture creams."
1,"I love this lotion- it stays on through a hand washing and it sinks in well.  However they changed the lid on it recently to a screw on lid (used to be a flip top) and I dinged it a star for that.  The new lid is VERY cumbersome (big lid, tiny hole to match up to the screw thingy).  I am always dropping them on the floor!Anyway the lotion is great if you are constantly washing your hands!"
1,"Love this lipstick.  It glides on, keeps my lips moist and the color stains my lips so it lasts for hours."
1,I purchased this product because I was looking for an alcohol free toner to use on my acne prone skin which is often dry and irritated due to retin-a micro.  This is a great toner which soothes my skin and does not burn or otherwise irritate it.  It removes anything that is left over from my cleanser (usually nothing) and preps my skin for the next step in my regimen.
1,"Always a great product. I have used them for years and I still love them. If you haven't tried them yet, you should."
1,"I have been using Great Lash Waterproof since the seventies!I have to curl my lashes and the waterproof formula won't uncurl them - the washable mascaras do.So going on 40 years of usage, I can highly recommend it!"
1,"I've been using this for 2 months. I don't notice much when I use this product.  It accentuates the darkness under my eyes, so I stopped using it there.  I also believe it was making me break out on my cheeks, so I stopped using it there too. It's moisturizing, so it's good for dry patches. I am in my early 30's and don't have wrinkles, so maybe it would work better for someone with different skin texture? I think the only benefit is the moisturizing properties, which I don't really need."
1,Soft and easy to use. It is just as described and perfect for applying powder (not just bare escentuals brand)
1,"This is really a nice value for the size and price of the lotion compared to other brands on the market.  This one smells of tea tree oil, so it must contain at least enough to benefit the skin, unlike some products that claim to contain certain things & have very little.I've been using this lotion for a while now and noticed my skin doesn't itch, become irritated & this has a cooling effect. I like that this helps to keep me from smelling bad in the summer heat, not to sound as if I have poor hygiene because that isn't the case.This product really has a clean scent, helps to keep me fresh and cool, doesn't irritate my sensitive skin and has helped clear up acne on my face.Couldn't ask for more with this product."
1,"Since my husband promptly stole my last foot file, I had to order myself another one and decided to try this brand. This is honestly the best foot file I've ever used and the idea of using diamonds in a file adds an entire new dimension of luxury to this item.The price seemed somewhat steep in comparison to other items, but then I figured maybe it would last longer than files that needed replacement files and maybe it wouldn't break as easily as cheaper plastic files. So, the advantages are a longer lasting item that works at least twice as well and the results are very apparent within five minutes of using this product. My heels could now be described as ""silky."" They are as smooth as satin sheets, almost unbelievably smooth.If you are a Spa Girl at heart, this product will completely impress you. You will also save money by creating your own little spa at home. This doesn't just remove dry skin it polishes your feet. The file rinses very easily, it's nice and sturdy and is very easy to use.This may be a 100 star product!~The Rebecca Review"
1,"This is my new favorite face mask! I don't know how it took me this long to finally try it! It smells really good, but feels even more amazing when it is on your skin! You get a nice clean, refreshing, tingly feeling. Not a burning feeling like some masks tend to leave. When you wash it off of your skin, your skin feels super soft! I definitely think that using this twice a week has helped to control my acne. I highly recommend this mask!"
1,"I have used this product on and off for years. I find it soothing and nonirritating. I do not know that it improves the appearance of my eye area, but it sure provides comfort."
1,"I just didn't like the feel of this product. I'm really sensitive to oily moisturizers in terms of how they make me feel. Although this did a good job in moisturizing, it left my skin and hands shiny, to the point where after putting it on, touching a doorknob would make the doorknob oily. If you don't mind a moisturizer that is a bit greasy, this is the way to go! The greasiness is probably due to the sunscreen in it."
1,I'm pretty picky about my hair brushes.  When I find one I like I'll use it until it falls apart.  I love this one.  The grip is fantastic.  I have fine hair and it works great.
1,Still learning how to use this. It's very strong - but has a nice lemony smell. Always glad of anything that repels spiders.
1,"I have been a devoted Neutrogena user for years and typically only used products in the Acne Wash line.  However, now that I'm in my mid-30s, I've been revamping my skincare.  I've been moving away from using face washes with salicylic acid as it just gets washed down the drain anyway.  I decided to try this product because (1) I tend to like Neutrogena products, (2) it's oil free, (3) it claims to remove makeup, and (4) it got good ratings from beutypedia.com, so I knew that the ingredients would be good for my skin.  Not to mention, it's CHEAP and I'd rather spend less than $5 on a cleanser rather than $15 or more.This cleanser is really really good.  It does a great job of removing most makeup.  I find that I still use eye makeup remover for my eye makeup first, but this gets off my foundation and most of my eye makeup residue if I use the product as follows.  First I wet my face with warm water.  Then I take a pump and rub it between my hands to get it to foam.  Then I rub it onto my face gently.  Then I rinse.  I repeat.  That's it.  When I apply my toner/exfoliant afterwards the cotton ball comes up clean.I haven't experienced any breakouts from using this product either.  Only possible negatives?  If you have dryer skin, this may be a bit drying for you.  With my oily skin, it's not an issue, but I think it could be for some people.  Also, contrary to claims, this can sting the eyes a bit.  Paula's Choice Hydralight Cleanser is gentler, but since this is cheaper, I prefer it!"
1,I used this for the first time last night. I have to say I'm delighted after blow drying and straightening my hair its really soft and smooth. I also purchased the keratin 2 minute restorer from aphogee so not sure if that also helped it as well. I'm pleased so far and will give more of a review after a few weeks of trying this.****Update: still loving this stuff! wasn't thrilled as first that it was a liquid but once I bought a spray head it has been really easy to use and good for my hair. makes combing it thru alot easier!
1,"I am not sure in 100% it really works for reducing acnes, but it is perfect to calm down skin stimulation after using microneedle on my face."
1,"This really helped deep conditioner absorb in my hair but if you leave it in the microwave just a few seconds too long it's ruined.  You have to heat it at 15 second intervals with a maximum of 90 seconds.  I know, sounds easy but I've gone through 3 so far and am going to try the battery operated one instead.  I'm hoping that the battery powered one heats more evenly as well."
1,"I really hate smearing lotion on myself, it's just not my thing, ya know... it absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a &#34;film&#34; of slime like a lot of other lotions do. I think I'm a special case when it comes to dry skin... I probably don't drink enough water, in fact, I know I don't!"
0,I am not a fan of this lipstick's consistency and formula. It easily feathers if you apply on slightly dry lips. I also have to layer it on because the formula isnt creamy enough and tends to slide off the lips. Make sure to exfoliate your lips well before applying this lipstick if you want good color payoff.
0,"I cannot use liquid foundation. I have tried tons of different products and everything I use, no matter how light, turn orange on my skin after a very short time. I decided to try tinted moisturizer and this seems to blend like I was hoping it would. This is not for someone who needs a lot of coverage. I have normal skin and I don't get acne very often so I don't need anything full coverage. I tried this and for the first 2 days I used it it seemed to blend well, I would still wipe some off after I went out into the sunlight, but I didn't have to remove all of it. This morning I put it on and it wasn't even on my skin for 5 minutes and I looked like I was turning into an oompa loompa. No matter how much I tried to blend it around my skin. Maybe I am destined to never wear liquid makeup. :("
1,This is a good product. I use it with the aphogee keratin 2 minute reconstructor and they work more than OK. I would recommend it for sure.
1,"I've tried many soaps for sensitive skin and find this product to be the best I've ever tried.  After my first use, I was surprised how clean I felt - even at the end of the day.  I also love the feel of my skin after I use it.  I have very dry skin and live in the SW, causing my skin to be even drier.  After cleaning with this soap, I didn't have to apply the layers of lotion I normally apply all day.  I was pleasantly surprised.  There is no fragrance, so if you need aroma therapy soap, this isn't for you.  If you have sensitive skin and want to be clean and feel clean and help your skin to be less dry, this soap is for you."
1,"I recently had a flare-up with red flaky skin around my eyes. I thought it might be from working out--sweat mingling with the styling products in my hair and irritating my skin. I only use premium hair products(Fekkai, Phyto, Davines, Philip B, etc) so I was not too happy that I had to give them up, but I was desperate. Then I did some research on Amazon and found Free and Clear. Well, it didn't help my skin condition, but I was pretty impressed with the products (styling gel and hair spray). The styling gel isn't sticky and gives my hair volume and shine. The hairspray holds nicely, but isn't stiff. I'll probably go back to my old products after I use these up, but I wanted to write this review because Free and Clear products really do a great job on your hair. So if you need hair products without certain chemicals don't be afraid to try Free and Clear--you don't have to give up nice hair for hypoallergenic products--and it might just work for you!!"
1,"Purchased another bottle of this lovely moisturing oil from amazon.com, and made by NOW Foods, apricot oil, 16 oz size, and really like this specific skin oil, I have purchased  it now a number of times as it is a light and refreshing oil for the skin and I use it with essential oils for massage and dry skin renewal."
1,I love this product.  Its great for facials or if you are stuffed up and need to clear your sinuses.  Makes your skin look good.  Be careful not to get to close.  Read the directions so you wont get a steam burn.
1,Pros:-You get a lot of product for the price-You really only need a drop or two to revive your dried polish-Makes my polish nice and silky againCon:-No eye dropper
1,I use this to tone down my gray hair - and it does the trick - just watch out you don't get caught in the rain - also apply with a plastic brush or comb = because the color does stain skin and is hard to wash off - the mouse itself is a good styling aid
1,"I have learned now (after my third clipper of this type) that you truly ""get what you pay for"". Not a bad product; does the job but it is NOISY !! You need to be diligent about lining up those adjustment blades with stationary ones- but all in all, good product for the little money you'll spend."
0,I found them too uncomfortable to wear for the entire night. i would find myself waking up in the middle of the night to take them off. They really hurt to take off. They left my skin dry where the strip was. Was not able to use them long enough to notice a difference.
1,this is a great little dryer. does what its supposed to do and for the price is perfect for occasional use!
1,Bought this for my husband as it is MY favorite scent on him and at such an affordable price!!  I will definitely by again!
1,this is the best cleanser i have ever used. foams great. cleans great. leaves skin feeling great. stocked up asap.
1,"I do like this scent but using it to burn for home along with orange,do wish they made a home use for burning scent,"
0,"This sponge is not up to the quality you would expect from a Silk Sponge.  It's just a tiny regular sponge, kind of rough in texture.  Good for scrubbing off dead skin, but not at all for delicate or sensitive skin.  Gave it to my husband who has oily skin, but won't work for my dry skin.  Really not a Silk Sponge at all."
0,Well.. this product made my hair have even more frizz.. it didnt hold a curl.. HMMMM not for me
1,"I have been using Jergens Face Cream for years. I wear face make-up every day, including mascara. And Jergens does a great job of removing make-up, even mascara. This is an important product if you want to get your skin clean before you go to sleep. Just put it on your face and wipe off with a tissue, and then wash with your regular face wash products.I also find the price of Jergens Face Cream costs much less than most other make-up remover creams. So it is economical to use too."
1,Looking for a simple neutral with a bit of shimmer lipgloss? This is it!! It beats MAC. NARS IS so much better!
1,"Even if you exclude the benefits to our environment this is a great product line.  I love it. It smells good, easy on my hands, cleans and degreases as well as more harsh products. I happen to like this fragrance so I have the counter cleaner and the hand soap in my kitchen."
1,The color is as expected. It goes on well and I'm happy with the purchase. The price is also comprable to store prices.
1,"I am sure it works anyway but I hate the fact that its so watery though I am sure a little bit goes a long way with the watered down type formula. Also I paid $10.50 Which pisses me off. I was looking for a cheaper price around  $7.00 and just now seeing it after purchasing it last week. Trust me, I couldn't find it for any less than $10 last week when I ordered. Anyway, its all good."
1,"I bought mine a few years ago. It's absolutely great. Even my kid (boy age 15) loves it. It's very therapeutic and relaxing.  I love steaming my face and then cleansing with a clay mask or using the oil cleansing method.  Very good buy and I don't feel the need to spend almost $200 for a ""professional"" brush. This works well enough for me and I am quite satisfied."
1,"I ordered this polish for what the salon used to call an American Manicure, which is more pink than the traditional French Manicure. After the first coat of polish, it was streaked badly. The polish was so thick, I couldn't get a second coat on the nail. I kept adding polish thinner, quite a lot ultimately, to get it to a thinner texture. It still streaked after the first coat, as well as after a second coat. I put the polish away for a few days but decided to give it one more try before giving up. This time the polish didn't streak after one thin, carefully applied coat, which was exactly the color I wanted. With one coat and a good top coat, it is a very natural looking manicure.After a lot of frustration adding thinner again and again to get the right texture and some time letting the polish meld with the thinner, I have the color and texture of polish I wanted. I will use this bottle of polish as long as it does not start streaking again, but I'm unsure if I will purchase another bottle."
1,For anyone suffering with Eczema or Atopic Eczema this productis the most &#34;FREE AND CLEAR&#34; that I have been able to locate.Would recommend.
1,"I purchased this soap and kinda tucked it away in my linen closet because I was using another soap in the shower.  I finally decided ""Hmm, I think I want to try to my Goat's Milk Soap"" -- and WOW!!!! It feels great, and the scent is amazing, I mean absolutely amazing! I will be purchasing this again when I run out-- I also have the Goat's Milk Lotion and it's also great!!!"

My skin was much more oily before I started using this product. Now my entire face is more balanced and not so dry in places.~The Rebecca Review"
1,"Let me start by saying that I did not use this product yet, but it shipped super late. I just got it today. Second, it didn't come in a box or anything at all, it was just a wrinkled tube of it. Third, it looks pretty big in the description photo, its very small though in real life.. I will be using this product and will actually REVIEW it in a week."
1,"I was a little disappointed when I saw that the ingredients were some kind of fancy, distilled, de-atomized water thingy, and rose oil. From what I know, real rose water is just crushed rose petals, so if that is something you need, don't get this.I used this to mix some crazy volcanic clay into a face mask so for me, I didn't crush me that this was not true rose water taht was crushed by a unicorn in eden. It smells nice and there's lots of it so that now I can do multiple facials and not worry that it costs an arm and a leg. I'd buy it again."
1,"I got this for our shower since we do not have space for a shelf.  It is great!  We decided to dilute the conditioner a little to ensure it flowed easily through the dispenser, which worked great, but we also did not try it without diluting so who knows - might work well that way as well.High quality item."
1,"I bought this for my son-in-law who dresses impeccably and travels. He has not used this yet, but It looked well made and I am confident it will serve him well."
1,"If you use this as directions say, and use it daily of every few days it really tightens up your eyes. A tiny bit goes a long way."
1,I am very sensitive and this has given me zero issues.  I used to buy a body wash and a separate summers eve wash for sensitive skin for private areas.  But this is all I need now.
1,Don't laugh. My wife has been using this for years and I tried it on my face for my drying skin.  Later I used it on my hair as a conditioner at night and the hair is not dry after shampooing and drying the next morning. Amazing. At Amazon prices you can do this. If I were buying from retailers the cost would be a little too high to do this although I still might since it makes hair shinny and easy to control without being greasy.  I know I sound like a girl. So be it.
1,"I bought this product like months ago and forgot to do a review on this product. I used to like this tinted moisturiser especially for everyday use when i'm going to school but now that I use a foundation I just abandoned this product. For me when using it with the Sigma F80 Flat Top Kabuki Brush you can get a full coverage finish, but when using it with your hands you get a light to medium coverage."
1,"was hoping for a little more color, wanted an opaque pink, its a frosty pink instead, oh well, its still very pretty, def wont go to waste."
1,"Once I figured out what product to use in my hair it was much easier to use. I have fine shoulder length hair. Even though my hair is fine I started using a clear styling serum. I need to have that &#34;slip&#34; so my hair won't tangle. I lightly misted my hair with water, applied  the serum and curled. I think most women could use this process to keep hair tangle free. I still have some trouble with some of my hair not releasing but that's just me. It gives me nice fullness and bounce. This isn't going to give you tight spiral type curls. The hair turns out more relaxed."
1,"My daughter just went to her first dental appointment and the doctor advised she stop sucking hey thumb immediately. We have been discouraging her from sucking her thumb for months but although she knows it's bad for her teeth and she doesn't want to do it, comfort prevails and she continued the bad habit. We bought her a book, showed her pictures of crooked teeth from thumb sucking, and tried to put colorful band aids on her thumbs. She liked the bandaid but eventually would pull them off and suck. I would even try to hold her down with her arms away from her face so she would fall asleep without sucking. I was hesitant to try this because I thought it would be cruel but after trying so many things, just decided to go for it. She liked putting the polish on and even asks for more but we only put it on her thumbs because the taste does come off on food and she still sometimes finger feeds.  It was funny watching her the first time she tried to suck and hard not to pretend something was different. Eventually that day she asked me to wash her fingers off. But we told her it would help her stop. And it did. I found we had to reapply once a day. I tested it on my pinky and it lost its effectiveness by end of day. She is sleeping now without sucking although it does seem harder to put her down because she doesn't have a comfort mechanism now. She asks for story after story.... But it has worked. I will continue to apply for another week to make sure she's weaned completely."
1,"I ordered this to try it on my acne, it was ok, made my skin peel from dryness but still remained oily and had pimples... just didn't make sense."
0,Works ok but takes time....just like many other products. Nothing special
0,"I remember trying this a year and a half ago. Essentially, it made my face red and burn, and small bumps appear near my jaw. This is most likely because it is a cream-based cleanser and it contains menthol, which is not recommended for sensitive skin (granted, I sometimes use Vick's Vapo Rub on the very rare cystic blemish, but it is always on a small space)."
1,"This was the very first product that I included into my new skincare routine and Thayers makes great Witchhazel products that I use on pretty much every part of my body. This stuff feels very refreshing on the skin and is not harsh at all, it gives no stinging unless I use a product like apple cider vinegar and calcium benzonite clay, then it gives a light stinging. Besides that, it definitely cleans my face and has significantly improved my complexion. I would recommend anyone to include this into their skincare routine since I use it for not only my face, but also areas of my body such as arms, legs, and neck making it a great deal.10/10"
1,"I've only been using the product for a week morning and night and can say that it works for its intended purpose that I got it for. Within two days I saw drastically reduced puffiness and after four the dark circles were diminished enough that I felt okay without makeup to cover my severe dark circles.Granted, they are still there a little, but it has only been a week. All in all, I say it works pretty well considering I didn't really have high expectations at all. I'll wait and see if it holds up over time.I don't have any wrinkles around my eyes yet so I can't speak for that part, but maybe it'll help keep them away."
1,LOVE THIS. I use waterproof mascara and this just wipes it off! My mascara will stay on my lashes for DAYS if I only use soap and water. Neutrogena loves my skin and lashes! This seller fast and efficient!
1,"I use this along with castor oil to clean my face (oil cleansing method) and I love it! It is more than enough oil to last a whole month, probably longer but I just started using it. Leaves my skin moisturized, I don't even need to use a  moisturizer."
1,this product can be a little strong in smell but its not harsh on my skin. it removes water-proof make up very well.
1,"i bought this because i don't own a purple polish. surprisingly, it's more of a fuchsia pink than purple to me, and i don't even like fuchsia, but WOW this color is amazing. I would have never bought a color like this, so this is a very nice surprise to me. It's probably my second most used color in my collection and everyone always compliments this color. I keep it on my toes just about 24/7."
0,"I didn't order this product from the seller, I actually picked it up at a local Walmart, they sell this product in a lot of drug stores and such too.It's in a nice pump bottle that you twist to lock and unlock it to prevent it from spoiling prematurely. The smell is actually quite pleasant, it's a clean fresh scent. When you pump it on your skin it's not runny, it's pretty thick. It's also has more benefits than any other western bb creams I saw at the store. (The highest amount of sunscreen and whitening properties)  It's very dry feeling so it's perfect for oily skin, and my skin feels somewhat moisturized after use.However.Like most Western makeup, this has an orange tint to it. I myself am pale, ghost pale. I have to mix my own makeup pale. (makeup forever's lightest shade is orange on me, the only thing that somewhat works is loreal true match in porcelain) It leaves my face very orange. This product is not for people who have trouble with fair to light make up looking orange on them.Also,  I don't like that is has glitter in it. At first I didn't notice it, I thought it was just a dewy finish, but when I looked back at my fingers they were covered in glitter.I feel like maybe if this matched my skin i would appreciate it more, because it doesn't break me out.If you're looking for a lighter western bb cream I recently tried macs new bb cream primer in light, and that blended perfectly and made my pores look smaller and face softer. It's a bit more creamy/sheer, but it makes your skin perfect to put makeup on and it really does make it look flawless."
1,"Wish it was a little more red, but I like it. I don't wear it too often because I'm more into matte, but it's okay."
1,"I have been using Olay Regenerist daily serum for 2 years now and I am very impressed.  For an inexpensive product it worked much better then expensive ones.  It goes on velvety smooth and in the morning when I wake up my face glows with a nice radiance.  It brightened under my eyes and made my face shine.  I tried other products to see if they would measure up to Regenerist but none did, they weren't even close.  I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a smooth youthful glow."
1,It's not helping me any in curling my hair. But it's very useful in touching up my hair. Straightening it and fluffing it a bit.It's a comb with heat. Easy to get your hair behave with it. So it's a 3 star from me.
0,"I have been buying glass/crystal nail files exclusively for years now.  I have one that is by far better than all the others and it still files perfectly, but I need more for other rooms of the house and have never been able to find it again, otherwise I would buy only that one exclusively (it is one-sided, white, and blue on the last third, with a metallic JB sticker on it).  Good ones last a long time and are smooth and don't leave a rough edge on your nails.I bought this Nail Tek one because I really like the idea of having a carrying case (sleeves are okay, but they get dirty and are impossible to clean inside).  This one was for my purse, and if it was good, I was going to buy more.  I am disappointed because the case is made of plastic and looks really cheap, and has some sticky residue still on it which won't come off, but my main complaint is that the case is so skinny on the inside diameter that this particular glass file is the only one that will fit (my others from other manufacturers do not, yet all other glass nail files are that size, not this size), so I will not be able to re-use this case.  And this nail file is just okay, not great.  It is fairly rough.  It does file the nails, but it should/could be smoother.  And why would a person pay this much for a mediocre file, when the whole thing is disposable, not refillable.  It might fit a short thin paper emery board, but I don't know, as I don't have or use that kind (they're not as smooth as the diamond/glass/crystal boards), and if you're looking to buy this style you probably are not interested in paper ones.  I also think that the price needs to come down (~ $13 is way too much).  Not worth the money at all."
1,I love this perfume! I had this a couple if years ago and all this time I had no idea its on Amazon.I'm so happy I can find it easily now! I just received it and it smells so soft and pretty...I really love this scent!
1,"We actually use this body wash as hand soap. It is gentle on hands and has a really nice yet not overpowering scent of lavender. High quality. Also, fast shipping."
1,I bought this in black & brown a couple years ago and am still using it.  Very happy with it.  I like the fact that I control the thickness of the eyeliner.  Would highly recommend.
1,i bought this to clean up the edges of my nails when painting. works great. it's not super absorbent which means that you wont use too much polish remover.
0,I bought this for use on my face which has really bad Rosacea. It made things much worse and really did not help with moisture.
1,"I'm just growing my hair out and I purchased this and two other colors.  I'm thrilled to be going gray...tired of all that dyeing, etc. This product gives a shade of white that evens out my colors while my hair is growing out.  And, it's a styling mousse.  I alternate between this color and #41 and #52"
1,"AHHH HEAVENS Oh my!This along with the day aha Souflee is a tag team duo fo POWER I cannot live without!SERIOUSKY, my skin color and tone and pores are now invisible, everyone tells me my skin is flawless with NO makeup on!I used this a week and souflee in day time and after first 2 dys I could see Difference AFTER a week EVERYONE can see the smoothness , even tone, helps acne scars fade too !!  I had one on my chin that is gone!Also took away one ketaris pilaris I think its spelled. Just get it , I love 12 % or higher as this is 12% ."
1,"This product seems to be making my fine lines fade. I only use it around my eyes and sometimes my forehead on the horizontal creases. I have used it almost nightly for about a month, and even though my sleeping has been less than desirable, my fine lines are definetly minimized. I am using this as a preventive measure (I am only 24 years old) so not sure how it would work on more mature skin. My one criticism is that it also seems to dry my face out slightly. This product is very potent with Alpha Hydroxy Acids(10%) which can cause irritation, photo-sensitivity and flaking. Research has shown that AHA can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, but there is little evidence to suggest long-term efficacy."
1,This product was purchased to mix with some others to make the correct shade of loose powder. It works very well.
1,"This cream/gel does not seem to cause my skin to peel. Love that. I can usually see results overnight. I don't really take the pills but have in the past and they seemed to be soothing - a little like resolving acid in the system. I don't know that's what they do, but, they do seem soothing."
1,"I usually use Sonia Kashuk's Remove makeup remover, but I ordered this since I couldn't get to my local Target and this had great reviews.  I love it!  It easily removes all of my makeup (even my waterproof stuff and my Urban Decay 24/7 eyeliners), and I don't have to keep going over each eye to remove all of my mascara.Some reviewers mentioned that this leaves a greasy residue, but I don't find that to be the case at all.  I use oneSwisspers Premium Cotton Facial Cleansing Pad, 50-Count (Pack of 6)total, and then add a little water to the pad to wipe away any remaining residue.  I no longer find mascara or black eyeliner under my eyes the next morning.It also doesn't irritate my sensitive, allergy-prone eyes or skin.Great stuff -- and it's a great price!"
1,"This product smells fabulous but leaves my skin feeling greasy.  I do love the fact that it includes SPF, but I think that contributes to the greasy like feeling. Though it doesn't have SPF, I've found that the daily cream works better than the moisturizer."
1,"i have dirty blond hair and this made it a naturally looking light blond.  no one suspected anything other than i had been in the sun.  obviously, like any bleaching product, it'll dry out your hair over time.  i keep my hair short, so that wasn't an issue.  if you have brown hair, i'm not sure what would happen.  this isn't for brown hair."
1,"I love Auric Blends perfume oils.  I have tried several different scents.  This one is currently my favorite.  It reminds me of Obsession (a Calvin Klein fragrance).  I find that the scent stays with me all day, unlike other perfumes I've tried.  Highly recommend this (and all of) Auric Blends product."
1,"The color is beautiful! The formula is a bit runny but everything else is great. Shipping was super fast too! OPI never let's me down, I'm hooked on them for life!"
1,"This hair color gives me the best shine my hair has ever had! It covers up my grays pretty well, and with the use of Pureology shampoo it seems like my color sticks around for awhile. It gives my hair a dark brown with a slight auburn color."
1,"I have used Ban de Soleil products since the 80s. They were the 'it' thing in the 80s. Remember the commercials?! This stuff is great. It really jump starts your tan for the beginning of summer, then I switch to Ban de Soleil SPF 4 gelee once I have a base tan and alternate back and forth. It's easy to use and doesn't turn you into Oompa Loompa orange. The only complaint I have, and it's not even a complaint really, is the scent. It's far better then most self tanning products but it still reminds me a bit of Play-doh! All the other Ban de Soleil products smell wonderful and every time I use them I think of all my summers at the beach when I was a teen."
0,"I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and it has absolutely made no difference. I'm Asian and I have acne on both my chest and back. It didn't make my skin worse, but nevertheless I am very disappointed in this product."
1,This color is absolutely magnificent and this review is coming from someone who doesn't like green nail polishes. It's slightly similar to China Glaze's For Audrey but without the blue undertone. It is opaque in 2 coats and it's oh so pretty!
1,"This curling iron is pretty good, but it does not have a strong enough spring to keep hair in place when curling. I have learned to correct this by hair-spraying the strands of hair I am about to curl. Then I clamp the hair under the metal clip about an inch or two up from the end of the strand. If you try to clamp your hair at the tip--it will not hold. You have to start an inch or two up from the edge to get it to hold. But if you do that, and if you hair spray it first--this curler can make some excellent spirals. I give this item 4 stars because it was basically the cheapest ringlet curler I could find. And this product does give me the curl I want, it just takes a little bit of finesse. But if you want something stronger and easier to use, look elsewhere."
1,"I was indicated these by my podiatrist and have been using them during the day for the past 2 and a half months to straighten out my 2nd and 3rd toe on each foot one and my 3rd and 4th toe on each foot the next; I didn't understand why my doc initially advised that the 3 looped one would be ""too much for me"", I found out later he meant ""too much pain at once""!My only flexible toe is the 4th, it hurts the least on that one, on the rest it feels like my bones are slightly or slowly breaking; PAINFUL!! When I take them off my 3rd toe is especially red on top, where the calluses of my hammertoes would be, again PAINFUL! Also, in the first month of use I got three blisters on the side of the 3rd toe on each foot and 2 more on the side of the 4th toe on each foot (8 blisters total); again OUCH!!!As you can imagine, in the last month and a half I've used it a lot less in an attempt to avoid the blisters. I use it a couple of hours a day and take them off. On the bright side, though painfully sore, my toes are straighter and more flexible the first few hours after I take them off and if a stop using them a few days my toes hurt as if returning to their hammertoe position; they seem to work. Another bright side, the pad provides wonderful relief of metatarsal pain from calluses or stress.Call me a massoquist but I just purchased a 3 loop straightner by Pedifix which I hope will be quicker n the straightening process. I also purchaseed a hammertoe straightner for the 2nd and 4th toes (by Footsmart) which I hope will be less painful and a single loop straightner to use on the 3rd toe (also by Footsmart). The pain of my hammertoes is simply greater and more permanent than the straightners, according to my podiatrist, this will be over in a year; I've lived with PAINFUL hammertoes for as long as I can remember. If you are like me, willing to take some ""short term pain"" to relieve long term pain this might be worth the investment. Just know the process is NOT gentle nor is the product gentle, as advertised. Hope this helps!"
1,"Lots of scrub for the price. I had been using another salt scrub but wanted to try this for the price and reviews look good. Boy, am I glad I did. For the past month, I had started to get white spots on my skin. The previous scrub did nothing for this. In fact, I booked a doctors appointment to have it looked at. Yet, I've used this scrub only 3 times and the discoloration on my arms had faded 70%!  My skin feel healthier and there is a noticable difference.  It's great to use before shaving the underarms, legs or etc as it prevents razor burn. I love this product and will be purching it again!"
1,"i really loved this color. its a nice, semi sheer, jelly finish. its a very hot pink (hence the name) very nice color. not as subtle as i thought it would be though. that's why i gave it only 4 stars. the shipping also took a while."
1,I add this to my lotions and liquid soap. in my spray dispenser to clean the whole house and floors mixed with a bit of liquid detergent/water.  the smell is fresh and clean and I always have some on hand.
1,"If you want to save your fingernails but still get a great scalp massage when you shampoo your hair, this will be the best .99 cent item you'll ever buy! You'll wonder how you ever lived without it before!"
1,"I have been using these wash cloths for about ten years. Great back scrubbers. They rinse clean and dry fast. Of course, I haven't been using the same one for ten years, but they do last a long time."
1,"I made this purchase from a recommendation and out of curiosity. I had been looking at it for a while and finally made the splurge. Off the bat I will say that this should be used as a top coat and not base coat. I found it to be not matte enough to maintain nail color stability if used as a base. It has amazing shine but over time the shine does dull and you may find yourself adding another coat of this to your nails to revive the shine or using a different top coat all together. It does harden your nails but maybe harden too much. What I mean by that is I used it as a base coat the first time I got it and then as a top coat with two coats of color between the two layers of this polish. I thought, wow, this is really strong. My nails aren't even bending. This is not good. You want your nails to have a little bit of elasticity on your nails just in case, say, you bump your nail on a door or table. If your nails are not flexible it will break, just snap off. This happened to me when I used just this product and nothing else. I got excellent elasticity when I used Sally Hanson Triple Strong as a base, added two coats of color, then this as a top coat. It was strong without the threat of breaking your nails. Because of that caveat I knocked a star off but it does do what it says, it hardens. Just try and be careful that you are using this with something else as well."
1,Using it mostly morning and night for my lips.  No other moisture needed during the day.
1,"I was skeptical about buying this given the fact I couldn't really see much real benefits to it, but boy am I glad I did! I use this almost every time finish washing or cleansing my face. It is a fantastic moisturizer! I normally don't like using creme or gel based moisturizers because my skin is a bit sensitive so this is a life savor. Also, it keeps my face nice and soft during this cold winter times in NY. I am not sure if it helps with acne since I don't normally break out, but I do get my occasional zits, however after I started using this in my skin routine I notices a dramatic difference in the amount of sudden break outs I get. It really does help keep a flawless look!"
0,I bought this hoping that the tea tree would help stop the dandruff and stop the flaking on my scalp...it didn't.  It also left my hair tangled after washing.  Would not buy again.
1,I wish to thank you for the timely replacement of the items I had ordered.The previous items had severe issues and you replaced those items quickly.Those items that came in this time were intact and had no issues.I highly recommend any individual purchasing from this company that you will be completely satisfied with their service and products.
1,"So in love with my conair curling iron. I have been using this everyday since I bought this. I have never had a curling iron with a clip, so I was wanting to try it. It heats up quick. I think the buttons are perfect, I have not hit them once while using the tool. Curling iron came in super fast, came in2 days before shipment date! It did take me some practice to use this. After the third time, I finally got use to it. Overall this product is fabulous. I recommend this if you want a curling iron easy to use, something that heats up quick, shipment comes in super quick, and for a great deal!P.S If you are interested in this product, but unsure how to use it; go on youTube and look up &#34;How to curl hair with conair curling iron&#34;. You can look up different styles as well. It helped me choose this curling iron. :)"
1,This color is very pretty!  I use it for water marbling.  This would also be great if someone wants a light shimmer effect this is the perfect color.
1,"Because I can't afford to use Opium bath gel, this is my second choice.  I keep a 32 oz pump bottle in all my bathrooms.It has a nice fresh scent that you won't tire of and won't fight with your perfume."
1,"I'm 48 with a history (thankful it's in my past now :) of hormonal chin acne and I have fair amount of dark circles under my eyes. I have an olive completion. I went looking for a hard core concealer and found this. Been using it ever since. I use Sand Beige mixed with some Carmel color quick fix. It covers VERY well. I will say that the quick fix is not as thick and is applied alot easier than the cover creme though the coverage is not as good. I would suggest that you first moisturize well before applying under the eyes for a smoother spread. I use mine under mineral powder and it works great. It's waterproof and has as your ""other"" make up wears off this stuff stays on so a good color match is a must. I highly recommend this product."
1,"I love this color when ever i decide to do black. This color is more of a blue black than a bright shiny black. The mixture turns a dark blue color when applied and developed. Although for Feria's version of blue black the color is still very shiny looking. You will not get a dull black using this brand and color. If your looking for more of a natural black or a jet black then you would definitely want to stay away from this color. Instead try using the color Black Leather for a more natural looking black. I love blue black hair for my ""Scene"" styled hair the two looks go perfect together when doing ""scene"" styled hair in a black color. There will always be some fading when using a hair color but with Feria i find that it fades only a little and its no big deal to do a touch up every once in awhile. In all my years of using this brand i have always been satisfied with its results. This color works best on Medium brown to dark brown hair to start for a more deep and darker black with a hint of blue for an undertone. Usually when starting with to much of a darkest brown to black color the blue will not always be noticeable using ""any"" brand which i have had that experience before too. In my opinion the color is very pretty and the brand never fails. When using dyes remember to always wash and rinse hair in lukewarm water to cold water to help keep colors from fading/bleeding. Especially when rinsing the dye itself out during application time. They tell you to rise the color out until water runs clear (DO NOT DO THAT) this step i do not do. I rinse about 10% of the color mixture out then use the conditioner and rinse some more. Your having to rinse your hair twice which helps fades color faster in its beginning process which can make hair seem faded faster and will fade easier. So don't rinse most of the color out during its initial application which is the most important in my opinion and it works for me. That way you still have a tiny bit of color left in your hair enough to extend the color and penetrate to keep your hair rich in color until you wash your hair for the first time. After dying i don't wash until a week to a week and a half later."
0,"Like many of the reviewers of this cream on here, I also have super sensitive dry skin & Rosacea. Thought I'd give it a whirl based on such good reviews & I can't fathom what people see in this cream. It is SO thick, greasy, & clumpy with the consistency of ""butter"" (even looks & kind of smells like it). It does work for super dry skin if you enjoy your face feeling like you have rubbed Vaseline all over it & having your face stick to your pillow at night..YUK..My Dermatologist recommended CeraVe cream to me which is also quite heavy but nowhere near as bad as this cream. I've used a few other Eucerin products & they were all like this. Guess I should have known better. I really disliked like product.**Just a little update here**-I've read some people use this as a hand cream (I guess due to it being quite thick) so I gave that a whirl & it does work great for dry/cracked hands & I now use it for this only, just wanted to add something positive!"
1,"I purchased this product after falling in love with a similar oil at another store (that I ultimately didn't purchase due to the high price). I was pleasantly surprised to see that the quantity of this was much larger than I had expected. It smells great and applies easily due to the roll-on top. It is a very delicate, subtle scent, which I was looking for, but it seems to fade right away unless covered by some clothing. I dab this on my wrists every morning and usually by lunch time the scent is undetectable unless I bring my wrist right up to my nose. Still, you can't beat the bargain."
0,"I typically use Burt's Bees shampoo and love what it does for my hair, but not for my scalp (dry and itchy). I purchased this shampoo to use on occasion to prevent the itchy scalp it seems to cause. Plus, I love the refreshing tingle of tea tree shampoos.Let me just say, I honestly felt like I was being dipped for fleas the first time I used this product. It has a horrible chemical odor...EXACTLY like pesticide. I tried a few more times to stomach it, but just can't do it. Plus, you would think it would at least tingle a bit, with it smelling like Raid and all, but nope; NADA.Also, if you are looking for a shampoo that is organic with no SLS...READ THE LABEL! This product is not what it is marketed to be."
1,"The flavor is nice. My daughter seems to like it, and I personally tasted it and enjoyed it. The texture is off, however. Its too thick compared to the kids toothpastes we're used to. It might just be me, but its pretty hard to get it evenly distributed on my daughter's teeth.It'd be nice to see a flip top lid, as well. The current lid is a screw off lid (with a metal tub! I haven't seen that since the early 80's!) and its just kind of hard to juggle an ornery, hyper kid and load a toothbrush while having to screw off a lid at the same time. Its a minor complaint, I know, but its important to me."
0,"It was difficult to choose which of these Clearly Natural soaps to purchase, but I finally settled on honeysuckle.  I don't use bar soap anymore, body wash or shower gel tends to be my preference, but I was drawn to Clearly Natural because of the cost and the fact that it claims to be a natural glycerin soap.I've used the unscented glycerin soap and I like it, but this one?  I'm just not sure.  I'm not sure that it is as pure and natural as it is claimed to be.  It was extremely drying and somewhat harsh on my sensitive skin.  It is a brilliant yellow, which indicates a fair amount of dyes in it.  And the fragrance?  It is a bit too perfumed for my liking.  Honeysuckle is supposed to be a light floral scent, but this soap is scented strongly.  I can't explain it but it is migraine-worthy.  There is no humectant in the glycerin which also left me an unhappy camper...and I don't like to write bad reviews.  I thought glycerin soaps were meant to be soothing and gentle, but this one is just not my favorite by a long shot.I definitely won't repurchase this soap in honeysuckle, but maybe I'll try the aloe vera one.  As mentioned previously, I also like the unscented version because it contains no dyes or perfumes.  The unscented one is clear/transparent and full of natural, skin-loving ingredients unlike the honeysuckle one.  The packaging is somewhat eco-friendly and at least the product is inexpensive so even if you don't like it, there will be no guilt about throwing money away."
1,"I got this thinking it would make large curls, but my hair is too long and straight for any curls this iron produces, to stay.  I should have remembered that large curls just don't stay like small ones on my hair type.  BUT I got something even better that I wasn't expecting.... I use large hot rollers to sometimes add body to my hair and give it a slight wave.  That is what this curler does for me now.  I love it."
1,Works great to get Cover Girl Waterproof Mascara off and to me that is a great accomplishment
1,"Omg this lotion has helped my Keratosis pilaris skin condition! It has helped smooth out my skin and reduce the ""chicken skin"" look on my arms and legs. I am extremely happy with the smooth feeling skin and the reducing of the dark marks on my skin. I wish I had used this long before now. I still have a few bumps pop up from time to time...but it is dramatically reduced. I use it twice a day...morning and night. I hope it keeps helping! :-D"
0,"The photo of these is misleading.  I thought these were the long ""professional"" hair clips my hair stylist uses at the salon to pin my hair while blowing drying (section it out and pin it).  These are ""useless"".  They are way short, and ""tiny"" so I cant even use for other things.These are barely useable for a childs hair/head.The box doesnt even list the length but these clearly are not the super long, tight clips I was looking for to keep my hair from falling and to keep it easily clipped while blow drying.I am sending these back."
1,"I had been using Preference Intense Red Copper, but as I've passed 40, that looks a bit too orangey and Crayola-ish on my medium brown hair (less than 5% gray, but my face can't handle such bright colors right next to it). The Lightest Auburn is a nice option because it still lightens and brightens quite a bit-- it's definitely a red, not a reddish-brown-- but the undertones are more natural. People think this is my real hair!"
1,Love using them to massage my scalp with this oil. My hair look healthier after the care. It is another treat I do for myself in my favorite bathing time.
1,"What a difference!! I feel like a new person. I would highly recommend to anyone who feels pre-menopause symptoms. If you're not sure if you are pre-menopausal, do a little research, it's well worth the time."
1,"I love the color pink so I couldn't pass this one up. It's not a neon hot pink but a darker hot pink. If you google images of OPI's specific colors you can get a feel for the accurate color. I've had an issue with a couple other colors not being what I expected but now I will always double check when ordering. This was exactly as pictured, however. HOT pink and FUN! OPI lasts forever on my nails too. My nails outgrow the polish before they ever get chipped or nicked and I'm not sedentary. Their formula has also strengthened my nails so now they grow longer and harder. Well worth the cost!"
1,"The color comes out true to the picture, which almost never happens with other hair colors.  Also, you don't get that chemically smell afterwards like you do with so many other hair products.  It leaves your hair in great condition.."
1,I bought this to replace the cetaphil moisturizer I was using and I am pleasantly surprised.  I wish it had a better fragrance but it gives my skin the moisture it needs.
1,"Bought this after seeing it won some beauty award and I was looking for a nice neutral pink. It is pretty but it very sheer, like clear nail polished classed up a notch. Pretty, but nothing special. No problems with chipping etc."
1,"My dermatologist recommended Vanicream products after I came in complaining about severely dry skin that was itchy and red compounded by cold winter air and a move to a very desert, dry climate. At this point, I was rubbing my whole body full of thick foot cream and still not getting relief. The results of Vanicream were instant. My newly clear skin is silky soft, superbly moisturized and I use every single one of their products quite happily."
0,"I recently had my hair styled and thought curlers would help me maintain the style--unfortunately the curlers were too small, they really didn't heat up as fast as the instructions said they would, I also had trouble making sure they were connected to the heat source--the casing is just too floppy for that I think--also, I didn't like the pins--the curlers kept on flopping around on my head and just weren't hot enough to do the job.  I returned them and will stick with a curling iron."
1,Skin feels softer and looks healthier.  Was having a problem with using products that were breaking me out.  This is not breaking me out.  Will continue to purchase.  Thanks!
1,"love this brush.  it's just the right size to carry in my purse.  it's perfect for my twa. the bristles feel great on my scalp, firm but not too hard.  it defines my little curls.  when my hair grows out, i will be ordering the larger size for my dressing table."
1,"I like Alba products. We always try to use organic products around the house. This soap smells very nice. However, it was leaking inside the box when it arrived."
1,"I love Essie polishes because of their strength. They may take forever to fully dry, but once they do they make your nails really strong. This color is pretty sheer, so keep that in mind, but it's a really beautiful neutral polish."
0,"First I don't like the pump container and it just did not suit my needs.  I am 67 and have sensitive skin so I need a moisturizer that will work, this just wasn't what I needed."
1,"Being thirty, I have tried everything for my combination sometimes dryer in the winter skin! I am prone to breakouts even before that time of the month. I am even more prone to breakouts when using harsh cleansers or even changing products to frequently. In the past year I have received four big cystic acne bumps and I am still trying to recoup from the scarring. After reading all of the better reviews about Cetaphil products and googling at the Cetaphil products at my local drugstore but opting for the fancier more expensive, well known facial cleansers - I am here to say that Cetaphil is the one brand that I trust most when it comes to my face and the rest of my bod! Being more concerned with my somewhat sensitive skin (After stepping out of the shower and sudsing my face with yet another harsh cleanser or even my shower bar of soap, my face was beet RED!) I have read that using a benzoyl peroxide zit cream or even benzoyl peroxide as an ingredient in a cleanser will kill that bacteria on your face which that nasty bacteria can lead to breakouts! So when I spotted this bar of cleanser that stated it was antibacterial (without benzoyl peroxide which on the bad side will cause early signs of aging on your skin - Bleh!!!) I have tested and tried it, even sometimes alternating with Cetaphil facial cleanser and what a difference! My skin this past week has never been in such better shape nor clearer! I am sticking to this and for 4 bucks I recommend trying it out for those of you who are prone to breakouts and cystic acne. Give it a shot like I did you may never go back to your regular acne cleanser!"
1,"I have chosen becouse it was recomanded by my friend.I am satisfied, It is good but not perfect.Yes i would recomend the product if you cannot afford  expencive one."
1,I'm still on the hunt for the red you see on the starlets and I still can't seem to find one I like.  After the second coat this seemed to go darker rather than brighter which is what I was hoping for.
1,"i love this makeup remover. i literally run it through once or twice and my waterproof makeup melts off. i've tried high end makeup removers from MAC and sephora but i end up having to rub my face multiple times with those products to get my makeup off.i actually use this all over my face lol it does the job. it does leave a little residue behind but i always wash my face after using any type of makeup remover. all that matters is that this product does not irritate my eyes or cause me to break out. i'm always switching to different products but always come back to this, or the wipes, they're both amazing :)*side note, when it says ""oil-free"" it just means it's made with lab created oils so it will less likely clog your pores and cause less acne. remember that all skin types are different so everyone will have different experiences."
1,I have finally found the perfect product! I have used for a week and my face is clear! I have tried so many products and it seemed they only made my breakouts worse. I will never buy anything else after using this. It only takes a drop so will last a long time. I highly recommend!
0,"This product has turned out to be a big zero for me.  In 2 1/2 months I have not noticed even the slightest improvement as I did with my previous product.I didn't give it one star because it has not caused any negative results, just no positive ones.  A big waste of money for me.  :("
1,"I have fibromyalgia and there are days when even taking a shower is too much.  Raising my arms over my head for the amount of time it takes to shampoo and condition will make my arms ache for the rest of the day.  This No Rinse Shampoo has been a godsend!  On the days I really must shampoo (I can mist my hair the second and third day after I shampoo), using this is perfect.  It makes my hair fresh and scalp clean.  I don't know how it works without having to rinse it out, but it doesn't leave it feeling sticky or full of residue, either.  It gives me one extra day of rest and that's important for some of us!Tip:  I would shower and shampoo normally the day after using this, however."
0,I have asked 50 dermatologist about this lotion.  Not one of them knows what it is! It was hard for me to believe anyone recommended this lotion. I saw no hydration. Absolutely none! I have very dry mature skin. Save your hard earned money!Don't spend it on hype!
1,This body wash is awesome. Skin feels so good afterwards and smell lingers after shower. I love all aveno products!
1,"The Colloidal Oatmeal in the Aveeno Products is the reason I keep buying them, even if I'm not overly excited about smoothing petrolatum over my skin.I wish these products were all natural. I have noticed the oatmeal has a calming effect on my skin and the addition of Lavender, Chamomile and Ylang-Ylang is emotionally healing.The minute you put this cream on your skin, you can feel the difference. Your skin becomes calm, soothed and smooth and silky. Perfect for after a shower or during the day when you need a calming moment.~The Rebecca Review"
1,Smells fantastic. Use it all the time!
1,"I was seeking for a new liquid make-up remover since oil make-up removers did more harm on my acne prone skin. I was worried if this will break out my face worse than it already is, but thank goodness it didn't. It was gentle enough to not to sting my eyes either. You would have to wash the face twice to get the make-up completely off. One facial wash won't just cut it. Besides, I have always double washed my face anyways, so it wasn't a biggie. You need to understand, I've used other cleansers that still left me with foundation residue after I swabbed cotton balls around my face even after washing several times. That totally overdries your skin. My face isn't dry at all right after I'm done with the wash too. The price is absolutely resonable. So far so good. This is my new favorite cleanser."
0,"It contains Phenoxyethano. Look it up folks, it's extremely toxic.  It has no Parabens but it has that which is MUCH worse!"
1,"I bought this because it is 98% natural. Nothing wrong with it. Scent is light. However, Earth Friendly Products Organic hand soap costs much less & just as good."
1,"I don't own one, but my hairdresser uses one in my hair.  I commented to her how nice it felt on the scalp.  It gives a good scalp massage and not at all abrasive like some brushes.  I will purchase one, now that my hairdresser has me on to them."
1,This cream is very moisturizing but feels kind of greasy for me. I wouldn't buy again because I haven't noticed and special changes in my skin.
1,this is an ok product kept my face moisterized but a little on the pricey side for the size and the fact that it's a pump not too keen on the pump thing.
0,I was disappointed after all of the good reviews I read. I just didn't find that this made any difference in my hair at all.
1,My 4 year old still sucks her thumb. The first Mavala we had gotten from the dentist but it kind of got used and old. This smell is awful and the taste as well. I believe this product works. Be careful when using on small children because for the first time I tried it in the evening and my daughter was throwing up that night every time her thumb ended up in the mouth. It is a good idea to try it during the day first.
1,"I've bought so many cleansers- clarien, Clinique, lancome, Kiehls, cremes, liquids, wipes,etc.  After all these years with all these products I'm back to the one my mom and my aunt used all those years ago - and it works, and it's great."
1,I love essie polish! This color is so fun and is so pretty! I use it as a base and accent- everyone needs it!
1,"I absolutely love this eyeliner.  And here is why.  I've started wearing make up pretty young. However not until 3 years ago was I able to start using liquid eyeliner.  Not sure why, but I always had trouble with eyeliners particularly liquid. I always had to just limit myself with the pencil or wet eye shadows and angled brush.  I'm not even sure why it was such a challenge for me.  I guess the brush applicators were just way too soft and I have never had a steady hand, and my lids I guess you could say a bit wrinkly.  So all in all no matter what I tried liquid never worked for me, the end result would always be disastrous and I would have to start from the beginning.  That is until I watched YouTube video tutorial where the guru showed eyeliner that is perfect for beginners and the brand was Prestige.  Thinking I have nothing to lose I bought it next day in the pharmacy, and have been using ever since!  I believe what is different about this particular eyeliner is the very stiff brush with soft ending.  It works pretty much like a pencil, except its liquid!I also own this eyeliner in dark brown and icon color, which is like a mix of burgundy and purple.  The color payoff for all 3 is really great.  It takes some time to dry, I would say at least 30-40 seconds depending on the thickness of the line.  Of course this is not expensive name brand eyeliner, so it probably doesn't last as long.  However it'll definitely stay on for at least 6 to 7 hours and I always have it on me to reapply.  All in all this is very good eyeliner for a small price.  100% recommend!"
1,Great product and doesn't irritate the skin. It's fun for body jewelry and other things that you would like to temporarily attach to your skin.
1,"This is one of the first products I bought when I started my Healthy Hair Journey last year based off the recommendation of Ateyaa on youtube. I had never used a leave in before and boy it makes a difference!! One time I skipped this step when washing out of pure laziness thinking that it would not make a big difference but I was proven wrong. My hair was dry and straw like. Since my bottle is almost empty, I will definitely be ordered one in a few days. This is a GREAT product!!"
1,This toner smells divine!!! It's so relaxing and is perfect after you cleanse. Just a few light spritz and you're automatically refreshed and ready to moisturize. This product is also great for a refresher/moisturizer on a hot day and to set makeup! It's all around amazing! Great delivery and customer service!! Thanks!!!
1,I really appreciate this product as well as others in the Mrs. Meyers line. Effective and environmentally sound.  Smells great too!
1,"I wish I had gotten a 1 1/2&#34; iron because I do love this iron, but I like larger barrels."
1,"This is a nice, light night cream.  It has a pleasant fragrance, that is barely noticable and fades quickly.  I like the way the cream feels when I apply it, like my skin is saying ""aahhh"".  The cream soaks in quickly and is not oily or sticky at all.I can not give it a higher rating because I did not find it to be effective at firming.  In fact it did not leave my skin as hydrated as other products I have used.  I will finish my jar, but will not repurchase.I am nearly 60 years old with fairly dry skin and I must need a need a more emollient product.  I think this one would work well for younger people."
1,"No hardly!  This is waaaay too red...if you,re looking for a clow n look, then this is t!!!Writing on my. New tablet is challenging!!!"
1,"I love this !  I usually wear strips of fake lashes but I tried out individuals and I loved it they stayed on my eyelashes for 3 days , until I took them off, there easy to take off but if I wanted them to stay a few days longer it would last !  The only thing is the glue is watery so it can shoot out if u squeeze to hard lol"
1,"Avalon Organics: Lavender Ultimate Moisture Night Cream, 2 oz. If you like lavender, than this can be your modest treasure that you will love and be thankful for. I love the smell of Lavender at night, and this one is just right, not too heavy, or oily, but if if you are more on the oily side do use a face wash in the morning. The smell of lavender is soothing and light. It did make my skin smooth, but I was not looking for any special benefits, just moisturize and aroma, and I got it, love all the Avalon lavender products!"
1,This is a very good product and really works to eliminate discomfort. The subscribe and save discount makes the price excellent.
0,"I have never tried henna before but by all accounts this is definitely not real henna. As a reviewer said above, it did not stain anything at all, the instructions on the box are poor which implies to me that these people are not real henna sellers (says mix with cold water-- no measurements at all-- whereas other, better henna products tell you to use a specific measure of warm tea water). I used the tea water anyway left this on for two hours and when I was done spent twenty minutes washing all the DIRT and rocks and sediment that was left in my hair. this stuff sucks and the Colora company should be embarrassed to sell such a mockery of a product. My hair was not in ANY better condition than when I started..."
1,"I received a small sample of this cream in a shipment from Amazon.I have one very rough elbow. The left one is okay but the right one has very dry skin. I was afraid I might be getting psoriasis. It wasn't it was just very dry skin. I tried the Atopalm and it worked!  I could not believe it, I had tried every other thing I could get my hands on before, even olive oil,and argon oil and the only thing that works is Atopalm. My Hubby has very sensitive dry skin on his face and I put it on him and it really helped. I recommend it to those who have tried everythingl I know it is is expensive.But just give it a try. You will not be sorry. Don't expect a magic overnight cure, give it a few weeks and you will see. We like it so much we are on autoship so we won't run out, we only use it on my elbows and my hubby's face. It works, it really does."
1,"I don't like heavy foundations, at all. I've been trying to stick strictly to bare minerals, but in the desert heat that I live in it's impossible for the minerals to stick to my dry skin. This moisturizer is the perfect remedy! The coverage isn't total, but that's what I love most about it! It minimizes flaws so you don't look like you're trying too hard, it really makes your skin look natural. The light reflectors are nice too because they give my skin that youthful dewy look. I tone it down a bit with my bare minerals powder, but it's nice to feel like your skin looks healthy, and that's exactly what this product does.Also, I never felt that this moisturizer was too thick. One pump gave me total coverage and spread really easily. They only had medium in my store, and I have fair skin, but I still found it to blend really well with my skin color. I love, Love, LOVE this product!!!"
0,"The smell is so bad and it honestly reminds me of moth balls, which I cannot stand.  I was recently diagnosed with Guttate Psoriasis, and only have a few small patches on my scalp.  Decided to try this stuff, bought it at a local grocery store because I had a $2 off coupon.  It seems to help a little, but honestly, I just can't stand the smell.  Along with the smell, the shampoo makes my hair feel nasty, not greasy or dry, just weird.  When trying to style my hair after using this, I have really bad results.  So if you have very short hair and don't need any body in your style, this may not be a problem for you. If you can stand the smell and the bad hair style, go for it.  Would never buy this again and I try never to waste stuff, so I may try what one other reviewer suggested and mix this with another shampoo, to help hide the smell.  I am doubtful that it will work, but may give it a try."
1,"I found out about this on youtube as well natural hair care community, and I have not used it yet but I am sure it will be great for my hair."
0,"When I was beginning to look into cold creams a while back, I came across this because of all of the raving reviews about how excellent this product was. Upon looking closer at the ingredients though, I changed my mind. There are formaldehyde agents in the formula--which is something that anyone should avoid (unless you are a specimen about to be preserved in a jar)."
0,"I bought this product as a whim. I am 23 years old with combination skin and the unrealistic wish for microscopic pores. However even with this wish, this product really didn't do much except sit on my self. The suction makes rings on your skin but doesn't take anything out no matter how much you steam your face. Don't waste your money on something that I promise you won't work."
1,I was looking for an aloe vera product that would mix well with other oils for a body lotion. This does the trick. I also use it in my hair as well. It goes on easily and mixes well with other products. I am almost out and will purchase again. I think this is a good price for an 8 oz bottle.
1,There is a special about this product. It is just a long makeup Q-tip that's all. It's just ok nothing special
1,These are fantastic for make up application and corrections.  These help people like me fix all the mistakes I make when initially applying make up!
1,"I would like to start off by saying that I did not purchase this item from Amazon, however I will the next time but in BULK!!!  I was in a hurry to get some hair color.  I typically go to my local beauty supply store and I get some hair color to mix with my developer and then I color away.  It has worked fine but I keep trying different brands hoping to get a DEEP black color that lasts.  I have yet to find such a thing until now!  I've tried several types from the beauty supply store but this time I walked in and went up to the sales girl and said, ""I NEED a black color that will stay and I want it to be very black, what do you have?""  She offered me two kinds with Bigen being one of them.  I was skeptical because it was a powder that you mix with water but the hair swatch was so beautiful and the sales girl told me that it would last and it WAS very dark.  So, I bought it.  It was on sale for 3.00 a box and she suggested two boxes (which I've never had to do), but it was fine.  Then I got home and chose to color immediately.  Logic told me there was NO way that the color was going to work well with a brush in the little plastic container they give you, so I pulled out one of my coloring bottles and I poured the powder in and then used the plastic container to measure the water and I used both boxes as directed.  I shook it up and went for it.  There is no stinky smell, it wasn't messy and it was quick!  I washed out the dye, dried my hair, and instantly fell in love! I'm sold forever!  My hair is just past my shoulders and layered.  Next time I will not use two boxes, because I had to toss out a lot of it in the end.  I will more than likely use a box and a half, which should be perfect.  Great product, great price, easy to use...PERFECT!!"
0,"A few years back Frownies came in a sort of wing shape, and it was almost perfect for placement between the eyes.the current ""shape"" is a triangle, which makes no sense at all and has to be cut to fit the area.  The edges and points of the new Frownie come loose.  So far, after a month, I've seen no difference in the look of the wrinkles between my eyes, but when I remove the Frownie in the morning, there is a red patch which takes awhile to resolve."
1,"This oil is great for skin and hair. I've yet to try and cook with it. I've not been able to find this one here at our local health food store, so it was nice to be able to order this here.  I will reorder again, the price is great as well."
1,"CONGRATULATIONS. you are a winner!! What a wonderful gift to of found this!!! Say goodbye to dry skin from face to feet. Wow, pretty amazing stuff. SENT FROM ANGELS!welcome to pure silk!!!!"
1,Smells good holds well is easier to apply and I can take it with me and spray it when I need it. I'm sticking with this one it makes hair soft shiny smooth silky and it smells amazing. Really good for long curly hair. :D Im buying more tomorrow.
1,"I recently switched to Maybelline Full n Soft after using Dior mascara for the past 5 years.  This product is reasonably priced and is fantastic.  My lashes still feel soft after applying 3 coats. Love, Love, Love this product."
0,"This product seems to be doing its job, my skin is soft and smooth and feels great!However the downside would be the smell of this product.  It's not horrible... just unpleasant.  The offensive odor doesn't linger overly long, it's mostly gone within 15-30 minutes, but it really takes away from the enjoyment of this product.I also purchased the Alpha Hydrox Night Replenishing Cream, which has almost no odor at all."
0,"I have been using this as advised for over a month now. It says 2-3 times a day on clean skin. Somedays I use it twice, some days I used it three times. I have not seen any even slight difference. Don't waste your money."
1,The best nail polish remover
0,"Nope.  Purchased it a couple weeks ago and every time I've used it, about 5 times, it has made my eyes burn and water.  Like the bestseller and highly-rated Maybelline Great Lash (in the pink and green bottle), this also burns my eyes.  I've read many reviews of the Great Lash, and this happens with quite a few people.  No idea what ingredient(s) are doing this, but consistent every time, and it doesn't happen with my L'Oreal mascaras.As far as the rest of its performance, I find this to be nothing special.  If it truly made eyelashes full and soft, I'd be happy, but I don't notice either of these things.  It seems quite sparse in what it deposits on the eyelashes.  I did a test with L'Oreal on one side and Maybelline on the other, and both felt crispy once dried.I do like that the brush is fiber, and not hard plastic like so many are nowadays.  It goes on easily and comfortably, though I would prefer the wand to be curved and longer.So all in all, there is nothing here to recommend, and all the other minor points become moot, because burning is not acceptable.  It claims to be hypoallergenic but it is not."
1,"I have the pleasure of having both aging skin and adult acne and this really covers both bases quite well.  I use them only in the morning because I found I actually got MORE breakouts if I used them twice a day.  The bonus of using them in the a.m. is that they're a great prep for make-up.  They get off all the little flakes and dead gunk and really prime your skin for moisturizer and then base.  I saw a noticeable reduction in breakouts and zits that do occur heal more quickly.  In addition, I think over time they soften and reduce fine lines.  I'm menopausal (yippee!) so I'll continue to have issues until my hormones settle but this has helped control that annoying hormonal chin acne that many women get.  Another tip - they'll last four months if you cut them in half so it's also a good deal in comparison to other high-end designer skin care products."
1,"This is my wife's analysis (I am a male and do not use these products); she says it is her favorite hair color product; it does not damage hair, and it gives her the color that she likes.  It is the only product that she uses to color her hair.  She says it is really difficult to find this product in stores, so being able to get it on line makes life simpler for her.  (Do you have that feeling that I am only the middleman in this review?)"
1,"Of all the products I've used over the years, this one has the most dependable and long lasting coverage.  Fortunately, I already knew what color I needed after trying various ones in a department store.  Although they had all the samples to try, they didn't have the color I wanted in stock so was glad to find it here.  Since the coverage is quite complete, it is important to have a good matching color.  For spot coverage, I've found the Everything Pencil is excellentJudith August The Everything Penciland easily portable in my purse, but for coverage of a larger area where you really want to 'erase' the discoloration, this stuff is great.  It provides flawless coverage and with the suggested dusting powder, it lasts all day.  I only use it on problem areas, not all over, and even with the dusting powder the coverage looks natural and blends perfectly.  It does not accentuate pores as some products seem to.  In fact, it minimizes them.  I have sensitive skin and have to be careful what products I use, but I have no problem with this product.  One extra advantage is that if you're covering a scar, the SPF 30 increases protection over what most products offer.I've laughingly said my skin color is 'foundation sample beige' since free samples in gift kits always seem to match, so the fact that I use 'true beige' in this product seemed appropriate.  The old name, Chroma 2, was pretty hard to remember so I'm glad they've switched to more descriptive names.  If you're in doubt about color and don't have a nearby place to try samples, I've found a slightly darker color is easier to blend than a color that's too light."
0,"I had high hope for the brush but as soon as I tried it, it caught my hair and pulled it out!!! OUCH!!! I have medium length hair and it would get caught in the handle. I returned the item."
1,I use it as part of my obagi nu derm regimen & I love it. It makes my skin feel squeaky clean but doesn't dry it too much. I also use it when I'm off the regimen.
1,"I've used this 1-2 times daily for over a month or so with no noticeable change in my wrinkles, but I like that it doesn't irritate my skin as other moisturizers tend to do."
1,This is my second iron from Revlon. I love it with the thick plastic ring at the end of the iron which leaves enough space for my fingers to turn the curler without burning my hand. I love it
1,"This is the greatest mascara formula I have ever tried - because of this, I've been hooked for over 10 years. It makes my lashes very full, and never crunchy. The price on Amazon is much better that what you'll find elsewhere - even at Walmart.  Buy in bulk.  It will save you money down the road."
0,"Touts itself to be an antioxidant sunscreen, but the only 2 ""active"" ingredients listed are the usual sunscreen things. How it's supposed to be antioxidant is beyond me. Would not buy again."
0,"I have pretty sensitive and oily skin, and it burns so much! I usually love Neutrogena stuff but this is bad!"
1,Exactly what I pictured and more!! It's bigger than I thought it would be and they aren't kidding when they say fast long lashes cause the mascara brush is wide and huge! I'm very happy with this and I'll be buying from this seller again forsure!
1,"I saw this clay mask at CVS and it had a rebate thing stating ""Try For Free"".  I gave it a try because I love free products.  This thing is actually good.  I have watched Youtube and saw reviews here that say this thing is wonderful.  I might have to agree with everyone.  It applies like a regular mask and after a few minutes, it dries up and you wash it off and voila, you'll feel great afterwards.  I took off one star because this mask does have a strong smell that even for a non-sensitive person like me, I would like for the manufacturer to chill with the scent.  It's a strong smell of baby powder with a tinge of hair perm??  Some of you guys might disagree but personally, that's what comes to mind when I apply it  on my face.  Overall it's not bad of a product because I do feel my face being cleaner after use."
1,"I have used this product for many years, get many compliment on my hair color.I highly recommend this product"
1,"I have no talent using a round brush and hair dryer, but this hot air brush combines the two into one.  What a great way to style your hair and I love the rubber brush.  This is much better than bristles that do not hold my hair or just get tangled. Plus with the two temperture settings I can start with high and finish styling my hair on low.  I no longer have to risk heat damage to have perfectly curly hair."
1,"IT IS  GOOD,  NATURAL, ECONOMICAL  FAIRLY  SMOOTH ON MY SKIN  AND  LOTS OF BUBBLES.  SMELLS NICE BUT NOT LONG  ENOUGH  THE SCENT  GOES AWAY QUICKLY."
1,These lashes look very natural. No dramatics at all. Great for daytime looks. I have very light lashes and these give me the lashes without anyone knowing I have false lashes on.
1,"I am particular about my hair and have to carefully find the correct brush. This is the best, and I recommend it because of its quality, durability, price. This is a good brush."
1,"This soap is super as are all of Palmer's products.  It really smells delicious, is creamy and makes your skin feel pampered. Because of his job, my husband showers twice and day and he loves this soap.  We live in the southwest and the climate is harsh on skin.  This soap keeps it with a more &#34;normal skin&#34; texture instead of dry and flaky."
1,"Most lotions I try somewhat sting my hands or leave them feel almost soapy. Aveeno, on the other hand, always meets my expectations in quickly absorbing into dry skin and not leaving any greasiness or tingling. This stuff definitely works as a basic lotion for everyday use and I'd highly recommend it if you're fed up with other types."
0,sometimes i try to do reviews as soon as i get the product but in this case i am happy i waited a while.in the beginning i was definitely going to say this is a 5 star brush.it was sturdy in my hand and managed my bouncy thick hair without too much fussing so instead of just using it to blow dry my hair i made it my number one brush and pushed aside all my other combs.now only a few short months later i wish i knew where my combs got to :(i have not used this brush 10 times to blow dry my hair and now almost 90% of the bristles have lost the tips-making it a pain to use.i wish i can find a better everyday long lasting brush.
1,"The brush is very sturdy and easy on my sensitive hair, does not pull too much. A good item for the price."
1,"I purchased this online due to the price and noticed when I compared it to the powder I bought at Ulta that the color, texture, and overall quality was different. I guess you get what you pay for! This powder was ok as far as working but not Bare Minerals."
1,"A friend of mine tried these and sweared that they worked, so decided to give them a try on those dreaded ""angry lines"" between my eyes.  I was honestly surprised & pleased to see that the lines weren't as bad as usual, when I woke up the night after first trying them.  Usually, upon waking, those lines are much deeper and then smooth out a little bit during the day, but it never occurred to me that sleeping was making them worse, more so than just day to day.I can see how these would take a commitment, they only really seem to do good the day after you've worn them over night.  But I HATE those lines, so I'll take what little (natural) difference I can get.  They do also take a little practice to get them to stay on, but I haven't had any trouble since the second time.  I think I can even let my bangs grow out now!  I've always kept them just to hide those lines."
1,This is my All time favorite hair brush. It is good for hair styling or just to use as a regular brush. I straighten or curl my hair every day and i use this brush as a styling brush and i love it. Perfect for my hair. and does not hurt my hair like other brushes do.
0,So disappointed. Very thick and sticky consistency. Way too heavy caused breakouts after one use. Also not for sensitive skin caused redness.
1,"I got philosophy wash as a gift some years back and could not bear going back to my normal wash. I tried. It's great quality. Leaves you soft and smooth, leans well. Worth the price. I would just choose a different scent next time. This was ok, but weakly scented and did not last like others."
1,"I've been using Maybelline mascara for what seems like over twenty years. How time flies. I have tried other mascaras but they just seemed more messy than this one. As long as you let this dry before you rub your eyes you probably won't have a problem. This is however a more thickening mascara. It does nothing for length. I like this mascara because my hair is brown and the mascara matches my hair and eyebrows. It also creates a very natural look unlike the lengthening types of mascara. Inevitably I do rub my eyes while wearing mascara and this one doesn't create too much of an issue. It only slightly darkens under my eyes but it is not very noticeable. If you are going to watch a sad movie while wearing mascara this is also a good choice since it is waterproof. It removes easily withMaybelline Expert Eyes Mascara Remover, Moisturizing. Just also wash your face with whatever you normally use as the remover tends to be a little oily. Otherwise it is great.~The Rebecca Review"
1,Personally I think that this sauna works great . I've used it for a facial steamer and it heats up fast and gives out a great amount of steam. Also when my sister was sick we used it as a vaporizer and added some liquid camomile and  mint to the water to help sooth her head cold.
1,"I never thought I'd spend this much on cotton pads, but I heard about it from a makeup guru on you tube, so I decided to splurge and spend  the $9 &#34;one time&#34;...well, I never thought there could be such a difference in cotton products!!  It was sooo nice on my very sensitive skin.  I have been very frugal with them, so they have last a few months, and I think I will be ordering them again! Love!!!"
1,"H2Ocean is the absolute best piercing aftercare product. I used it to clean each of my piercings and I still use it to clean my jewelry, I won't use anything else."
1,These fit very well and are not uncomfortable.  I've had ones that were so tight I couldn't keep them on for very long.  These are holding up well after multiple uses.
1,"Smells nice, keeps your skin moisturized and doesn't require a lot as a small amount works very, very well. Doesn't leave residue and absorbs into your skin very quickly while still retaining moisture. As usual, Neutrogena knows their stuff and this product comes easily recommended."
1,I bought this item before and really liked it. A little goes a long way and goes into the skin with a greasy feeling. I will probably buy more when I run out.
1,"Years ago I used this but I used one rounded tsp 3 times a day along with a healthy diet. I gradually lost 56 pounds and lowered my blood sugar levels, and my cholesterol levels dramatically.Since that time I went off of it, returned to my bad ways of eating, regained the weight, and blood sugar and cholesterol went way up again.For the past several months I have once again been taking fiber supplements. I had been taking Konjac Glucommanan Powder and have been very pleased with it. But, I decided to try Konsyl again since I can just go to the store and buy it instead of ordering online.I do not like taking the Konsyl as well as I like the Konjac Glucomannan. And, there is some differences in the two fibers. Konjac Glucomannan is solely a soluable fiber (which will more effectively lower your cholesterol), while Konsyl is a mixture of both soluable fiber and non-soluable fiber (the non-soluable fiber helps 'sweet' your colon and creates faster transit, while the soluable fiber lowers the cholesterol but doesn't increase the speed of transit).So, if your transit time is too fast you may want to look more at taking Konjac Glucomannan. But, if your transit time is too slow Konsyl would be better. If you want (more) lowering of cholesterol than Konjac Glucomannan would be the way to go. If you want faster transit along with cholesterol lowering than Konsyl is the way to go.I have decided to alternate using both products; one product at one meal, the other product at the other meal. So, alternating both products should give me the best of both.Konjac Glucomannan sticks to the side of the glass if you don't mix and drink fast enough, but it goes down smoothe. But, there also is a slightly odd flavor to Konjac Glucomannan. Konsyl is a pretty much flavorless fiber, but has gritty path down that I really don't care for. But, it's not terrible."
1,"Cheap price, cheap product. BUT- it does the job! it works fine, came on time, and I wear it everyday"
1,"This color works great for those with golden fair complexions. It looks dark in the bottle, but on it's a a soft pink glow like a soft real blush."
1,"I absolutely love this color! It looks great against black, brown, gray, and tan clothing or shoes! I've never found a red color this perfect! I'll never have to buy a different shade of red again! I get compliments on it ALL OF THE TIME. It looks great against my skin. I have medium-fair skin with yellow undertones. I'm sure it would look great on anyone, however. I highly recommend this color. I've got the blues for red!"
1,"Pretty color, true silver. I put it on with Eussie all in one base/top coat/strengthener underneath and Seche Vite top coat over and it stays on a long time."
1,"I like this product. It makes my hair softer,with mininun frizz and good volume and it is not heavy at all.I even use it on my dauthers hair and it works perfect.Just be aware that if you have curley hair and want something to define your curles ,maybe its not the product your looking for."
1,"Just another &#34;firming&#34; elixir...nothing amazing.  It is pleasant, unscented,  goes on quickly and is also clear and not flaky.  You can apply make-up over it. Some of the rave reviews I read here seem to be &#34;shills,&#34; carrying on about immediate effects.  I don't see it.  I am not a youngster, so I do not expect a miracle."
1,I pretty much use tea tree oil to disinfect everything. The Desert Essence brand definitely makes a quality tea tree oil. I haven't found one that I like better.
1,"My hair is colored and highlighted.  My last metal core hot-air brush (Conair 1000 watt) left my hair scorched and brittle.  This Helen of Troy works perfectly to smooth and add a hint of curl and body.  It is also much lighter in weight then my last one.  And because this one is all plastic/rubber, no more scorching!!!"
1,The colors are a little bit different that what you see online or the actuctual package.  It needs to be used up in a years time or the color dries up.  The clear gloss is fine so it can be used as a gloss even after that used up year!It does do what it promises. . . . . stays on all day long even after eat!  I guess that's what's most important!
1,"Witch Hazel has completely cleared up my adult acne, it's great! This bottle is nice and easy to squeeze the right amount onto a cotton round. I actually bought a pretty glass soap dispenser to pour this into though, since I use it day and night and the bottle was too big to have sitting out on my counter. After washing my face, I wipe it down with this Witch Hazel. My face feels clean and it doesn't irritate at all."
1,"After the first night of using this product, I saw an obvious reduction in my pimple.  The pimple was not gone completely, but it was definitley smaller and less visible.  Although product says it's a gel, it's more of a white, pastey cream.  The main con is that I paid $6.00 for the product on Amazon, and I have since seen the same product in the local dollar store for half the price."
1,"When you wash, this makes your face feel clean, no soap residue, then continue with steps 2-4 and yor ready for the day"
0,"I can barely smell the rose scent- it's very diluted.  The smell also changes to something very unpleasant on the skin, hair or anything else that's being sprayed on after a while.  Won't purchase again."
1,"As a gal in my 50's, with good skin that nevertheless gets a little dry and sensitive and has some fine lines, I always thought of Bare Minerals was for the young gals. Too drying and cakey for an older gal like me....WRONG!!!I have been going through foundation by the dozens trying to find a new one since my beloved Max Factor PanStik was discontinued (yes, that is how old I am, I used to use PanStik!).So I finally figured, what the heck, let me give it a shot.Well, to my surprise, I LOVE IT!!!!It does NOT make my skin dry at all - in fact, it feels like it is keeping in more moisture and is more protected. it looks smoother and more even, even when I am not wearing it.It does NOT make fine lines more noticeable at all - in fact it gives me a nice luminous glow without looking makeup-y that is more youthful than my previous foundations.It is EASY to apply and foolproof too, as long as you follow the instructions and buff it nicely. It was easy to learn how to do it.You can do a quick buff for a casual look or layer it for a more polished look.It never looks powdery or dry on me.I  have to say, I am impressed and would definitely recommend it to others.one proviso - if there is a store near you, go and try the colors and let them demonstrate how to use it. I thought i understood how to do it but at the store I got other tips and was able to pick just the right colors without geussing."
1,"I bought this conditioner based on the reviews on this site and loved it. I've had a problem with cheap conditioners weighing my hair down but this rinsed off clean and left my hair shiny and manageable. I will never spend money on a high-end conditioner again when I can get something like Suave Naturals-Coconut at such a low price! My hair is not very curly, it doesn't get too tangled but I have a lot of very long hair. I used to buy ""natural"" conditioners sold at natural foods market but those never worked! They either left residue or just didn't condition enough. I would've never thought that the solution could be as simple as picking something up at Walmart! I'm currently using the shampoo Argan Magic in combination with this conditioner and I've noticed my hair is shinier. I would attribute most of the shine to the shampoo, which I found at Marshall's at a discount, since I started using both products around the same time but I let my my mom use the Suave conditioner and she loved it too! I might have to try some other Suave products now. Their Humectant Moisture conditioner from their 'Professionals' line is supposed to be really good too."
1,Wear this color every day to work.  I get a lot of compliments and people constantly asking me what color I'm wearing.
1,"I've been using Maybeline mascara for more than 50 years.  It was the brand my Mom used and it was the mascara I first learned to use as a teen.  Over the years I've tried other brands, but I always come back to this old dependable product."
1,"They do what it says, but if you have oily skin like I do then I suggest getting something else. This stuff makes my skin more oily, though not at first. After a couple of minutes, it gets more oily faster than it usually does. This stuff is better suited for normal to dry skin."
1,i bought for bottle smooth smell it dont smell cheap for price it wear off but it ok for what pay for it
1,Such a great product for a great price. I use these on my hair and also my 2 little girls hair after a bath. It smells great and really takes out tangles leaving hair silky. When it gets about half empty I just fill up with water and it still works really well b/c it's so concentrated.
1,"Seriously Bare Minerals?  Can we have a heart-to-heart?  Why do you gunk up my face with a coat of oil so thick I mistake you for a BP spill?  No other make-up makes me pray I won't break out in hives like your brand.  I use other brands and the makeup lasts most of the day before breaking down in an oil slick.  Not Bare Minerals... I feel as if I've wiped a cheesecake on my forehead.  I want to love your product, but this latest purchase had me wondering if I ordered a counterfeit.  It's greasy, the coverage is mediocre, the color only matches albinos, and I feel the quality has diminished.  You used to have the best product on the market and now I'm slumming it with drug store brands because they perform better."
1,"this is the best perfume in the world i absolutly love it and so does my boyfriend, yea its a little spendy but completely worth it :)"
1,It smells what it says : Almond! You wanna eat it or use it in cakes!! It's Very good! Perfect!
1,"I have oily scalp, but dry-straight-thick hair because I swim twice to three times a week. The chlorine really dries out my hair even though I have used special shampoo for swimmer. I use this hair mask every time I wash my hair (usually every other day)&leave it for 3 minutes before rinsing; and once a week I would apply the mask, cover my hair w/a plastic hair cap & leave it on for at least 1/2 hour. It makes my hair sleek."
1,"I got this so I can have a natural scent and use it in my homemade cleaning products. This product is light and fresh! I am in love! The color comes from the bottle there is not pigment added to this product. It is sweet, light and lasts for an extended period of time. A little goes a long way and I like that it can be used instead of essential oils. A+ product and price. We will be ordering again.I highly recommend this product."
1,"When you want to feel absolutely beautiful...This is the parfum to wear...Jennifer Lopez has one of the best parfum on the market in my opinion.  I am always complemented on my look and my style and I wear Still when I want to be my beautiful best!  Buy it, you will love it too!"
1,"I've been using Colora Henna for a couple of years and really like it! It covers even partial grey hair, in spite of a lot of info. to the contrary that's online.I mix mine with room-temperature filtered water (not coffee or juices etc, again things mentioned online) and leave covered, overnight before I use.I leave it on for 2 hours before shampooing and conditioning.I don't apply any styling products for at least a day, to avoid any gels, mousse interacting with the henna.It is messy but so are other hair colors. It also takes a thorough shampooing afterwards to get out all the product.I usually like my hair after a couple of shampoos, to really see how the color will be.I switched to chestnut recently and have been getting a lot of compliments about the new color. I was using brown or ash brown before. The Chestnut is a rich, reddish brown, very nice. Vibrant!Don't be put off by the naysayers of henna. Try it for yourself.The bit of extra time and effort is so worth it. For your hair and your long term health. Regular hair color has a lot of questionable ingredients.Another plus of henna, no more worrying about some getting close or in your eyes. I always hated that the most about regular hair color.One more plus, it's cheaper than regular hair color too.Only one thing I wish they'd add to the package is a pair of plastic gloves, a cap would be nice too but I usually design one from a large plastic bag and that works ok.Recommended!Geraldine at myreallifereviews . com (you can see my full review of this product there along with photos)"
1,"This color used to be more in style than it is now. But its a good product. Bought this 15 years ago, still love it. I top it with a light pink lipgloss."
1,like this color goes well with black shadow for s smokey eye. nice color for everyone can be used as an all over color and highlighter. wont repurchase from here a little to expensive that ok wanted this color badly.
1,I have been using this cream for over a year.  I have sensitive skin and many products contain chemicals that are irritating.  I have this product on my Subscribe & Save monthly shipments - nice discount too!  My daughter is also using this product.  It is light.  You do not need a lot (dime size is enough for my face and neck application).  I highly recommend this product.
1,"I'm not sure how this product compares to others like it because this is my first purchase but I have very severe keratosis pilaris so I didn't exactly get that immediate of a result (which I wasn't expecting from the start.) However, I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now along with dry brushing and I do see a change in the number of red bumps on my skin as well as I can visibly see small hairs where there are red bumps left showing that the hair is coming through on its own! It takes some dedication but it does help to improve the appearance of kp but it isn't completely cured just yet."
1,"To begin with when I opened the Gel I was surprised it had no scent. However, it made up for that with the amount of hold it had for taming unruly curls and my edges. Also, the gel does not leave any residue or buildup and can be used quite often. It doesnt have any unhealthy ingredients such as alcohol which can make the hair have a crunchy feel instead of a soft supple feel. I would probably suggest this for people who have a unruly curls or edges. Just dab a tiny bit between your hands rub where is needed and voila your hair will come out great. An added bonus is Aloe vera has healing properties for the scalp and is extremely healthy. Lastly if doing a twistout or bantu knots I would recommend this."
0,"I have been using this product for the last 6 months straight on my forehead, applying the cream every other night before bed. This product has not smoothed out any wrinkles. Also, the product has a slight drying effect, so I stopped using it around my mouth as the dryness was the most noticble in that area. I regret all the time and patience I put into this applying this product, and I would have loved for it to actually work for me like it has worked for so many others."
1,"Smell is so subjective it seems that it may not be a valid review point. One person may love the smell of something and another person hate it. That being said, I like the smell of the citrus body wash. It has a faint scent of oranges and is sweet. It doesn't dry out my skin as much as other soaps do. It makes mounds of lather, so a little goes a long way. The ingredients listed on the product page are incorrect; it does not contain lauryl or laureth sulfates."
1,"Price is better on Amazon than the price the shoe stores charge. I use them to separate my big toe from the next toe. Keeps my toes from irritating each other. They wash well, keep their shape and last a long time."
1,"this is by far the best chapstick on the market - i have tried sooo many different brands, and none of them compare to neutrogena. it leaves you lips CONDITIONED and soft, not waxy. other chapsticks just put a layer of moisture on top of your lips, whereas neutrogena actually penetrates the lips and improves the condition of the skin. i will never use another chapstick for the rest of my life."
1,"Okay, I observed my wife and my brother use this product upon the effusive recommendation of my sister-in-law.My sister-in-law and my wife have basically perfect skin, rarely a pimple ever forms for them.  My brother also uses this product to great effect as well, which I have observed over the past year.  My wife uses this as a routine facial cleanser, then she applies moisturizer after she's done.  She does not get irritated skin.Personally, I think a lot of commercial cosmetic products are super expensive, over rated items that take advantage of the ""newest fad"". -- Okay, off the soapbox.  This particular Neutrogena product seems to be different."
1,"I am on a hunt for protein-free, moisturising products. In this, I have finally found a leave in that works for me. I wash my hair, let it dry about 95% (it doesn't work if my hair is wet, my hair repels it), then put this in, and seal with shea butter or castor oil. This leaves my hair moisturised and soft for a few days. I have chronically dry hair and I still haven't found a conditioner that works yet but this has improved my hair dramatically, after 16 years in just 3 weeks.The only small problems I have with it are 1) It is too little for so much money. 2) It leaves my hair a bit sticky if I reapply it too often and can leave a white residue. In such a case, I just spritz with water.My hair is 4b, thin strands."
0,"I really have only one complaint; so far as I can tell, in essentials, this bar cleanser is much the same as it ever was, but I could SWEAR that the bar I used several years ago was fragrance-free. I know I would never have even tried it if it had smelled like this then. I mean, part of the Cetaphil brand's selling point is that its skincare products have no fragrance added to them that would irritate sensitive skin. So why does this Cetaphil product have any fragrance at all?I usually have no problems with lightly-scented skincare products, provided they are only LIGHTLY scented. I'm fortunate not to have sensitive or allergic skin reactions to fragrance ingredients, but I still have to avoid most of them because for me, strong perfumes set off major migraines. Other than that, some of the scents in skincare products are actually quite nice. But this... THIS was like my worst nightmare of every ancient, long-expired bottle of old-lady perfume dumped into a single bar. It's intolerable. I couldn't even just throw it away; it still stunk up the whole bathroom from the bathroom trash can. I ended up taking it straight outside to the dumpster. And I still had to empty the half-full bathroom garbage to get rid of that sickening, cloying, unbearable scent that sparked off a 2-day migraine.Maybe I'm just missing something obvious. I would appreciate it if someone could let me know IF Cetaphil still makes a fragrance-free bar soap/cleanser. I'd like to go back to using an old favorite, but I can't find the ""old"" favorite."
1,"I do like this product - it smells nice, works well and goes on well.  But I dropped it once and the lid cracked, and now I have to keep it in a baggie so it does not leak.  Seems pretty cheap to make a lid that will not break so easily.  Otherwise, good product and one I would purchase again."
1,"This color is really pretty and all, but is kind of thin. It's not very hot pink (like I thought it was), but still really pretty."
1,"In my over twenty years of trying numerous foundations, I have yet to see anything cover and perfect all while allowing the natural radiance of your skin to shine through. This powdery foundation is like powdered gold. Not only do the crushed minerals shimmer ever so delicately, they are magical once they touch your skin.The lightness of the product is fascinating and you feel as if you are not wearing foundation. The free feeling and the beautiful complexion you achieve through the use of Bare Escentuals may make you want to try all their products. The kits are a good way to introduce your skin to the products because they include the brushes you need to apply this powdery foundation.The Artist in you will love the way you apply this makeup. Each container of powder has many possibilities. You can blend more warmth or add a touch of summer shimmer. Once you have your foundation on, the possibilities are endless.This product is free of preservatives, talc, oil, fragrance, dyes and irritating chemicals. Once I put on this makeup, I thought I was dreaming. My skin adores this product and liquid makeup is history! The mineral veil also keeps away shine and is the perfect compliment to this foundation. This makeup and the delicious Lush bath products are my finds of the year. I take a bath with one of the bath ballistics and then apply this makeup and feel like the world is a more beautiful place. Bare Escentuals will add the magic of radiant skin so your natural beauty is never hidden from the world.~The Rebecca Review"
1,"It's ok.  I don't really need it tho.  I guess it's handy to have on hand but I won't re-purchase.I LOVE the Sweet Blessed Bee Magic and the All Natural Queen Bee eye cream better.  (I think they're 2 separate companies and both products are excellent for aging skin, for the eye area, just overall for any type of moisture retention and skin care.)All 3 are different products, different uses.  But they have a lot in common.  I just don't need this Calendula added to the mix.But if you're specifically looking for CALENDULA, it's fine!"
0,Just bought this item. DOnt like it at all. Not enough steam by any stretch of the imagination. I give it a 2 star because the exfoliating brush and other amenities are great added features.
1,"I bought this soap at the recommendation of my dermatologist. He suggested for eczema, but this soap is great for any kind of skin! We run the gambit in my home and this soap is perfect for all of us. Odd bonus: Because the soap leaves nor residue, it clean my wedding ring better than jewelry cleaner. I wish I knew about this soap when I was a teen!"
1,"It came pretty fast, works great (I use a brush instead of the pad they send with it).Ill be buying another when this one runs out!"
1,"My Nordic background blessed (?) me with blond hair, light skin, and sensitivities/allergies to a lot of different things.  One of my biggest problems moving to Florida 33 years ago was to find an EFFECTIVE deodorant and anti-perspirant  that didn't declare war on my underarms.  Everything I tried made my underarms sore and chaffed.Several products I tried professed to be 'gentle' and 'hypoallergenic' and yet caused the same reaction.  Finally I tried Almay and was amazed that not only did it work in Southwest Florida's heat and humidity, but I had no adverse reactions to it.  Another advantage is that it doesn't mark my clothes like some deodorants do.So if you are having a problem finding an effective deodorant/anti-perspirant that doesn't cause a problem with your skin, give Almay a try.  Hopefully it will solve your problem too."
1,"After seeing all the great reviews and recommendations, I decided to purchase this product and was so excited to try it out when it came. I had great expectations and I was sad to see that they weren't met. I've waited months to write this review because I kept hoping to suddenly see dramatic change (maybe Im just not seeing the change myself at all). On the first use of this cream, I put on a very thin layer to see how my skin would react - it was fine, i felt a verryy slight burning sensation but that's normal. Woke up next day, skin looked the same. So I waited two days until I put a thicker layer on at night - in the morning my skin didnt have any noticeable changes. I have skin with small bumps/blemishes around the nose area and hyperpigmentation spots here and there from pimples/zits. I've used this product for about 3 or 4 months now and I can't notice any differences to my skin .. sadly i'm very disappointed :/ Maybe my skin is just too tough for 10% glycolic acid."
0,"I got this shampoo hoping that it would help my dried out winter hair. Well, it made it worse! I looked like Broomhilda afterwards; it stripped my hair of anything that it had left and I looked as if I'd stuck my finger in an electrical socket wet. I don't recommend it at all if you have dry hair. If your hair is oily, then I think this would be fine. It sure smells nice and clean though! Save your money for a professional brand - they definitely overshot the marketing on these!"
1,This stuff is great. It has a nice aroma and really cleans deep. I use everyday. This is great to put some in a spray bottle and use just before moisturizer and make-up.
1,"This is not as good as the hair dryer I use at home, a Conair 225NP Comfort Touch Tourmaline Ceramic 1875-Watt Hair Dryer. For compact, portable, it is not that small. For use as a regular hair dryer, it takes awhile to dry, and just hi/lo heat and volume. My previous portable one was smaller and dried better. This works OK."
1,"good cream but a bit too heavy for my face, even in winter.  Occasionally okay for overnight, but leaves my face way too shiny for daytime.  I use it on dry patches (like elbows) and it's effective.  A little goes a long way.  In my opinion, too oily to use as hand cream unless you want to drop things and leave fingerprints everywhere.  Consistency is a bit strange, creamy but the distinctly yellow olive oil separates out if the container goes unused for more than a day."
1,"I've tried other astringents, and this one is the perfect balance of effective cleansing without overdrying.  Those who use this product alone probably do not get great results, but this is designed to be part of a skincare regimen, including moisturizing.  I use a mild face wash, then I use this astringent to help remove any makeup that did not get removed by the face wash (makeup remover gives me breakouts).  After that, I use Neutrogena Anti-Wrinkle Anti-Blemish lotion.  It's a very simple regimen, but extremely effective.  I've tried other astringents in the same regimen, but they dried out my skin and had noticeably higher alcohol content, likely the cause of the over-drying."
1,After putting this on I forget about my dry winter hands for hours. I just wish it came in a lager size and with a better cap.
1,"I bought this because it said that it was food safe. I was making lemon pound cake and needed it. It didn't really do much for the flavor and after reading the other reviews, I'm a little scared to use it for food anymore."
1,Very good quality brush .perfect with concealer application .makes a big difference when u have the right brushes and bare essentials is got the best
0,I thought this was supposed to be a natural product but it has artificial fragrances and it really bothered my hands since I have mild eczema. Very disappointed since the labeling was misleading.
1,I had use Total block 65 and now 60. Total Block 65 is a great but 60 is even better. It give a light cover up. Since not many of us have even skin tone. This product provide great result and yet doesn't have the unnatural look. I love it and I will buy it again.
1,"I started suffering with severe acne during late junior high and early high school. After several failed attempts at dermatologist ""chemical"" fixes(which only made my sensitive skin worsen) I started using all natural products. I use this toner whenever I feel like I might break out(especially in the muggy summer weather). It does have a strong smell but it goes away within seconds of application to the face. I use this withBurt's Bees - Garden Tomato Complexion Soap, 4 oz bar,Burt's Bees Doctor Burt's Herbal Blemish Stick with Tea Tree Oil .3 fl oz (8.8 ml), andBurt's Bees Radiance Day Lotion with SPF 15, 2-Ounce Bottle(and sometimesBurt's Bees Acne Moisture Lotion - 2.0 oz.) to keep my skin crystal clear and my complexion smooth and soft. Though this is my regimen, I'm sure it could work for anyone who suffers from any sort of breakout. Just keep in mind that no one product is going to clear your breakouts up in one day, it is a progression.Overall, this Witch Hazel is fabulous for toning the skin and I find that it makes a wonderful mid-day cleaner even when I have on makeup to just dab on my face."
1,"Used to use this and was lured away by Neutrogena Naturals but I have come back and I am so happy I did.  Works great, no residue, no stripped feeling, great happy scent!  Takes off makeup -- including eye makeup -- easily and does't burn my eyes at all.  And I like the big bottle that lasts forever."
1,"I have tried many, many nail products over the years with little success, so thought I'd give this a try.  My nails seem healthier since using the Nailtiques, but I have only had the product for about 3 weeks.  I plan to continue with it and I'm faithful to use it each day.  Just a side comment:  I purchased the Nailtiques polish from another source.  I have NEVER had a polish that stayed on so well.  I apply one coat Nailtiques as the base followed by 2 coats polish and then one application Nailtiques each day after.  I can go almost a week between polishes."
1,"PRO:Price competitive product. Sharp chrome finish that fits well in my bathroom. Excellent 5x magnification provides extreme close up for personal grooming. 8-inch mirror size allows for full face/neck viewing. Easily mounts on the bathroom wall with two screws.CON:Extension arm is entirely too short for my personal needs.Overall this is a good product - I only use the 5X magnification side because that provides me with the close-up view I need for personal grooming, be that nose/ear hair trimming, shaving, blemish maintenance, etc. I've yet to use the normal magnification side of the mirror since I have this mounted next to a large mirror / cabinet in the bathroom.The chrome colour fits in well with everything else in the bathroom - so really not much to report there. Install is easy with just a couple of screws and so if you find a stud in the wall you're pretty much good to go.My complaint which removes a star from the product is that the extension arm is just not long enough to bring the mirror away from the wall and right up to my face without me having to lean into it. If you have a large vanity / sink then you're going to have to lean in if you want to see right up close to your face. This can be managed a bit with mirror placement and of course it depends on where your walls are in the bathroom, but I'd like to see something with an arm extension that is a bit more adaptable.Swivel of the mirror is smooth and unencumbered. The mirror rotates gently but is tight enough so that it doesn't move when you need it to be stationary. Good light reflection and is easy to clean with a wipe and some windex, or a glass cleaning pad.This is a daily use item for me and for the price was a good deal."
1,"This Neutrogena hand cream is the only product that provides moisturizing for both my hands and even my face. I have tried too many other products to count and was so glad to re-discover this great hand cream. My skin was getting progressively drier with weather conditions and as I get older, but problem solved. Thanks Neutrogena!"
1,"I bought this because of dry patches on my face. However the cream made me breakout horribly, and I wouldn't recommend it to be used on the face.However, for anywhere else on the body this cream is a life saver. It sinks into the skin and makes you feel so soft immediately. The first thing you'll notice is the smell. It's the camphor, and it goes away quick. (If you don't know what camphor is, it smells like Vicks Vapo Rub)Overall this is a wonderful thick moisturizer."
1,"Pinkish color with a little sparkle. Pretty in sunlight. Long lasting. I would prefer a little more sparkle, but all in alll a good choice."
1,"This is without a doubt the best smelling hand soap in the world. The green apple scent smells just like green apple jolly ranchers. You'll want to wash your hands even more, just so you can smell this awesome fragrance. Until i recently discovered the touchless soap dispensers I had this on every sink in my house....and as soon as i figure out the right formula to use this in a touchless dispenser...I'll be right back on the Mrs Meyer's green apple band wangon! LOVE IT!!!!"
0,I can see how MAYBE this product works for a person with very very deep wrinkles... using this every night may lift some of the indentations. I have very minor forehead wrinkles and this product does absolutely NOTHING for me. I would suggest not wasting your money.
1,Olive polish. Trendy. Used on my toes. Lasted a good two weeks with my seche vite top coat. Great OPI quality. Good neutral polish color for fall/winter.
1,"I love this face wash.  I've been using it for a few years now.  It's effective, removes make up, and doesn't over dry my face.  It's not too rough, either."
1,"I tried almost every product from neutrogena and this is by far the best. This is the ONLY cleanser I used that doesn't dry skin out, it adds moisture and my face feels very clean after using. I been suffering from acne and my dr recently prescribe clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide, I use the medication along with this. best ever!"
1,"I've always loved peel-off masques. That's really because I enjoyed the peel-off process. However, I considered them ineffective because the only thing they'd get rid of are my baby hairs at the front, nothing more. But this is one masque that does the trick! I constantly looking forward to applying it and seeing the difference it makes it closing my pores and getting rid of my acne. My face is so much more radiant and alive! This is definitely a product I'm sticking to."
1,I use this oil to retain moisture in my skin and hair after bathing and washing. It is wonderfully effective. Pleasant in texture and odor. I really enjoy it!
1,"Got this because of all the reviews. I now have this, the ocean one and the clarifier. It works just as well. Cleans thoroughly, smells nice for ""fruity"" days, and is a great body wash. I love how much lather it creates too, but all the Naturals do so. I use this when I'm not feeling ""oceany"" but want something sweet, and I use the apple conditioner with it. No build up, no fuss, just clean hair. I need conditioner though, as it's not a creamy formula--I don't like those anyway. If you like the basics, this is for you. Also, dirt cheap at the store, but I'd buy it here if that was a necessity. I do stray from Suave but always come back. Suave Naturals, I just don't know how to quit you.Anyone else do that? Try other products but then run back to what you really like? I don't know why I cheat, it never lasts. I'm definitely a Suave addict, although I won't tell a stylist that. I know I'd get in trouble."
1,"I have owned and used his facial brush (yes, the same one), for 8 years now.  ...wow.I'm not going to be unrealistic and claim this brush dramatically improves my complexion.  Because it doesn't.  Nor does it claim to.  However, it DOES produce the results listed in the official description, namely, ""heightening the benefit of foaming cleansers.""  An earlier reviewer said that this brush turns any cleanser into a foam party.  That made me lol, and it's the best part of using this brush!  Note that ""foaming cleanser"" can be a bar of soap.  This ability to produce more suds probably maximizes the dirt/residual makeup-removing potential of your cleanser (versus using your fingertips), and that's what makes this puppy valuable.The price seems a little steep at first, but consider that I've owned and used mine for a VERY long time.  8 YEARS.  It has not shed a bristle, and has no gunk build-up.  Pretty impressive.Be gentle, and be realistic about what this brush is all about.  I would buy another one, but don't really think I'll need to."
1,"Some of the colors look scary in the compact because they are so highly pigmented. Exhibit A, for example, is a bright clownish looking orange-red that surely has scared off many a gal. But for those who know how to use a blush brush properly (ie, high quality bristles, good construction, a judicious amount of pressure, good blending), these babies pay off. And I mean pay off not just in beautiful color, but in how long they last, because this quality and pigmentation means you don't need to use a lot. One of these can last you a long, long time, even with daily use.I have Exhibit A, Torrid, Taos, Crazed, Luster, and Mata Hari, which covers a range of warm and cool tones. Exhibit A is my fave go to red blush. Using just a touch of my duo-fibre MAC brush on it (ie MAC 187 brush), this deposits a beautiful, face-brightening blush to the cheeks. Too much and you look like Bozo, so this does require restraint.Mata Hari is a lovely, feminine, cool pink-rose tone that I, who have olive skin, can wear and look like I was out walking briskly. Those two are my fave ones from NARS as they are matte. The others have some shimmer and require even more care in application and go well with a shiny gloss on the lips.Luster is more like a highlighting color for me (it's a goldeny-lustrous color on me). It's pretty much the color of my skin with shimmer, so I can put it on without a color payoff, but it gives a nice glow that I like for days when I look ""tired"". A perking up thing. Also nice for adding glow when going out at night/to a party. On a lighter person, it's probably a nice warmth on the cheeks, sort of like a subtle bronzer. Could probably highlight eyes, all over, too. It's versatile.Crazed is a deep raspberry pink with shimmer (ie, a cooler color that has glowiness). Taos is like a somewhat warm deep rosed-up red. It's a color that will definitely suit darker tones, but can be used by fairer women with much restraint. Torrid is a gorgeous deep peachy sort of tone with shimmer. I'm wearing it today with Manhunt by NARS (lipstick) overlaid with Red Devil coral-red gloss by MAC. Torrid is not as deeply-intense as Crazed or Taos, but it's not a shy color either. Will give a nice payoff.I'm med-dark olive toned (NC44 in MAC) and all those look fine on me. I'm ordering Gilda to add to the peachy colors in my blush collection (which right now includes two MAC peachy tones and one by Physician's Formula). With summer coming in, I'm looking for peachier/warmer tones.These are expensive-ish, but these are top-notch, and it's no wonder makeup artists and celebrities love NARS blushes. (Note: I don't own the much-touted, much-beloved, nearly legendary Orgasm, though, which is more suited to ligther-than-me gals, but it really is pretty in the pan. I have heard good things about Super Orgasm colorwise, if you don't mind having chunks of glitter fall off your brush.)UPDATE: I got my Gilda blush and it's lovely. A soft-textured, nicely-pigmented matte peach that will look fabulous with peachy-coral and more orangey glosses for Spring and summer, or even with nude glosses."
1,"OMG, I just can't describe how I love this face cream! All the blemishes and pimples are gone, my face is so soft and never looked better. Would recommend to anyone!"
1,"I have very dry skin after chemo and have tried so many OTC and even expensive prescriptions but this has worked the best for me.  It soaks in and I don't scratch.  I don't feel like I've got lotion layering on my skin.  I'm a picture so if I feel a bump or scratch or rub and it moves I unintentionally dig and this stuff has soaked in, a rarely scratch and then its usually about time for the evening application.  When I apply at night, even with the mild hot flashes it keeps me from scratching, a nice lubricating product that doesn't layer on top, it really soaks in.noknots"
1,"Vanicream works great on my skin.  It keeps my skin hydrated, without causing breakouts.  My dermatologist recommended Vanicream for my dry skin.  I use it on my face and body.  The lotion is unscented, so it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, or cause an allergic reaction.  This is the best lotion I've ever used."
1,Fast Shipping.  Love this cleansing bar.  Very lite on your skin with no irritations.  I use the Vanicream Lite Moisturizer afterwards.  Feels great...  Wouldn't use anything else.
1,"i LOVE this product.  i have been buying it for years, but lately have had trouble finding it in the local stores.  i like this version, as it has Q-10 in it.  i really think it help smooth fine lines.  It is NOT greasy, it doesn't have a fragrance, and a little goes a long way.  I have SUPER-SENSITIVE skin and I have never had a problem with this moisturizer.  It also does not clog your pores."
1,"This product is a good one for home users only. good points about it, you can trim your beard, cut your hair in various sizes and shapes, the blades of the Wahl are great. Negative points: It is a bit heavy and noisy. But in general, the product is satisfactory and gives good haircuts."
1,I don't personally think this does what it says.. The Sephore  star to finish just doesn't start so it definitely doesn't finish.. Went back to my Perfect Formula base coat and PF  top coat  SORRY  SEPHORA  I love OPI but Not you
1,"Compre este aceite para usuarlo en mi casa de alquiler. La gente que se ha hospedado con nuestra casa, siempre nos dicen que la casa huele a un aroma fresco y limpio. Usualmente lo usamos en la cortinas de cada habitacion y tambien lo mezclamos con baking soda para limpiar el refrigerador y las alfombras.Excelente producto se lo recominedo a cualquier persona que desea sentir al aroma de sus ambientes fresco."
1,I started using SolarOil when I got my first Shellac manicure... the salon recommended that I apply this oil nightly.  And then I got hooked.  It's a great cuticle oil with a nice almond scent and it doesn't leave my fingers feeling too greasy.  Now I carry a bottle in my work bag so I can apply the oil whenever my cuticles are feeling dry.  A once or twice daily application is all you need.
1,I love their products and use both the eye serum and regenerist daily.  It really moisturizes and makes wrinkles fade away big time.
0,"the problem w/this product is that they do not list the percentage of retinol that is in it.  the higher the percentage, the better the retinol works.  the highest percentage allowed w/o a prescription is 2%.  my sense is that the percentage in this product is far less than 1%. I currently use skinceuticals retinol 1.0 refining night cream.  and I'll probably go even higher once my current tube is finished.  I used the ROC a few times, but will either throw it out or use it on my hands at night."
1,This smells like fresh lemon! The bottle makes it easy to dispense without a mess. i put a few drops inside the toilet paper roll and it gives off a nice smell each time the roll is used.
1,"This color is quite deceiving , the color is so attractive, and sexy, nice pigment. A nice dark eye with a little sparkle at nite to mix and your hot.XOXO Love it.Another pointer, add a little sparkle to your lipgloss for nite wear youll shine like the star you are."
1,I placed one in the guest bathroom and a second near the kitchen sink.  People seen to genuinely like how it smells and we are very happy with this purchase.  I plan to purchase more when it runs out.  Good choice.
1,"I hadn't really used a hair dryer in a couple of years, due to a short hair style.  But I've grown it out a bit, and the styling wasn't looking right.  My stylist recommended adding a dryer back into my routine.  I don't like big, bulky dryers, so I chose this one.The first time I used it, I remembered why I always used to love compact hair dryers!  The air flow is concentrated, and the heat levels are just right (I have never felt like it's burning or like it's not hot enough).  The dry time is fast, I manage to dry & style my ear-length hair in 3 minutes or less every single time, with wonderful results.  Most of the time, I don't even have to use the flat iron afterward.I like the cool shot button, that is a nice feature to have on a compact dryer.  Also, the sound of this dryer is thankfully not shrill like some of the older compacts I've had.Overall a great buy, I love it and highly recommend it."
1,"Great color with the quality you expect from OPI. I was in search for a fun color. This one has a little shine and sparkle to it, that's not over the top. It's lovely."
1,"Oily skin is simply irritating. Especially on hot, humid days, my face feels so clogged up and muggy. Although the label may say makeup remover, it works perfectly as a quick facial cleanser, leaving my skin feeling refreshed. These wipes do have trace amounts of salicylic acid - for you out there who might care."
1,"I was expecting much bigger clips, like the ones they use in the hair salons. These are much smaller, more similar to barrettes than hair styling clips.As a cosplayer, I need clips to hold both my own hair and my wig hair out of the way when styling. These do the job, but because they're smaller than I expected, I need to use twice as many, especially because my hair and wig hair is really thick.Make sure you know what you're paying for!"
1,Works on my long mostly straight hair to provide a bit of shine and to get the ends to curl under.  (I do not know how it will work on thick or curly hair.) It heats up in less than a minute and gives my ends a curl in under 16 seconds on a medium heat setting. The turbo setting works in a few seconds and gives a good heat boost. It will give you a tighter curl. I am done with my hair in under 3 minutes most days.Be careful not to  wind  your hair too many times over the brush or you could get a tangle that is difficult to undo. One or two turns is very safe.My last  curler one kept going for several years and only failed after one too many falls to the bathroom floor. These things are quite durable under normal circumstances. Could not live without one.
1,"I wanted a good face wash that doesn't sting my eyes and leave them bright red with irritation.  I read another reviewers comments that this face wash was non irritating to your eyes & decided to give it a try. It does the job and doesn't irritate my eyes unless I intentionally open them while I'm washing my face. Stupid, I know, but I kind of wanted to see if it would burn? So here's the report: not too much. It did burn but not nearly as much as some others I've tried AND it washed out instantly & didn't leave my eyes scarlet with irritation.My personal favorite face wash is by Philosophy - but that's a huge bottle and really pricey. This is a great size, doesn't take up too much real estate on my bathroom counter & does the job.  I'll definitely order again."
1,"This product is pretty strong.  I used the 5% previously and felt it might not be strong enough, and this definitely does the job and one can feel that it is working after just a couple of days, as far as getting rid of dead or rough skin.  I am just over 60 with good skin, but need some sloughing and this does the job.  It does sting, and it is very hard not to get it on your lips and then they hurt and feel very chapped and it is hard to get it off, even if you put salve or balm on them.  I thought it might be causing my face to break out but I am not sure and am still experimenting, while not using it every day.  A mask or a scrub might work better for those with sensitive skin."
1,"I have been a rabid fan of Lush products for years, often having them shipped to me form Canada before they were so easy to buy in the states. Each product has a certain Earthy quality it and its nice knowing that people who make each an every single on of these luscious concoctions love them as much as the customers do and it shows!The Karma soap looks like a slab of gold in shape but is really reminiscent of candied carrots I would find in fruit cakes I used to eat as a kid growing up in Poland. The clarity of the fiery jewel like color is quite attractive as it makes for a nice soap to put in the guest bathroom or for self spoiling with hand made soaps that beat the other cookie cutter types by a mile. The scent itself is a breezy breath of citrus with mother earth embedded deep in the core. The lavender and patchouli are a whisper, a shadowy backbone to the zest and freshness. The multidimensionality of layering scents makes fore a very uplifting experience and I can smell the heady aromas every time I was my hands with it. I also love the Karma perfume, which smells almost exactly as the soap.I find that my hands don't get as dry when I use this glycerin soap as opposed to regular soaps laden with chemicals and lards. But I always use a hand cream afterwards, preferably one of those gooey Burt's Bees creams that come in heavy glass jars. My hands never crack or get dry no matter how dry the air or how cold it is when I used Lush soaps and a good hand cream.- Kasia S."
1,It's quick and works so good!!! but I do not use the  snap on covers I use Conair Salon White Roller clips...work great!!!  I have super long hair...and I use 4 jumbo rollers...thats all...four straight down from the bang area to the nape of the neck...Just 4 like a mohawk...maybe... but the new styles are smooth on the side so when my hair is almost dry I set it in 4 lg rollers with the Conair clips holding the bottom two rollers and the pointed metal clip for the top two.... A little drying with blower dryer and perfect.. Also after exercise I use one quick one on the top and two on the side rolled to the face so it smooths it out and gives very finished look.  Soo Quick!!!  Easy on Hair and done while you do other things like drink coffee and get dressed. Got one the first time they came out and found out that with our hard water you must remember to empty unit as soon as you turn it off to prevent water build up.  Great for little kids and so light...I sleep in mine. Love it!!! Nothing even close to working like this!!!
1,"Heats up really fast, especially with the turbo setting.  Works well, but you can barely see the light indicator.  I have to look very closely or turn off the light to make sure I turned it on!"
1,Its a strange color but then it is Milk Protein & Honey. Smells good and works great...for a soap that is.
1,"i use this most days. and i used this before, just bought it online because it was easy and i have prime. thanks!"
0,"I have used Olay since I was 16 and I never notice any firming or any difference. Perhaps because I am still young but I do notice some eye wrinkles and this has not helped at all. It is however, a great moisturizer :)"
1,"Worked just as promised, just have to be careful not to get color on clothing or ears."
1,"When you first apply, there is a powdery smell. But shortly after applying the scent becomes warm and vanilla-ey. This is my fav scent, with love at a close second, and egyptian goddess in third."
1,"This facial cleanser has helped me maintain my skin for some time now. I find that I have less blemishes when using it but my skin maintains a balanced moisture level, which is ideal. Many cleansers dry skin and in the winter that is not a nice feeling. Amazons price is very good compared to local retailers. I wish it did lather a little more since it is labeled as a foaming cleanser but that is a minor complaint. Overall I am very happy with this product."
1,"I wanted to use this product for awhile before leaving a review and I am glad I did. I have been dying my hair for over 10 years and about 6 months ago I bleached my hair and went a bright vampire red and the bleaching destroyed my hair. It was stretchy like a rubber band and was so bad that I thought I was going to have to shave my head. I gave this a try and I am so glad I did. Within a couple uses I could already see AND feel a difference in my hair. I would recommend cutting off as much of your hair as you can which will help your hair grow because all that dead hair will never be fully healed. This product is wonderful and I will be purchasing it again which won't be for awhile, I use a lot and still have a ton which is great! It might seem a bit pricey for a hair product but it lasts a long time so, it's worth it because it actually works."
1,I bought this because I have been biting my nails since I was in grade school. My nails look terrible and the front teeth are starting to wear from the years of bitting. I haven;t tried anything else in the past for this but now that  am 31 years old I figure it;s time to break this habit for good.I apply this stuff daily and IT WORKS! It's the worst tasting stuff when I am conscious of when Im about to bite my nails I stop myself and the few times today that I have forgotten and unconsciously tried to bite them I am bitterly reminded of why I need to keep from biting. I'm hoping to be broken of this habit very soon. Only bad thing is that it will get onto finger foods and make whatever you are eating taste funny; otherwise great product.
1,"Aside from the fact that this towel dries my hair quickly, I like that the towel itself also dries quickly. Since it was so expensive, I only bought one and like to get a few uses out of it before throwing it in the laundry. So it stays much cleaner since it dries so fast."
0,"The smell is so strong it burns my eyes. I love Freeman's other masks though, I enjoy the clay avocado one a lot and even use the black sugar scrub one to exfoliate. This one doesn't seem to improve my skin or make it look any better after using...it's fun to peel off though."
1,"I'm on accutane which has caused me to get some dandruff (I normally never have it). After freaking out and doing research, I bought this. It seems to have lessened the severity of my dandruff after just one use, but the smell is SO AWFUL! It's like I dipped my head into a freakin tank of gas! I have long hair and to try to get that smell off is  impossible. I have to put really potent anti-frizz serum in it, then spray some of my strong perfume DIRECTLY on my hair in order to TRY to mask up the smell. Even then it still stinks.If you like the smell of tar and gas, this is for you. If not, try to get the ""clean scent"". I haven't tried it, so I don't know if it's realyl different. Honestly, I'm thinking I'd rather have dandruff than stinky hair."
1,"If you have tried other products and had no success, I would recommend  trying  coal tar shampoo.  This shampoo helps me with scalp health and itch.It can bleach colored hair so be careful.I find it actually works best if I don't use it too often, no more than once a week."
1,"Suave Naturals Conditioner, Tropical Coconut - 22.5oz.Suave got it right! Its refreshing & simple and cleans my hair really good!"
0,"This is one of those perfumes you must test for yourself before buying or you are destined to be dissapointed.  I bought a sample vial because I read so many good reviews and am glad I only spend three dollars! This stuff reeks! This is worse than grandma scent, its nauseating. I asked my husband what he thought and his response was: ""Phew! What the hell is that?""Yeah. It does last a very long time but what's the use."
1,"This product changed my life. I had dry, flaky skin and now it's perfect. I still have the occasional breakouts and some uneven tone (I already had this though) but I am very happy with this moisturizer. It smells so good! I use it religiously every morning and I follow up in the evening with Olay Regenerist Night Effects."
1,"PLEASE REMEMBER TO LEAVE FEEDBACK...IT IS SO HELPFUL FOR FELLOW AMAZONITESI normally use this as a one step process and it turns out very well.My natural color is a dark ""dishwater blonde"" with some gray. This time I had lightened my hair first to pale yellow shade and it had that bleached look without the softness of shading. Lady GAGA yellow...Too yellow.  I used the  lightest blonde shade first in this color and it did not help enough.  Then I used this light ash and it looks just perfect. With just enough yellow but the softness of the ash but NO grey  to it at all. Looks kind of like a child's natural blonde color, my color as a child. Very beautiful. However, having my roots bleached out  first is going to make new roots show quickly. Therefore, next time I will use this but not bleach my hair out first. I'll just do touch ups to root area for about an hour then put on rest of hair for 5 minutes. That way my roots will continue to grow out just a wee bit darker than the ends so not as noticeable as my hair grows and I like it that way. One step to blonde! Bleaching out first is just too much trouble for me and too high maintenance. If your hair is not too dark , you might want to try it with just the one step, without bleaching first,  to see if it works for you.This hair color is the most beautiful and affective of all the blonde hair color I have ever used. It is a bargain as well.  Most don't realize that you get the pre color protector, a nice size tube of both shampoo and conditioner that keeps your hair in super condition. Really, my hair feels in better condition after I color.My hair is fine but very long. One box is enough for me to do all over color.  I still use one box for my roots alone though.The price on Amazon , with shipping, is still less price  than the stores."
1,i put this on everyday i feel the clean it smells more like a powder smell not to roseyit helps with my break outs and the shine i get with a greasy face
1,"These are easy to wear, not to tight, great colors, nice to have a very thin set, vvery comfortable, would recommend"
1,"I've been using this product for a several years. At first I used it on my face and neck, but as I got older, I needed a creamier moisturizer for my face as my skin became drier. I still buy this for my neck though. I've seen women with really wrinkly necks, so far mine is OK.I have ultra sensative skin, this Olay doesn't hurt when I put it on, I like the fact that it has SPF 15 which helps a little bit to protect my skin from the sun. If I'm going to be out in the sun for a long time, I use a different product, with a high number, SPF 30 to 50.When I ordered this, I thought it was the larger size, so when it arrived, I was a bit disappointed. I bought another one exactly the same, in this size at Walmart a few days ago, it only cost $5, I paid $6 here on here Amazon, it's good to shop around.I would recommend this for those who are just beginning to use a moisturizer."
1,"For the price I thought this would be more effective.  I have used it long enough to see some improvement on my face, I don't.  It feels ok going on and does make my skin feel smooth, but just hasn't shown me any long term improvement.  I think there are other products out there which do just as much for less money.  I probably won't buy it again."
1,"I've switched from body lotion to this Neutrogena Body Oil. Living in AZ is pretty dry and lotions don't rehydrate my skin after showering like this does. I've tried several methods from using it right in the shower to toweling off LIGHTLY and apply this afterward. That's the method I like the best. If I dry myself off too much and wait too long to apply the oil, I just lightly dampen my skin and then apply the oil. Great product I won't ever be without."
1,"As with the other Vagisil product that I posted a review on, I did not buy this product for myself, but for friends who cannot afford to buy them.  Vagisil is an excellent product and I highly recommend it."
1,"I notice that it takes a lot of this product to actually see a difference. I had to use about half the bottle to ensure that all my hair was covered. When I let it sit for a couple of minutes and rinse my hair, it felt like silk."
1,First powder foundation that I came across with excellent coverage without the hassle. I have very obvious hyper pigmentation marks and this stuff covers it very well.
1,i never try blonde hair so i'll give it a go at it hope that it works well with good results
0,"After reading glowing reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, I decided to try this hoping it would help my sensitive, acne-prone skin. I liked the idea of an inexpensive cleanser that was gentle on skin. Turns out this soap is gentle on dirt, too. It does not remove makeup very well. After use, makeup still comes off on my cleansing cloth! I have since switched to Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash, which seems to work better."
1,"I bought this for my mom who saw it suggested on the television program Dr.Oz (famous for being on Oprah). She recently started using the cream, and she's already noticing improvements. I'll definitely buy her another tube when this one runs out."
1,"I have somewhat large pores, so I was really hoping this would help. I use it once a day and it immediately shrinks and clears them out considerably, though they get bad again the next day. Overall though, I've seen an improvement in my complexion, so I'd highly recommend this even though it's not magic."
1,"I ordered this from America Rx and it took forever to get here- like 3 weeks! I've only been using this for a few days. I like it so far. It hasn't really cleared up my acne yet, but only time will tell."
1,I love this daily scrub. It's gentle enough to use everyday. The first time I used it I couldn't believe how bright my skin was! Some washes cause me to break out. Not this one! Thanks Aveeno! I will definitely be buying this again!
1,great to travel with and if you are on the go! i used this for a cruise and a weekend get away with the girls
1,I bought this color on Amazon because it is sold out EVERYWHERE else and for good reason.  It looks great and mixes well with other colors.  Does fade quickly though and require reapplication which is why I'm only giving 4 stars.
1,"Thayer's, a venerable  Westport, Connecticut company, has invented an extremely satisfying and effective alternative to plain old witch hazel, well known for its astringent, mild exfolliant, and cleansing properties.  This cocktail for the skin really does smell like fresh rose petals, which is both amazing and expected since it is made with ... Purified Rose Water!  There is no alcohol-like smell; in fact, thre is no alcohol.  I won't repeat all the ingredients since Amazon.com helpfully lists them in the ""product description,"" but they include soothing aloe vera, Vitamin E, and grapefruit seed extract.  While the ingredients appear to have moisturizing qualities, I notice and appreciate most the fresh clean feeling I have after using it."
1,"Natural, not heavy, greasy, and doesn't have a perfume odor.  The only drawback is that it stings a bit when getting too close to eye."
1,I've used this Maybelline product for many years; no complaints. Better than most higher-priced eye makeup removers; why pay more?
1,"It is soooo useful for so many things. I use on my hair,eyebrows, eyelashes, and I even oil pull with it for my teeth. I love it"
1,"i love this truly, all-natural moisturizer.  i normally make my own but have stopped because this is so nice.  doesn't leave you oily or feeling weighed down.  I highly recommend it."
1,I got he right color and can just use it when im in a hurry instead of doing the full process my make up routine.
1,"I've tried not using this but I can't live without it! My makeup does not go on the same without it!  I wear this as my moisturizer/primer...one step to flawless skin! Sinks into skin, never greasy and I swear my lines dissapear. Love the Amazon price with subscription saver.  So much more affordable!"
1,"I use this with my Mia, and love it. It's gentle, it's cleansing but not drying and with my Mia really leaves my face feeling like a baby butt."
0,"I already have thick hair but am always looking for more volume. I was impressed by some of the reviews on here an decided to give it a try. I haven't really noticed any difference in my hair. I still continue to use it because it says with continued use your hair can get up to 70% thicker but I don't know. Maybe it only works for people with thinner hair to begin with. It's too expensive for me to buy with no results. I do love the smell and it certainly hasn't damaged my hair and has good ingrediants so I'm going to keep using until I run out. Maybe after I don't use it anymore I'll be able to tell a difference, but as for right now I'm sad to say I'm not thrilled."
1,"I love this oil!I've had trouble with acne for awhile and was looking for a new way to moisturize and calm my skin. Doesn't cause breakouts, but does moisturize very well. Hasn't made my acne disappear (but it's a work in progress) but it has helped calm and nourish my skin!"
1,"I ordered the bigger one but had to return it. Because it was too big for my short hair. But Amazon kindly and quickly replaced my order (I mean, changed to the smaller one), and I could get the product in a short time.. So far, so good. Hair damage is not that serious, very easy to use... I love it so much."
1,"This scent is magical beautiful and not overpowering ,I wore it and went to the mall recently I was amazed how many people approach me asking me what I was wearing what fragrance so I said it called Auric blends Egyptian Goddess  they all liked it wanted to know where I bought it and I said amazon website they were all said wow ,I said you can find it there,the scent made me look like a goddess too felt like cleopatra ,thank you amazon it  will be one of my favorites now."
1,"This product is a great cleanser, the skin after using looks amazing. I have tried other ones, and this is the best."
1,I use only Obagi skin care and my skin looks great.  I get told often what great skin I have.
1,this was recommended by my dermatologist  and I am pleased that she did  It leaves my face so soft and I feel that it is a safe product
1,"I purchased this because it was fragrance free - I hate having my face smelling after using a product.  It goes on easily and the pump dispenses at the right amount - not too much or too little.  It fades in nicely and I can put makeup on fairly soon afterwards.  My face doesn't feel stiff as it does when I don't use product after shower.  So in all, I'm pleased with this purchase."
1,"Good product, received quickly. It is not the most high quality of soap bowls (but do keep in mind the low price), however, it is a good medium grade quality that functions and looks just fine."
1,"Essie has some of the best polish that I've used to date. The brand is long lasting and the colors truly deliver. It's well-worth the few extra bucks it costs. What I love about this color in particular is the natural rosy glow it gives my nails. My nails are short, but this polish delivers a slight pink tint with a long lasting shine (with a top coat, of course).This is one that WON'T Disappoint!"
1,Since i was hearing and reading that orgasm nash blush was the most used and better for most skin types i wanted to try it.  It looks good with my completion (medium light skin) but needed to apply more in order to be more noticeable. But color is good..
1,"Smells like carnations to me (love that scent!) but dries down to a sweet, candy smell, but not rich enough like I would prefer. It's nice - but I won't continue to wear it."
1,"I have been looking for the right size travel carrier for quite some time. And while this pretty well made and bigger than most, the way it opens and closes is awkward. While I would recommend it just for the size and the underside compartment, it's not perfect."
0,I found these difficult to use unless your into burning your hands.  After one use they now reside on my closet shelf until I make my next trip to the GoodWill.
1,just as it says a gentle cleansing bar without soap - therefore no soap film and does not dry skin
1,I keep this in my locker at school and I always put it on because my crush calls me cotton candy now!!!
0,STAY AWAY FROM IT IF YOU WEAR CONTACTS AND HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN. I put this on my face and it felt alright for the first hour. I noticed my eyes started getting irritated and a rash on my forehead. My eyes looks stressed and was red. I didn't put this on the next day and my eyes felt way better and no rash. However my face is red from the irritation from this sunscreen. This product seems like the perfect choice for me:A daily moisturizer that has clinically proven Total Soy Complex and natural light diffusers that work to naturally even out skin toneGentle enough for sensitive skin and daily useOil freeHypoallergenicNoncomedogenic(won't clog pores)but the result turned out to be a bad product for me...I wish I could get my money back. If you wear contacts do not buy this. This product has a very heavy scent that will irritate your eyes and you will be desperate to take your contacts off.....
1,"After considering Bare Minerals for a very long time, I bit the bullet and decided to give it a try. I hate wearing foundation, but I don't have perfect skin, or even really really nice skin. So I have to fake it with make-up. I was coping pretty well with a liquid foundation and concealer from MAC, but really wanted something drier.First of all, using the tap-swirl-buff method the way the DVD advertised resulted in practically no coverage. I had to use more and more to get anywhere, even after using the concealer brush. Because of this, the foundation didn't last too long. Seeing as how I dropped a good chunk of change on Bare Escentuals, I am not too pleased about this.Second, sleeping in this made me feel kind of icky. I wasn't as greasy as I would have been had I slept in my MAC foundation, but grease is grease.Finally, the aforementioned tap-swirl-buff method also covered every surface in my bathroom with a fine patina of medium-beige covered mineral powder. This means I have to clean my bathroom more frequently. How is THAT fair?!To counteract all of the negative points, I would like to say that once the make-up was on and applied and everything, I liked the way it looked. It took me a while to get the blend down pat (I'm multiracial and have an in-between skin shade), but once I got it mixed to a shade I liked, it looked alright. And I was able to spend a day out in the sun and heat and not have a nasty, sticky, oily T-zone. That in itself speaks volumes!Overall, it's not a bad product. But due to my experience with how long it lasts, I'm sticking to my MAC foundation for now. It goes much further, and covers better."
1,"I know a lot of persons have commented on how great these Buf-puf sponges are, but I had to add my own praise.  I had previously tried the regular and found that they were a bit too harsh for my skin (I have both eczema and acne, so my face tended to get extremely sensitive even when I was gentle with the puff).  The gentle is perfect and  I'm happy I bought the 6-pack too.We're currently renovating at home and it feels so nice after dusting, sweeping and mopping every evening to be able to just put a little Cetaphil cleanser on it and just buff off all the dirt....no other scrub product required...I also use the body buf-puf for showering and can't help but feel nice and clean afterwards.A great little product!"
1,"I'm trying a couple of different moisturizers because I don't really see a difference in my skin with Cerave.  This one smells nice, has a sunscreen and is not too heavy. If anything, it might be too light for those of us who experience various skin conditions in the winter.  Good for the price."
1,"The young lady that wrote the first review was incorrect. You can use it on your face and nose. In order to use it for your face, you have to turn the plastic suction piece around. It is reversible. Its an effective product."
1,"Hi,I've been using Cetaphil for years now.  I first bought after reading reviews in Allure magazine and I wasn't disappointed one bit!! It's the best, non drying and non-abrasive cleanser I've ever used... and while it is a bit pricey (I'm pretty cheap lol) it's worth it and the bottle (used by my eldest daughter and myself) lasts us 6 months!  And you can use it without water if you needed too!  It's amazing!Honestly, I will use this stuff forever.  :)LOVE it!"
1,"I have used the bee one and the only good thing is the smell, now this one does make your lips more soft but no smell, so I guess I rather to have my lips soft and looking healthy instead of just smelling good but no effect. so yes I recommend this lip balm."
1,"wonderful in-shower with-conditioner to the max for combing out my 3b curly hair.  Cannot do it with anything else and NEVER use on dry curly hair!  Read up on it, NEVER comb curly hair dry."
1,"I've used this for several years, keeping a tin of it in my suitcase.  Sometimes when I travel it's just not as easy to unwind in the evenings and drift off to sleep.  Some how, this balm helps me relax and fall asleep.  I rub a little on each temple and on my wrist pulse-points.  I've never had anything but positive results regarding calming and my skin."
1,"My hair is long and thick. I've gone through several brushes where either the heft of my hair pulls the pins out of the brushes, or the brushes have needles so close together that pulling them through my hair is torture and a major cause of split ends.This is a great brush just to BRUSH your hair. Gets all the way down to the roots, pulls through the hair easily, and doesn't hurt! The best thing is the brush isn't destroyed - it's still intact after you get done brushing.I know this brush has all kinds of claims for it (ionic, thermal, etc.), and that may all be true, but for me the part that makes a huge difference is that it really IS an ""all purpose"" brush.For five bucks and change (what I spent), it's a good, basic, and useful brush if you have long hair and value your tresses."
1,"This product gives you good coverage without looking heavy or leaving a line of demarcation at your neckline. It doesn't have a chalky or powdery look, and has an added bonus of sunscreen. I usually prefer a cream matte foundation, but this Maybelline Purestay Powder & Foundation gives me excellent results as well. If you find that you need a little extra coverage for whatever reason, this powder also goes on looking natural on top of other cosmetics -- just use a light touch in applying.This makeup has excellent staying power, and that's what really counts. Who has time to keep checking in a mirror and retouching your face all day long? I never once felt the need to do my face again during the day!This is a good value at a fair price. Recommended!"
1,"Cool Water By Zino Davidoff For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Oz.I love this perfume.  It is not to strong and smells fabulous.  I have been using this perfume for years and I like that I can purchase this through Amazon.  Great pricing, shipping, and delivery."
0,I bought this because I've always wanted to try a tinted moisturizer and most reviews seemed ok. I got it and tried it on for less than a month but it is basically thick sunscreen with foundation. It looks whitish on my skin when I first put it on and then looks oily...just like if you would put on sunscree! I wouldn't recommend it.
1,"I have used this brand of iron for years and have always been very happy with them.  I was disappointed in a few of them for the cords were too short, this one is not.  It is however, a bit heavy but I'm used to it.  Heats well, does what I need."
1,This is the best soap I have ever used.  I have many allergies and this one has no perfume added.  I use it all over my body and my face.  LOVE IT!
0,"I buy the DHS fragrance-free shampoo and love it (DHS Clear Shampoo, Fragrance Free - 8 fl oz). I bought this along with it the first time. Unfortunately, I'm highly chemically sensitive and couldn't use this product because it still has a chemical smell. The shampoo has no discernible smell to me."
1,"I love Alba products for being natural and wonderful!  I also love the micro nutrients in the sea minerals.  This moisturizer is great for my dry skin, it tones and leaves my skin feeling great and nice and soft.  It takes a little bit of time to sink in, but it does sink in eventually, and the moisturizing properties last and last.  I love this stuff.I've tried the Olay total effects, and I hated it.  It was heavily perfumed, greasy, and never seemed to sink in.  Alba's is light and MUCH nicer without being greasy, it is much better.  Alba's products are always nice, cruelty free, and natural as well, a MUST HAVE for me.  Great product!  Also you can apply make up cleanly over it once its absorbed after a few minutes.  Really great.  ^^"
1,I thought I would try a different brand because the price was goodon this brush. It works fine it is just that I guess I am just too usedto using the Spornette brushes.
1,"I've searched and tried so many shampoos and conditioners due to itchy scalp.  Some shampoos seemed OK, but after using a few times my scalp was irritated.  I didn't like all the chemicals in the liquid shampoos and conditioners.  Also read some can contribute to hair loss.  I think that is due to the hair follicles having a waxy buildup and pores can't breathe.Enters this simple shampoo bar with few ingredients, how simple and effective this shampoo is!! I was amazed when I use the bar directly on my scalp, swiping a couple times, how much it lathered.  After rinsing off, wasn't sure if needed conditioner, but once I dried my hair, it was so soft and shiny.Though I should mention, my hair, the first week (2-3 shampoos), did take adjusting and seemed a little stringy (a little oily).  The natural oils in the scalp was adjusting to just using this bar shampoo.My hair feels so wonderful, thicker and shinier.  Will buy more of this.  The bar is small (smaller than I expected), but lasts a good long while (equals a 24 oz. bottle of shampoo from what I read).  I store it away from the humid bathroom in a soap holder that keeps it out of standing water.  It will last longer.  I don't use a conditioner, though if I do need to remove shampoo buildup, I would use organic apple cider vinegar and water (2 tbsp. to 1 cup water) as a rinse.So pleased I finally found what works best for me as I do have sensitive skin (dermatitis) and no more itchy scalp."
1,"Again, this soap lathers well & lasts longer than ur average soaps. But I found this bar in particular was more milder than the others I've tried. The scent was alright, reminded me of Jergens original lotion. But it faded really fast. Was disappointed in that. Other than that, it did serve it's purpose."
1,"I have been looking for ""Loving Care"" for years that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. My mom is allergic to both peroxide and ammonia. Unfortunately ""Loving Care"" was discontinued, and it went to black market. Now that ""Clairol Beautiful"" is available, she has switched to this product. No allergies!Just a note: This type of color dye does not last very long in your hair after a few shampoos."
1,"My family had used this product for many years but I had not been able to find it in a long time.  I have old feet, yep, there it is...I have old feet.  They have developed cracks and creases, callouses and snags.  My husband is a diabetic and foot care is of utmost importance for his wellbeing.  Pretty Feet & Hands is a great exfoliant for both of us.  I recommend using this at least once a week, though it can be used daily.  Bye-bye rough, dry, cracked, snags and such.  Hello to smoother, younger, healthier feet!"
1,"Great product, love it, please don't discontinue it or try to improve.  does the job for me now, very convenient to use and pack for travel"
1,"I own two of these, and I'm looking to expand my collection as my hair grows out. I've literally had 0 problems with it. I've never owned a curling iron before this, so I admit, it's something of a learning curve. But, it was simple enough and I look goooooodddd."
1,The product has been around for years and has proven itself to be an excellent makeup remover.  I will continue to purchase it.  Amazon has very good prices and is prompt.
1,"I'm a big fan of Queen Helene's masks for one particular reason: They're as effective as high end brands, and generally work. This mask in particular is great at evening your skin tone, and shrinking your pores if you use it regularly. I use it at least three times a week, and it makes my skin appear healthy and glowing. I'd also, recommend their other mask,Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque, 8 Ounce. It's an excellent mud mask, and its tingling sensation really makes me feel like it's deep cleaning."
1,"smells so amazing and has helped to reduce my large pores, I put it on before my makeup, do feel that it is a very good wrinkle calming solution."
1,"I love Nars makeup and have rarely been disappointed, but this color was a tough one.  NARS eyeshadows are a typical pigment type that doesn't always blend easily.  Dry, they are more subtle; wet, they can be really full-force in color intensity.  This color was a tough one for me.  I am very fair and my skin can go to peaches and cream/ruddiness and I think it brings out the worst in me.  On a darker olive complexion or any dark complexions it might be really attractive but on me it sort of looked like my eyelids were about to bleed from the inside."
1,"I was skeptical at first about this product..thinking that it would not be enough for my problem oily skin. After reading all the positive reviews from other people with skin like mine, i took a chance. I'm so glad i did! I'll never go back to using harsh chemicals on my face again. This is perfect for oily skin..believe it or not! It gently & effectively cleanses the skin of any dirt & oil..leaving your face feeling so smooth & refreshed! I also noticed that it actually clears up any pimples and blemishes too. I'll be using this for LIFE!"
1,This is the only cream I buy that actually smells like roses. It's not overbearing. It's the same Rose Milk I'd sneak and rub all over my body when I was little and my favorite aunt used to come and visit.
1,"I love this cream.  I use it in the morning and evening.  As a result of using this product, my skin feels smooth and soft."
1,"If you have lame genetic acne (like me!) that does whatever it wants, you NEED to try this moisturizer. All the topical treatments dry my skin out to flake off like a gosh dang lizard lady - and this is one of the very few things that works on gross flaky skin. More importantly, because this stuff sorted out my lizard skin, i'm way less likely to pick my face, and therefore way less likely to introduce bacteria to screw up my clear-ish skin. And let's not forget that acne treatments (retinoid creams, accutane, benzoyl peroxide) make your skin way more likely to burn so this SPF is killer.It has also lasted me for waaaaay longer than i expected! I use it maybe twice a day and a single bottle is still going strong after 6 months. It works fine under some primer and makeup as well.Eucerin: Great for lizard people, lasts forever, just the best everyday facial moisturizer on the market"
1,"I have been buying this cream for my husband . he has varicose veins and suffers alot, itching and pain in his legs. Thisis the only product that makes him feel  fine,  so I will continue buying it, it is really good for people with varicose veins really good.Excellent"
1,"We love this shampoo.  I know a few people had said that it caused itching and irritation on there dog.  I have a Jack Russell, short coat.  I have been using it for awhile and we haven't seen any problems. I would say if your dog has sensitive skin, this might not be for you. The bottle pictured is different from what you will receive.  I guess they changed the original but shampoo is the same.  No ""wet rat"" smell here after the bath.  Nice scent!"
1,"excellent product,received in excellent conditions higly recommended if u want to give it to your girl,mine went crazy with this perfume.Higly recommended"
1,"This product gave me amazing results. Two years ago I had the Brazilian blowout done and my hair never looked so good. The BB was supposed to last about 3 months, but it's two years later and my curl is still gone, and now I have extremely frizzy hair, that is now broken and damaged because I have to flat iron everyday. I started using As I Am cowash, and that helped but I needed something to strengthen my hair since I have to flat iron my hair so much. I have to say that I absolutely love what this has done for my hair. I still use my heat protectant before using the flat iron for added protection but my hair now looks as good as it did when I first got the Brazilian blowout done. It's important for anyone using this product to know that you shouldn't use it everyday because it will actually do the opposite of what it's supposed to do. I use it twice a week and the cowash takes care of my hair in between uses. I highly recommend this product for anyone struggling with extremely dry and damaged hair."
1,"This is a beautiful, vibrant shimmering crimson red. I have included a picture. Used flash to take picture, so there is a lot of glare from the polish.So far my favorite of the red shades from Opi but I have not tried them all yet. I received numerous compliments more so than for any other color of polish I have tried recently. Like all Opi polishes, this polish dries fast and is long wearing (with a good base coat and top coat)."
1,"Omg I love amazon.com this came in two days the fastest ever, I decided to try this eyeliner I give it 5 stars, had it on for 8 hours...not a drop was gone. I have oily skin and my eyes will not hold eye liner that long..this works nice for oily skin....love love,love."
1,"I was looking for a color similar to OPI's Lincoln Park After Dark, and this really hit the mark. It's a great quality product, and the color is pretty true to the photo."
0,"This perfume should be selling for about $20.00. There is nothing outstanding about the scent. I do not know what the rave is about with this perfume. It doesn't last long, the bottle is not attractive and the scent is normal. I am disapponted withDonna Karan.. pull up your socks!!.. you will lose your customers"
0,I dont like this stuff at all. I dont feel fresh.  I have tried other brand that actually works.  I will be going back to that one. Very disappointed :-(
1,"I really like the highlights that i get from this light brown on very dark 4b hair. But, it does not cover grey."
0,"i haven't completely used this yet but i brought this to make me slimmer, and it doesn't do that. the jar only says for cellulite."
1,This tooth gel is amazing. I love the natural ingredients. I love that its minty like and not fruit flavored.
1,"I have been using Great Lash by Maybelline for a *long* time, and I have tried mascaras from Chanel, MAC, Shiseido, and many more.  This is actually my favorite of basically everything I have tried so far, and is under $5!  It makes my eyes pop, goes on dark and smooth and doesn't clump at all.  This is also the only ""non-premium"" make-up product that I use on a daily basis.  The rest of my cosmetics are from Bare Escentuals, MAC, Chanel, etc.As far as I allergies go, I was surprised to read about all of the allergic reactions on here.  I am very sensitive to cosmetics, wear contacts and have *severe* allergies, but this mascara has never been a factor.  I've actually had much more expensive mascaras give me a reaction, but not this one.  I guess it just depends on the person.  However, I think it is worth a shot for under $5, and if you're not allergic, you will more than likely make this a life-long product."
1,"Great bronzer, super natural looking.. Never ""dirty,"" or ""orange."" This stuff is great! I have purchased this repeatedly and I rarely buy the same product twice. I'm always looking for something better... so that says a lot. Have not found any bronzer to match the natural-ness of this. I apply it w/ my MAC187 on the forehead/temple/cheekbone area. Gives definition/dimension to my round Asian face. Love it!"
1,"The Sex Bomb seems to be the top rated bomb from Lush, and for good reason.  The first thing that happens when this delectable bomb meets the water is the fizzle... and then the rice paper flower blooms... just like a woman coming into her own.  The scent hits you next which is almost illicit in its intoxicating smell, taking your mind to places not for public viewing.  The one and only downfall to this naughty and wonderful sin is the hot pink velvety water has a tendency to stain some tubs so make sure you have some cleaner ready - oh and make sure that your man of the hour is on standby, you won't want to be lonely after this!  FYI: Remove paper flower before running off with loverboy/girl otherwise the mess is quite icky!"
1,this color is a great spring color.. a lot of the clients at my school choose this color! it goes on nice and smooth!
1,"I'm sure this is a great bursh, bu for me it is too stiff for me.  I don't have a sensitive scalp, but I feel like I do when I use this brush . . . I've never experienced that before."
1,This is a good lotion/moisturizer. I use it on my face because I have extra sensitive and combination/oily skin. I am proud to say that this lotion does not break me out and it helps to control my oil in a way (even though its not oil free). I recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin but if you have EXTREMELY oily skin I would say this may not be for you because it helps with oil about 85%.
1,"Let me first start off by saying (like many others) that I have tried almost every single acne product out there, from Retin A to Proactive, to Salicylic acid, to Oxy pads to Clearasil and nothing has ever worked. My doctor told me the only thing that would ever ""cure"" acne is Acutane, which I did not want to use.  I have used products containing benzoyl peroxide before, but have only used facial treatments containing up to 5%.  When I came across the 10% bar and all the positive reviews that came with it I thought I'd give it a shot.  Yes, it is drying. Yes, you do need to use a moisturizer. Yes, it is working!!!  I use this bar in the morning and at night and although my face isn't totally clear,  within the first week of using I have noticed a big difference. I hope it continues to make my face even more happier as time goes by!---------------UPDATE 1/7/13This is probably the most effective product I've used in over 10 years. Helps clear blemishes and manage skin tone. I use it once a day and gone though almost 3 bars since my original review, so it does last awhile. Hope they continue to keep this product on the market."
1,"Excellent product! Taste is disgusting enough to deter biting. Like others have said, it can interfere with finger foods. Only problem is it isn't as glossy a most topcoats, so a mani doesn't look as good with this painted over."
1,"I like Jason products. I misread the description, so I gave this to my mom. It's hand soap. Lol. Jason is a good product and easy to recommend. I just don't like how fake it smells."
1,I bought this soap to help out with my son's psoriasis and it works. It does have that tar smell in which I do not mind and neither does he. As long as it gets the job done to loosen and remove those scales.
1,"So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth. It is not heavy and does not leave a residue."
1,"There's a history of ingrown toe nails in my family so I make sure to take good care of my toes. There's nothing beautiful about this file, I would actually describe it as plain and ugly (my preference are products that serve the purpose and look nice!) but boy, does it do the job! Its perfectly shaped to file the sides of my toe nails and does that with such ease that I have to give it five stars."
1,I was surprised that it did so well.  I guess I shouldn't have been.  After all it is a Neutrogena product!
1,"My dermatologist recommended this brand of spf 30 for daily use because I have Rosecea.  I love this brand because it gives me a nice fresh glow if I don't wear makeup and it is easily worn under makeup because it's not greasy.  I've tried many other brands and probably my 2nd choice would be Eucerine's spf30 for face.  But I still say this is the best because it doesn't feel like you've got sunscreen on.  It seems to stay on well during exercise too, because I alway put it on when I go for bike rides and never burn."
1,"It's just okay, it doesn't work with some nail polishes like Essie.  I had to go back to my Essie base instead of this."
1,"I've tried more expensive lotions and creams on my face, but I really love this one. It leaves my face feeling and looking very soft. I also love the way you just pump the top and the moisturizer comes out....you don't have to dip your fingers in a jar or touch what's left in it. All creams and lotions and such should be this way...I hate having to dig out cream in a jar with my fingers not knowing if I've left any germs in the remaining cream. I recommend this."
1,"I purchased this over a year ago because I had so many post-acne hyperpigmentation marks on my face, including really dark and noticeable spots. I used this product for some time and for whatever reason, I moved on from it and stopped using it. I do remember it being decent, I don't remember why I did halt using this. Fast forward many months, I decided, ""I purchased this, why not employ the contents to completion?"" I've been utilizing this for a few weeks now (solely on my face), and have really seen a difference. I'm not exaggerating when I say that every day in the last few weeks that I've applied this to my face, when I wake up and look in the mirror to see if any changes have occurred, I do observe that the post-acne spots have either disappeared or have diminished some what in tone. So people might want to know, what is my skin color? Because this product might have a greater impact on some skin tones over others. This is probably true, probably not. My facial skin color is that of a tanned brown skin-color.For the people who've recorded no results and have seen no visible improvement in their appearance here are some tips that I've carried out in hopes of ameliorating my post-acne skin condition:1) Wash your face at least twice a day (especially if you have either oily skin or medium-oily skin). I know this is difficult to do. For me, I come home after 11pm many times, and I'm too tired to brush my teeth, let alone wash my face, but this is vital in keeping up the fight for advancing the changes you want to see on your face.2) You have to allow the fade milk product to sit on your face for many hours at a time. For me, if I'm not leaving the house for whatever reason, I try to keep this on my face for AT LEAST 7-8 hours. I can keep it on for as much as 10 hours. You want the maximum effect of this item, and the only way it can do that is if you allow it contact with your face for a substantial period of time. 4-5 hours isn't going to cut it and I wouldn't be surprised if the results produced weren't too noticeable or impressive.3) Ignore the ""sunscreen"" claim on this product. Firstly, it doesn't tell you how much SPF is on this thing, so you don't know how much time this fade milk is allowing you protection from the sun. Secondly, and this is important, it makes no mention of UVA and UVB protection, because it doesn't have any. And third of all, and this is also a significant point: this has hydroquinone in it. Hydroquinone is the lightening/bleaching agent. Anybody who's done some of the most basic research on lightening agents, like hydroquinone, knows that you're not supposed to be out in the sun when it's sitting on your skin. It's counterproductive. In fact, they warn you that bleaching agents can have the opposite effect when you're exposed to the sun, it can actually make your skin darker, not lighter. When I know that I'm going to go outside, especially for an extended period of time, I almost never use this product, and certainly never for its sunscreen purposes.4) When you sleep, sleep on your back. This goes for any product that you apply topically. I used to apply so many products on my face only to consciously sleep on my sides a few hours later. Like using bleaching agents and then exposing yourself to the sun, this also defeats the purpose. Most of the product is going to be swept away on your pillow case as opposed to being on your face, working. I know that sleeping on your back is not the most comfortable position for some people, especially if you, like me, have suffered with asthma before. First control your asthma (this is vital) and sleep on your back. This will ensure that the probability of the contents of the product staying on your face as opposed to being scraped away is higher.5) The directions instructs you to ""apply a small amount as a thin layer on the affected area..."" Booooooring. I usually apply a liberal amount on the hyperpigmentation spots after each time I wash my face.6) Drink a lot of water. It does not matter what product you use, using them is only part of the battle. Your skin is like a child, you have to constantly tend to it by hydrating it. I drink so much water, my urine is more clear than the polluted tap water I drink.7) Think also about purchasing a sunscreen like AMBI (Skincare Even & Clear Daily Moisturizer with SPF 30). It's a legit sunscreen that also evens your skin tone, so that should complement this product, when you're looking to go outside. It also contains vitamins C & E (which are important for the skin) and it's also recommended by the Skin Care Foundation.8) For the guys, shave your face at least every other day. The facial hair catches the product as opposed to the skin, so applying this product on a face that has facial hair is not as effective as it would be if your face were smooth and free from any facial obstacles.9) Lastly, you MUST get sufficient sleep (at least 8 hours worth). Sleeping rejuvenates both your body and especially your skin. I've had episodes where I washed my face, coated it with facial products and then woke up some hours later, horrified with what was staring back at me. I didn't allow my body and skin enough time to relax and recover.It annoys me when people rate products on here and yet don't explain in details why they graded it the way they did. I rated this product four stars out of five due to my perception of this product working properly. The reason why I didn't award it the full five stars is because this isn't a perfect solution. You do have to give it time to work. Also, I'm not convinced that this alone will lighten your skin and diminish the post-acne marks. This is only one part of a larger process that should include both natural and supplemental means to enhance your skin's appearance, from drinking a sufficient amount of water daily to eating healthily to using other (hopefully safe) even-toned/lightening skin products when you're not utilizing this one, to getting a sufficient amount of sleep, etc. So this alone won't do.The company recommends that you use it for 3 months and discontinue use if you see no apparent results. Most people aren't going to wait 3 months, let's face it. We live in an instant-gratification era where we want what we want when we want it. And here, we want to see results and quickly. Use this for 2-3 weeks constantly, like I advised above. Wash your face twice a day, apply this twice a day (if you can), leave it on for many hours at a time, sleep on your back (and get at least 8 hours), etc. If you don't think you'll be able to decipher whether or not your skin has improved, take pictures beforehand and use that as a measurement."
1,"Great neutral color to match all your outfits. I have light brown skin and it looks so nice. Needless to say, I am never disappointed by OPI's quality."
1,"Remember the movie Annie Hall and her black soap? I was always intrigued about it and I think this may well be it. It cleans very well, however.... it does smell like a fire pit. I bought it after reading it helps eczema and psoriasis on the face, and for fungal/yeast problems in the skin, like melasma.Some people swear by it... I'm not sure if I'll be swearing BY it, or AT it, just yet. I will say, it does get all the dried up skin and oil off and leaves the skin feeling very clean, tight and smooth.Four stars for performance... two for the fragrance."
1,"i have may of these and cannot imagine using anything else. i even have one in my beach bag so that i can comb through my hair when wet to keep from nasty beach tangles. whether my hair is straight or curly, this glides right through with far less effort than other products"
1,I bought this along with the Cucina wire set that holds Cucina soap and lotion in a cute wire holder.  I've refilled the set 3 times and still have a lot of soap left.  It's a green way to use Cucina soap and I love that.
1,Cetaphil cream is always in my bathroom and I've been using it for 4+ years. I use it during all seasons to keep my skin soft and moisturized. I have sensitive skin and I normally need hypoallergenic cosmetics/skin care products and this is moisturizing yet super gentle and leaves my arms and legs feeling soft like a baby's bum.
1,its good my arms get tired of holding it so idk but its a nice blow dryer bu it doe
0,"Doesn't heat up enough.  I had it on my hair for 20 seconds without it feeling hot to the touch, on the highest setting.The on/off buttons are in the way and I turned it off by mistake at least 3 times just trying to curl the front of my hair, before I gave up and used another iron.I did get a cute curl once, but it went away by the time I did the next strand.  I knew I hated Revlon curlers, but this was the biggest one I could find at the store.  Hopefully the store will take the curling iron back unwrapped."
1,"Plain, classy, opaque - kind of white, but still light.  Looks good with everything.  I have short nails and it looks very nice."
1,Good stuff and creamy and soft but have other stuff that works great and is much cheaper and would buy again and again.  Not going to purchase this again due to high cost and other things out there that are just as good if not better.
1,I love Essie. This color is amazing. It lasts longer and dries. Pretty fast. Worth the few extra bucks that you pay.
1,"Ok, this is my first steamer and being the little impulse buyer that I am---I now have no idea why I bought it. If the goal is open pores then a 10-minute shower would accomplish that.But, no matter...(lol).I still like it. I put a couple drops of peppermint oil in it, throw a towel over my head and I'm completely steamed out.Heats fast. Very easy to put together. Directions simple to comprehend.I have no complaints."
0,"it's rose smell does the work for 'rose toner' but the result i got.. wasn't as what i expected. i bought this product because one of my friend is using it. she uses it well and recommended to me. since we both have sensitive skin and so i thought this should be good for me... yet who knows each individual is still different. my face started to have break-out and i patiently use it for about 6 months.. nothing gets better. not even toning feel. and the cap is so loose that whenever i accidentally flip over, it spilt all the time. now i just keep it aside and using Neutrogena from drug store. it's cheap and so i think you get what you paid for."
1,"I discovered this tanning lotion  any years ago,  it's the only tanning lotion that my daughter can use.  She is faired skin and this lotion gives her a nice tran without getting a sun burn."
1,I purchased this for my tween so she could get the hang of feeding small amounts of hair into a curler. This is great for short to medium hair lengths. I have long hair and it takes a long long time to do my hair with it but it does a fine job of polishing my pony.
1,I had heard on Dr. Oz that this is a triple threat for wrinkles. I have seen an improvement. Not drastic but it is working. You need to use it everyday 2 X a day.That is how I use it.
1,"Very gentle on the skin, yet cleans well and refreshes. I would highly recommend to anyone regardless of skin type!"
1,"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.Yes, it stings my eyes to high heaven. Yes, it smells like a hospital. Yes, it feels so watery that it possibly can't be hydrating. But can it? YES IT CAN!I love this product, even though it stings my eyes like crazy. Why? Because it's the best moisturizer I've ever used. Not only is it light weight but it's not greasy AT ALL. I have oily/combination skin and this moisturizer keeps my cheeks nice an moist without making my T zone all oily. Honestly, it's so weird how quickly my face absorbs this stuff after I clean my face at night. Most moisturizers take a while to soak it and when you apply too much, it stays on the surface kind of acting like an oil slick. And when you wear glasses, that gets annoying fast when your glasses keep sliding off your oily nose. Not with Hope in a Jar.If you can get over a little pansy eye burning and the chemical smell, this stuff is GREAT."
1,"This product relaxes the curl of virgin hair and further relaxes chemically treated hair safely. I have bought every expensive consitioner that you can imagine and none of them can do what this stuff does. It is the ultimate, natural conditioner that coats hair, especially hair that is stripped and damaged. It makes the hair easier to comb, shiny, soft and detangled. I found this in the beauty supply for $4.50. It is sooo simple to use. My recipe is:1. Mix the powder with about 1 1/2 cup of coffee, eucalyptus, peppermint, cammomile and green teas boiled together in a plastic bowl. You can mix the boiled herbs and the powder together and let it cool.2. When the mixture has cooled, you can add avocado, egg yolk, mayonaise and a cheap thick base conditioner.3. The natural henna powder does not change the hair's color and is safe to leave on the hair for many hours at a time. The longer you leave it on, the straighter your hair will become, no lie. Make sure to get a few thin, clear shower caps from your local beauty supply when using this. This locks in the moisture to the hair and it catches the water. If your mixture is too soupy, it will run down your neck and ruin your clothes.4. Leave the mixture on for as many hours as you like, but some people prefer to leave it on for just 4 hours. This product will not make your hair like brillo like some henna products.5. You can shampoo your hair and use a cheap conditioner such as Aussie Deeep Conditioner Treatment to get the herbs to rinse out of the hair. This mixture is extremely gritty and a tad difficult to wash out. If you don't rinse this out correctly, you will have a gritty scalp and and follow up with treatments such as Phto Vital Force, Ojon Two Minute Mask, Ouidad Mediteranean Treatment or even Treseme Mud Mask.Use this henna as often as you like. I use this every other day for hours at a time. Makes hair super easy to detangle and provides a coating for the hair that has been stripped by perms and chemicals. Do a skin test first behind your ear for an hour. If you have no reaction, you should be good to go! Many hair blessings to you!"
1,"I have this in the ALL NIGHT LONG shade. It is a nice shade: plummy/wine semi-sheer. It goes on nice, but barely lasts fifteen minutes. My biggest gripe aside from the price is that this gloss had a nasty smell and taste. Like burnt plastic. Just YUCK!"
0,"I used to buy this and use it without lucky.  Seems like when I lived in San Francisco it did the trick, but in dry arid Colorado the product isn't rich enough.  I could put it on 3-5 times a day and it didn't help.  I switched to an organic macadamia nut oil product called Bee Nuts and have had great luck with it."
1,"This is the first curling iron i ever used.. and i am not planning to purchase anything else.I had a problem with the Auto on/off button at the beginning since my hand kept on pushing it by mistake, but now that i know the proper way of holding it it doesn't bother me much.i use a heat protectant so i didn't notice any damage to my hair, on the contrary, my curls ended up being soft and shiny!"
1,"Last year I posted a comment on Jessica H's review (the first review here) basically thanking her for the update she posted about using the Softcup with an IUD. Finally after a year of waiting, pondering and pondering some more I tried it last night. I'm going to be completely honest I was extremely hesitant, not about assaulting my lady parts but already having the IUD and now throwing some other foreign device in the mix. If you have an IUD you'll remember for the first week or two your uterus would make an attempt to force your body to expel the IUD well when you use the Softcup a similar process will happen. A little background on me I have had my Paragard IUD for 3 years, I have a tilted uterus and I have had one child (vaginal birth). For me it was not to difficult to insert, I got it in on the 2nd attempt making sure to secure it behind the pelvic bone, I took 2 Aleve (to reduce the slight cramping) and went to bed, had no problems, discomfort or leakage overnight and I had just started my period. The Softcup will mold to your body and although the company says you won't feel it if it's inserted correctly but you will specifically if you have a tilted uterus even if it is inserted correctly. You will also feel it if you have a full bladder.Now here's the fun part, I seem to hear the most horror stories about taking it out. I took Jessica H's advice and just used a glove and used my middle finger to find the ring and I slowly pulled it forward and low and behold it came out with no problems. Once you start pulling your body will pretty much help by forcing it out. I emptied it and wrapped the glove around it and threw it away, it was not a messy or uncomfortable experience.  In all honestly I think this device works fine with an IUD, however I would not try it unless you've had an IUD for at least a year. You just don't want to many new foreign objects in the lady parts at once.Part 2: I am on my second day and my heaviest day and I inserted at around 6:30 am and had to change around 2:45 pm, only to have to worry about changing 1 time at work on my heaviest day is unreal for me. The only downside was I forgot my glove so needless to say it was an adventure but I was able to grab the ring and pull it out with no problems. I was pretty confident in the product and my own insertion of it that I did not use any back up and I had no leaks the entire day. I can tell when I did remove it that it worked it's way a little further than when I inserted it which is a good thing. As it did exactly as it was supposed to do.I did lots of research (videos, Softcup website and forums) to read other's experiences and what they have done and product likes/dislikes. I suggest you read the instructions enclosed and you should be fine. As with every new product things will take time to use and perfect. Personally I like it and will continue to use it and I am completely sold on a product that nearly scared me to death I now think is the best thing to happen to me."
1,I have used this product for several years and have not found a better shower oil.  It is cheaper to buy it at Amazon than my local drug store.
0,"I took these vitamins for more than six months and during that time I did not notice any enhanced hair growth or any noticeable improvement in my skin and nails though I was on a very healthy diet, drinking plenty of water and exercising regularly at the time.  I stopped using them and decided to try getting the needed nutrients from natural sources so I turned to  eating a breakfast consisting of  wheat germ, wheat germ oil, milk, an egg and fresh fruits daily followed up with healthy servings of vegetables and yogurts and plenty of water for the remainder of my meals, and it was only then that I noticed improvements in my skin, hair and nails.  My hair texture has improved, it is growing above average, my dry skin and scalp have normalized, my complexion has cleared and I have a lot of energy.  It is more than one year later, and these improvements are still there, and it is cheaper on my pockets."
1,"I initially bought this after reading all the raves!  My acne has not changed one bit after using this twice a day for a little over 1 month of consistent usage.  It is really great for taking makeup off, with only some eyeliner residual left behind.  Since it is cheap, this is a great alternative to cleansing oils, as the Origins brand is expensive and just as comparable.  It is best to transfer it into a foam pumper or else I really don't know how others are managing its watery mess!  A little goes a long way (just one pump).  I still give it 3 stars since it does a good job taking makeup off and making your face feel clean.  I have yet to see any acne clearing benefits!"
0,"it is way to strong for my face, i had use a dime size all over my wet face and then rinse,after i look in the mirror my face was red all over.it went straight in the garbage,but what i do like is clean and clear blackhead eraser scrub,it smell really good and leaves my face super soft,so i will continue to use clean and clear blackhead eraser scrub,as for the clean and clear continuous control acne cleanser never again will i put that crap on my face."
1,"I love this hair color, have use it for many years. I am more then 50% gray and after 20-30 min it covers it all up.  It leaves your hair smelling good and really shiny and doesn't dry out your hair like other hair colors."
1,"Many eyeliners boast that they stay on all day and are waterproof but they aren't.  Ultraliner is actually one of the few exceptions.  Don't spend a bunch of money on an eyeliner that promises to be good.  Ultraliner is actually great.  I'm not sure what the formula is, but it stays on kind of like a permanent glove.  It was even snowing and blowing in my face making my eyes water really bad, but when I looked the eyeliner did not run and was still on.  I tried it on my hand and noticed that it dries right away.  It dries to a material that can actually kind of be peeled off as needed.  If you try to rub it, it won't come off.  It did not really budge with water either.  Amazingly you can still take it off when you are ready.  It does not run in your eye and I noticed unlike some eyeliners that get all over your lower lashes causing marks under your eye, Ultra Liner does not do that.  I've had this eyeliner a long time and it still works.  You may just want to clean the wand off though to prevent a sticky buildup.  I've had more expensive liners that were just terrible.  You can find Ultra Liner mostly any department or pharmacy type store and online here.  My only caution is do not confuse the Line Works liner with this - they are not the same and the Line Works is terrible."
1,Forget makeup removal tissues!  I have used these for years.  They do exactly the job and do not make my face peel.
1,I gues it works taking off makeup and mascara but it dried my skin out real bad and I have oily skin but my skin was just too dry
1,"I got wife the tiny sampler to see if she liked it, and she did so it looks like I may be getting a bottle next time around"
1,"Seriously, between my eyes, I see a huge difference when I use these. I can forget for a few days and then, WHOA, I am back on them. They stick nicely and come off only when I decide to take them off. They work by immobilizing the muscle...like botox but naturally letting the muscle become lax because it isn't always being used...the anti-workout. I use them all over my face where I notice expression lines and am a huge proponent. I am too broke for botox, but honestly, these work just as well for me. I am 42"
1,Another awesome face mask ...peel off this time. It has a cooling effect as soon as you apply it. Feels great on the skin..it's perfect after a hot summer day or a day on the beach. Smells like fresh cucumber ...I was surprised how much I loved it !
1,"My skin has changed so much as I get older and I knew I needed a serum.  I've used Olay's products in the past and this one the company said on the box they have improved it.  This cost less than in the stores for me.  It's been over two weeks and already my face and neck is doing better.  My skin's smoother looking and feels smooth.  I am waiting to see if it helps with fine lines, even out my skin tone and whatever else it claims it can do.  I just follow what it says on the box.  AND it's fragrance free!  Since I can't spend $50 or more on the department store versions right now, I can fall back on this brand for sure!"
1,"I'm just adding to the mass of comments like mine, but here's another for the cause: i have fair-ish skin with dark freckles and dark hair and eyebrows.  this looks pretty darn good on me.  It's shimmery, yes, and it just might not be your thing.  if you're skin isn't bumpy you probably won't hate it.  With shimmer it can accentuate lines and &#34;problems&#34; (acne or pock marks), but it's still a great product for night if you want an easy One-Product-Application.My bottom line- if you're worried about the price don't buy it; if you're open for the risk or could give it to a friend if you hate it, give it a try!  Odds are pretty good you'll like it."
1,I only need five rollers and they must be large.  This is the set.  This is actually my second set.  The first one was purchased in a store years ago and the felt had rubbed off so it was time for a new set.  My go to rollers.
0,"I am extremely disappointing with this one. When I went to use the product is has this horrible fish smell... I am not one to normally complains about smells.. it was really really bad. I wanted to see if it would work anyway, so I tested it on some lashes ( to see if it would get tacky, never touched my face with it) and it wouldn't work at all. I have used this product in the past and I loved it, I have been through many tubes of it. This one was expired and I would honestly call it rancid. I threw it right away. I will buy it at Sally's where I normally buy it, this seller ships expired products.. not ok!!!"
1,No grease or oil. Just a nice leave in conditioner that deals with dry looking frizzy hair. Worked with my hair type - good stuff!
1,"Ok I have to admit, I read the reviews more than the description... so to those of you whom may be a little like me. FYI: There are 3 brushes in this package! I bought two sets thinking I was buying two brushes.Ok on to the review. Wow, no more tangles. I was constantly getting snags and tangles with my old brush. I've replaced every single one I have in the house now in favor of these beauties. Its not painful, I've noticed a HUGE HUGE difference in static. There is none now!! I'm so happy with these I wish they'd last forever. Since I just bought them I know they will last for quite a bit longer, but still I morn in advance the day my brushes will need to be replaced."
1,I've tried Thayers witch hazel in peach and rose. Rose (alcohol free) was fantastic. Peach dried my skin out.Thayers witch hazel is great stuff and I cannot recommend it highly enough. I simply do wish the peach and lemon varieties were alcohol free.
0,"maybe I expected too much, but even putting it on right on my orange hair, leaving it on, mixing it into shampoo or hair color, the discoloration did not leave my hair. Carrot top!"
0,"cheap. oily. and makes my skin break out. I don't even see an expiration date. Its like wearing a mask on your face all day. Just go to cosco and buy the new stuff, it prolly works better in the long run. I don't even use this anymore. Does anyone check for the expiration date anyway?"
1,"I switched to more natural products once I got pregnant, and sorely missed my Secret Clinical Strength Deodorant. All the natural deodorants I tried were insufficient at blocking smell or minimizing sweat, and they all smelled terrible combined with body odor. Finally I found Crystal deodorant, and it was the very best option for me while pregnant. (Crystal goes on so nicely, and you can't feel you're even wearing deodorant, and it minimizes odor very well, so it's also worth a try!)While pregnant, I got this Home Health unscented deodorant, and it didn't work for me at all, so I went back to Crystal deodorant. Now that I've had my baby, I no longer feel the Crystal deodorant lasts as long as I want it too (it can be hard to shower regularly enough with a brand-new baby) and you can't reapply Crystal without cleaning off the odor first. I went ahead and tried this Home Health deodorant again, now that I'm no longer pregnant, and I absolutely love it now! It lasts all day, you can easily reapply even if you're starting to smell and it deals with the odor easily. I have no idea what the difference was hormonally that made Crystal better during pregnancy and this better for postpartum, but I'm very glad to have both in my medicine cabinet, and you really ought to try both of them, if you're looking for natural EFFECTIVE deodorants."
1,"Not the best looking, but its good for the price. Seems sturdy enough and is the perfect dimensions for my purposes"
1,"I'm still trying to decide how I feel about this conditioner.  The first time I used it I loved it.  My hair looked shiny and had a lot of body- a treat considering how thin and fine my hair is.  But after a few uses, I started to feel some sticky buildup on my scalp and noticed that my hair started looking especially limp and flat.  For this reason, I'm thinking this might be a good product for occasional deep-conditioning rather than as a daily conditioner.  It does have a really nice scent, no synthetic fragrances, just the light herbal scent of the plant oils in the conditioner."
1,This is gentle enough for my child to use in the bath each night. I order the lavender kind also.
1,I ordered the Melon Daiquiri and the Margarita one.  They both smell true to their names and are really great.  They came a couple days than before I expected.  It was really great surprise because I was expecting them a to take a little longer.  Nothing was wrong with the product and I am very happy with the money I spent on this.
1,"This is a very mature scent, but can be overwhelming and heavy, so you should use sparingly."
1,"We may not have everything the famous folk have but we can have JLo's fragrance, &quot;Still,&quot; which is luscious - sexy yet serene, light yet sensual.&quot;Still&quot; is a floral scent with a difference - the bouquet includes, Freesia, Rose, Jasmine and Orange Blossom. Sound innocent? Not at all because there are hints of Sake, White Pepper, Sandalwood and Musk. An amazing combination.It comes in a jewel-like flacon, faceted it is reminiscent of an antique fragrance bottle.I would recommend it for both evening and day wear."
1,"I absolutely love this product.  Several months ago my hair was bascially destroyed through overprocessing.  Huge amounts of breakage and my hair looked like straw.  After switching hairdressers I had a keratin treatment, deep conditioning treatment and purchased several rounds of organic keratin shampoo, conditioner and leave in treatment.  The Keratin products put out by Loma are excellent, however I will say this, Aubrey Organic Blue Green Algae Hair Mask in my opinion made a great deal of difference in the health of my hair.  Not only did it look healthy after a treatment, but my hair was so soft.  I am in my 40's and my friend was floored when she felt my hair.  It is just so soft and healthy looking (even though the ends still had a great deal of breakage-you couldn't tell). The most I can do for the damaged hair is wait for it to grow out.  This product is so affordable, the only negative aspect is the amount you are getting. I got 4-5 treatments and my hair is fairly long but thin.  I wish it came in a bigger size, I would definitely buy.  I put the product into my dry hair, work it through before bed, wrap it and wash it out the next morning.  Unbelievable results and it's organic (what more could you ask for)."
1,"This was an in-store impulse buy for me. I was shopping with my friend when she saw this on the shelf and started gushing over saying it was her absolute FAVORITE moisturizer. She told me I HAD to try it, so I did.She was right! This moisturizer works well and is LIGHT. I personally hate putting on thick lotion after getting out of my shower. I put this on and my skin absorbs it super quick. It is refreshing and won't weigh you down.I absolutely love the summery coconut fragrance. The bottle says, ""its best when fresh. Keep from freezing and high heat."" I assume the reviewers who said negative things about the odor received a bottle with expired content. I'm not sure if I would want to order this online for that reason. (At least not in the winter, as I live in VT --it is bound to freeze).The best part? No animal testing. Yay!I highly recommend this product."
1,"I really love this face soap. My stepmom turned me on to it when I was a teenager (it is what she used) to battle acne...It was such a miracle worker. It is really gentle and soft. The scent is really light too. My face feels clean but not destroyed - you know how many facial products &#34;clean&#34; your face, but then after, it's like every trace of the good oils on your skin were just stripped away? Well, this leaves the good stuff on your face so you feel clean but soft. I know it is a pricier soap, but a little bit goes a very, very long way. I literally just take my wet hand and rub it ONCE on the soap which gets enough soap to clean my face. I have also used it on my body when I ran out of  Dr. Bronner's, and it feels great on the body, too (but I am too cheap to use it as a body soap!). I highly recommend this. I have been using this for over 20 years now."
1,"I love this machine. Could I say anymore...I will. I like to keep my face clean, and steam is the easiest, safest and more effective way to do this. It really clears the pores and gets all the gunk out, while adding moisture to the skin, then I rinse with cool water and put on a mask and my skin is happy and clean. You can use it every day, or night and the results will be amazing.It works well for your sinuses too. I put this on my counter and lean over it, just don't wiggle it or hit it while it is on. It has been safe for me and heats up fast. I really love my machine.The brush was great, it worked well to cleanse before the steam, but it isn't waterproof and eventually broke."
1,"Sensitive skin is a problem. This product works well with no bad reactions. It has a faint smell, but that lessened after a couple weeks"
1,"I love Lush things, but in general they tend to smell similar, well, this bath bomb, make the water a hot pink, and it smells like sweet, flowery musk. In other words, it's insanely enchanting.I think the dictionary should have a picture of this Bath Ball under the definition of beautiful, beacuse this simply it.And I love how consistent they are, every single one of the Sex Bombs I bought smells the same. Major points there!I think I've used like 8 of those all ready. I can't stop buying them, great product, and a nice unique scent!"
1,"I have gone all my life unable to wear mascara for any length of time because I ALWAYS get raccoon eyes.  I have tried nearly every &#34;waterproof&#34; mascara on the market, and I am always left with the smudges within a matter of hours.  I can't wear eyeshadow either, because it fades into the crease and within an hour, I have no eyeshadow left on my eyelids!  But then on day about 2 years ago, I was in a Bare Minerals salon and they showed me the Blinc.  I was skeptical, but I decided to give it a shot.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO ANY OTHER MASCARA!  I can wear this all day (10 hour work days in a very hot environment) and never fades, flakes or smudges!  I can cry, sweat and rub my eyes and it will not come off.  BUT&#62;&#62;&#62;when I get home at night,  I throw some water on my face and a warm washcloth and rub and that is it.It works like this...the mascara goes on just like the regular stuff, but as it dries it forms a &#34;shell&#34; around the lash.  Kind of the like the hard chocolate shell you put on ice cream.  Don't worry you won't feel it!  That's why it stays put.  At the end of the day when you wash off, the mascara comes off in little tiny pieces (some say it looks like little spider legs!).Once you try this, you will never to back to regular mascara"
1,"I've been using this for years.  It is effective to keep acne at bay and very concentrated so a little goes a long way.  I only use it once a day, and combine  with a gentler wash for when my skin isn't very dirty (no makeup, etc.).The only reason I knocked off a star is because I hate the packaging.  Why would it come in a tall (tip over) type bottle with no give (squeeziness?) to it.  I refuse to use it in it's own packaging, and I instead transfer it to small silicone travel containers (called GoToobs) and it's much easier to dispense/use."
1,"I love anything vanilla scented and I'm also crazy about Philosophy products. I'm sorry, but this shower gel missed the mark. I can smell a slight hint of vanilla when I sniff from the bottle, but once I use it in the shower I smell NOTHING! I gave this product three stars for lathering well and making my skin soft, but there's no scent. I wish Philosophy would sell the Eggnog all year. Now that's a scent that you can smell!"
1,"Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing Bar is a non-alkaline, non-soap bar that its makers claim to be non-comedogenic, hypoallergenic, and free of harsh detergents that might dry or irritate the skin. The makers also state it can be used for facial or full body cleaning, and is designed for dry, sensitive skin to moisturize as it cleans.  Its active ingredient, they state, is Triclosan; it is a neutral pH formulation that will leave no residue.  The manufacturers further claim that it is good for many skin conditions, such as eczema, and is as mild as the mildest bar cleanser. It is manufactured by Galderma Laboratories, major benefactor of the Dermatology Foundation helping to fund dermatology research.This bar has worked very nicely for me.  I turned to it after messing up my hands by use of a perfumed soap bar: mind you, I know/knew better than to use perfumed soap, which has always caused my hands to get red, raw, and covered with rash.  But when a bar of perfumed soap comes as a gift from someone of whom I'm fond, I can't resist it.  So, anyway, after a few weeks' use of the Cetaphil bar, my hands are looking and feeling much better, not nearly as red, sore and painful.  You might give it a try if you find yourself in a similar situation."
1,"I like this sponge, but I wish it was a little bigger and had an exfoliating side to it. Overall, not a bad deal. I keep it in my travel bag and it never gets that &#34;spongy&#34; smell which is great."
1,"Originally I was worried about allergy. I have to say this treatment may be too mild to me. It works, not significantly.Also I found this is NOT transparent gel, but some white cream which does not fully absorbs, and leads to an ugly face white white spots."
1,"I have used this product and the conditioner for 2 years now. I found this in my search for natural, organic shampoo and conditioner. According to my hair consultant, my hair is better than it has ever been. It feels great on the scalp and the longer you keep it on, the better it feels. I need conditioner to keep it easier to comb and more manageable, because I am letting it grow."
1,"I didn't expect too much when I purchased this Conair curling iron.  It is quite inexpensive, about $7 when I bought it.  There is nothing incredibly special about it.  But it is a decent curling iron.  It is available in three barrel sized, 1/2&#34;, 3/4&#34; (which is what I bought, and 1&#34;.This is the traditional design, with a heating barrel and piece that opens and &#34;clamps&#34; against the barrel with a thumb lever.  Our family prefers this to the newer heating wands that have no clamp and come with a heat-resistant glove.  We find those tend to be awkward, as you need two hands to manipulate the iron and your hair, as opposed to this design where you have one hand free for a brush, but still can use the clamp to curl your hair.The iron features a black tip at the end of the chrome barrel.  The tip does not get very hot at all.Heating is very quick, about a minute, and it has a simple rotary knob built into the handle to adjust the heat.  The controls are near where some people may hold the barrel, so you could accidentally touch them, but I think the barrel design makes it simple enough to avoid that (the rotary switch is on a thicker barrel part, adjacent to the heating iron.  The switch has 25 power levels, as well as an On/Off switch and indicator, and a &#34;Turbo Heat&#34; button and indicator.There is a small metal rest at the bottom of the barrel to help keep the hot barrel off surfaces when you place it down.The 5' cord is designed to swivel to minimize tangles.Conair backs the curling iron with a 2 year warranty."
1,"It blends well with my skin color and I think it's really helping with breakouts. It has a camphor smell. Some people wouldn't like that, but I think it smells good."
1,"Good color, it's good for spring and summer, but it's more of a hot pink with flecks of blue. Beautiful shade and overall great polish."
1,"This product is awesome and results in silky, shiny, wonderful smelling hair.  No scalp irritation or uneven color. Works like a charm and is very easy to apply. I love it!"
1,"Although it specifically says not intended for women, I thought I would try and see if it could make my hair grow faster.  I used the product for about 3 months and really didn't see any significant growth--I was using the Rogaine for Women prior to that--what started happening however was I started feeling very dizzy.  I researched the product online and found that this was one of the side effects so I stopped using it and the dizziness stopped.  Over the entire period of using both the women's Rogaine and the men's Rogaine, I really didn't see any growth--even though I did meet the guidelines.  Maybe I just started too late.  However, I did want to warn women that side effects could occur with the stronger product and to think twice about using it.  That being said, I have been using the men's product on my eyebrows and it does work--my sparse eyebrows are now fuzzy.  That is quite an achievement and since I don't experience any side effects and only use it at bedtime, I will continue.  In time, I will probably return to the women's strength but for the moment, will give my head a rest."
1,"I have used to to apply to socks, stockings, and craft projects.  It removes easily with water.  It can get to be a bit messy but with practice it is a good buy."
1,Applying this powder to set my foundation makes my makeup last a long time. I like that the color is translucent so it goes on clear.
1,This is a amazing moisturizing cream.. I use it in Winter as well as in summer... its very smooth to apply... I ordered it 4 times now... an will order many more..:)
1,"All I can say is Aubrey Organics conditioners have become staple products to the masses for good reason, and they do not disappoint with this product.If your hair is dry, damaged, chemically treated, straight, natural or somewhere in between, if you are looking for a great conditioning product that will leave you with super soft hair, then, Aubrey's Blue-Green Algae Conditioning Mask is for you!Pros:*Works well on its own or layered over other ingredients for super rich DT(as in with honey, olive oil, aloe)*It is an awesome product!Cons:*They are getting really stingy with their (better) products. It only came in a teensy-weensy 4oz jar--I used about 3oz of it when I conditioned my (below-shoulder-length hair)* If you want to use it more than once a month it will add up (granted, it is worth every penny)--You really should get more product for the price.User Tips:If your hair is oily or very fine, apply it to damp hair (layered over a little aloe vera) and shampoo out.If your hair is very dry, damaged or chemically treated, cleanse hair first and layer it over olive oil for a super intense Deep Treatment and warm-water rinse OR co-wash out.Overall, it is a great protein conditioner and I think you will like it a lot for general use.In color and appearance, it reminds me a little of GPB, (I was using warm honey + Aubrey GPB combo exclusively for DT, which I still love, but I think I have a new alternate for switching up products!)It is awesome for more intensive conditioning needs -- The only negative is that you if you have longer hair, you will use most if not all of it in one go.High marks to yet another fantastic Aubrey Organics product!Grade: A-  / Five Stars for this product!"
0,"i guess we are severe nail biters....beyond help....because this stuff didn't work. it washed off with water and my son figured that out pretty darn quick. after that, he would just scrape it off with his teeth and proclaim that he liked the taste. i tried it myself and it honestly doesn't taste that bad. i mean, it stays in your mouth for a bit but nothing unbearable. i've been biting for 32 years.....this isn't going to work for me. it does get all over everything you touch so be careful eating."
1,"I have always loved Freeman products but when I used this I really fell in love. It has a great smell, easy on my sensitive skin and removes the junk that can get in your pores. You do have to be generous with the application so it will be easy to peel off. I would buy it again."
1,"Good, natural color. have been using bare minerals for over 7 years now. Won't even consider any other product. Good, natural coverage. Stays on all day. Very gentle."
1,I suppose I should start by saying I didn't know what I was getting into before I ordered this. I had read it would be nice for facial masks and thought why not.I mixed this in and put it on my face and got the worst scent-related headache I've had in a long time. I'm going to find a more appropriate use for the rest of it.
1,"I have loved this Buddy Wash for years now and think it is the best on the market.  It cleans well and the scent is very nice, mild and not overpowering.  I have tried other dog shampoos and always come back to Buddy Wash."
1,"My bf was using a bag from a comforter set to carry his toiletries.. we travel a lot and he has many things. I had to force him to use this.... It doesn't really fit everything but this was the biggest bag I could find that was not a suitcase. I wish it was a little bigger with a few more compartments, but overall it serves its purpose."
1,"I'd gotten so tired of trying to find the ""perfect"" mascara, to make my lashes look long, but not clumped together.  I tried the lash inserts at a salon once, but they were way too long and fakey looking.  I tried the short Ardell lashes first, then the mini.  The mini looks WAY more natural.  And to me, that's the point.  You want them to look as if they could be your lashes, at their best.  At one point I ordered from another site because Amazon didn't have brown.  Then I tried the black, and they're fine.  They're not too dark, and I add a little brown mascara.  I've tried the lash lengtheners. Latisse really works, but you have to use it faithfully for a few months to really see the difference, and it gets too expensive to keep up with.  I couldn't tell a big difference with the others.  I'm addicted to the individual lashes now, and I've already reordered so I don't run low.  (One glue I used didn't work well, and they kept coming out.)  One nice side effect is that I don't notice my full upper eyelids as much with my longer lashes!"
0,So disappointed.  With the Eucerin name I thought this lotion would be really great.Pros:-goes on smooth-feels good on my skin-no break-outs or irritations-no smellCons:-it pills really bad if you rub your face - ICK!I will not buy again.
1,These are good curlers - gives your hair a nice curl without the damage of a heat tool. I ordered extra of the medium sized ones because they seem to be the right size for me. I'd recommend these over any other brand of hot rollers/curlers!
1,So far it really has no static! The real test will be in the winter when New England get very dry and I have flynaeaysnand frizzy static hairs like crazy!
1,My sister and mother loved this as a Christmas gift.  I should have gotten one for me. Next time I will.
1,"This stuff indeed does smell good. It's not that strong a scent: I lather it up and sniff my arms in the shower to get the scent. The scent immediately washes off and doesn't linger after showering. I give it 4 stars for a pleasant scent, but 3 stars for the price. It is pricey for the size you get."
1,"I saw the positive reviews for this brush, so I purchased it when I needed to replace my old one. I am very pleased with it - the brush is made of small metal prongs that work great on my longer, thicker hair. I have always used plastic bristled brushes before, and I was very surprised at how much better this feels when brushing my hair.Highly recommended!"
1,"I loved how this made my face feel. It made it feel soft, absorbed quickly, and didn't leave it feeling greasy. Plus, it's a whipped texture which is amazing! However, I could NOT stand the smell :/ it smells like a wet dog. It would make me sick evertime I would put it on plus, the smell would linger on my hands even after I washed them. This moisutrizer is too expensive to just not use but I just couldn't anymore. That's why I am giving it only 3 stars. I'm taking away a star for the smell and the price. It's a shame too. I really liked this. I hope they change the smell at least to make it beareable and pleasant."
1,"When it came, the item was not exactly the same as the picture of their product page, so I was annoyed. But I can file my nails and clean out callous around my fingers, which is great. Unlike others, though, it still leaves thin white strips underneath my nails like other files, only not as much."
1,This is my perfect color which is beautiful for summer and goes with everything.  I do find that OPI is a great polish for staying power too !
0,"I have experienced mixed feeling with this foundation.The first time I got over a year ago my face broke out entirely. It was a disaster, no other makeup in my life made me break out like this foundation. I stopped using it, then tried again 6 months later...at that point my face did not break out but it was itching all the time. once I cleaned my face the itch was gone. So I tossed the foundation away. I switched to mineral powder foundation by Gabriel Cosmetics and his Zuzu Luxe line. I LOVED it! NO itch, no break out, silky smooth foundation and excellent coverage. I ran out and wanted to give this foundation ONE more shot so I ordered the start up kit... This time with moisturized and primed face I felt like my other foundations were much better than this one! My face did not itch or break out but there was NO coverage after the first application. I decided to build it up with one more layer and the face started to look totally cakey... Mind you, I use kabuki, buff the product so I know how to apply mineral foundation. Honestly I was yet again disappointed. I will stick to Gabriel Cosmetics powder foundation for as long as they make it. I tried to really like Bare Minerals and their flashy price tags but 3 times did not do it for me."
1,This has NO added fragrance (unlike Dove).  It doesn't irritate my skin at all. I use it during the winter months to soothe my sensitive skin.The only thing I would change is to make the bottle a bit more manageable in shape and size.
0,"I bought this to try because it seemed to have some good active ingredients at a fair price. Alas, as I already know, you get what you pay for. First, the smell is pretty off putting, but that's not the deal breaker for me. What I really dislike is the watery texture and how it seems to just sit on my skin in white streaks that don't seem to absorb so much as dry on the face. This just feels icky yo use before bed and it's definitely not right for under makeup. Once it finally dries, it does sort of tighten the skin, but leaves it feeling sort of tuggy, not soft and smooth.I am generously giving this 2 stars because at least it doesn't seem to cause any adverse reactions."
1,"I had been using a flat iron that I purchased several years ago to straighten my hair only occasionally. It worked okay, but, when I decided that I wanted to straighten my hair more regularly, I thought an upgrade might help me do the job more quickly. I did a lot of research on flat irons and eventually settled on this one. I have been using this product for about two weeks now, and I absolutely love it. I am still shocked by how much more quickly and easily I can straighten my hair. The iron heats up and cools down quickly. It doesn't pull my hair. Most importantly, I see great results every time I use it. Highly recommended."
1,This product make your skin feel so tight once you remove it. I am glad I decided to purchased this item.
1,"I bought this for my boyfriend, he loves it. I ended up taking a shine to it as well so now we use it all the time. Tea Tree oil is great for oily skin and this particular wash smells great. We use it as a face wash and have had less break outs since we started using it. Best thing about Jason products is that they are organic, all natural, not tested on animals and contain no animal ingredients. Perfect for vegans or those who just care about what they use on their skin and bodies."
1,"Both my son and I use this for our massively thick, wavy hair. It's light weight, not sticky, and gives your hair shine and hold all day whether you air dry it or style with hot tools. Pricey but an 8.5 oz. bottles lasts for months. Use a bit more on dry hair; just a pea size drop, combed through for wet hair. If you comb it through and want your hair to dry curly, just wrap your head in a terry hair turban after combing product through. Leave on for 5-10 minute, gently scrunch with fingers and don't touch your hair till it's dry. You can use a diffuser dryer on low if you want it to dry more quickly. Just hold and lift carefully to keep you curls."
1,"This is the best thing in the world for burns, so recommend keeping some near the stove. Also best for sunburn, the quicker you apply it, the better. If you search for the uses for this product you will be amazed.  Never run out."
1,"I love this moisturizer! It has a unique texture that goes on very smoothly and in a nice thin layer. I have combination skin that is prone to breakouts and I don't find this moisturizer irritating in the least. I wear it under Bare Minerals foundation and I feel like it helps my foundation say on longer. I also use this at night after washing withPhilosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser, 8 Ounce. I know that others complained about the scent- I think it is fine. It has a very light, fresh scent that is not at all overpowering. A bit on the pricey side for me, but I am quickly becoming a Philosophy junkie!"
1,This polish needs a few coats to be opaque. It's a pretty color if you take the time to apply the multiple coats. I do like the color so I plan on keeping it.
1,It works awesome with only a small amount needed! Also works great to thin new nail polishes that are a little too think or dark
1,"I STARTED PURCHASING THIS ROGAIN FOR MY HUBBY AFTER HIS GENETIC HAIR LOSS, AND THE HAIR OF HIS CROWN HAS GROWN BACK, AS SOON AS MY HUBBY FORGETS TO USE IT, HE FINDS  LOTS OF HAIRS ON THE PILLOW.I ALSO STARTED DEVELOPING HORMONAL HAIR LOSS AND STARTED USING THIS ROGAIN FOR MEN, WHICH IS STRONGER THAN THE ONE FOR WOMEN WHICH I USED TOO, THE HAIR AROUND MY HAIR LINE IS GROWING SLOWLY, THE ONLY PROBLEM I FIND IS THAT IT CAUSES DANDRUFF ON MY SCALP.i ALSO APPLY ROGAIN ON MY EYEBROWS AND THEY ARE GROWING!!! THE DOWNSIDE, HAIR ON MY FACE SO I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN I APPLY IT."
1,"I used this for the first time last night.  My face did sting for about 10 minutes, and then I applied heavy moisturizer over it, and the stinging sensation subsided.  I really liked the way my skin looked this morning.  It looked brighter, and my face had less redness.  I think I might be using too much of this product; a little goes a long way, and I usually apply about a dimes worth to my face and, and I feel it may be overkill.  I sort of like how it makes my skin red initially; it gives me some color, almost like I was in the sun, but a healthy color, not like Retin-A red, where it's splotchy and sickly looking.  I hope this product doesn't break my sensitive skin out, but I will update when more time has passed.  I'm using this on alternate days with Retin-A cream (both at night before bed), as I have read several places that these two products work well if you use them on alternate days.  I have very delicate skin, and I can only tolerate Retin-A twice a week, or I get a lot of irritation and redness (not cute redness either).I used to put lemon juice on my face a few times a week, and this AHA cream feels exactly how the lemon juice felt, so I wasn't alarmed.  Lemons work great, but they are sort of messy and gross, and I don't like the way it feels on my skin while I'm sleeping.  Lemons are incredible for brightening my complexion, but it appears that this AHA lotion has the same effect; yay! :)UPDATE: I have been using this now for a few weeks, and I really like the results.  I put it on after I wash my face at night, and then put a heavy moisturizing cream on after it.  My skin definitely looks brighter and makeup goes on much smoother.  Just make sure that you are exfoliating your skin by washing.  I wash twice a day, once in the morning in the shower, and then at night.  I don't use a wash cloth to wash, because that is too harsh for the delicate skin. I just use my hands and gentle pressure and wash for 1 entire minute.  This makes all the difference in the world."
1,"This is the best bang for your buck when it comes to inexpensive mascaras. It definitely gives lashes dramatic volume but in a way that draws attention to your eyes and not your makeup. It doesn't clump at all, and it only flakes if you really start rubbing your eyes. My only complaint with this product is that it is very difficult to remove...but it's a waterproof mascara. It's supposed to be long lasting! When I shower and wash my face each night it will not budge. It doesn't bother me, but if you are someone who must remove every speck before bedtime, this is not for you!"
1,I have thick hair that is fairly coily. This helps detangle my hair. I use a detangler conditioner as well.
1,"This was a gift to my husband because his ties always get crushed and out of shape when we travel.  The case is sturdy and holds enough. My husband is happy, and so am I."
0,"Take the cap off and sniff, and you'll get a light whiff of this perfume. Not bad, really. But, roll it on and the scent disappears. I've used it several times and the result is the same...nothing. I can only think that it is just too weak to have a scent when spread thinly on the skin. I am aware that an individual's personal chemistry can affect perfumes, but I expect some scent, even if different once applied. Disappointing, to say the least, and I am afraid I cannot recommend this product."
1,This is a great toner and feels incredibly soft on my skin.  The only thing that would make it better is if it were all natural.
1,I really like this brand for removing my nail polish.  I am a repeat customer.
1,"This is a great paddle brush, nice and sturdy. I would recommend this to anyone that needs a good sturdy powerful paddle brush."
1,"I like this mask and it lasts awhile, which is really nice. I wish it didn't have fragrance in it though."
1,"I love my Olay products. This moisturizer goes on great, isn't greasy and has an SPF which we ladies should use daily. The pump is nice because it helps prevent pouring out too much at once. Using this along with my other Olay products leaves my skin soft, tighter and protected."
0,"OMG I just can't believe it! The product has changed after all these years.  In a previous post, I rated a powder and referred to a Long and Lush mascara from the 80's and how bummed I was when thr formula changed.  HERE we go AGAIN!  To say I am disappointed is a huge understatement.  This product had remain unchanged and perfect  for so many years and I have faithfully used it.  It washes off easily but doesn't smudge EVER.  That was the old Great Lash I loved.I noticed while applying it that it didn't feel exactly the same but didn't look closely at the bottle.  It wasn't until my shower that I realized something had drastically changed.  I simply could not remove the mascara!  My eyelashes felt like they were glued into 4 lumps of lashes.  Crazy.  So, I had to use some baby oil to actually remove the mascara.  Then 2 days later, after using this one time, yes, one time! I got a sty on my upper right eyelid. Upon observation of the bottle, the word ""waterproof"" has been added.  Holy moly they're not joking!  But if you have a product that has withstood the test of time, why change?  Call it something else!  UGHSo now what to do?  That is a good question.  Meanwhile, I'll keep using the old bottle until I test out some new mascaras.  WHAT a BIG BUMMER!!!"
1,"I've been using this cream for a couple of weeks.  While using this cream, my hot flashes became so bad that I would break out in tears.  I don't think the cream caused my hot flashes to become worse, but it definitely hasn't helped.  I found some Chinese Royal King ""menopuse"" tea at an international farmer's market, which DEFINITELY helps.  I'm not going to stop using this cream, since I feel better in general, but I am taking primrose oil and fish oil and that could be the reason I feel better.  I'm not convinced that this cream works, but I am convinced that the tea works for me.UPDATE:  I've continued to use this cream and drink the tea less regularly.  I never have hot flashes during the day now and I went for several nights without having a night hot flash.  I had a mini hot flash last night, but it didn't interfere with my sleep much. As some other reviewers have noted, it seems that some people will have to go through a difficult adjustment before this cream will improve menopausal symptoms.  I'm glad that I didn't give up on this cream.  I'm going to continue using this cream, along with primrose oil and the ""menopuse"" tea and menopause vitamin that I have been taking.  I feel much better and I don't feel so anxious.  The hot flashes were making me so depressed and left me tired.  I also had headaches.  I feel much better now.  I'm just determined to deal with menopause without synthetic drugs."
1,"This is a big bottle.And this is not thin lotion.I have been using this daily on myself for at least 6 months. It smells amazing, a small amount goes a very long way, and my skin feels soft and hydrated.This is, hands-down, my favorite lotion."
1,"I love this Olay product, it's made it so easy to use sunscreen everyday. I came across the Olay UV Defense Regenerating Lotion SPF 15 a few years ago, and haven't looked back. I have acne prone skin, but this sunscreen doesn't feel or look like an oil slick on my face, and it doesn't make me break out... these characteristics are very important to me. Despite the addition of fragrance as the last ingredient in the ingredient list, it's a delicate fragrance, and surprisingly doesn't irritate my skin.  Great UVB *and* UVA protection from the Avobenzone.  I went to Hawaii with this sunscreen in tow, and I came back from the vacation as white as I left (this is a good thing! I'd like to delay skin resurfacing procedures as long as I can!). Highly recommend trying this lotion if you're looking for a sunscreen that won't make your face all shiny."
1,"I've only used this one time, I'll try more often as I start to fade later on in the summer and not as outside as often...so far so good."
1,I love this cream. I've been using it for almost 8 years now and i still cant find a better cream than this! I wear it at night and my skin wakes up soft and hydrated. I absolutely love it. The smell is also very nice!
1,"I didn't notice a different when using this lotion.  It didn't make anything worse or better even after a few weeks.  Oh well, hopefully it will work for others.  I'm glad I tried it though."
1,"Works great - my skin has been clear since using these, even through hormonal acne.  My skin has never been smoother/softer. I replace each one about every 3 weeks and use with my desert essence tea tree face wash on a daily basis.  If my skin is sensitive, I may use it every other day, but these work great."
1,"I offer no recommendation as to the effectiveness of this product.  My wife likes it.  Any husband, of long standing, who expresses an opinion on an anti-aging products effectiveness better make sure he weighs his words carefully.  After careful consideration, my wife likes it."
1,"Neutrogena is a great product line and delivers quality always. For products that we use regularly, it's great to get them routinely delivered and at a great price.  this saves us a lot of money and trips to the retail pharmacy."
1,Just ordered a second bottle. I love this stuff. It is great for oily skin and has helped keep the acne away. The seller is great. Product arrived just as described and fast!
1,"It's okay, I really didn't see a difference.I have used it twice already. So I guess I have to use it more often to see any kind of results because I haven't seen it yet. But the way he goes on it's smoove!"
0,I do not give one stars very often at all. But this stuff was just weird. I put this on a wound that had formed a scab and it caused the scab to come off. There was then a hole in my chest where the scab had been. Is that what this product is supposed to do? I threw this product away. It was very yucky. I got it to help heal wounds and it seemed to make them worse. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,I have not had a problem with it so far. The color is really nice. I would get it again.
1,"I use this after my morning shower, and it makes my hair easy to brush out. It's sort of a no-tangle-guarantee for me. Perhaps people with different hair types may find other things work better for them, but I have thick, straight, and long blonde hair, and it's the best I've come across."
1,Used sparingly over a few weeks it seems to have done its job well. Always liked the shampoo and this seemed like a good addition. Also used a scalp brush when washing hair. Nice.
1,I had been using another brand that I can no longer get. I tried these through the subscribe and save program. The pad is amazing! I was able to take off all dirt and makeup as well as cleanse my skin. I have sensitive skin but this does not irritate it. I rinsed the pad and wiped off the residue and I was still removing makeup and dirt. Too bad there are only 28 instead of 30 to cover a whole month.
0,"This product cleared my acne, that is for sure. But I have dry skin.. and I've read about others with dry skin and acne prone and using this and it works wonderful so I thought why not give it a try. I have been using this for about a week and a half now and as I mentioned before I have dry skin. My face has become SO INTENSELY dry and I thought maybe it was the winter season? Maybe its just my skin acting up? So I bought dry skin cream. Didn't work. I bought another dry skin cream. Again, didn't work. I tried one more time but this time I bought a VERY thick one.. and guess what. It did not work. My skin is STILL dry and this is so not like my skin. So  stop using it and my skin is slowly starting to gain back the moisture. This product dried the HECK out of my face and BADLY to the point of where NO cream on this earth was going to work on my skin. If you have dry skin I highly do not recommend this product because it is TERRIBLE. Clears acne? Yes. Hydrating? Not in the LEAST bit and I am so upset because I wanted to love this product so much and I can't. My skin was miserable."
0,"Didn't really seem to work any better than a clear coat under color does-for me anyway. I have weak and peel-prone nails, so maybe this works better for someone with good nails. I do love china glaze though, the polish never gooped up at all and I used the whole bottle (I was really hoping it would eventually work hehe)"
1,"I have used a loads of brands like Redken, Biolage, John Frieda, Garnier etc. This shampoo has been the best I have used so far. It really cleans the scalp and hair without any residue. Pair it with any good conditioner and results are fabulous. This is cheapest and yet the best shampoo I have ever used! Highly recommend."
1,Recommend it doesn't make my face oily like a lot of lotions on the market. Built in SPF is awesome also.Try it
1,"This is the best I have found to remove waterproof mascara or any kind of mascara for that matter, & I have been using it for years.  It just takes a couple drops & lasts forever (kinda oily & I assume that is why it works so well at removing the mascara & eye makeup).  The price is a lot cheaper than most brands."
1,The perfect light blue!  Very delicate and opaque.  You will be fine with just 2 coats and Seche Vite Fast Dry top coat.
1,"It was not planned.  We were sharing a hotel room and I was out of the room.  Just like any Sister...she got in my stuff.  When I returned she was so impressed she had to come clean about using it!  Serves her right. LOL  She had put the cloth aside to show me.  Crazy Woman.  In a good way Sis.  So anyway, she had washed her face with...whatever. Than used my beloved Purity and was astonished by the make-up...whatever that was removed.  'Nuf said."
1,I've used many many different masks for my acne prone skin and this one is definitely one of the top ones on my list.  I apply it to my face twice a week in the evening and leave it for 45 minutes before washing it off then apply a thin layer of balancing moisturizer (for acne skin).  I didn't even need to use any medication afterwards.  It's noticeable that mask helps the skin to heal from broken pimples or those that were about to develop into big ones.  One of the big plus that come with this product is that it's not too expensive so I strongly recommend it!!
0,"I have had a Diamon Deb file for about 30 years and this new one isn't a good as my old one, even tho it is old.  The quality isn't the same."
1,"This nail polish came out with OPI's India collection a few years ago.  As it isn't a current collection, I had to go onto Amazon to order after getting my nails polished in this color by my manicurist.  ""Black cherry"" really describes the color of the polish very well.  It's like a black red.  It almost looks black, but upon closer inspection you can see the red undertones.I love OPI products, especially their brush.  It's wide and makes giving myself home manicures so easy."
1,"I really dis-like the weight and feel of traditional foundation but I need coverage due to dark circles and uneven skin tone. I take full advantage of using the concealer brush and the kabuki brush for full coverage. I find that the shade I chose was a perfect match, it has good coverage, feels light and is less fussy to put on than regular foundation. I also like that it doesn't make me break out.I only gave it 4 stars because I find that it doesn't last all day. Then again, you reapply it like you would a powder so it's not a big deal.Bottom line is, for me it's good coverage and still manages to be lightweight and look natural. I'm happy with that."
1,"This face wash works well, even on my sensitive skin, but is hard to use because it is a very thin liquid, not a soap or gel.  Since I wash my face in the shower, it's hard to keep this face wash from simply running down the drain:  I have to cup it in my hand like water and splash it onto my face, being very careful to avoid letting any run into my eyes because it does sting.Other than that, I have no complaints.  This face wash keeps my skin clean and relatively blemish free, a tough feat because I have sensitive blemish prone skin and spend a lot of time outdoors gardening and exercising, so my skin gets very dirty.  The soap does seem to have a slightly drying effect, so if I had very dry skin or was looking for a product that left my skin feeling moisturized, this might not be the right product for me.This product is priced very well.  This bottle will probably last me about six months.  I pour the liquid from this refill bottle into a soap pump and two or three squirts of the pump is more than enough face wash to do the job, even counting what runs down the drain."
1,"Aveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant Cleanser, 6.7 Ounce is a great facial product.  It leaves your face clean and fresh and not dry.  Highly recommend this product."
1,"This is a nice product, and seems to be working!  It is gentle for the skin, some of the retinol products can be irritating , and this isn't!  I wear a stronger spf under it, because 15 isn't strong enough for daylight!"
1,Works great on very dry spots or areas that are a bit irritated.  I have very sensitive skin and prone to allergic flare-ups.  This cream is very soothing; helps heal very dry spots even on your face.
1,"I was assuming this perm would relax in time - it didn't. I will use bigger rods next time, but the perm worked as advertised - believe it!"
1,"I like this great comb,I use gel and it combs my hair back great,and the price can't be beat!!! And It's cool looking to boot!!!"
1,"This is one of the best facial cleaning gels I have used, my skin is dry, sensitive and acne prone and it gently cleanses my face without over drying, removes dirt, natural and has a clean orange scent that is not over powering.PROS:- Clean orange scent not over powering- Works great on dry skin that is sensitive and acne proneCONS:- There are some organic ingredients, but not all ingredients are organicCountry of Origin: USA"
1,"I love the color this leaves my hair and it does not seem to be as damaging as other brands I have used in the past. I will say I have had the best luck with Feria Color products in general, so I may be a little bias, however I have never been disappointed with any of the colors I have tried."
1,"I quit using hairspray several years ago because I couldn't breathe after spraying my hair.  Given a choice I would rather have out of control hair and healthy lungs as to use the toxic brands.  Then I found this at my fav healthfoold store and tried it.  It's great, makes my hair shiny, has great control, brushes out easily and I can still breathe.  There are several safe hairsprays on the market but they all made my fine textured, limp hair look greasy and stuck to my head.  My husband loves it as much as I do and was really pleased when I found it on Amazon for quite a bit less money than the retail store.  Thanks Aubrey and Amazon for giving me back my all day hair do."
1,"natural; 100%. That is one thing I am so serious about. Natural products usually does not make my extra sensitive skin to have reactions.ZENMED- Omegaceramide+Extreme Hydration Recovery Moisturizer Rosacea & Acne Treatment, Redness 60mlis another great skin care product."
1,I use this on my hands and feet. I have psoriasis which leaves my hands and feet very dry and cracked. This is an amazing cream! I love it! It is so creamy and rich and it doesn't leave a residue and it does NOT burn my fissures in my skin. It has no alcohol in it which causes the burning stinging issues with broken skin.I will always buy this as long as it is sold in stores or online.
1,"I love this mainly because it's not greasy but still has the effect of an anti aging cream. Too many creams these days are laden with much too oil, but this is great!"
1,I use tea tree oil on acne/blemishes and for other times I need an anti bacterial like on cuts. It is a high quality oil and I prefer Desert Essence over other brands I tried.
1,"This is one of Burt's Bees very best products.  I rub it well into my hair before shampooing.  It does a much better job than a conditioner because it treats my hair before shampooing.  My hair is a lot more manageable and easily styled, with good volume, with this product than with most others.  I highly recommend it."
1,"Nothing else works especally if you have hormonal acne from high testoterone but this stuff is AMAZING. It's super hard to find, harmon drug has it but other than that you gotta buy it online but it works well. The key is to use a diffrent wash cloth for your acne area then the rest of your body so you dont spread the germs and oils that make acne worse, then ONLY twice a week or so use those scrub gloves (VERY GENTLY) to exfolitae the areas. If you rub too hard it can cause more acne. But this stuff works well on backacne so far."
1,Great for natural nails!~ Nailtiques Nail Protein Formula 2 Plus...had artificial nails then went back to natural and this real helps then nails get thicker....Much cheaper on Amazon as opposed to a salon!~
1,"This toner is awesome. It's actually the first toner I've ever used, but it's kept my skin soft, reduced the size of my pores, and kept my acne at bay."
1,"I'm 29 with combo/acne prone skin that's somewhat sensitive. I used to use Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel, but decided to try something less expensive. The Clinique moisturizer has a more runny consistency than this moisturizer and glided on the skin more easily. This moisturizer is a little bit thicker and that makes it more moisturizing than the Clinique. I felt like the Clinique moisturizer just stayed on the skin for a few hours and than my cheeks started to feel dry and I'd feel like I needed to reapply it again. I don't have to to reapply with this one. My skin still feels moisturized hours later. This moisturizer has a lightweight feel and that's key for me because I have oily skin. I just use a very small amount and that's enough to cover my whole face and neck. It doesn't make my skin feel greasy at all. I haven't noticed any breakouts with this moisturizer either. I have an oily T-zone and my cheeks are usually dry and tend to get a little flaky. The Clinique moisturizer didn't do anything for the flakiness on my cheeks. This moisturizer absorbs into the skin perfectly and I no longer have flakiness on my cheeks. One day I washed my face and decided not to use this moisturizer to see how my face would feel. I immediately noticed the difference. This moisturizer fits my budget and my skin loves it. It's something I'll definitely repurchase."
1,"I don't use these all the time, but whenever I have a breakout I use them on the area for a few days after cleansing at night. They seem to help clear up breakouts faster than they would on their own."
1,"Great product, not greasy at all. I would recommend it! This product was in Allure magazine, and all those girly magazines, which is why I decided to try it out. Great stuff, been using it for years. Never caused me to break out or anything."
1,Nice hand and body lotion that doesn't leave a greasy residue. It lasts a while and I enjoyed it. The only thing I missed while using it was a more defined scent. This rosemary lotion's smell might be subtle enough for those who prefer to use unscented beauty products.
1,I am a Asian with dry and sensitive skin.  My skin product will irritate my skin or my eyes but not this one.I also really like the smell and how it feels after I washed my face.  I hope it can be more creamy so that my skin can feel more protected after washing.
1,I waited to review to make sure I liked it  This is a good mascara.  The wand is thin so that the mascara applies nicely without clumping.
1,"I've tried a few bronzers, and im not the biggest makeup junkie i really just try to go for a natural look...and this gives me the perfect glow, definitly recommend this color!"
0,"YUCK! I am really starting to think many of these rave reviews are fake, because go on over to Makeupalley and everyone else hates this product as well. I have never in my life actually thrown away a full product, until this one. It was literally unusable. It made my face look muddy, not natural at all. And it also clumped up around my eyebrows and the sides of my face, even though I didn't use that much! It just looked so bad, I didn't feel guilty about throwing it in the garbage at all. Buy at your own risk"
1,I have really enjoyed this toner.  It has a light fresh smell.  I noticed some complained about the scent being too strong.  I am typically pretty sensitive about scents and don't like most women's colognes/ perfumes.  I found this scent to be very pleasant and light.  This toner  is very mild and makes skin feel nice and fresh with zero drying effect.  Very gentle.  Highly recommend and will continue to purchase/use for myself.
1,"Great exfoliation!When first applied, your face will feel chilled -- very cool and refreshingIt really pulls everything out of your pores which I guess is why the pores seem to shrink.Interestingly, despite the fact it pulls up excess oils, it doesn't dry out your skinA very win win product"
0,"I bought this hoping to spend less on a daily facial cream with SPF.  I've been using Ole Henricksen's ""truth revealed super creme SPF 15"", which is $55 a jar.  Well, you definitely get what you pay for.  The smell of this ""unscented"" cream is so chemically (is that a word?) and sunscreeny, that it's almost unbearable to wear.  It is thick, so only a little bit is needed, but it isn't fully absorbed by my skin.  My makeup brushes have to be washed more frequently because of the residue and the smell (I don't want it to cross-contaminate into my blush/powder foundation).  I will not purchase again."
0,"I have type 3a curly hair and I purchased this item after having read the reviews.  It really didn't do all that much for me, in fact it did nothing, as if I put water on my hair.  I don't recommend."
1,Hair! It loves this product so make sure you get it for it. Only give your hair the best of the best.
1,"I had thought this was the size I needed, was wrong my fault, it was too small, keeping it though who knows when you may go short."
1,"Excellent buying experience, very good choice of perfume because perfectly fulfills my needs, its aroma is exquisite, durable, citrus and fruity type an entire show to smell, perfect for gift giving or for personal use. .. Delivery time and attention was correct. thanks!"
1,"I've been using olay for about 15 years and I love it.  My face does not dry out and I have hardly any wrinkles (I'm almost 50).  Although it is expensive in the stores, you can purchase it here on amazon for a lot cheaper which is great.  This moisturizer also comes in fragrance free."
1,"Good and cheap hair styling product! I tried it today after I blow-dried my hair. It was frizzy and hard to handle at the tips, as always. I looked like a troll. I turned this on and let it warm for a few minutes. I put 2 on each side and one on the crown. After a couple minutes I took them off and voila! Loose, sexy, and effortless Victoria's secret curls (:Would recommend to anyone, unless you're looking for a genuine curl."
1,When using my first set I lived in NY and my hair was always long. The caruso curls were wonderful without hair breakage /intence heat or sitting under an old fashioned dryer. In remembering how much I loved them I bought another set. I live in Florida now and the reason I'm not getting the same results I'm sure is that the humidity down here is off the wall. On low humidity days or just plain normal weather you can't beat the curl. I like the ability to create the type or kind of cure I'm in the mood for.On humid days I leave the curler on steam for a shorter time and use large hair clips instead of the carouso jacket.
1,"This is the best bang for your buck when it comes to inexpensive mascaras. It definitely gives lashes dramatic volume but in a way that draws attention to your eyes and not your makeup. It doesn't clump at all, and it only flakes if you really start rubbing your eyes. My only complaint with this product is that it is very difficult to remove...but it's a waterproof mascara. It's supposed to be long lasting! When I shower and wash my face each night it will not budge. It doesn't bother me, but if you are someone who must remove every speck before bedtime, this is not for you!"
1,"If you are looking for a peeling mask this one is pretty good.  It dries fast and you can get a good peel with it - all in one sheet. It seems to help to control my sons acne a little.I made the mistake of after the mask, using a blackhead tool and clearing out anything that came to the surface --- well everything came out easily but he was left with a face full of red marks and scabs for like a week, so I felt terrible. It draws everything to the surface and leaves the skin extra soft and sensitive and more easy to tear and damage.So I'd recommend just using the mask - and not picking after! I've used it several times without picking and it's been fine."
1,No need to mess with the best! Does the job perfectly every time.  Very Black and Very Intense! Great and sexy lashes.
1,I am not a fan of the scent.  It is not horrible but just not what I was expecting.  It is a decent body wash but I will probably not buy again.
1,"This has a clean scent, but just a warning, it is also very heavy and synthetic at the beginning. It may even give you a headache. But about 1-2 hours in, it'll start giving off a very pleasant scent. And the longer you wear it, the better it smells. Make sure to spray it early in the morning so you'll get the best of it during the meat of your day. I've gotten the most compliments from wearing this stuff (I also wear Le Male from Jean Paul Gaultier, CK Obsession, and Issey Miyake). I prefer the smell of Issey over fcuk by a long shot, but I don't seem to catch as many compliments with Issey, and I wear Issey very often (still my fav)."
1,This ruby stone is the best nail file I have ever used. It leaves nails smooth with no rough edges. Nails  never tear or split. It is great for real nails  as well as acrylic. Have  been using this type of nail file about ten years and never have any problems.
1,I love this body spray I think I bought four bottles of this stuff. My husband loves the smell. Great buy.
1,"All the reviews for this brush are true. My hair gets easily frizzy and this brush is an absolute god send. No snagging other than if you already have tangles, and no static build up! I am planning to buy another one for on the go =)"
1,"I bought this when a airline lost my luggage on the way to Kodiak, AK. I settled on this product, when I couldn't find a cheap Jojoba or Vit E. Oil at a local drug store. I used it at night only, since it doesn't include SPF. It seemed to be hydrating without being oily. I kept using it for a week at night, even after finding my luggage. I ended up trashing a full bottle due to breakout and a bit of a rash developing on my cheek. Back to Jojoba and La Posay Roche.This just reinforces why I never buy drugstore products."
1,this is a great bag but many of my bottles wouldn't fit in here. I returned it but I would totally buy it again if it was a bit more lady friendly as the design is spot on.
0,I have to agree with the other person it is to heavy and has grease fill you can use it better on your feet but still grease fill not the right lotion for my hands
1,I have been using this for years.  It doesn't smell like flowers but the trade off is that it does not dry your skin and is good for a lot of skin issues.
1,"Winter is so hard on my hands.  I've always been a lotion addict but in the winter I find I need a bit more.  I use this mostly at bedtime because it does leave your hands a bit slick.  It's part of the bedtime routine for me.  I flick each nail through the pot and rub that in before applying to the rest of my hands.  I follow up with the lemon butter cuticle cream and then Curel hand lotion.  No need for gloves because the lotion kind of brings it all together and more or less keeps everything in place.  In the morning, there's enough left on my hands to rub in before the first hand washing of the day.  My hands have been more hydrated since I've been using this."
0,"I have used this product before except I bought it at my hair salon.  That one worked well.  So well, that I decided to buy again except I saw this one online and it was cheaper.  But, this one purchased online got all over my hands as soon as I touched my hair lightly, got on my shirt when I pulled it over my head, dripped down the side of my face when I perspired.  Awful.  Wish I could return it but I didn't pay that much so let's just say its one lesson learned."
0,"I returned this styler after just a few uses because it gets VERY hot, even on the ""low"" setting, and the cord is very short.  I don't recommend it as a hair dryer, styler, or anything!  Look elsewhere."
1,This is ok for short term but it quickly loses efficiency after about an hour. I have also noticed some residue from it.
1,"I didn't expect to like this cream as much as I do.  It's an excellent value and I don't plan to be without it in the future.  Cetaphil now sits on my bathroom vanity and is used as a routine moisturizer for my face, elbows, arms and any other moisturizing needs.The scent is clean and very minimal so it doesn't iterfere or offend.It hasn't caused any breakouts and seems to hold moisture longer than many of the high-end moisturizers I've tried.Excellent product and a terrific value.The glowing reviews here were my reason for trying it and I'm very glad I did."
1,"This perfume blend is exotic and sexy, but definitely a bit more powerful/heady than I (a light or non-perfume wearer most days) am used to.  I love wearing it on date nights, but I recommend starting out light and adding a bit more as needed. My husband really likes the way it smells."
0,"I usually use the 6G or 6-1/2G, but it was unavailable, so I thought just the normal brown instead of the golden brown would be ok to just do my roots. For whatever reason, this stuff just didn't do the job in covering the gray or blending the roots. Also gives my hair a greenish cast. I've been using Loreal haircolor for years and I bounce between Excellence and Preference, and the 2 brown shades I mentioned. I will never deviate again."
0,"Ran out of Dominica and looking for a substitute, I bought this stuff.  Wretched!  Bears the same relationship to real bay rum (rhum) as instant coffee does to brewed coffee - in other words, it's smelly brown water."
1,"THIS MAY BE THE BEST OF ALL THE WONDERFUL REGENERIST PRODUCTS; IT SEEMS TO CHANGE THE TEXTURE OF YOUR SKIN WITH THE FIRST USE. MY OLAY REGEME IS GETTING A BIT EXTENSIVE, BUT I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANY ONE OF THEM UP, MAYBE THIS SERUM MOST OF ALL."
1,"I bought this based on other reviews. It smells great and feels great. I out it in every night before bedtime. However, my hands are dry when i wake up. Will not buy again, but works well enough to finish the tube. Maybe i am supoosed to usemore frequently?"
1,"I am usually very picky about my shampoos and conditioners. I use Herbal Essence as my shampoo of choice, but I didn't really like their conditioners. I have tried many others, but I keep coming back to the Suave Coconut. I'm very sensitive to strong scents, but this coconut scent is light enough that it doesn't bother me, but heavy enough to remind me of the beach. I can't find this in the store very often anymore, so I'm glad i was able to find it on Amazon!"
1,"In an effort to stop spending money on high end products, I've spent a lot of time in the regular stores looking for great products. The scene has changed from when I was kid. Back then, grocery/drug store brands weren't very good. However, it has been a real treat trying all the products. Some are pretty awesome and work just as well as the salon brands, and some drug store brands work even better. This Neutrogena is the best conditioner I've tried in a long time. The smell is candy-like but light and doesn't linger; the texture of the conditioner is like cream, and the result was super easy to comb hair that dried nice and soft. There was no need for leave in conditioner or smoothing hair serum after this. What a treasure this is! I hope others have as good of luck as I did. My hair is super dry!This might be too conditioning for people with fine, oily or limp hair textures though."
1,"This is my 3rd box of frownies.  I love them.  And they work.It might be a bit of an adjustment at first.  You will kind of resemble the invisible man with the bandages on when you apply them.  There might be a little tug on the skin directly around the frownies but this is a minor annoyance compared with the price of botox and restylane treatments. And these work just as well.I would definitely not recommend using them on a first, second or 30th date.  This should be applied in a comfortable setting around someone who won't freak out when you come out of the bathroom with flesh colored paper attached to your face.But the main thing is that they work. Period. So you have to make the decision."
1,Amazed at how well and gentle this brush functions. The price was great and I have no issues with the brush.
1,"I totally love this cream. It's not too thick and not too thin. A bit ""waxy"" but it spreads well and absorbs well. I like the tea tree scent (some people don't like it at all) and the scent does not linger more than an hour or 2. It's lovely on hot days to cool down and refresh. Not sure that it's all that effective at calming irritation or getting rid of itching. I don't think it's a miracle cure for those ailments. It's by far the best lower priced natural body lotion products I have tried."
1,I have used this product for 45 years and it is still the best foundation ever made. You can put it on sheer or use it as a thicker dab for concealment of blemishes or age spots. It is the best foundation ever made. Period.
1,"My mother and I both love this (she's in her early 50's, i'm in my early 20's). This leaves our skin soooo soft and feeling moisturized and hydrated without an oily slick. She has eczema and this goes very well on her skin, I have very sensitive combination skin and this has never broken me out at all. In the winter I have also applied this during AM hours to keep my skin from feeling dry during the day. We love this and highly recommend."
1,Not sure how to feel about this b/c I have not used it consistently yet.  But when I do use it during the day it encourages my skin to form a greasy film over it that feels tight.  I do feel a tingly sensation when put on.  I believe it aids in accelerated skin turn over because I am seeing more dead skin ready to be sloughed away after I started using this product.
1,"This is my favorite color red to use, it gives a gorgeous red-orange on brown hair and I've used it over top of blonde and pink hair as well with wonderful results. Always leaves my hair feeling great and the smell brings back memories. I really love this brand."
1,"this is pretty good. but not the best, i think. dries up quick but kinda hard to shape the line?i like it won't smear after been wearing the whole day."
1,This smells fresh and clean. Had a problem opening the pump but I held the collar firmly in place while turning the pump and it popped up finally. Disaster averted. The price is half that of the local stores and this size is larger than the usual.
1,"This product works.  I wake up the  next day with it on.  This is my second tube of this color and I have at least 4 other colors I have purchased.  Does not run into lines around mouth, if you have that concern."
1,"This fragrance is really stunning.  It's classy and soft and leaves a great trail of perfume behind you.  It's definately a summer fragrance.  It's a nice soft floral that won't turn too sour in the heat of the day.  It has the kind of smell that reminds you of playing out in the fresh cut grass.I think this is a little different to other perfumes out there, and it's so beautiful that you really have to try it.  If you love soft, floral and classy fragrances then this is for you.  I don't think Donna Karan is great in the perfume department, but this has been the one great standout of hers.  Go try it."
1,"If you have never tried a LUSH Bath Bomb, you've never really lived! Treat yourself! This is a feminine, feel good, smell good, pamper yourself, playful product if there ever was one. The name's right too!!I have to admit, I had not been pampering myself enough recently, and rarely had time for a leisurely bath last summer. It was jump into the shower in the AM and off to work. Then, especially in NYC, there's the morning, afternoon and evening rush, a quick dinner, maybe another shower, hit the sack, and then it begins all over again. I pulled a muscle a few weeks ago and bought some bath salts to relieve the pain. I realized how good it felt to bathe again - to make time to relax. I mentioned this to a friend, (Thank God for girl friends!!), who hustled on over to the nearest Lush store and picked up a potent Hot Pink SEX BOMB Bath Bomb for me!!!OK! So what does one do with a bath bomb. Clean your tub!! Then fill it with water. I like mine hot. Drop in the bomb and it will fizz like crazy and dissolve. You can dive in while it is melting or wait. I was and am impatient. For those bombs containing flower petals or other surprises, wrap the globe in nylon before use. The water should feel silky soft and the entire room will smell wonderful and steamy.Now, I hate pink - which I don't consider to be a real color. ..so much for girly-girls! But this was such a lovely gesture from a good friend, and so I made an exception. She wanted feedback, no less. Fortunately I used this product before going out, because (WOW!) once you experience the eroticism of bathing in the alluring scent of jasmine and ylang ylang, lying back in the tub with a towel cushioning your head and neck, and the warm, fragrant steam wafting by your face, you will not want to sleep. As I said, the name's right - for a reason. You will feel invigorated and want company to share your newly softened, lush smelling skin.Anyway, back to the bath. I turned the lights low and lit a candle to enhance the experience. And the lack of light did help to hide the fact that my bath water was pink - but a much softer, more subtle color than the outside of the bomb, fortunately. Clary sage essential oil,  with reported aphrodisiac properties, is a primary ingredient which helps sooth and smooth the skin. And again, the smell was heavenly.I have since become addicted to Lush's bath bombs, there are all kinds with just one purpose - to pamper you and make you feel terrific! Check them out. You deserve it! This one is a real winner!JANA"
1,I am fussy about my lipstick.  It has to feel as good as it looks.  This lipstick fits the bill;beautiful flattering color with  a little glimmer (making lips look a little poufy) and feels creamy.  I will order this lipstick as long as it is available.
1,"I love the scent; I bought it  for use as a facial toner, but it's strong enough to use as a perfume splash."
1,This is basically the same color as Tart Deco but I still love it. And it is a good thing because I just ran out of tart deco! It is a great coral color and I use it all the time!
1,"I was looking for a new liquid hand soap that smells good and this does the trick.  I have seen it in another store for much more money than Amazon charged me.  After using this soap to wash your hands, it leaves a nice fresh scent in the bathroom.  I even bought the large container for refilling this one.  I am pleased."
1,My dermatologist recommended I use this product after I developed acne in my mid 20's. Thus far it's been perfect and keeps my well moisturized and breakout free.
1,For the price and the hype I expected rave results.  Which I did not get.  All these products that claim to hydrate and smooth really don't stand up to their claims.  Willnot buy again
1,I like this oil its not greasy it absorbs well it has no smell it works great in my hair
0,"I was using these in my shower, but got tired of the pumps not working, especially with conditioner.  It took so many pumps to get all the conditioner I needed.  Worked great for shampoo.  Anything thicker than shampoo, forget it.  I went back to sticking with the bottles the shampoo and conditioner came in.  Yes, it saved space in the shower, but I'm standing in the shower for 10 minutes trying to get all the conditioner out."
1,Although I quite like this set because of the &#34;steaming&#34; effects my hair doesn't hold the curl as well as my &#34;heated&#34; curlers. The steam heats up in seconds and the clips hold the curlers in place very well. When I first take the curlers out the curls are awesome but then they fall out in a short while. I don't like to use hairspray but perhaps if I used this then it would warrant spraying to keep the curlers in place. The set comes with a whole bunch of curlers and I think it would be a good set to take on vacations since it's so small. I would recommend it but to use hairspray after the hair is curled.
1,Someone brought this hand soap into the ladies' room at work. The restroom smells so good! This hand soap is amazing. It smells like real honeysuckle and cleans without drying. I am definitely going to stock up!
1,"If you have to wear any sort of support hose, this product stops it from ""wiggling"" away from you.  It washes off in the shower.  It is great for ""gap-osis"" or over revealing tops."
1,I am quite satisfied.
1,"I wont get enough of this!this concealer Works so well for me, it has the right ammount of coverage that I want (I must say is a m&eacute;dium coverage) and doesnt melt in this high humid and hot whether where I live (North coast of Colombia)I highly recommend this.. but the only thing is that if you have dry skin, you might want to apply some moisturizing before using it."
1,This actually helps with the acne I got on my back. I highly recommend it. I no longer have back acne or bumps.This body wash and loofah does magic!
1,"My sister and mom used these all the time a long ways back..I bought them each one box of this for Christmas...Both were very happy to get this...I bought some more for my wife.. She is in love with the product. Itsmells pretty good and makes her skin feel even softer than normal.If baths didn't cost so much, I would even bathe in this just to softenmy dry skin.. I do really love the scent. Try some of the other scentsif you are like my wife and just have to take a bath everyday. =)"
1,"I liked it, however it could have been better. It sometimes left my hair feeling hard and it wasn't a feeling that I liked frankly."
1,"My hands and legs get very dry especially in the winter. I have tried many products, but Neutrogena Norwegian Formula provides the best relief. Nothing comes close. I'm glad it's packaged in a 4 pack because that's about what I'll need to get through a winter!"
1,i dont have very curly hair so i need product to maintain my curls and thsi is a good product but i have to add mousse and spray in order to maintain my curls all day.
1,"I am not a customer for this seller, however I recently purchased this oil elsewhere and so far so GREAT! It is virtually scentless but when warmed up by specific body parts [external lady parts, under arms, inner thigh] it does have a little bit of a funky fish smell BUT it is easily avoided if you mix it with a scented essential oil or lotion. I'm giving this product 5 stars because of the improvement I have seen in my normal/dry skin in just a matter of days. My skin is very sensitive to new products as well as cold dry wintery air, so far this product has been highly beneficial. My skin is not only smoother but it generally looks more hydrated. I mix 1 to 2 drops with my regular Aveeno face lotion and it gives it a better texture while prepping my face for make-up application as well. At night, I put this on alone and wake up with better skin, at least it has been that way for the passed week. I've used cold-pressed organic coconut oil in past and in comparison the results with the Jojoba are much more desirable."
1,"I just got Olay Total Effects Fragrance Free this week. I was worried because some reviewers said that they had bad reactions, and that it's not good if you have sensitive skin. I have very sensitive skin and I have not had any bad reaction to this.I think the key is not to get the one with SPF. The people who had bad reactions bought the one with SPF. This fragrance free variety without SPF has not given me any problem so far. I am not happy that the product contains parabens though, so I won't buy it again for that reason.So, if you want to try Olay Total Effects, get the one that is fragrance free and does not have the SPF."
1,"I adore this.  A light, pleasant scent that reminds me of my grandmother.  It does a lovely job of cleansing my skin, leaving it soft and smooth.  I've actually gotten compliments on my complexion since using it, which is odd but fine by me.  :-)"
1,"Olay never fails me and this is no exception. Its a great face lotion. Before i was using olay total effects fadce lotion which is a thicker and this one is more of a serum feel. At first I didnt like it because it didnt mosterize my face as well as the other and left it a little dry, but i noticed my face is less oily as the day progresses so a little extra dryness for a shine free nose works for me!"
1,"First off, I'm a 21 year old female with light hair and light skin.  I have used several philosophy products and this is one of my favorites.  I really like the texture of this stuff.  It is very hard to explain exactly what it feels like but, it goes on so smoothly.  It just instantly makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated.  I use it at night a lot and even put it over my eye lids.  I have been known to have sensitive skin at times and this has never bothered me.  (nothing from philosophy has) All in all, I love this product and it is a great moisturizer."
1,"I'm 48 and Mom is 75 yrs old and ANY moisturizer gives us immediate acne.  I'm glad I found this again, the AH souffle is a tad oily.  The no-oil formula is a godsend, no more breakouts.  The product exfoliates according to how much and how often you use it (overuse will get you a red face).  It provides a gentle peel effect that starts working quickly drying up oil and acne.  I like the rate of peel; no scaly face. In 2-3 months I had smoother skin, slightly smaller pores, and better skin tone.  Using Alpha Hydroxy I have received the first EVER complements on my skin. I have very few wrinkles for my age.  I'm not saying I look 30, but I look good.  Mom's a recent convert, her skin has smoothed and she has noticed a difference."
1,"I bought this styling set to take it overseas.  I just have given it a try and it is working fine. I like it because it is not too heavy and it is compact.  The case is really fantastic, keep everything in place. The only thing I am not too happy is the amount of rollers, should have at least a pair more, but I will manage."
1,"this is the best foundation. I use to use clinique but it during the winter when i lost my tan they did not make a shade light enough to match my skin tone. This is great, it matches my skin tone, controls my oily skin, stays on all day, and looks super natural. i'll never swtich again"
0,The light around this mirror does nothing but look pretty. I wish I had bought one with more magnification because the light does not help you see any clearer.
1,"I'm in a panic and ran out of this lol. This is awesome, it's cool refreshing water and if you live in a hot climate or have hot flashes or thyriod problems this is esecally made for you. I love this stuff. It's perfect for the gym, yoga class, the beach, sunbathing, traveling, EVERYTHING. I can't be without this stuff love it. I just wish it was easier to find in retail stores verses having to buy it online."
1,Leaves my skin soft and fresh. i have sensitive skin and it is the first toner that hasnt dried out my face and left it bright red. definately reordering
1,"Oh yum!! No, I don't actually drink this nooooooo! I bought it to use in making My own homemade soaps and shampoo bars,"
0,"I see that this product has tons of good reviews.... but I have to say, after trying it, and trying to STICK with it after it DESTROYED my skin... I am NOT pleased with it whatsoever.I have been using Olays ""Complete All Day Moisture"" lotion for YEARS. (I'm 24). It was the perfect lotion for my young skin (I know, I know, I'm by no means OLD now) It had the perfect amount of moisture and never clogged my pores. Well last year I had this crazy time of breaking out and I thought it was partially caused by the Complete All Day Moisture lotion, so I stopped using it. I went through many other lotions TRYING to get the breakouts under control. Finally, I changed my diet, attempted to rid my life of stress and went back to using the All Day Moisture. At first my skin calmed down and seemed like it might clear up......So since I use to bask in the sun, and I've used tanning beds, and even though I'm not old.... I noticed a few lines on my forehead and by my mouth (Those dreaded parantheses) I decided to try this lotion since I wanted to keep my skin looking as young as possible. All I can say is HORRIBLE.It felt GREASY on my skin, it never fully absorbed and it caused an even WORSE breakout then before. I had tons of little red bumbs across my forehead and on my chin. I thought maybe I was breaking out all over again due to stress and stuff, so I continued to use it unknowingly.Well a few weeks later it dawned on me that the lotion may be the culprit. So I switched back to the All Day Moisturizing lotion and WALLA!!!!!!! My skin calmed back down and the red bumps went away.This lotion may be a godsend to those with dry skin (Mine is combination) and who's skin has more fine lines.... but for young skin that is either combination or OILY, STAY AWAY from it! It will only make it OILIER!"
1,"In general, I think toners are a waste of time.This is going to sound stupid, but the graphics on the bottle were the primary attraction.  I came across this product at a a natural health foods store in the area.  Alcohol-free...I like that too.  I've been steaming my face a couple of times a week, and thought this would be a good way to remove excess cleanser and close my pores.I really like the scent, texture (it's a bit moisturizing), and how it preps my skin before my moisturizer (I use jojoba oil).  I have not had any problems with irritation, and have been using it at least twice a day for 3.5 months on my drier, hormonal-acne-prone skin.  If I'm going to mess with a toner, this will be the one I use."
1,"This won't take off blackheads or renew your skin overnight, but for what you pay for its ok. It does make my skin softer, reduce some redness, and has a calming smell. I mainly use this with my younger sisters when I visit from College. It breaks a bit when you peel unless you are very slow about it. When applying to your face you might want to make sure you have water on the side to start washing your hands off, its very sticky and needs a bit of soap to get off! Imagine applying it then turning the water on, you'll get the handle nasty. If that happens just wait to peel it off when it dries, but kinda annoying if you have OCD!"
1,"I am not going to make pretenses, I am a fan of the entire Aubrey Organics line through and through.  This is an exceptional product of theirs.  One just puts it on starting at the scalp and massaging down to the ends and keeps it on for fifteen minutes before rinsing.  The results are visible the very next day.  And what results are there!  My hair is immediately thicker and fuller and healthier.  It definitely helps with the split ends. I fully recommend."
1,It smells like a rose! So lovely. I guess I am going to buy this one again after using mine.
1,very good hot air brush. it's easy to use and make your hair shiny and curly too. it's very worth your money. the quality is more than the price!!!! love it.
1,"Although this is probably considered more of a female-oriented scent (it reminds me a little bit of baby powder), I find the Auric Blends brand of African Musk to be both incredibly sensuous and yet very ""clean"" (not overly heavy). It's a light, musky and somewhat powder-y scent which I actually dab on the back of my neck and arms when I'm working out at my stinky gym (I wouldn't wear this at work).  I find that it doesn't end up smelling like a heavy body spray when I'm working out (and I've had more than a few folks tell me they really liked it).  It smells like a VERY light version of musk incense that street vendors sell, but much nicer.Although a particular perfume scent is hard to describe, if you do see this being sold anywhere else, try the sample bottle. I actually bought my first bottle about 5 years ago for $5 from a street vendor in NYC who was also selling incense, but I haven't seen Auric Blends being sold on the street in awhile, so I've been buying here at Amazon. Price here is good, too. About $2.00 cheaper than what I've seen online at other places."
1,I love this stuff. It cleans your skin very thoroughly and leaves it very soft. I love the smell too! Overall I'm very please with this and will continue to buy.
1,"My son has been nail biting since before he was one year old.  He is three now and after the first week of using this product his nails are growing and look fantastic.  I have noticed in about three day this product wears off and he reverts back to the biting. Since this habit didn't start overnight, I expect it to take some time to break completely. I was skeptical before trying this product but now I strongly recommend it. I finally can see there is light at the end of the tunnel for my little nail biter."
1,"I have dry hands, as my job requires me to wash them very often. I have very sensitive skin/allergies, and tend to avoid anything with strong fragrances. This is my favorite moisturizer; it has a definite scent, but it's not floral or cloying at all. Most importantly, this rubs right in and leaves hands moisturized without any stickiness."
0,"My hair type is thick and prone to dryness on the ends.  My hair is not overly damaged but this product actually made it feel damaged. I used this product ""correctly"" as another reviewer outlined and still got poor results. There is nothing special about this product, it might as well been from the dollar store. I have used many hair products from cheap to very expensive and this fell way near the lower end.  After using it my hair felt straw-like and gross, something I had never experienced even when I do not use conditioner. It didn't even smell good. I couldn't find one thing I liked about this product. Will not be buying again."
0,"A truly lovely and uplifting scent. Clinique definitely had a winner with this, but unfortunately I cannot love this perfume. It was a staple in my high school and every other teenager I knew claimed it was her &#34;signature scent&#34; after Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) made this perfume popular for tween and teen girls in Legally Blonde. I wore it and so did every girl I knew. (This, and Love Spell from Victoria's Secret and Cucumber Melon from Bath and Body Works... ugh) I can't stand to wear it anymore and when I smell it on someone my age I honestly wonder why. I have to think that they don't have the same baggage attached to this scent that I have.But I do find myself sometimes picking up a bottle and spraying a bit if I'm in a store and there's a tester sitting out. It does hold some nostalgia for me, though quite bittersweet."
1,I love the smell and it lasts a long time.  I can't believe it lasts so long considering the price.  I like both the ones I tried; this one and LOVE.
1,i found this same product at Walmart for $6.00. i wish i had looked there first and i would have saved some money but i am looking foward to this smell. several you tubers says its smells like candy and thats what i am looking for!
1,"Absolutely love my Mac foundation.  For a woman of color it matches perfect.  It's light not to thick, foundation looks flawless."
1,"Smell not so appealing, watered down lavender. But this shampoo is great, makes hair very soft, shiny and it seems to really protect it from damage. Would recommend it again, and would buy it, price so reasonable for such a good shampoo."
0,"I thought this was more a mat finish,  but it is shiny and lands in every life wrinkle and laugh line around my eyes.  I am sure the younger ones would love it, but for this &#34;seasoned&#34; female who loves cosmetics this was not for me."
1,"I have been using product for 8 days now, and my forehead wrinkles already look better! About 40% improvement. Eye wrinkles less but noticeable too. More updates later after longer use!"
1,"It's alright, not really sure what anyone could expect for this price but if you're gonna use this as your primary bowl just know the inside isn't waterproof or anything, you're a lot better off using a mug."
1,"Finally found a lotion for dry skin that absorbs quickly and doesn't feel 'heavy!' Silky smooth and just a hint of almond fragrance. Easy dispenser plastic container that will  fit just about anywhere it's most convenient . . . bathroom, bedroom or kitchen. Description, product information, color and visual is accurate.This is now on 'my favorites' list . . . definitely recommended!"
1,The soap is nice but I thought it would have more fragrance. I expected it to have a nice Mango scent but I could not smell much of anything.
0,"The instructions also seemed to be written wrong (aside from referring to parts that weren't included). We kept putting off installing it as doing so would require a trip to the hardware store, which isn't a bad thing at all-just more trouble than this homely, chintzy thing was worth. In the end, we donated it to charity."
0,I used this product n it's okay.  Did not work the way it said......n I used it every night.  Sorry but I did use it every night like it said and did not see a difference at all.
1,"I have oily skin to the point where I avoided using moisturizer as every one that I tried in the past made by skin even oilier. It was embarrassing! I decided to give this one a try because of what it says it does and because I somehow developed small patches of dry skin on my face that needed to be treated, even though I was still oily. This moisturizer is absolutely amazing! My skin feels so smooth after application with no greasy after feel and I am totally shocked to see how well it has kept my makeup in place. I did not have to blot once during the day while at work. It's been 12 hours since I applied it today and my face still looks great. This product really works!!! I am overjoyed that I decided to give it a try and highly recommend it."
1,Gorgeous scent. I love the smell of rhubarb and snapped this up right away. It's perfect. At the end of the day it's just soap: it works and it smells nice.
1,"I usually don't pay this much for nail polish, but it is absolutely worth it! The color is a soft, neutral pink, perfect for french manicures. It is sheer, so multiple coats are needed if you want complete coverage. The brush applies it smoothly and it dries without streaks or brush marks. It also seems to last just a tad longer than less expensive brands."
1,"My sister originally told me about this product.  She's used so many different products for her sunspots and loves this one the best especially for the price.  So far, I'm loving it too."
1,"I wanted something to help with my face, a toner as well as a moisturizer. I did some searching a came upon Rosewater so I decided to purchase this item since it's pure. The smell is wonderful and the cleanliness feeling is great! I started using it on my body right out the shower to close my pores and to add extra moisture with my other moisturizers. A fantastic product that I recommend."
1,"It holds what it promises - smoothes out rigdes, and provides a smooth and matte base for the nail polish to be applied to. Good brush."
0,"These patches remind me of pieces of envelope paper with glue on them. They have hard edges which I find uncomfortable and itchy. It's difficult to sleep with them on and in the morning, yes they temporarily flatten lines, but at the expense of a border in the shape of the Frownie showing all around the area they were plastered to. A few facial expressions later and, voila!, you have the border AND the wrinkle. Don't waste your money."
1,I have used this product for about 6 years.  Light and natural looking.  Good coverage.  Like the SPF in it too. Try it!
1,"This is the best price by far! And NOW oils are great! I've started drinking lemon water for all of the many health benefits and an important part is the oil from the rind, just using lemon juice won't be as good. This answers the problem! Yum! Plus it's easier on your teeth :)"
1,"As a woman in her 70's, my skin has become quite dry.  My face cream i've used for some years was discontinued & it took some time to find a good rich-enough cream for sensitive skin...& was totally unsuccessful til I tried this Eucerin facial cream.  It's a definite winner for me!!!"
1,"This does work. I feel you have to do use quite a lot of it, however. My fine hair seemed weighed down a bit by it. Simply because I used three applications to get the tonality I wanted. If you do not have much yellowing to cover I feel you could use less. I do feel that this is a great solution for someone who already uses a mousse or for someone who does not need a great deal of toning. For me, there was quite a bit of yellow in my bleached hair so I used more than what I would have liked."
1,It did bring the under skin pimple to head faster but it didn't happen over night.  It took me 4-5 applies to make it worked.  Also the cream is very dense & hard.  Not easy to apply. Just wonder if there is anything better out there.
1,I love this iron. Nothing beats the hot tools marcel iron! The tinier curls are great for holding the curl but be sure to brush them out before you leave the house or else you will look like curly sue
1,"Reliable old favorite that still holds up in the market.  Good price, goes on smoothly and stays on.  I need waterproof due to oily skin, and I keep coming back to this one."
1,It's another try of a patchouli soap and nope it's not what I can call patchouli smell! I like it strong and it doesn't smell strong and the patchouli smell sort of is really too mild. I'd describe it more of an essential oil.
1,"Eyebrows grow in different stages, either they grow at the same time or sporadically and then fill out. Since I am in my early 50's, my eyebrows grow sporadically and slow, but with ardell they sped up a bit. I tried different eyebrow growth serums and nothing happens, but I tried ardell lash and brow growth for couple weeks and the overpluked area of the brow has filled in nicely. I still have a bit left to go."
0,"OMG this product name/claims make it APPEAR to be &#34;natural&#34;, but its made out of horrible chemicals:.... Claims &#34;No Ammonia, No resorcinol, No parabens &#34; So what?...it contains:peg-2 oleamine, aqua (purified watter), cocamide dea, alcohol denat (alcohol), propylene glycol, oleic acid,  ethanolamine, p-phenylenediamine ( TOXIC!! ), sodium sulfite, tetrasodium edta, hydrolized vegetable proteine, sodium erythorbate,  n,n-bis (2-hydroxythyl)-p-phenylenediamine sulfate, 2-amino-4-hydrohyethylaminoanisole sulfate 1 , 4-chlororesorcino...blah, blah, blahIt fried my hair so badly I cannot even brush it. wth. Also, this color has an orange tone. O-R-A-N-G-E.  Like a pumpkin. Only on crack. I would sooner shave my head than EVER use this product again. Naturtint, you are NOT anything near natural, you suck. People, don't use products that can harm you, cause &#34;allergic reaction&#34;, seizures, coma or death. Just the ingredient PPD alone is enough to make me say: Naturtint, you SUCK. DO NOT BUY! DO NOT USE! Unnatural color. Unnatural ingredients! Huge red flags! So glad they claim to not test on animals, but now I look like a damn pumpkin. On crack."
1,"For reference, I'm 25 years old with combination skin and acne, very fair with beige undertones.This is probably the closest thing an American company will ever make to a true BB cream. Almost all the others are just tinted moisturizer with some SPF if you're lucky. This one helps lighten dark spots and clears your complexion like the Asian ones do. I guess it's still technically a tinted moisturizer, but since all of Aveeno's moisturizers have corrective formulas it ends up being better than the others anyway.You have to warm it up in your hands a bit before applying it to your face, otherwise it streaks pretty badly and and flakes off while you blend it. It gives quite a bit of coverage without caking, which foundations tend to do for me. It doesn't cover my acne very well, but no worse than any other foundation without concealer. It gives a matte, porcelain finish that seems to last all day for me. The Fair to Light color (which was the only one my Rite Aid carries) works on even my ghostly skin.I recommend it highly."
1,"I have been a bare minerals fan for a long time, but I am finding products now days that cater to a more pure approach, all natural powders that I like just as much. I still use bare minerals but I use it more sparingly now."
0,This gell did nothing at all. I religiously put it on specific areas for weeks and nothing changed. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME
1,I have used this product for years and it is good. I'm pleased with it and never irritates my skin.
1,"I love OPI nail polish and although it covers nicely, it is not the pale pink color that I was looking for like the picture shows.  I'm going to try the &#34;Privacy Please&#34; color and see if it is more what I am looking for."
1,"Exactly what I ordered. Inexpensive. Bought it for someone else who raves about this product, but I have personally never tried."
1,"My eyelashes aren't particularly short, but they do go straight outwards so are very hard to see. The curler is a very good buy for the price and works great and it's very portable. I use it every day and my eyelashes definitely look better."
1,"I have had eczema for years.  my face was always itchy and rashy.... Went to several dermatologists and got varies cream but the problem kept reoccurring.Earlier this year I had a hard time breathing.  So I went to an allergist to figure out what to avoid.  Yes I was allergic to some usual stuff but that's not part of the story.  The doctor took a look of my face and pulled out a textbook to show me.  He said from where the rashes are located, it's &*^&%$*((* @# (injecting lots of big words and medical terminology).  Turned out my pores are confused, so they keep producing new skin.  Therefore the old skin is irritated.  (at least that's what I understood)So he said use T/Gel to wash my hair,  leave it in my hair for 5-10 min.  Also apply it over the rash area on my face and leave it there for 5-10 min.  The condition improved within 3 days.  Now my face is complete clear which has not happened in years!  I even look normal after swimming.  it's amazing.Pay attention when you order.  It's only the &#34;Original Formula&#34; that works with my condition."
1,"This is a relatively new product from a tried and true company long involved in natural medicines. It works well, as does their Nutribiotic liquid."
1,I had high expectations for this moisturizer because of the good reviews. The texture is thin and runny so I don't think I will buy this item again.
1,"Basically, this is a LONG, narrow ""scarf"" shaped microfiber towel that is used in the shower as a way to exfoliate the skin all over your body. I'm a distance swimmer who uses a ton of sunblock, so by the time I get out of the water, I'm really ready to SCRUB down my skin from head to toe and get all the chlorine and sunblock and salt and sand out of every pore of my skin. This Exfoliator definitely does the trick.The only thing to know about this is that it's NOT soft. This is pretty much the same texture as a brillo pad. It doesn't hurt your skin or anything, but it's not always a pleasant experience, especially if you have any sort of sensitive skin areas or sunburn.But if you want a deep down clean, including your back and other areas that are hard to really get at in order to really scrub down, this is the greatest product for the bath/shower. It's also excellent for traveling- it dries instantly and folds down into northing."
1,"The texture of this concealer pallet is fantastic, it has great coverage and a wide variety of uses, I guess it's meant for professional makeup artists and a lot of the colours are of no use to me but I use at least two of them on a regular basis, and two more occasionally, which is the only reason I'm giving it for stars, I feel like the range of colors is kind of a waste for me, but the  product itself  is wonderful, it's not cakey, gives me a natural for and concealed my imperfections, therefore I highly recommend it :)"
1,It's soft on my skin and smells good! I love washing my face with this in the morning and the night. I just wish it wasn't so expensive.
0,"I will start of by saying that it is difficult to do at home root touch ups for blonde hair.  This product turned by light brown roots organish-redish.  Although the organish-redish is better then my natural brown roots with my blonde lowlights & highlights it still is not what I wanted nor was it what the box stated.  In addition, the conditioner supplied to use after the touch up made my hair feeling as though product was left behind.  I have used it twice and made sure I washed the conditioner out the second time and still ended up with the same feeling in my hair and incorrect color. I would not recommend this product for somebody who is doing a root touch up with naturally light brown (or any shade of brown hair).  If you're trying to save money by not going to to hair saloon, I would still advise to choose another product.I give it a 2 star only because my hair was still lightened by the color, even though it was not what I was looking for."
0,"It says oil free, but with my crazy sensitive/combination skin, I should have known better.I've been using this moisturizer on my arms, shoulders, etc. for some light sun protection though so not all is lost."
1,"Ultimate spot treater! Zaps down pimples before they get better. Can be used to conceal pimples too, if u manage to get it to a shade closer to your skin tone"
1,"I've been using this product for about two months,I'm 69 years old w/good skin but this has given my skin such a boost,smooth,hydrated,people cannot believe my age.I really recommend this to use each night.It doesn't sting or turn red,just smooths wrinkles after a few weeks."
1,I got this as a gift item for my mother. I assumed she liked it didnt hear elsewise. Cant go wrong with Philosophy.
1,This is perfect. It gets really hot and keeps the curl. It cam e really fast as well. I would say get one
0,"I have type 2B (wavy) hair, and bought this hoping to get some frizz control. I diffuse and use a curling iron to get some more wave in my hair and after using this my hair seemed just as frizzy as it would be without using it. It does not make my waves more separated, and does not add more shine as claimed. I am pretty disappointed with this purchase, and will be keeping my eye out for better products."
1,This is the best cleanser for acne prone skin.  LOVE IT.  After using it my face feels so clean.  Much better than Proactiv or an other acne wash product.  Try it!
1,"my face changed for good ,so i recomend all palmers products i have been using since i was a teen."
1,"Makes nail polish last, :) i love itit look great after the nail polish or for rhinestones its great"
1,have used for about a week.  I think its a good soap.  don't really have anything to compare it to.
0,"I had been using the AD and E creamy cleanser by earth science but wanted to try this one as I thought it would help clear my skin up. I do not have bad acne, only a few spots here and there that generally go away in a few days.This cleanser first off smells horrible. I read the ingredients but still can't place the smell. Very chemically though Second it stings and dries my skin. Perhaps it is old or perhaps not even the actual product. I t was slightly open when it arrived and leaked a little, I should have just sent it back or thrown it out.I haven't ever had a problem with this brand and will not order from here again. I will stick to either the company site or another site that I normally use (vitacost) .Very unhappy, so is my face since it was irritated. And my nose for smelling this stuff.I didn't notice anything in the ingredients that I haven't seen/used in other products at one time or another so I do not know why the smell.Product is also too running and not very &#34;gel like&#34; as a cleanser should be."
1,"I didn't even want to finish the bottle, but I did give this a fair chance. This is an average shampoo, comparable to all other drug store shampoos. It lathers, it cleans. I still need a conditioner because it leaves my hair dry and tangled. There is a great rosemary scent, but I never got any of the 'volumizing' effects. I've had better and wouldn't purchase again."
1,"Suds up and washes off easily, and get a good amount of shampoo for the price.  Would probably buy again."
1,"Which is why im giving it 3 stars. I personally think it smells like old lady perfume. Once my mother reminded me, I remembered that she used to wear this perfume when I was younger ( her and a few other women). It even made her reminisce about the days she used to wear this before she had children. This is the second Auric blends roll on ive tried that I do not like ( the first was the vanilla) and have given to my mother(she seems to like them a lot and they even smell different on her)."
1,"If you have thick hair and especially if you have thick, curly hair, you're highly likely to love the functioning and style of this brush.(I'm trying to learn to be ''detailed and specific"" and write what I would have wanted to know before purchase, hence the length and detail)It turned out the reviewers who kept mentioning still having static and mentioning they had fine hair were accurate, I have ''fine hair but alot of it'' and the brush did not work for me in regard to static. It caused more static.Anyone relate to my ''wanting to really like this brush but...""???  It brushes the scalp in a tingling manner (for me, anyway), so invigorating I couldn't take it.  So, if you also like scalp wake-up, it's a plus.  If you're kinda sensitive, it's going to either take getting used to or you just won't like the sensation.I read all the existing reviews at the time of purchase (very recently) and I'm giving this 5-stars because it's durably constructed and comfortable to hold and yet I'm going to give to my hairdresser. Again, I wanted to like this brush but evidently having alot of fine hair versus dense, thick hair combined with a sensitive scalp won't work for me.  I can totally relate now to the rave reviews about those with thick, dense hair...and to the reviewers who kinda told me ''not for fine hair''.Just to push details to the brink here's the measurements in-case anyone wants to know if it's a take-along brush for them or a stay-at-home or both...BRUSH DIMENSIONS:It's an attractive brush, black and ''chrome'' color.  Across the head of the brush are nine (9) bristles with those little round tips, down the side of the head of the brush are twenty (20) bristles with the little rounded tips.  The total length of the brush is nine-and-one-half inches long (9-1/2 inches long).  The nine (9) bristles running across are a diameter of two-inches (2-inches).  The length of the brush head itself is four-inches (4-inches).  The handle itself is a bit shy of five-inches-long (5-inches-long)."
0,"While I like sweet fragrances, this one is too simple and smells like it would be for children. No depth, no intrigue.It isn't interesting or compelling, but even so, too loud.Someone wears it at work and I always wonder why, but then again, I don't like her clothes either."
1,"I used Clinique ""Take the Day Off"" for years, but at 1/3 the price, I found that Neutrogena performed almost, if not just as well. I have to rub a tiny bit more than with the Clinique, but it's worth it for the price difference.The Neutrogena works well and doesn't bother my eyes at all (I wear contacts). The formula does feel a little slick after you apply it, but it absorbs pretty quickly without leaving anything oily behind. If I'm in a hurry after using it, I just rinse my face with water right away. It takes off both my waterproof eyeliner and my mascara no problem. Eye shadow is a breeze. I also found thst it works better with the cotton rounds instead of cotton balls. The cotton balls absorb more of the liquid and I ended up using more product."
1,"This thing is amazing. I was worried that it wouldn't be a real Denman but this isn't a ripoff. I have shied away from these types of brushes in the past because they ripped my hair out, but the Denman is actually better than my wide toothed comb for detangling after I wash my hair. It's also great for wrapping my hair at night. I'll never use a regular brush again!"
1,"Businesses are so misleading these days. They must make an extra kick-a** version of their products and put it into samples then water down the rest to make more of the actual product. Then sell us junk. The sample I tried cleared my skin and was amazingly clean although it seems like the product is pure lard. I was impressed so I searched for the regular sized product and after using it broke out worse than ever. Makes you wonder how organic is this stuff and is there really bees and a guy named burt involved at all? Or just a clever advertiser...It's just not the same as the sample. Smells pretty good though. Instructions very vague (on all their products, it seems)."
0,"I ordered a package of 3. When I rec'd the order, one box of the product was so damaged that the &#34;developer&#34; lotion had spilled inside the box. I had to throw it out. As a result, I paid for 3 boxes of this product but rec'd only 2 I could use."
1,I have dry and grassy skin and this product helped me with that. My skin looks good after use it and is not aggressive like others
1,My husband uses this product not only as a skin lotion but also as hair gel.  He said it works great.
1,"Love this color i have almost purchased this color twice. Easy storage and highly pigmented. Color online is pretty much the same color. Fast shipping. Now seeing these cubes in local store such as Walmart and Target. Check your local store for deals. Also, remember Walmart price matches. Nail color also does not chip even with swimming everyday. It took 2 weeks before my nail policy stared to look worn after swimming everyday and washing dishes. Pretty good considering other nail polishes chip fast. Sorry not a fan of Belisha polish, it's too harsh for my nails and weakens my nails as well."
1,"I'm a hairdresser, so I'm used to using a lot of professional salon products.  This Free & Clear hairspray is good in the respect that it has no scent, but it doesn't hold my hair very well at all.  My hair is blond and fine."
1,"A lovely rosewater, but the smell is fleeting - perhaps because it's made from oils but then diluted with water rather than just being essential oils/extracts from petals? I don't know - this was a hypothesis given to me by my masseuse who swears by roses' purifying powers. In any case, it's totally benign and has not stained anything - I spray it all over my face and neck when I need to switch gears from one mode to the next. Highly recommend and less expensive on Amazon than at Whole Foods.Beware, however, that it does NOT come with a sprayer - that you'll have to rob from one of your existing bottles or buy separately."
1,The color is okay..Its alot darker in person then in the photo..Still pretty i guess but i prefer brighter colors..It comes out really nice though..Shipping was awesome(:
1,I've had bad acne for some time and now its coming back again I started using this as soon as I got it and saw results overnight!!!! I'm so thankful for this product
0,"I am ready to throw this in the garbage.  Its tooooooooo thick, i am unable to use it, most of it i use to clean my bathroom floor, sink and tub.  Maybe I can try again to thin it out with water.  I would definitly return it but it was so inexpensive that shipping will cost me more.  Dont bother ordering this, words cant express how dissappointed I am with Burts for selling this since I LOVE all their other products.  I will be contacting Amazon regarding this product and will keep you all updated."
1,"It's kind of silly that I'm reviewing Q-tips online, but this is the only kind that I will buy anymore. I tried generics, but found that the cotton tips are more compact and not as effective. These are 100x better :)"
1,"I've never really used a ""base coat"" before, but I heard they help! So I ordered this and received it quick! I went to go do my nails and put on one coat and it dried so fast! No waiting around long to start my colored coat of nail polish. Now lets hope it truly does help keep your polish on ;)"
1,Unfortunately for me this product is not quite worth the price.  I have small but easily clogged pores- this product has a hard time removing/cleaning that.  If you have larger pores I'm sure this product is fine. I'm probably going to pass this on to my husband for the pores around his nose.
0,WHen my eyes watered it came right off.  no staying power at all.  Went on easily but I will not wear it again
1,"Beautiful color, its a dark color but has such a pretty deep red to it.  Essie polish always goes on nice and lasts longer than other brands."
1,"I've tried just about every base coat on the market. I discovered this when I had my nails professionally manicured. I've used it for 2 years and love it. I had trouble with staining, ridges and chipping. This base coat has solved all those problems. I work retail so my nails get lots of rough treatment."
0,"I bought this because this was a favorite of my mom's and has been used by my mom for years. I figured since this particular one was water proof, it would be a plus. Boy was I wrong. Not even hot water gets it off easily, after loosing about half of my lashes, I threw it out. Save your lashes and stick to a great lash mascara that is not water proof."
1,"The regular version of these Pufs is way too rough, can't imagine using them on anything but elbows and heels. This extra gentle version is better for facial skin, exfoliates nicely. I use it with Neutrogena Facial Bar, rinse it well, and air dry it on end on a soap tray between uses. It does begin to pill slightly after a couple  months but lasts a good long time as long as you carefully rinse it and prop it up to dry out. This is the most cost effective exfoliating treatment available. Too bad its only available online."
1,"I've been using this moisturizer for years because it doesn't make me break out like just about everything else does, and it keeps my face nicely hydrated all day."
1,"Finally something for my horrible blemishes! I had been using the drugstore brand concoctions for my face and was sadly disappointed many times. It never occured to me that the ""other"" ingrdients could be to blame. I enjoy the fact that a little goes a long way and my pores are no longer clogged due to buildup. My skin is so soft and radiant."
0,"This lotion was not what I expected.  It was thicker and oilier than I thought it would be, and the scent was not appealing to me- smells a little too plastic. Still, with it being winter, I thought it would keep my newborn's skin soft and moisturized.Alas, after application, she broke out in a red rash. Tried it again after a few days passed to confirm it was this lotion.Thankfully, Amazon has excellent returns program and I was able to return for a full refund.Bought &#34;Noodle and Boo Super Soft Lotion&#34; and love it."
0,"I used this in my hair, but it seemed to make it tangled and nappy. Sprayed it on my face and besides smelling like roses, it was no more effective than plain tap water. Wasn't really sure what to expect when I tried it though....."
1,"I have used this for nighttime moisturizing and for sugar scrubs. It makes a great base for the scrub and my face felt softer after use. It did not help clear up my eczema though, nor did it help with acne."
1,"Want something that smells delicious? Well This is it..don&#8217;t look any further, I can remember this fragrance back in the day and I haven&#8217;t seen it in a long time until I was shopping for the older colognes. I put this cologne up there with DKNY, Gucci, Eternity, BCBG and Betsy Johnson&#8230;I love this stuff&#8230;they don&#8217;t make them like they use to but this one right here is a classic."
1,"I love this product. I also like the Shower Works ready-to-use kind - that one is a little easier/more convenient to use, but you pay for that convenience b/c it costs more. But both products work in terms of keeping my hair looking healthy. I would recommend using these about twice a week. For my hair, this really works - I have long, wavy, highlighted, fine hair (not thick)."
1,"Love the color, love the application and LOVE the conditioner.Future suggestions: Sell the conditioner alone too so it can be purchased independently of the color kit.  I would use this conditioner at least 2 x a week if available outside of the boxed kit."
1,"I use a lot of acne treatment products for my frustrating adult acne, which dries my skin out quite a bit. I love this moisturizer because it's not greasy nor too heavy, but it really does make my skin feel more supple and look better immediately after use. I use it every morning for sure, and sometimes at night before bed.I also like that it has light SPF, which should help with the wrinkles over the years, right? RIGHT? ;)"
1,I am a young woman and Im always looking for something to help keep my skin looking young and fresh and healthy. This product is AMAZING. I used just a pearl size amount every night after cleansing and my face stays moisturized the whole day after I wake up and after about a week I really started to notice that my skin tone was even and smooth. Great buy
1,"I got this for my roomate we shop at the store and they sale it for a much higher price. This thing works but dont expect you can stop using it beacase it is not a cure, but yes it works and you need to keep buying it for hair."
1,"Have used buf puf's for years, this is a good deal for 6 pufs. They are great exfoliators, I use it every other day and can see a difference if I miss a day. We live in a dry climate."
0,"I wanted a coppery orange color and i had dyed black hair so i picked this up to strip the color out (this is something i've done before with other brands with no problem) however, this formula is so crazy thick it didnt spread at all and my hair turned out so splotchy because of it. This product was not meant to be your standard bleaching kit, its for people with already light hair who want to go lighter, If your dark like me and wanted to go lighter i suggest manic panic bleaching kit or splat."
1,"This is a good brush, but on the expensive side. I've bought this brush quite a few times because it doesn't last very long. For me, it loses its fluffy texture pretty quickly, and eventually takes on a rough feel, which doesn't feel nice on your face. That said, I would save your money and try a cheaper brush, or maybe a more expensive brush that lasts a lot longer."
1,"I order this product to target problem shin areas. It is still in review but with 4 applications I discovered it soothe the skin, relieves the itch and has a good of that most important Neem Oil."
1,"I wasn't wowed by this product. I don't wear makeup and was just looking for a good general facial cleanser. I have oily skin that breaks out in times of stress. I bought this during a stressful time and it seems to have helped, but was not a miracle.  It works, but I guess that for the price I thought I would be amazed by it, and I'm just not."
1,I love Philosophy Shower Gel.  It leaves a wonderful scent and its not overpowering.  It lasts a long time.  This was my 2nd purchase.  I plan to try another fragrance.
0,"I have been trying to develop a skin care routine and was looking for a good moisturizer.  I have oily acne prone skin and this made my skin burn and break out even worse.  My face is red and dry now because of this.  Cystic acne is not fun to deal with and this brought out too many cysts around my chin and cheeks.  My face was doing great, clearing up before this.  Waste of my money, but I guess it's all about trial and error.  I take my time when adding a new product to my skincare routine so that I know if its going to break me out or not,"
1,"without it.  Love Vanicream, it's always in my bag- it's easier to spread than Eucerin in the tub and obviously this tube is more portable than Eucerin (which is my very favorite).  Vanicream has no fragrance, it isn't quite as moisturizing as heavy duty Eucerin, but it does work.  I use this on face, hands, body.  Eucerin original is amazing when it comes to softening elbows and feet, Vanicream is a close second.  I use Vanicream, Vanicream lite, and the facial cleanser (Free and Clear) made by the same company.  It's the best stuff for sensitive dry skin, like mine.  It absolutely will not irritate and it will calm the itchiness and soothe the dry patches.  This is a terrific brand all the way down the line."
1,My hubby lost his old bag and I thought his world had ended!!! I found this one and ordered it and I became the best wife in the world.....AGAIN! Great quality bag and if it made my picky hubby happy it will make you happy too!! Hahaha!
1,"I feel that women are really being taken for a ride by the cosmetics industry. I am always looking for excellent products that are truthfully, reasonably priced This moisturizer fits the bill. It smells wonderful, my skin sucks it right up, it does not cause acne or breakouts, and is very reasonably priced. If you are tired of sticker shock at other moisturizers, look no further.VERY pleased."
0,"Rather than leaving my hair softer and more manageable (which is a conditioner's most basic function), this conditioner left a noticeable, waxy residue in my hair. I wonder if this gross waxy film is what makes your hair feel ""thicker and fuller"". It does not glide on to hair very smoothly and smells like Pine Sol. Major disappointment. I won't be ordering this again and I would hesitate to try any other hair products offered by this company."
1,"The title speaks for itself hahah sorry I had to write that. This product feels so amazing to me!!! I have NEVER in my life, used a toner that didn't burn or tingle...this toner feels like your putting refreshing water on your face. I can't rave enough about this...I've been using it for 1-2 weeks now and I am in love with this toner and will never venture away from it EVER. It works just the same as any other toner but feels smoother and better for your skin. I know alot of reviewers didn't like the smell but I LOVE the smell. It smells pleasant to me and not too strong and I even use it while pregnant and my senses still like the smell lol. My Fiancee said it smelled like pesticides when he leaned over to kiss me which made me crack up hysterically but I guess everyone has different senses."
1,"The color is WAY more grey than pictured, but applying a UV topcoat brightens it up. I love it and would wear it regardless just because of the name!"
1,This product is as described and it works great.  I warn though... the taste is horrible! Which is good because it def helps you stop biting nails!
1,I am trying to get healthy so I discovered that body brushing is a good thing and I love this brush for that purpose.
1,Very small and strong blowing hair dryer. I love bring it for travelling which is light and not taking too much space in the luggages.
1,"I am down to the last few drops of my camomile gentle eye make-up remover by the body shop. the nearest body shop store is about 45 mins away from me and I can't drive there within the next 2 weeks so I purchased a cheap ( compared to the one from body shop) makeup remover from my supermarket to hold me over until I make it to the body shop.For giggles sake I applied my camomile eye makeup remover to one cotton round and this neutrogena oil- free eye makeup remover( after shaking it) to another cotton round.I placed both cotton rounds over my eyes to remove my eyeshadow, liquid eyeliner and mascara.I held each pad on eyelids for about 6 seconds so that each product can soak into the makeup. After 5-6 seconds, I wiped and looked at the difference. Neutrogena removed 98% while my wonderful camomile only removed about 85%. I turned the cotton round over and with the second wipe, neutrogena removed the remaining 2%, no traces of mascara left!!! The body shop camomile removed about 93% so I had to wipe a couple more times ( but this was my normal routine using it anyway).In the end after that camomile soaked round was used up, I still had a small bit of mascara residue on lashes so I used the neutrogena cotton round to remove it.I just permanently replaced my body shop camomile eye makeup remover with this neutrogena one. I love the moisturizing effect too, my skin is normal type."
1,"After many different skin moisturizers for my sensitive skin, I stopped at this one to balance my skin type. No perfume and not greasy."
0,"Did nothing for my skin. Used as suggested and no signs of brightness. Wish it worked for me, but it didn't."
1,"I was using neutrogena rapid anti wrinkle night moisturizer... By the way I am 36 and have 2 lines in the forehead and a wrinkle in the nose in between eyes. And also lines around eyes... I don't prefer to use chemicals near eyes.. So I use organic natural product for around eyes. The rapid anti wrinkle was good.. Still I felt it might be too strong and I don't need it now .. In late 30s... Might be in late 40s... So tried this cream which is milder... I am using it for the last 2 weeks... When I wake up every morning and see myself in the mirror... I feel like my face is super clean, fresh and soft...doesn't  break out my combination skin... So far so good... Will continue using this"
1,"I have been using this make up remover for about two and a half years now, and I love it because it works and feels great on my skin. Even though a lot of people complain that it is NOT oil-free (which is something you find out as you start using it), I don't mind it! It is a reasonable priced product that lasts a while, even with every day use. It takes off make up very fast and easy (even waterproof mascaras come off instantly). It smells nice and does not irritate skin!"
1,"After trying this product once, my husband noticed a difference in how his hair turned out after styling. He told me to buy this product again and now it is a favorite.This product is guaranteed to add at least 10% fullness to your hair after the first application.It has mild botanical cleansing agents and fruit acids. It not only cleanses your hair, it helps to purify your scalp. Polysorbates free your scalp of excess cellular debris which can block hair follicles.He doesn't use the conditioner, but I love usingit with this product.~The Rebecca Review"
1,"I think this is the best drugstore eye makeup remover on the market!I've tried Almay Eye Makeup Remover Pads (Almay Eye Makeup Remover Pads, Oil Free, 80-Pads), but it was not as good as this Neutrogena remover. Keep in mind that Almay pads was Allure Magazine's Best of Beauty Award Winner.Neutrogena's remover easily removes waterproof mascara without irritating my eyes, which Almay's didn't quite do. The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that your eye area is still left with makeup residue after using the remover. You need to use the remover specifically to remove eye makeup before cleansing your face. I hope Neutrogena comes up with a new remover that not only moisturizes eyelashes but also helps eyelashes grow longer, stronger & healthier!"
1,"To me there is no comparison between this product and the typical drugstore kit.Health-wise, if I am going to inhale fumes during the coloring process, I am much more comfortable with this than I am with typical dyes.  This does not have the noxious, chemical-like smell of its competitors, and I would bet anything that it is safer and healthier to use.Another key selling point is that it actually COVERS GRAY!Yes, all hair color products make that claim, but in this case it is actually true.  Ironically gray hair generally does not take color as well as hair that has existing pigment.  I do not mean to beat up on Clairol, but even their Gray Busters additive is challenged in terms of gray coverage.If you try this product, I doubt that you will go back to typical hair colors.  This is more effective and I am all but certain that it is more safe.Hint: mix in some of the ash blond shade if you are plagued by brassiness."
1,"I use this at night and I love it. It isn't a sleeping pill but in combo with a sleep pill as needed this works great, even alone it works night. I put it on and just doing the same routine is nice, but the smell is lovely too. I will buy more."
1,This was not for me. It caused me more breakouts and made my rosacea flare up even more. It does work nice on the neck area but no miracle product.
1,"I have thin hair and this product is fabulous.  It covers the area where my hair is thin and alsogives me the best body I have every had.  It is a little difficult to work with at first, but once youget the hang of it - it is great."
1,"So I guess this qualifies as an ""off label"" use but i use this primarily on my face to treat acne breakouts.  In fact what I really like to do is squeeze out some of the T/Gel into a cup and then add a few drops of tea tree oil.  Then i apply the gel to my face and let it sit for about 10 minutes before getting in the shower.  That works well on my skin but everyone is different.As for the smell I really like it for some reason.  Then again I always liked the smell of gasoline, turpentine, freshly paved roads, etc.  If those are unpleasing smells to you then this might not be your shampoo.  For me coal tar, or something else in the bottle, certainly SEEMS to help keep my skin clear.  I never really had bad dandruff so I can't evaluate it on that basis.On the downside 4 oz goes really fast.  I can use an entire bottle in 2 weeks if I'm showering regularly (you are supposed to apply, rinse, apply, rinse).  Lastly, it is only .5% coal tar so I'm not too concerned about using it pretty liberally."
1,"Suave Naturals Shampoo, Tropical Coconut - 22.5oz. .. I have used this many times before and I have always loved the fragrant scent"
1,I found this after I got a facial. I use it with the foaming cleanser and the brush and my face feels so clean and smoothe. I like using the other products in this line. I can really see a difference in my skin. I have a lot of sun damage (lived in the sun and tanned like crazy)
1,"I have owned a Caruso hair setting system like this since years ago and love it.  I have very straight hair and these rollers set soft curls in minutes.  Also, I have owned my system for approx 6 years and still use it!!  I use it once a week approx.Highly recommended product!"
1,I bought this to help cover my acne scars after I watched a product review. I'm so glad I decided to get this product! There's a lot of product in this container and it lasts all day! Not to mention the fact that it does a fabulous job of covering my scars. It's not heavy on my face like some creams can be. This is definitely a favorite that I will continue to buy!
1,"This is a great oil. It's one of the best natural oils out there. For Naturalistas (Natural African Amer. Hair wearers) this is one of the best moisture sealants for Type 4 Hair. I also use it to seal in my skin moisturizing lotion after I take a bath. Also, It's great for older women with dry facial skin use it alone or over your moisturizer. Finally, if you have eczema or psoriasis this is a great skin lubricant. Great stuff and I love this huge bottle, I insert a pump into and use, use, use."
0,"I purchased this on the recommendation of those who said it cured ""raccoon eyes.""  Was willing to give it a try, though I find it extremely expensive but thought I might be able to justify the cost of it really worked.  I was sorely disappointed.  Not only did it still end up smudged beneath the lower lid but it was practically impossible to remove from the lashes.  I have tried everything imaginable to get it off without pulling at the tender skin around the eyes.  I decided to give the mascara one last try by applying my regular mascara first and then applying a layer of this only on the underside, sort of as a top coat.  Still smudged.  Also, there seems to be very little product in the tube, and the brush is terrible in that the bristles wrapped in a spiral are far apart so when you apply the mascara it clumps several lashes together and leaves a gap between lash clumps.  Cannot recommend."
1,"I use this product primarily for its affordable combination of niacinamide and peptides in a non-cream, non-lotion consistency.  However, I was recently disappointed to learn from Paula Begoun's website that this product only contains 2-3% niacinamide, not the 4% I had initially thought.  Could someone confirm whether this is true?  If so, I'll be switching over to a niacinamide toner or alternative serum.For my oily but water-dry skin, I like this product more than the expensive NIA24 products.  But I'm turned off by the silicone primer texture: it would work great as a replacement for a makeup primer but I use niacinamide at night before bed, so the silicones are just not useful as a primer for me.  Due to the niacinamide, serum is not very compatible with the stabilized LAA serums that I use in the morning to boost my euro Tinosorb M sunscreens, so I can't use this product in the morning under makeup anyway.Please don't be fooled if your skin texture feels silky after applying this product--that's more likely the silicones doing the work in the short term.  It takes a long time of frequent application for niacinamide to work its magic on skin.Caution: for the time being, I wouldn't recommend using this product with anything with Resveratrol/sirtuins like some of the Avon products and Cellbone Solidifirm and Cellbone Resveratrol.  Niacinamide and sirtuins are not very compatible with each other, so I wouldn't recommend layering these products."
0,After that minimal steam. Cool mist worked ok. I agee with previous review. Towel and a pot of steaming water for me.
1,"My daughter is addicted to this toner. It has helped to clear her mild acne, the smell is a little too rosy for me, but she likes it and it's gentle & natural. I put a little in a travel sized container for myself so we could share this bottle since it would take me forever to use all of this."
1,Very pretty color for a nude look. Just what I was looking for and for half the price! Would highly recommend.
1,"I have been very happy with Olay products. I lived out of the county for years, but always had anyone that was traveling purchase my Olay products and bring them back to me.  I always kept a nice little stock of Olay products - never wanted to be without them."
1,"Mainly bought for scent after trying it out at my favorite local bar a few times. Honestly, I noticed how much I liked it for washing off the smoke scent from my hands while at that bar. Of course it's great in the kitchen or bath at home normally as a result. My hands get extremely dry easily and this is still really gentle."
1,"When I bought this I was hoping for a solution to my problem of a perpetually flakey face.  I have dead skin on my face every day that can be seen when I apply my makeup.  This stuff does take off some of the dead skin, but not all.  I'd need to use it every day.  And sometimes when I know there's a lot of dead skin on my face that I can see, I'll use this stuff and it won't ""find"" the dead skin to peel off (i.e., it won't roll the dead skin off in those little balls like it's supposed to).  And when I get out of the shower and put on my makeup... there it is... the dead skin.  So I think, for the price and efficacy, this is not a winner."
0,mine was smelling very bad- I wonder if  it should be like that or it is just old-  now happy-
1,"This smells amazing just like chocolate. It melts quick in your hands or wherever you rub it in. My face feels so soft when I apply this. I also use shea butter. Both of those products make my skin feel good. I work in a place where my skin gets dried out very fast so to have something that keeps me feeling so wonderful, I'll definitely keep buying."
1,At 56-um-something I noticed my crow's feet were getting pretty deep.  I used this with two other products from Olay and am happy to say I can barely see them now.  Not vain.....just like a clean fresh face without the early signs of aging.  Great produce and the price isn't CRAZY (you know the ones I'm talking about!)
1,It works for what I need it for. I loved that it was single packaged because I wasn't going to sit and measure it out. Only one issue with it... It smells kind of icky. Its not so bad though. A tip though is to just start with one packet and slowly move to two... Too much at one time can make you get morning sickness and thats just icky! All in all though I like it as much as I liked the prescription kind.
0,This had really good reviews on this stuff but it did nothing for my hair at all total waste of money for me.
1,This is one of my favs. I am 50 with normal skin but people think I'm 10-15 years younger! Awesome!
1,Smells nice and fresh and invigorates my skin! I really enjoy this mask. It works better than any other for the price. It doesn't dry out my skin (I have combination-oily) and it does actually seem to improve the appearance of black heads. The bottle is actually pretty big and for the price you should totally &#34;pull the trigger&#34; and try this!
1,"I've been using nailtique for almost a month now and I don't know what I would do without it. I've been struggling with thin, peeling nails for the past two years after a bad fake nail experience. I have tried a ton of the drugstore ""nail hardeners"" and nothing worked. Absolutely nothing.After using this product my nails have grown longer and stronger. I can't even remember the last time they have been this long!! For the past two years I've always had to have my nails painted because they looked so unhealthy bare. Now I can wear just one coat of nailtique and they look flawless. Even when I remove the product my nails feel tough and no longer bend. And they haven't peeled once since I started using it. I swear by this product, and I will never be without it!"
1,"This is my favorite deodorant because it is clear, I have noticed no stains, dries quickly and doesn't interfere with the breathing of people who are sensitive to fragrance, or annoy people who simply don't like fragrance.  I like the fact that the packaging is clear, too, so I can see how soon I need to replace it.  It is one of the few toiletries I take through Airport Checkpoint Security."
1,"I have tried both dept. store and drug store brand eye liners. I have tried them all from liquids, to pens, to gels to crayons you name it. Trying to search for that perfect, blackest black eye liner that will last more than a few hours. Well here it is ladies, this stuff is the best. For about six dollars this stuff will not fade, flake, crease or dissapear on you. To give you an idea I went to the gym with my son the other day. Did an intense one hour work out for an hour on the tradmill. Sweated my butt off, where I was dripping, including my face of course. Went in to the gym restroom thinking my makeup would be a mess, nope. My eye liner looked like I had just appled it! Today I put my make up on at 8:30 th morning, if I told you I am sitting here at my computer at 8:45 p.m. and my eye liner looks exactly the same as I applied it 12 hours ago would you believe me?? Seriously, this is the best eye liner ever. I am so impressed with this stuff I feel the need to go out and buy some back up in case they stop selling it. With other eye liners I normally have to touch it up in the middle of the day not this one. If you are looking for a very cheap, stay put eye liner that does not fade to an icky faded black, please try this. You will not be sorry."
0,"I don't know what it is about AHA products but they all make me break out insanely. I thought maybe it was just the face wash so I tried the lotion because of all the amazing reviews but it was horrible. First, it doesn't blend well into the skin. Within two days of using it I have acne all over my face, blackheads and huge cysts. I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone who has acne. There are waaayy better products, like Bliss No Zit Sherlock.Edit: I had 2 people say this review was ""unhelpful"" so maybe I should clarify. I DO NOT have sensitive skin at all, I've never had a rash or any type of allergic reaction to a face product before. Maybe this is an allergic reaction, there's a first time for everything! Personally, I just think this product is not good for people who have acne, but it could just be me."
0,"I'd say this is just your average hair dryer. I didn't notice anything magical happening with the ionic technology, and the accessories that it comes with are pretty cheap. Particularly the straightening-comb, which falls off every time you run it through the hair. The diffuser worked ok for me."
1,"Being a fan of lemons, I love the soft lemony smell of this product. It  works pretty well, too. I thought it would be a little more moisturizing but it does make a difference on your cuticles.  Worth a try if you have dry, cracked cuticles."
1,"This works, but if I stop using it my bacne comes back again =/It smells great and if you keep using it, it actually will work!"
1,"This product is not worth the price. You have to use so much and the results aren't great. I always wear my down in front and I got acne all over my chest. It was so ugly. My hair looked ok but I wanted to hide my chest. On days I wear my hair up I will use this just Bc it was 22 dollars. Would not purchase again. Lady's with curls check out catwalk and trendstart amplifier, you will not regret it."
1,"Don't ask me how I came across this product because I certainly wasn't looking for it.  I'm 43 and I like my face just fine.  Still, we all age and like many, I'm a bit vain and am willing to fight for my right to be as gorgeous as I can at any age.I got my Facial Flex on December 8th (today is the 17th) and have used it twice a day since.  First, I used the 6 oz. bands but after two days it seemed to weak for me.  Still, I noticed during the day when I turned my head left or right that my neck and chest felt a little tight.  Not in a bad way. It just let me know it's working.By the third day, I switched to the 8 oz. bands.  I was able to do about 120 reps and today I am using one 6 oz. band and one 8 oz. band.  I was going to buy the 14 oz. bands but figured I'd use up what I have first.The resistance with the two bands is now perfect.  I know because when I'm doing my exercises, I can almost NOT compress the device all the way.  It feels good when I take it out.  I really feel it.  And my face and neck are already showing definition.And just so I wouldn't be tricked by my eyes, I took a picture of myself on the 8th before using it and today, remarkably my jawline is more defined, my neck looks *stronger* somehow, my chin is more squared and I'm just plain pleased.  Yes, I can see myself using this product well into the future.  I can't wait to see what 6 weeks brings.Another great benefit it my lips.  They're plumper, juicier and lipstick glides on with fewer lines showing now.  As a note to anyone who's using it, take this tip: besides moisturizing beforehand, be sure to moisturize your lips, too.  I put on good ole Chap Stick in the black tube before using it to keep them supple while ""working out"".At work yesterday someone asked if I was getting more rest during this holiday season.  My face looks bright and has a glow.  A good facial scrub and a masque once a week and I've got my regimen down.  How easy is that?If you're thinking about making the purchase but you just aren't sure, take it from me.  You don't have to be 50 or 60 to see dramatic results in a short amount of time.I'm very tempted to use it more frequently but I'm sticking to my twice a day for 2 minutes.  I set the timer on my microwave and go at it.I am SO looking forward to my 44th birthday next month.  If I get results like these in just days, another full month should be incredible.  I'm taking a new picture every week just for my own proof.Amazing product!------------One more note --I noticed after posting this that the product I have is the Facial Flex Ultra but I doubt the product is so significantly different as to make a difference in results."
1,"This is the greatest thing since sliced bread...well no not really. I read so many rave reviews on this. When I first received it I was disappointed. I tried to curl my hair with it to no avail. I couldn't understand why so many hyped reviews. I was going to return this but then I read it takes practice. I practiced and I learned I had been using it all wrong. Now I have gotten the hang of it and am only keeping my old clamp curling iron as back up in case something happens to this one. Really awesome..the reason for only 4 stars is because your hair can get tangled pretty easy and when it does, it's not too pleasant. Also the cord is very short, can't move to my normal ""getting ready"" spot, need to stay close to the outlet."
1,I used this during the day for a couple months in conjunction with the Q10 night cream and it seemed to help soften the wrinkles I had started to notice.  Doesn't aggravate my acne prone skin and I like this lotion better than the night cream since the consistency is light and absorbs well and the smell is very minimal (plain suntan/lotion smell).  Works fine under my makeup.  Would be great if they offered it with a slightly higher spf to last just a bit longer (since I don't reapply over my makeup).
0,"i bought this with plans to mix it with almond oil and lotion to make a superior moisturizer but the smell is horrific and it gave me massive head aches. I even tried to mix in scent but nothing seemed to cover it. I had to through it out, im sure it works as a moisturizer but i just could not handle the smell"
1,"This was really, really heavy for my face.  It felt like wearing a mask.  I in turn gave it to my mother who really likes it, though.  So, all's well."
1,"Excellent soap.  Great lathering, wonderful scent and ingredients you can feel good about.  I'm truly clean when I step out of the shower, but not dry.  $3 a bar at Trader Joe's."
0,This is too light... didn't do anything for my hair. I also found the shampoo terrible... left my hair dry. I wouldn't recommend it.
1,"this will boost your hair like no other, it will have it looking good right after you flat iron it"
1,"I like it but is not awesome...your skin will definatly apreciate it, it will deep clean, bright your tone, make it softer...great for value price and.  Like the menthol like freshness"
1,"I am prone to breakouts and have tried Proactiv - which does work but it is too expensive for me to keep using, especially since my problem is hormonal/occasional. This product fits my needs perfectly. Whenever I see or feel a pimple coming on, I just take a Q-tip immersed in this astringent and clean that area - and that area only. I try not to wipe my whole face with it because it is drying. Last month my whole upper chest/neck area broke out for some reason. That was when I diligently wiped that area 2x a day, morning & night. Took care of the problem immediately."
1,"I am not getting up there in years yet, but there is nothing wrong with someone in their 20s protecting their skin- it is called taking proactive measures.  I love this stuff- I started using this stuff four years ago and I was sold from the very first use.  It goes on nice and easy and spreads over your skin.  It doesn't feel oily once it is spread on your skin and leaves your face feeling firm and soft.  My skin tends to get a little red when I spread it on, but that quickly disappears after a minute or two.  I love the way this stuff makes my skin feel!I have noticed that they now make a version of this serum that has no fragrance, but I actually prefer the fragrance!Definitely a five star product that I highly recommended.  I gave my mom some of this when she was out visiting, and she loves it too!  It is a must have for your skin care regimen!"
1,"* I waited 24 hours to let the color fully develop before writing my review since when it first dried, it was lighter than expected. Once I woke up and checked it out, it was darker. I held the box color swatches up to my hair and it was a very very close match.*I followed the directions and knowing some science, having lots of experience dying my own hair, and after reading more reviews on this product, and others, than I can recall, I had expected to be let down. Why? My natural hair color is dark brown almost black with some gray. I have dyed it multiple times within the year including dark brown to red and the most recent- highlights. I know these are not recommended per the box instructions and warnings on the outside of the box but I took a chance. The results? My ends which had been dyed the most and the darkest were darker than the box- but took the tint and blended well. The highlights took the tint as well but are lighter creating natural looking color variations/low lights/high lights/whatever you want to call them.*My natural base is red despite my almost black hair color. This lightened it and covered about 99% of my gray. The color was almost exactly what appeared on the box. No brassiness for me despite every other product I have used has caused brassy tones (which I like, actually, but am trying something new).I would recommend this product to anyone once they have a good understanding of their hair, can follow the directions/understand the warnings, and won't worry if it doesn't come out as planned. After all, it's not a perfect science- hair color doesn't always comes out for one person as it does another. I wouldn't recommend waiting until the day before a big event either like other reviewers I see have. That's just too much of a risk in my opinion."
1,This mascara is a great product for everyday. It's a classic! The standard brush is great and I don't have clumping issues.
1,works as expected
1,"I started using Eucerin products 25 years ago when my child's pediatrician recommended it. They are all quality products that are consistently good for my skin and my children's skin, and don't cost a fortune. It is not always easy to get a good selection of Eucerin products where I live, so was thrilled to find them on Amazon."
1,"This is the best facial cleanser by far!  I've tried Clinique, Neutrogena,Basis, etc. but I always come back to this.It is gentle yet thorough.  I use this in conjunction with my clarisonic."
1,this is what my hand and feet needs.. its really work.. all the rough skin will easily removed with out pain.. I use that every 2days before going to bed.. the results are amazing... go for it and see the difference on your hand and feet
1,"i bought the mini black, could not get them to stick to my lower lashes but i did use them in the inner corner of my upper lashes when i was using individuals"
1,"I loved this stuff years ago but stopped using it for a time. Just got a Subscribe & Save deal on this so I'm happy it's in my life again. It is helping to minimize the laugh lines that are starting to form around my eyes. The feel of this product on my skin is just amazing, and it doesn't upset my acne-prone chin area. I use it under makeup every day. Love it."
1,"Smells exacty like natural lavender, which is spicy and herbal, versus the overly powerful and too-sweet synthetic/artificial lavender most often used in soaps and perfumes.And that's a good thing.Degreases well, for a mostly natural product, and sudses well, too. Yeah, yeah, I know. Ionic surfactants can clean without suds, but let's face it--tons of suds are cool, I like them, I want them, and any product I use to wash my dishes (along with my hands at the same time) needs to have them. Simply put, I won't buy a dish-cleaning product that lacks them.Decently priced for how much you get and how long it lasts, this is also available priced similarly at my local GE Markt Distr store and at my Tarjay."
1,"This stuff is a little more pricey than I'd like for a face wash but consistent use will reduce the size of your pores. It STINGS like all get out if you get it in your eyes though so wash your face carefully, and with your eyes completely closed."
1,It's a Palmer's product and I like basically everything they offer.  This bar of soap is no different.  I like the way my skin feels after using it in the shower.  Would recommend this product.
1,Never disappointed. Best cleanser out there and last for a lifetime ( not literally). This is my favorite cleanser enough said
1,"I have used conditioning sprays by dove, loreal (costs $9 a bottle!) and frizz ease. This stuff is by far the best and only $3 a bottle at the store. I haven't gotten my hair cut since FEB and it is now NOV and I dont' have any split ends. I use it on my son too because he gets ""crib head"" or whatever it is called where their hair is all nappy in the back from how they lay on it, even though he is 2. This is the best priced and best working spray. I use sulfate free shampoo, skip the conditioner and just use this. I have naturally curly hair if that makes a difference, it is a tiny bit coarse, it isn't thick or thin. This stuff doesn't weigh my hair down either or make it oily, I still only wash my hair every other day."
1,"I used this stuff about 25 years ago, and it really worked wonders on my fragile, splitting, peeling nails.  I was able to grow out my own nails for my wedding.  I don't know if it's the cream, or the massaging action as I rubbed it in several times per day.  I do believe the cream itself strengthens the nails.So I got some more and started using it again, now that I'm past menopause . . I wonder if I'll get the same results? My hair and nails are much more fragile now. I'm sure that at least my cuticles will be in good shape.I also have used the Cream in the tube - better for carrying in a purse, but .. it doesn't seem to strengthen my nails like the jar cream does.  The jar cream is thicker, and probably different from the tube cream.  I dislike using a jar cream for NAILS of all things .. very unsanitary.. the tips of the fingers tend to be very germ-y, but... I try picking out some with a toothpick or popsicle stick . when I remember.Regardless, it did wonders for my nails.  They are the weakest imaginable.  I'm constantly finding a broken nail for no reason.  I did massage nail beds several times per day with the cream to get the results I did.However, after I had acrylic nails for a while? .. even with Barielle, it took months for them to recover.  I'll never use artificial nails for any length of time again. Only for a few days, perhaps, for a VERY special occasion."
1,This is the best moisturizer for sensitive skin. I find that this product takes care of some of my skin ailments and produces a better complexion.
1,"absolutely love this item.  color is great, perfect for contouring.  NARS are great.  easy application.  great price and works great."
1,"I ADORE this leave-in conditioner! It smells nice, it works great, and it doesn't leave a nasty feeling residue in my hair! I have very curly hair, and live in a humid climate. This stuff was GREAT for humid days. I use it EVERY day after showering, before I put in any other products, and it helps keep my hair from damage due to styling products. If I use just the conditioner, it leaves my hair soft and less frizzy. It's WONDERFUL stuff, and Amazon has a GREAT price!"
0,"This is not doing the job I thought it would.  Should an emergency occur I may try it again, but to date it has fallen below my expectations.It is hard to apply to the actual area where it is needed and seems only to want to cover (and stick to) unblemished skin... which is kind of useless."
1,johnson's & johnson's has done it again! i absolutely love this oil free lotion it makes my skin feel smooth and great with or without makeupi love using after i exfoliate or when im done cleansing after wearing make upim glad i purchased
1,"This is my favorite brand of at-home hair color. I have tried almost every kind out there, and this is the only one that provides a shade true to what is shown on the box. The color comes out vibrant, and your hair is actually soft and shiny after coloring. I definitely recommend this product (and any of the other shades in the L'Oreal Feria line)."
0,"I shiver at the thought, remembering when I last used this product. I have sensitive skin but didn't think that this product would effect it since everyone said how ""moisturizing"" Olay products are. First day I used it I didn't think much of it only that it's pretty thick and greasy feeling. Used it again the next day and by about the third day I had completely broken out in a rash and acne! It was so bad, I discontinued the use but it took couple weeks for my skin to return back to normal. At the time I was in my late 20s and I don't even break out, but this stuff made me look like a teenager in puberty! So if you have sensitive skin, or you think you might have sensitive skin I would NOT recommend it. Instead I would highly recommend Garnier Ultra-Lift, it's light, and does not irritate or make you skin break out. Plus it WORKS unlike anything else out there and gives our skin a glow, even under makeup. Plus completely got rid of all my wrinkles! :)"
1,"I'm a disabled person and have to have someone else do my hair for me. As i would really like to be able to do it myself, I find it disturbing that some helpers have no idea how to use this.  So que sera,sera. What can I do,but hope someone will know."
0,I do not know how this product is made or whether or not it has anything to do with roses.  It certainly smells NOTHING like roses.  Who knows what it is?  I feel badly cheated and will never order it again.
1,"The price of this product is wonderful... It lasts along time and a little goes a long way. I love the wonderful smell of this product, but was initially concerned that this would cause my sensitive skin to breakout. Thank goodness I didn't have any negative reaction to this product. It is moisturizing and I love it. I'm not so sure how well the anti-aging works for this product, but as a moisturizer it works well."
1,"The thought of cutting my hair is beyond consideration but two little Yorkies just love this set.  The main reason is that is is quiet and effective.  Those, to me, are the operative words:  quiet and effective.  When you turn the clipper on it makes a humming noise instead of a loud ""I'm going to get you"" sound.  Then when you start cutting small animal hair you actually cut it without pulling or leaving gapping holes in their fur.  Maintenance is easy and with all the tools you could almost go into business but I'll pass on that.  Additionally, you have the Wahl brand and that makes a positive difference."
0,"I used Aveeno for years but switched to Elta MD over two years ago and have not looked back:Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46, 48-Gram 1.7 oz.Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46 provides higher spf protection and goes on smoother with a cleaner finish.  Elta MD is much better for combination or acne prone skin than Aveeno.  Elta MD does a FANTASTIC job of calming the excess redness in my complexion, something Aveeno has no effect on.  I also love how Elta MD goes on much lighter than Aveeno and Elta MD lasts longer as a result.  Elta MD is more expensive than Aveeno but I found myself going through an Aveeno every 2 months and a container of Elta MD lasts me over 4 months, so net net you are spending about the same or less with Elta MD over time.Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision."
1,i love facial soap that is foamy and great for the skin for this product is tested and approved by skin doctors so with that in mind you cant go wrong.
1,"I got a free sample of this with a recent Amazon order, and ordered more as soon as I'd tried it for a week. Cannot believe how well this product works. It's absorbed immediately and your skin it doesn't glisten or feel like clay after using it (as with Cetaphil's moisturizer.) I hope its not possible to build up a resistance to it (dermatitis). This is the product to replace your Cetaphil with if you're not happy with that stuff.Miraculous."
1,i use this at night time; i have slightly oily and sometimes acne skin; but i still need a moisturizer;  it is not greasy and i can even wear it under makeup if needed.
1,"As of August 2013, Nizoral is once again available through mainstream outlets. The main ingredient, ketoconazole, has been shown to block DHT and, hence, reduce male pattern hair loss.  I wrote to the company to get their opinion and they generically refuse to comment saying the product is not FDA approved for hair loss.If you have access to a journal database via a medical library, you can locate many research studies demonstrating the DHT blocking capabilities of ketoconazole.  This effect is very different from suggestions that other dandruff shampoos reduce hair loss by removing dead skin cells or improving blood flow to the scalp."
0,I am 23 years old with combination skin. I have used this cleanser the past two weeks and I had immediate acne flair ups as well as over drying. I was unimpressed with this product and disappointed after the reviews. Just didn't work for me.
1,"I bought this after reading many online positive reviews. The RoC Night Creme arrived today and though the RoC Eye Creme and RoC Daily Moisture plus SPF30 cremes had expiration dates, The Night Creme did not. I will save you a call to the RoC. Here is there number should you have more questions however: 1-800-782-1964.The Lot # on the box reads like this:  0639V  AThis means the product was made on the 63rd day of 2009 (March 4th). I was told that there are no expirations on cremes with an unlimited shelf life such as this Night Creme.  Other cremes such as the ones with sunscreen have a shelf life with expiration dates.  Cremes can go rancid, and stop being effective. Always smell product, and make sure you yourself do not contaminate products with unclean hands or leaving caps off near sinks etc.There was a 10 minute wait to get to a RoC phone Representative but he was very helpful with my questions."
1,"I got this night cream to use during the harsh winter months. I have a trouble dry spot in the center of my forehead that need extra attention in winter. I got this having heard nothing of the company beforehand. I do like it, the cream really moisturizes my dry spots. It  is pretty thick too, but if you apply while your face is damp, it rubs in easily and I noticed that I don't use as much too.Not that it is summer I have only used it a few times. I don't want to coat my face on a hot summer night. I don't think that would be good for my pores. I would recommend this product for someone in a dry climate, (DC is super humid in Summer) or someone who is looking for a good dry skin fix for the winter."
1,"Another quality Aveeno product! Nice scrub without being too abrasive. Nice mild scent, and a little goes a long way."
0,"Not sure if this really does anything it claims.  Everytime I use it, I say to myself what is it supposse to do becuase I do not see any kind of improvement.  Firming??? Hmmm.....Am I missing something here?  Ok I tried it but will not waste my money on ordering it again."
0,I don't understand why they put fragrance in a facial cleanser.  I am allergic and am not able to use this cold cream.  It gave me a migraine and an asthma flare-up.Also I am disappointed that it did not remove my mascara and did NOT do a good job at removing my eyeliner either.  I don't wear heavy makeup so this should not have been an issue for this product.  It's really too bad because it is a good price and I can't afford more expensive products.
1,"Everything has a smell. When Aveeno says that it is fragrance free that means they did not add any external fragrances to the product which can be irritating to some people. This product smells like cooked plain oats when initially applied, but that will go away after it absorbs.Now that that's out of the way, the reason I rated this product 3 stars is because Aveeno seems to have changed its ingredients around from when I first bought this lotion. Oat Flour (Avena Sativa) use to be its FIRST(most abundant) ingredient. Now it's the 7th, and the first ingredient is water, which I think has caused this lotion to be less effective than it used to be for me."
1,"After years of not wearing make-up I tried to use bare minerals. Although I liked the way it looked, for some reason, my face felt itchy. So, I stopped using and started wearing MAC. But, MAC often made me feel like I was wearing make-up. So, one day, on may way to the MAC counter, I stumbled across bare minerals again.This time, I learned the proper way to apply it and what a difference that made! And, I love it! It really looks and feels natural. It makes me look better but not made up. I can wear it every day. And, people compliment me on looking great. So, my suggestion is that you take the time to go to a make-up counter and learn the proper techniques before you buy.My only concern is that bare minerals does not cover dark circles very well. So, I use Bobbi Brown for that. But, the other bare mineral products can help to give you a natural glow of beauty. And, the brushes are reasonably priced compared to other high end cosmetic brands."
0,"This was a total waste of money - I've had it a week and the bristles are falling out all over the place.  I thought maybe it would get better after a few days, but no luck.  I don't know - perhaps this is not the real thing because the first Bare Minerals brush I owned (that I replaced with this one) was fine for almost a year before it started shedding."
1,"As I get older I find that even though I live in a fairly humid climate my lips dry easily and even peel (yuck!). Lip balms that used to work only made matters work. I was dubious when I read reviews stating this product could relieve peeling lips overnight, but nothing locally available was working so why not try it?By golly, this product relieves peeling lips overnight! So I got several!"
1,"I like to use this soap in the Spring and Fall, because my skin isn't too dry or too oily as it is during the Winter and Summer months.  I have sensitive skin, and it cleans my face gently without leaving it dry or greasy.  I don't like using facial cleansers, I prefer bar soap.  This soap has been hard, if not impossible to find in stores during the past few years, so I am glad I'm able to find it here on Amazon."
1,"Some background so you know I know my stuff when it comes to beauty products: I've worked in the beauty industry for over 25 years, with a variety of brands and price points. I remain enduringly curious and enthused about trends in products.As someone who often has favored tinted moisturizer or sheer foundations as I've put on some mileage, I got quite interested in what BB creams had to offer. I already have one I really like by Too Faced. But I've been staring at some of the mass market options to have something that I felt a touch more casual about. And just to experience something different. I'd been circling around some of the L'Oreal ones since they also own Lancome and the technology seems to overlap, but also staring at a few of the other skin care brand ones. Chanced across this one. Now at 48, I'm usually looking for a radiant finish. Something glowy to keep this illusion of youth going. But my skin at that time had been behaving so youthfully that I had a few small blemishes (rare for me). So I decided I'd try this Aveeno one to help steer my skin clear again and then save it for the summer when skin is less dry and the 25 SPF will offer more incidental protection than the 15 SPF I usually wear.Thing is, though my skin snapped right back to normalcy, I haven't given this one up.The finish reminds me more of a light foundation than a tinted moisturizer, but I like it anyway. The tone is balanced as far as warm and cool undertone. It smooths on nicely and doesn't change consistency or tone. It simply looks good. I'm going to stock up, because usually I only see one or two bottles on the shelf when I actually can find this item. Don't tell the brand I'm working for, I'm wearing this though I'm selling something more prestige."
1,My favorite...AS SEEN ON TV MHRCD12 Miracle Hand Repair Cream....works really well absorbs my daughter also loves it as well.
1,"The wave lasted a couple days but the curls fell within a few hours, I'm going to keep trying smaller rollers. i have a lot of thin hair that is long (upper mid back length hair), it's layered....the jumbo rollers are almost worthless. I get a decent curl out of the large, medium gets too tight of a curl just out of the roller but it falls eventually. Im going to experiment more because I am looking for a less damaging ways to get long lasting curls."
1,only reason i gave this product 4 stars was because the teeth on the comb are hard and a little sharp (but i'm tender headed so i'm not sure if that has something to do with it?) Product arrived a day early than exspected and was in great condition and original packaging.
0,I used this product devotedly for several years until it became almost impossible to obtain in stores or internet orders.  It might even be unavailable?  I switched to another newer self tan product with 15 SPF and found it to be highly superior.  The Bain de Soleil Mega Tan had a very drying effect on skin.
1,"I was getting a lot of neck acne because I have course facial hair. This stuff is a lot better than using all that expensive acne medications and scrubs on the market. It is also a huge bottle and will last a long time. Just make sure you don't get this in your eyes- I accidentally did and it seriously burned me. I'm ok now, and will use this when needed, but keep your eyes closed!"
1,"Vintage Peach is a really pretty, peachy-pink.  Bare Minerals feels great - like wearing no make-up.  I have sensitive skin and only use their foundation (Medium), Mineral Veil, Warmth, blush and highlighters."
1,"My dermatologist recommended this to me 10 years ago and I still use in when I occasionally have dry skin.  I do not use it as much anymore since it cured my dry skin, if you have eczema, this really helps."
0,"Repeated use of this hand soap completely dried out my hands to the point of the skin around my fingernails cracking. I had to throw this product away. And when I stopped using it and went to another hand soap, the skin on my hands got better almost instantly.I've now tried this and the lemon counter top spay and have been totally unimpressed with the performace of the Mrs. Meyer's products. They may smell nice but they perform mediocre at best."
1,"This gel smells great, feels great, and Amazon's price was terrific. I haven't used it as a shampoo, because I color my hair and am afraid this would be too harsh. It would definitely make your hair smell good though! The scent is very nice, light but very pleasant in the shower, although not really strong enough to linger once the shower is over. I actually bought the cologne in Amazing Grace after using this shower gel and am thinking of getting the body lotion."
1,"i like this product, it has a fresh smell and it cleans very well. leaves my face refreshed and not overdried."
0,"I have fine, shoulder-length hair.  I primarily use hair spray around the roots to add body and to hold the baby hairs in place.  I developed a mild reaction to the current hair products I use (that works) and tried Free & Clear Firm Hold Hair Spray.I'm not happy with the spray.  I'm not sure what it really does because it feels like my hair is still doing it's own thing, regardless how much spray I use.  I may as well use NO HAIR SPRAY because it seems to wear off a few minutes after application.  This is after a using it for a few days: my hair is unruly.  I'm going back to the stuff I'm allergic to (it worked all this time without issue).PRO:* No itchy dandruff due to allergic reaction to hair products.CONS:* Hold is not firm nor does it give my hair body.  Big Sexy Hair's Spray and Play Harder holds better.  Kept my hair in place without looking it like a helmet.* Does not keep baby hairs in place.  John Frieda's Fly Away Tamer does the best job on this one."
1,"I love these for cleaning up cuticles after a manicure.  The cotton ? is tight and has a nice point, no fibers smearing into the wet nail polish.  I am so glad I found these!"
1,"This is a lovely cream.  Go easy on it though because it only takes a small amount.  I like to add just a dab of the cream to my face, otherwise it can feel a little greasy and I don&#8217;t like greasy.  The fragrance is nice too.I don&#8217;t wear any cream every day, I like to change them around or I get bored.  Silly, I know, but that&#8217;s the way I am.  This is a cream I always seem to come back to.  It&#8217;s one of my favorites."
1,used this for my sons yeast infection. worked wonders. mix it with a&d ointment and a few days later it was gone.
1,"This will cover your grey, but I do not recommend it for those with a full line of roots to cover.  It is sticky and heavy, and it will rub off on your fingers when you touch the area you use it on. I would choose a marker style grey cover that is liquid over this."
1,"This was not easy to use. It's very dark, it sprays out thick and it gets all over your hands if you touch it. Even after it's dry, it's still possible to stain your hands. It's not easy to wash out. Do not sleep with it in. It will stain anything your hair touches. Think of it as hair spray paint that dries kind of chalky. It's similar to charcoal in the way it feels. I don't recommend for daily use only because you must wash it out daily. For women, this dries out our hair. Do not try to work out or sweat and wipe your hair with a white towel. You will regret it (&#62;..&#62;)"
1,"Left this on longer than the 30 seconds and felt I had better results. It's a great cleanser, although it stings a bit. I think the fact that this cleanser has menthol makes it great, as menthol is known to reduce acne inflammation. It didn't get rid of acne but it definitely helped reduce outbreaks."
1,"***Note: This review is for the bar soap, not the shampoo***I take extra good care of my skin: wash with Syrian olive soap, moisturize body with argan oil, tamanu oil and avocado butter; moisturize face with the the same oils plus rosehip oil and Josie Maran sunscreen. As a result my skin looks really good at my age. Imagine my consternation when my legs suddenly broke out with psoriasis about 2 months ago! I have never had psoriasis or eczema in my life. As a child I had several fungal skin infections and 2 cases of cellulitis, all of which contributed toward my current obsession with healthy skin. So I tried extra tamanu oil on my legs - nothing. Washed my legs carefully twice daily with my beloved olive soap - nothing. The dryness and itching were maddening and there was no relief to be found among all my precious oils. Somewhere in the back of my mind I recalled reading something about pine tar being good for treating skin problems, so I ordered this soap because it got the best ratings though to be honest I did not expect much. I also broke down and reluctantly got a cortizone cream by Aveeno for the interminable itching. I had heard bad things about cortizone so was leery but desperate! The combination of these two things gave immediate relief and within less than a week the abominable itchy red spots were gone completely. Who knew that for less than $15 I could get rid of it so fast?Given the stellar results, I sure as hell do not mind the woodsmoke-like smell of this soap. Indeed, I have grown to like it - reminds me of summer camping in the woods. I am sure that my psoriasis was a milder case than others may have, so if yours is severe you may need a doctor. I am really amazed at just how well this soap worked for me, though!"
1,"My significant other uses it to moisturizer his... nether regions post-trim down.  He swears that it keeps ingrowns at bay and makes it that much more comfortable.  Definitely worthwhile for moisturizing the face, and other parts of the body."
1,"*****This has been my daily moisturizer for several years. It makes my skin very soft, very healthy looking, and glowing. It makes me look radiant. I have given it as a gift to my sister and to other women, and they have all liked it as much as I have. No one has had any adverse reactions. You can notice a difference after just one use. When I've run out and used something else temporarily, I always can see the difference again once I start back up. It is as close as it gets to a miracle cream.I do not wear makeup, so Hope In A Jar is it. I am 49 years old and I think my skin looks incredible. The friends I have given it to also like to keep a natural look and prefer their skin without heavy creams, thick moisturizers and sunscreens, or makeup.The women I know who are fans of Hope In A Jar are like me. We're kind of lazy no-fuss ""one cream that does it all"" people; instead of one jar of something for one thing, and another for something else---eye creams, night time moisturizers, daytime moisturizers, etc.---we're the type that wants just one that can do the job and then be done with it. In other words, we don't have the patience to fuss with our looks a lot, or to spend money buying bunches of different creams to keep track of and remember to use.Unlike other reviewers, I love the smell, which is not perfumey, but definitely pleasantly distinctive. I use it around my eyes also, and have not had an allergic reaction. It seems, though, that these are the two biggest problems with Hope---the distinctive odor and allergic reactions among some people. I would suggest buying it the first time from somewhere you could return it if you don't care for it; although in my opinion, this would be unlikely, apparently it is possible. Philosophy now makes another version of Hope In A Jar for sensitive skin; if you know that your skin in temperamental, perhaps it would be better to also try this version. I have stuck with Hope In A Jar because it works so well for me.It seems expensive, but it is not because it lasts a long, long time. The two-ounce jar lasts me about six months. I use a toner and then Hope In A Jar and that's it. I'm done with my face in 30 seconds. Plus, it gives me a look that most women use makeup to get, so I think it's a bargain.*****"
1,"Beautiful color, though a little sheer. Needed three coats and it's still not completely opaque. Love the jelly-ness quality though!"
1,This is one of our favorite shampoo's to use as the smell is very fresh and clean and lingers on his coat for a few days afterwards. Most doggie shampoos smell great initially but don't offer up enough lather or continue smelling fresh...this one is the exception. It's the best one we've tried of all the designer shampoos and it's nicely priced.
1,"This face wash feels luxurious on the skin. It cleanses very gently and washes off without leaving any residue/greasiness like some other &#34;gentle&#34; solutions do. I was a little worried about acne, though, so I alternate between using this and an exfoliating face wash every few days."
1,I usually would use Clearasil's blemish cream but decided to try this instead as it had really good reviews. I don't think it works as well on my skin as Clearasil's blemish cream did and I would probably not purchase it again.
0,"I have bought NARS products for years knowing that no matter what I bought I was getting a quality product which why I don't mind spending the money. Unfortunately this duo Windstar lacks everything NARS is coveted for! No pigmentation,awful glitter fall out, absolutely awful. These shades are so beautiful and flattering in the pan but are virtually  invisible once you attempt to apply them. Save your money and get All about Eve or Alhambra"
1,"I've used several different brands of henna and this is my favorite. The henna is finely ground and that makes it easy to rinse out of hair. I don't use it the traditional way because I don't have time. I mix it with conditioner and slap it in my head over night. My hair is moisturized, my grays are auburn, and my hair feels smoother. It smells similar to hay or alfalfa. If your hair is dry, you might want to mix it with conditioner, shea or another butter, and/or honey."
1,"I love this color and received compliments on it every time I wear it.  I am African American with, dark skin and it looks great.  I loaned it to a friend who is Caucasian with a fair skin tone and it looks great on her too.  Anyone can wear this color well.  It's a deep red, sort of burgundy yet it did not stain my nails at all.  Goes on smoothe and drys to a beautiful finish with just the right amount of luster.  Lasts just as long as any other nail polish and removes easily."
1,"I have used an entire jar of this cream & I really like the way it makes my skin look and feel, especially my neck area.  It works very well to moisturize, minimize fine lines & wrinkles, & does not irritate my sensitive skin.  I will definitely purchase this product again."
1,"Very expensive but WONDERFUL make up. My skin tends to break out in zits even at 39! I look young but it sux to not be able to wear regular foundation as I am uneven in tone and wish to cover up tons of imperfections. I can use this stuff and it looks GREAT and gives suncoverage (sunscreen). May I recommend though Physcian's Formula dry type make up? It is CHEAPER and works almost as good! I use sunscreen though FIRST with Physician's Formula.  I found a link in here...but I found the mineral face power and mineral veil at Walgreens...Physicians Formula MINERAL WEAR Mineral Face Powder & Mineral Duo Eyeshadow (1 KIT), Light Bronzer"
1,"Olay olay regenerist, this serum is the best, very good and does not clog your pores. I will buy more"
1,I have been using these for many years to exfoliate my skin.  The size is a good fit for my hand and they last a long time. I highly recommend them
1,"I've used this Heritage water to chase away kid sized monsters ( changed the label to read: Removes bad dreams and eliminates things that go bump in the night), freshen up the dog, pretty up all the rooms after cleaning, tone my pores-less expensive and better quality than the salon priced rosewaters, and scent my bathwater. How's that for one little bottle of quality rose water?  I love the lavender too. LOVE LOVE LOVE these floral waters by Heritage!"
1,"For those of you that really wants a great facial steam, this product doesn't neccessarily perform the greatest. Its good but it doesn't cover the entire face. With a facial steam, you want to be able to cover the entire face --- in this case, I would suggest going to the gym where they have a STEAM ROOM. But again, this product is not a bad buy... i just don't use it much after 1-2 uses.. because i don't think the effect is really great."
1,I am half way through the bottle and still have problems with my scalp. I will continue to use (instead of almost everyday) to see it it makes a difference. The price isn't too bad though. so I might buy another one.
1,Quick shipment.Customer Service was great.This product works very well with the other Alpha products.It however doesn't leave my skin feeling very clean if I used alone w/o the other Alpha products.
1,"* The Neutrogena Cleanser worked fine, but I found it a little to strong for my skin, would like to try the Aloe version* My Boyfriend likes it for the acne he gets on his back* A great buy for the price!"
1,"I love OPI, red and have Chihuahuas. Couldn't think of a better polish to show my Chihuahuas how much they mean to me than to wear one that is about them. Do recommend."
1,"To be fair, i'm still learning how to apply lashes, but after it dose get tacky (3-5 min) its really hard to remove if you make a mistake on placement. Also, did not dry clear."
1,"I have to say that I love most of the products from this manufacturer and this is actually how I happened upon this particular product.  I first utilized the vitamin c cleansing milk and thought that was what I was repurchasing, but instead ended up with this gel.  I must say that this product cleanses the skin really well (as evidenced by the salicylic acid cleansing cloths that I use afterwards).  It give a fresh feel and actually helps to diminish uneven skin and reduce darker pigmented scars.  I love this product as well as most Avalon Organics products.  If I had money and if they were a public company (I don't know their status), I would buy stock in it.  :-)"
1,"If your scalp is itchy, T/Gel is worth a try for as long as you are willing to keep using it for a few months. It worked for me but there were no 'instant' improvements. In my case the itchiness went away VERY slowly but, 3 months later, it's 99% gone.I'm not sure what the exact problem my scalp had but it was itchy like... you know what. It began about one year ago and I couldn't stop myself from scratching which, of course, ensured that my scalp stayed itchy and irritated. Discussing the problem with our good family doctor back in October or November (7-8 months ago) did not help much. He had nothing to prescribe but suggested that I massage my scalp with cortisone cream - messy because I have a fully head of hair and I am not planning to shave it - and predicting that the itchiness will get worse in the winter. (Thank you doc!)To make the story short, a couple of months ago I stumbled upon a bottle of T/Gel left over from the time I used it (effectively) to address a dandruff problem and decided to give it a try. The box claims that this is 'effective from the first use'. It's not. My scalp was still itchy one month later but maybe not as much. And... a couple of weeks ago I just noticed - I wasn't scratching or massaging my head any more. The itch was largely gone.I can't say that the T/Gel cured me and it's quite possible that the itchiness would come back if I stopped using it. Maybe I will experiment with that in a couple of months but, at this time, I am content and happy to have it at least under control with one weekly T/Gel use. Yes, it smells a little funny but if you use it before going to bed the smell should be gone by morning.The product deserves my 5 stars because it worked for me. It's possible that it doesn't work for everyone but I can't see how trying it would hurt.____________________________________NOTE: about the smell.The active ingredient that addresses itching and flaking is 'coal tar' which is smelly. Neutrogena has patented something they call NEUTAR which is a more refined version of coal tar that doesn't smell as bad as the traditional ingredient. This version of T/Gel contains 2% NEUTAR."
1,"Maybelline Great Lash Mascara, Dark Brownis so easy to use. One of the few brands that offer brown shades of mascara.  I am very fair skin, and black mascara looks so harsh on me.  I am so glad Amazon offers this particular Maybelline mascara as it washes off easily with soap and water.  I highly recommend this product.For Maybelline Water Proof Mascara, I recommend Maybelline eye mascara remover."
1,"Here it is: my 8.5 daughter has B.O. I bought this at Wal-Mart for her for experimentation purposes back in Spring 2011, but then nixed it due to some type of aluminum ingredient contained within the deodorant that is not so great for kids. I have been using it since my Mitchum ran out two months ago, so I figure that is enough time for me to now present my findings to the world. Please do not swoon when I tell ya this: I have Yeti armpits. I shave them twice a year as I am time constrained, lazy, and married*. Don't worry- I do not sport tanks in public. Anyway, I put this deodorant on eleven hours ago, and even with the Furbies in my pits, I can hold my head high (or should I say arms?). I even rubbed my hand as hard as possible in the pit area, prayed, sniffed my hand deeply, and was rewarded with the sweet smell of nothing on my right pit, and a very, very, very slight Josephine scent on the left (Josephine was supposedly asked by her husband, Napoleon Bonaparte, to resist bathing herself in his absence so he could bask in her true essence at their reunions). For several years now I have had worse B.O. in my left pit- weird, but true. This deodorant is not scented, gentle, effective, produces no clothing stains thus far, and has a great price. I am pleased with my first foray into the world of unscented deodorant that is not a crystal. So, exercise, clean house, yell, walk briskly, shop madly- just put this stuff on first.*Footnote: For data's sake, I do want to mention here that when I do shave my armpits and then apply deodorant, it does not work effectively for the first several days of hair-freedom. Do hippie armpits somehow fare better because the deodorant ""clings"" to the armpit hair and harnesses its effects for a greater period of time? I will investigate this one day, but for now, I will only update this review if I shave my pits before my Almay runs out. I am interested in its effects at that time period."
1,"I often recommend mixing a great lotion with a topical steroid  to my patients to cover a large area of itchy skin.  This is pretty thick stuff, so it could even be diluted some.  Not fragrant."
1,"Since I started using it my skin has definitely gotten clearer. I would recommend this to anyone, negative reviews are over exaggerated. This is easy to use, very straight forward."
1,"After reading the reviews on this and similar products on Amazon, we purchased this one.  It is wonderful.  The swivel mirror allows me to check my hair in the back easily, and the magnifying side is wonderful for putting on make-up.  I am in my late 70's and without this 5x magnifier might easily apply cosmetics resembling a clown rather than an elderly lady trying to look a little better."
1,"Good cream, it cover well my face, the dispenser control really well how much you want to use.The system of the dispenser protect the cream of not being contaminated, because it never expose the cream to the contact of the hand or air."
1,"Have only been using for a couple weeks. Have no problem with reaction. Use only every other night. Seems to help skin. But be sure to use a good sunscreen during dayAdditional comment--after using for about a month, several people have commented on how good I look. Never had any adverse effects. Decided to buy one for friend as purchase price is very reasonable at Amazon for such a good product compared to other more expensive skin products that do not work as well."
0,I have noticed over the last few years my pore sizes has increased.  It is crazy and now it really bothers me!  I tried this along with many other products but I did not notice any difference!  If you like a toner its not a bad one pretty gentle but don't expect no more pores!
1,"A girlfriend turned me onto this stuff. It's mild, smells fine and cleans my face up really, really well. Love this stuff, gives my face a nice glow. Definitely financially best to buy the large size, works out much cheaper.All of Philosophy's products are great for girls, and boys, but this is one of my favorites."
1,"I have been using this for a few weeks now.  I'm not noticing too much in the &#34;firming&#34; department yet, however I like the cream a lot.  I have very sensitive skin and this does not bother or irritate it at all.  The smell is pleasant and the cream goes on smooth.  I wake up &#34;fresh-faced&#34; without an oily sheen as I've expreienced using other night creams.  I'll keep watching on the &#34;firming&#34;, but I will definitely purchase this again."
1,"Pheromone is a green chypre with a little 'c'. It's very wearable for someone (like me) who enjoys this category but not the big beast, oakmossy Chypres with a capital 'C'. White florals thankfully don't dominant the composition, like in some green florals.Pheromone is a classic that can hold its own up against any number of famous scents. To me, Pheromone is a stronger, dirtier YSL Y, which often is considered a reference green chypre, albeit a prim one. If you could turn Estee Lauder Alliage into a chypre, this is what you would get. Only difference is ... I love Alliage, not Pheromone.This is a very adult, old school fragrance. I imagine a female in a 40s peplum dress, complete with a hat and fur stole."
1,This works just as well as other makeup remover brands I've tried and does not aggravate my acne prone and sensitive skin.  I have not yet used a miracle eye makeup remover but I have to always worry about breakouts and stay away from anything possibly comedogenic which limits the field to chose from.
1,"I have horribly oily skin and need a sunscreen/sunblock that does not get shiny after awhile. I like the fact this was tinted, so I did not have to wear makeup, although the original color was a little too light for me. There is a small container of colorant to darken it and/or personalize your color.  This sunblock worked okay on not too hot or humid days, in fact I even got a compliment by a woman that told me I had a beautiful complexion and my skin just glowed when I was wearing the Fallene Sunblock (she did not know I was wearing sunblock at the time).  Although,another time on a hot, humid summer day the sunblock melted and looked horrible in several hours accentuating my big pores. AND.. a couple of times when I looked in a mirror in a public washroom and saw my face with the Fallene on it I looked washed out and ghostly, plus it was kind of thick looking and just settled in my pores.  So, for me it was just okay half the time."
1,"nice product leaves hair shiny, healthy and bouncy. it does help with colored hair. so try it out for it is dermatologicalye tested"
1,"I have a skin really white and when i put this procuct in my face rarely seen, but i think the products NARS are amazing !"
1,I have tried lots of glues. This one works best.  Even their brush on bonds quickly and easily.  It is easy to apply and less mess
1,"I can't express how much I love this product, everything about it, from the smooooth texture, to the smell (yes, I do actually love the smell), to the results! No other moisturizer works. A lot of people complain about the smell but really, it does grow on you and it has become a really comforting and relaxing smell to me. I have rosacea and acne prone skin and this helps sooth everything. It soaks in immediately and leaves my skin soft and plump! Won't go without it."
1,"The Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum is sort of a mixed-use cream. On one hand, it's not the super-expensive use-by-the-drop eye cream that is typically sold in the tiniest bottle on the planet. On the other hand, it's not a more casual face cream that you would slather on your entire face, at least not at the prices they ask for it. This falls somewhere in the middle. It's not meant for near-eye use - Olay has a Regenerist eye lifting serum for that task. Rather, this regenerating serum is meant to be used at other wrinkle spots that don't require the super-special eye cream. Eye skin tissue is VERY delicate - where the wrinkles on your forehead and mouth are not quite so delicate.I use the fragrance free variety, because I don't want anything that near to my nose to be putting off aromas all day long. It is indeed fragrance free, which is nice. I use the serum on my forehead, and under my chin. Those are where, for me, I need the most help keeping my skin in its best shape.The price is of course a down side, but again it's meant for special care; it's not meant to be a full body lotion. You use this where your skin is in need of some TLC and attention. However, having said that, I find that it's just a little too greasy for me. Where the eye serum is wonderfully light and goes great with the delicate eye skin, this serum should have been slightly more thick but with the same grease-free feeling. Instead, I find the greasiness to be uncomfortable on my face. It makes me feel like I need to go wash my face to get the ""slime"" off. I therefore only use this at night, when I fall asleep soon afterwards and let the serum nourish my skin until I wake up again.Well recommended, although I'll keep testing lotions in this price range to see if I find something else of similar quality but with a less greasy feel to it."
1,I go to cosmetology school and wanted blond hair. The instructor bleached my hair 4 times in a row. Imagine the damage I received from that! My hair felt like a wig that was thrown into a closet for months. I bought this at walgreens on sale. I left it in for 30 mins and my hair felt amazing. You can run your hand through it. I even bought a shower cap (hello kitty of course) and I sleep with this in my hair over night. To rinse this out I suggest using cold water to close the cuticle up and cold water adds shine to your hair. :) I would recommend this product to anyone.
1,"This is the only liquid eyeliner that can withstand my oily eyelids all day without degenerating into a pool of guck. Cat eyes are my every day look and this liquid eyeliner does a competent job. But, it's not perfect either. I'm not sure if I should keep buying new bottles every so many weeks without using up the old ones because I think being exposed to too much air breaks down its effectiveness. Rather than getting smudgy on my lids, it starts flaking, so I look like I have chipped paint. Not good. But out of all the liners I've worn, this is the longest wearing one by far."
1,"Great color, it looks good on people with cool skin tones not warm, because it is an orange red. It shipped and arrived very quickly."
1,"My son has been struggling with breakouts for the past year.  He has tried a number of moisturizers with no luck.  They either cause him to break out, leave his face feeling greasy, or offer no SPF protection.  This is the one moisturizer that works, and that is important because his acne medications can often leave his face dry and irritated. This product has become so essential to him that we order through subscribe and save to make sure he doesn't run out."
1,"I've used Elizabeth Arden Blue Grass deodorant for many years and it is by far the best on the market!  It's subtle aroma is never overpowering, it goes on smoothly and NEVER leaves underarm garments stains! It's the best for me!"
0,"gives more wrinkles than you already have!!! i bought it and tried it for couple of nights...then i had to quit using them, because it creates more wrikles over night! paper is rigid!!!!! waste of money!!"
0,"I learned after buying this bar, that if you have sensitive skin or trouble with acne, you should try to steer clear of anything in BAR form. Now, I'm not sure if this was the bar's fault or if my skin is just having a field day being irritating, but my skin got worse using this product.  I normally love Aveeno, but this is not for me.Good luck!"
1,"This brush is amazing. I have never really found a foundation powder brush that I thought was worth splurging on, but this brush is everything and more. It holds the powder and it keeps everything even on my face."
1,"This is my first excursion into &#34;fancy,&#34; non-drugstore blush.  I have been using this for the past month.  I saw it in Sephora, and was aware of all the hullabaloo about this blush. I decided to try Super Orgasm rather than Orgasm, because it looked nicer in the box.  It looks VERY glittery in the packaging, like clubwear almost.  However, on the face it is quite subtle, it doesn't make me look like a go go dancer or anything.  I've been wearing it every day with different colors of eye shadow. It appears to go with everything, and lasts the whole day.  The texture is fine, but nothing special in comparison with cheaper brands.  It is more expensive than what I'm used to, however, it appears that it will last for quite some time.  And the color really is so nice, natural, and lovely.  I think I will try a more dramatic shade of pink/red for date nights and such.  Overall, good buy!"
1,"I've recently started dry brushing.  I love that this has a handle to get my back, but is removable to use on the rest of me.  GREAT quality natural bristles for the price!!  VERY pleased."
1,I love love love this color and the pigment is so strong. very blendable too. a little goes a long way
1,"Good size, and serves the purpose I purchased it for (to wash my face)..One little drop of my face wash and it lathers well..I recommend.."
1,"I decided I was done with expensive, fragranced moisturizers I could only find at the department stores.  This body moisturizer smells nice and gives a nice glow to the skin without being greasy.  Application feels very luxurious and I wondered whether it would be too emollient but it soaks into the skin nicely while leaving a moist appearance to the skin which lasts pretty much all day.  Some moisturizers I could feel sitting on my skin all day - even once I'd get into bed at night, like I had a layer of plastic coating on my skin but Aveeno Creamy Moisturizing Oil seems to be perfect.  Usually, I don't get through one bottle of any product before I move on, however, I just purchased my third bottle of this.  I think it's a keeper!"
0,"I purchased this soap for the sole reason that it was supposed to be ""jasmine"".  It's not even close to that fragrance.  However, it's still a glycerin bar of soap so I will use it but it is falsely labeled as jasmine."
1,Here I received the 30 plastic caps which i use for my heat cap treatment.They work fine for me. They are big enough for my curly bushy hair.
1,"I bought this because I identify with what happens to gardeners' hands.  I love the way it goes on, but I am not very happy with the scent; and the tube does not stand up, so I have to keep it in its box in order to keep it standing in the place I keep this sort of thing.  But I DO like the way my hands feel."
1,i love this thing!!! it makes perfect curls!! they arent tooo thick and i love it!!! so happy' its a great buy!
1,"I feel like it keeps the oil at bay. Not very good with the color range and packaging isn't very cute, but it does it's job. It is nice to keep in your purse/makeup bag because of it's size. It is in very thin packaging. Sometimes it can be hard to find these. I see these in my local cvs but not in my walmart or walgreens. Not really sure if they are phasing these out."
1,"I have tried almost every conditioner on the market and found that most are too rich and weigh my hair down or they don't moisturize enough and left a rat's nest out of my hair.  Of course the superexpensive (Fekkai) ones work great but I get tired of paying that much money all the time. I was very pleasantly surprised that this conditioner worked PERFECT. My hair felt conditioned but it was not weighed down and it had some body. This has a very light, pleasant scent. I highly recommend this to anyone just to try and see and at this price its not an investment."
1,I've used this product several times already in my bath.  It works wonders.  I plan on buying more when this jar runs out.
1,"These are the best marcel irons around, will only use these. I own a beauty school the only one I will let my students use. easy to us, spins nice and heats up very well."
1,"I feel like a giant lemon bar when I use this product. This is a gently clarifying shampoo I use once a week or so, alternating with the Alba Botanicals product line. The smell and lather is great (lathers a LOT more than the usual ""natural"" hair products). Organic, too!"
1,Good coverage but wipes of easily. Waiting for the setting powders in original & saffron to see if it still gets on my hands and clothes.
1,"This has a clean, FRESH true/real lemon fragrance!  Excellent moisturizer - just make sure your skin is still damp so the oil is completely absorbed into skin.  The lemon fragrance stays fresh and clean for a fairly short time - I'd say it dissipates within the hour....  Still, it's SO yummy and clean and doesn't at all smell artificial or like the lemon scents used in various household cleaners (in case you're wondering)."
1,"My son got tanned despite of using this daily. He had golf lessons 3 times a week in the mornings! and only for one hour! he came back home darker after each lesson. My husband got a tan too but didn't burn. I have to admit, we are currently in South America, perhaps it will work better in Northern Hemisphere.  It's not easy to spread, leaves white cast, you have to rub it a lot to get rid of whiteness, and hairy fuzzy men, forget it!!! We tried Australian gold brand (easier to spread but stinks to high heavens), and no difference in protection."
1,"This is good especially as the winter progresses, but I prefer something a little creamier. I like the size for purse, desk drawer  and car."
1,"Okay, but not a miracle (haven't found one yet :).  Did moisturize without being oily and wrinkles certainly aren't any worse than before I used the tube.  I used it all, am still looking for something to help with these ugly creases above my lip.  It has some highly recommended ingredients, but best for night use since has retinol."
0,"I have very dark brown hair and for some reason it took me a while to learn that these feria blacks are just not good for your hair. not only does it strip my color out of my hair (my hair starts turning medium brown in spots after a week of this product) but my hair absolutely feels awful (course, dry, brittle) immediately after usage. loreals ""last through 28 shampoos"" creme gloss product is longer lasting than this so called permanent hair color. I think this crap needs to be taken off the shelves and they need to try again."
1,"I have been using this mascara ever since it first came out. I tried several dozen other mascara both popular brands and high-end. And I could never find a mascara that gave good lash coverage without the clumps. This mascara allows you to either create a completely natural (but beautiful look), or add an extra layer or two for a dramatic, almost fake lash look. Without mascara I look like I don't have any lashes at all, but with the Maybelline Full 'N Soft on I get compliments on my eyes and sometimes even get asked where I buy my lashes! What a difference!! Plus another BIG benefit of this mascara is that it comes in a ""brownish-black"" color, which looks black on but doesnt look awkward and fake. This is totally different from brown mascaras that I think only work for very fair blond people. I have hazel eyes  and dark hair, this brownish black looks incredible on my eyes. Well, I just cant speak well enough about this magic product, I am SO IN LOVE WITH IT I don't know what I would ever do without it!!"
1,I have a few of these towels and never leave home without one.  I always pack one for traveling because of how well this product works.  It really does cut down on drying time so much and wicks the water out of your hair unbelievably well!
1,"I love the smell of this leave-in conditioner and it does a really nice job of keeping my hair untangled! I would recommend this! It is also a really good buy and a good price for three of them! I was able to buy one at Walmart first and once I saw I liked the product, I was so excited to see this deal online!"
1,"Basically, a good product that delivers all it says.  I love all of the Alpha Hydrox products because they work and they are inexpensive."
1,"The formula is completely different than what is shown on Amazon. The bottle I purchased has ""new"" on it. The actual second ingredient is aloe, which sounds great. But, they throw in several alcohols in the shampoo and conditioner (alcohol is in the top five ingredients) now. I'm not sure why. In order to get a comb through my hair, I have to now use a Aussie leave in conditioner. Never have to do that when I use Pantene, which had the super drying sulfates in it, but I guess there's enough conditioners in the shampoo and conditioner to where my hair is virtually tangle free. I think Avalon Organics can do better. A plus for the shampoo is that it has a nice, calming scent of lavender. Sadly, it doesn't stick around when my hair is dry. It is very cleansing almost to the point of being a clarifying shampoo, so for now, I'm alternating with ""Yes To Cucumbers"" in order to go ahead and use up the Avalon shampoo. I won't reordering until they create a more gentle shampoo."
1,"This is an ok product that I tried for summer.  I don't know why any sunscreen product has less than 30 SPF since 15 does almost nothing for you.  It does work as a thin moisturizer under heavier sunscreen for outdoor activities.  Again, it is super thin so be careful when squeezing the product out or you could have a disaster."
1,"Great product at a great price.  The brushes have a wide paddle and slender handle.  The brush bristles are firm with rounded &#34;ouchless&#34; tips that don't rip through your hair.  Even though they are attractive wooden paddles, they are not heavy and awkward to use.  They clean up easily."
1,This pump hand soap is very handy in my kitchen and smells great. Of all the kinds they had in stock this was the best. This leaves my hands very soft. I'm reviewing the product not the online price.
1,Quick shipping which I enjoy.Plus the mirror is so cute defenitely something I like.Made my eyebrow plucking and makeup application much easier.
1,"Great for skin, this steamer is easy and pleasant to use. One reviewer suggested to spend $180 on a ""better"" model! Why waste your money??This has improved the texture and appearance of my skin in a matter of a couple of weeks. Break-outs are way down. Deep pores are smaller and blackheads are disappearing. The deep water tank makes it easy to use without refilling every few minutes as with smaller tank models.I use this for about 20 minutes at a time. It can be set up so that it can be used as one watches tv, so the treatment goes by as one is entertained. There is no need to bend the face downward, one can look straight ahead and it does a super job cleaning the entire face. The face is to be held about 3 to 7 inches above and over the cone, not stuck down into it.Foe even better results I highly recommend buying the Panasonic EH2511A Pore Cleanser with Micro-fine Mist for $37. Using the pore cleaner after 20 minutes of steaming cleans out the pores with a tiny vacuum. Using the 2 devices together has been a breakthrough for my skin. It is very satisfying to see all of the waxy junk pulled out of the pores when cleaning the Pore Cleanser after use. It's wonderful to know that stuff is no longer clogging my pores!Finally, if you have allergies or suffer from congestion, this is a great steamer to use to open your breathing passages. When I feel the squeezing pain/congestion of an allergic reaction coming on, now I turn on the steamer and breathe the soothing, hot steam for a while. It clears things up and often avoids the headache I could feel beginning. This is no cure for allergies, but it has made it possible for me to use fewer doses of decongestants and allergy medicines. About half of the time, if I use the steamer when I first feel symptoms, I can skip the pills. I cannot understate the good this does me to use less medication and have relief from sinus pains."
1,I'm prone to acne in the summer so I was thrilled to find this product. I leave it on for 15 minutes. It goes on smooth and calms my skin. Good price too.
1,"So I gave the Clairol Toasted Almond 4 out of 5 stars because I leave these Semi-Permanent dyes. They don't irritate my scalp as long as I don't wash my hair right before, they don't seem to damage my hair, the smell isn't bad at all, and there isn't an obvious line when it grows out.As for the color  . . . I'm naturally dark blond so I wanted something to darken and deepen my color a bit so my hair color isn't so completely neutral. This color really means GOLDEN light brown. It's not to dark but with my already blond hair it made the color an unnaturally golden/coppery brown. It's not offal so I still ran around with it for a few days but it's not what I wanted either. For natural blonds I would recommend sticking with the other 2 light brown colors Tweed or Suede. If I were a natural brunette I WOULD give this a TRY if I wanted to ad some golden radiance to my color. I bet on a brunette this color would ad some beautiful depth and shine."
1,"This is a &#34;travel&#34; version but it's the only one I use at home - five jumbo curlers are exactly what you want for some wave, body, and curl but NOT Shirley Temple-style ringlets.  They used to come with metal hooks, but now they come with white plastic jaw clips which are much easier to use."
1,This product works well along with the Matrix Biolage Smoothing Shine Milk. You put it on your hair when it's damp and it will feel so soft. For curly frizzy hair
1,"It's a good facial sponge...soft enough for your face, but it just doesn't last long. Too fragile and falls apart/shreds.I do use other, more sturdier Buf Puf sponges and have been for years and do like the line."
1,"Very pleased with the Conair Instant Heat Travel Hairsetter.  The rollers are the right size for a quick fix up and fit nicely into your suitcase or even at home, on your bathroom vanity.  The set heats up quickly and the rollers give my hair a good wave.  The clips fit nicely snugly on the rollers keeping it tighly in place."
0,"Reviews for this moisturizer are all over the board, but I had high hopes when I ordered it on Subscribe & Save. Am I the only one who got a bottle that's grainy? It literally feels like I've mixed a little sand in with the lotion when I massage it into my face. Possibly I just got a bad batch, but I didn't get any of the glow effect others talk about in their reviews, not even an orangy look described by one person, just lotion that won't quite melt into my skin because of the graininess. I first looked at it in my magnifying mirror, thinking it might have little sparkles that produced the ""glow"", but I couldn't see any. Makeup goes on okay over it, but even if it didn't have the graininess, it's nothing special.I just want a daytime lotion that I can depend on to protect and nourish my skin, with no hassles. I've tried everything from the most expensive brands I could find online to the cheapest (always based on healthy ingredients). So far, the RoC and Regenerist products are about as good as any. I'll use the rest of this Morning Glow Moisturizer on my arms and hands, which is what I always do with facial moisturizers that I'm trying to use up. Sorry for the negative review, but in fairness, it's my experience with this lotion."
1,I don't normally wear mascara but I bought this for the few times I do. The product seems to be good and natural. I like this product.
1,In one use I immediately felt like my face's muscular elasticity improved. I recommend it for sensitive skin and it helps to keep the skin's pH balanced.
1,"My skin is oily, sensitive and problematic, but I bought this lotion and it doesn't exacerbate acne or oiliness.I use this twice a day and I have noticed a shocking difference in my skin!My breakouts are healing much faster than normal, a few new ones were coming out at first, but that's pretty much stopped now.This product works better than ANY of my Rx acne treatments, and Proactive and Clinique acne regimens.Compared to tretinoin creams, benzol peroxide cream, a sulfur cleanser, and solodyn pill, this lotion works better than all of those. I never had these results so quickly.I don't have wrinkles, I am 21, SO I cannot attest to that aspect.The smell is a bit funky, and it tingles a bit, but didn't bother my skin much&my; skin is VERY sensitive! Aveeno products irritate my face. This product tingles barely enough to notice.Also, a little goes a longggg way. You do not need much of this, at least my skin doesn't."
1,"Finally I have found a great concealer. I used it under my eyes only, and have found it is perfect for me. A lot of concealers give me raccoon eyes because they are to moist and my mascara bleeds. But this one works great. Good coverage, and a little goes far, so justifies spending just a little more than other brands. I apply after moisturizer, and before foundation. Works great."
1,"This is a great facial cleanser!!  It removes all make up but doesn't leave your face feeling stripped and dry!!  I'm 60+ and have been using the same expensive cleanser for years. It did a good job of  cleaning but left my face very dry. Philosophy Purity Made Simple leaves my face clean, soft and slightly moisturized. I follow it with Philosophy's Hope in a Jar before going to bed each night. The two combinations are fantastic. My face never feels greasy because both products are very light and the Hope in a Jar absorbs quickly."
1,This works very well. I use it to but body gems on our groves members for festivals and feasts. I am very happy with it.
0,This stuff is TOO STRONG!! It peeled my skin within 2weeks of using. I would not recommend this product for use!!
1,"I can't find this dye anywhere, firstly. Secondly. IF you're like me and you have dark, dark, brown hair, maybe you should look elsewhere. I actually came to this shade because I wanted a reddish tent to my hair.Anyway, this stuff actually shimmers, though my hair is no where near copper it is shimmering. I actually had shiny stuff all over my pillow for a week, so, just a heads up. I love the results I got. I closer to a copper chestnut than a sultry copper, but, like I said, copper was never my intention."
1,I am using my husbands account. I like this blush but not for the price. It's not any better than some of my other blushes. I do like it a lot. It;s a very pretty color but I would not buy it again because of the price. I don't have anything to negative to saya bout this blush other than the price because it is pretty. If it had been about 12 to 15 dollars cheaper then I would have give it 5 stars.
1,This is a good product but not for me I have a very sensitive face and it doesn't help my face is red a lot of the time not from the product just because I am a diabetic and my face is so dry. I have to use a not soap product.
1,"the facial steamer does put out alot of steam,but it pull to much electricity,where everything shut off in my apartment,beside that great facial steamer.yes i would recommend it if your house manage."
1,"I gave it a 3 because with the current colognes of today, it kinda doesn't stand a chance but for those old skool people who happens to like the musky, woody, type smell. Its a good choice. The smell won't fade on you. Just don't just too much. It can potentially be way too strong to some."
1,I lOve this butt I hate the smell ...you can see your face glow very good product I will deff buy this again :)
1,"I bought the Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque after I couldn't find my St. Ives clay masque anymore.  Since this product had good reviews, I thought I would give it a try.  Well, I wish I had found this years ago!  My skin has never looked so good!At 26 years old, I still have issues with breakouts, even when I am extremely diligent about my skin care.  I started using this masque several (3-4) times per week for the last two weeks, and I have not had any more acne pop up, and in fact, my chin (which is my main ""problem area"") looks so much better!  The bumps are gone, skin is smoother, pores are smaller, and since I'm not getting any new breakouts, my old acne scars are beginning to fade!At the same time I ordered this masque, I also ordered Burts Bees Repair Serum.  So, after I wash the masque off, I put a dab of my St. Ives Collagen moisturizer in my hand, several drops of the Burt's Bees repari serum and about 5-6 drops of tea tree oil, rub it all together and slather it on my skin.  I think I've finally found a skin care routine that works!  My skin is clear, my pores are smaller, and my skin is so soft and smooth!I'm so pleased with this product and I would recommend that anyone with troubled skin try this.  I think you will be amazed!"
1,Not greasy at all.  My face loved it but my neck found it too strong and developed an itchy rash at the base of one side between the collar bone and the top of the shoulder and up the neck a bit.  It went away when I stopped using the cream and came back when I started again.  So I used it up on my face and moved to a different cream so that I didn't have to keep two kinds of cream going.
0,"I missed this warning until it came in the mail:This product contains progesterone, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer.What a bummer ... I was so hopeful that it might help me, but I can't use something with such a clear connection to cancer. :(  I threw it away so I wouldn't be tempted."
1,"I am blessed to have a 50+ year old wife who still looks 30, and people are always asking her how she looks so young.  Her answer is Obagi and she cannot imagine life without it.  Here in Texas, many of the Obagi products are virtually by prescription or completely banned, so mail-order is the only way to get them and at a reasonable price."
1,"I've used Jason's shampoos which have tea tree oil in them but they're very abrasive/stinging on my scalp but theraneem is VERY gentle that you won't feel it.  It's as gentle as baby shampoo.  It's liquidy and as others say, it doesn't lather well and doesn't have much of a fragrance, so I add it to a thick fruity or flowery shampoo or bodywash with better lather. Wet your hair first before putting it on your hair so that you'll be able to spread it more widely, especially near the scalp. I put it on early in my bath and only wash it off after it's on more than 5-10 minutes.  So far, my scalp hasn't itched, i don't have dandruff, and I don't have any lice which is the whole point of me using natural herbal shampoos which have neem and/or tea tree oil.It's certified organic, paraben-free, sulfate-free, and gluten-free."
1,"I love everything Rusk and I love this Leave-In-Conditioner! Not only does it smell good, but it also keeps my hair smooth, soft and shiny! =D"
1,No harsh fragrance. Easy to use and leaves my skin feeling soft. I also feel that the area around my eyes look a little younger. I will order this again.
1,Came very fast. i have really curly frizzy hair and this definitely helps to keep it under control. it does have a sort of wet look to it though.
1,WOW -  GOT RID OF MY ROUGH SKIN IMMEDIATELY  -I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT MORE OF THESE  -I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE
1,"This peel is amazing. It gets off ALL the dead skin and makes your skin soft and smooth, and it temporarily reduces the appearance of pores. It doesn't burn or sting at all, unlike an acid based peel. It doesn't irritate your skin in the slightest, which is surprising for something this effective. The only downside is the price. I would use it a lot more often if it didn't cost so much per use."
1,"I bought this because I was sick of tripping over all the different shampoos and conditioners that I like to trade off and on with.  I like being able to switch back and forth, but hated having to pick which ones would be the ""lucky"" shower versions, and which would be put under the sink.  It always turned out I'd have way too many bottles in the shower and then I found this!What a perfect solution.  Not only does it store all of what I'm using, but if you're one of those parents who always find yourself saying to your children,  ""What are you doing.... DRINKING THE SHAMPOO???"".It dispenses the perfect amount, and though I paid twice this much somewhere else, I'd do it again in a heart beat.Its neat, its compact, and it works perfectly.  I'm frankly thinking of giving it as a gift for those up and coming events that I'm not sure what they need or want.Update:  I've had this for a few months now, and the savings in shampoo has more than paid for it.  It dispenses just the right amount, and results in big savings."
1,This was $4.00 at Ultra.So it was the firs titme I bought the cream.  easy to apply and stil doesn't get of fthe mascara if not tube mascara by Blinc.  lolI had to use another eye make up remover but the cleansing action leaves my skin feeling supple and soft.great smell.
1,"It's a good product, the only thing I don't like is that it's not very matte and doesn't last all day especially for oily skin."
0,"..maybe this brush is just not suitable for my hair type, I have wavy/curly hair and its making it more frizzy and not so soft.."
1,I TRYED AT LEAST TWO TONERS BEFORE AND NOTHING COMPARES TO THIS!! IT MAKES YOUR FACE SO REFRESHING AND CALM AFTER YOU WASH YOUR FACE. IT FEELS LIKE COLD WATER WITH SOOTHING ELEMENTS IN. PLUS IT'S NOT OILY LIKE MOST TONERS AS WELL. AND IT'S GREAT FOR ACNE PRONE SKIN.AND DRY OR COMBINATION AS WELL. I USE THIS WITH MY OLAY FOAMING FACE WASH FOR SENSITIVE SKIN. THEN MY ZAYPT ZIT GREAT TRIO.  BUT I HAVE ACNE PRONE AND THIS CALMS THE ACNE DOWN PERFECT. AND NOT OILY SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR FACE GETTING LIKE A OIL BUCKET. IT'S ALSO VERY CHEAP THEN LOTS OF TONERS SO DON'T THINK THE PRICE IS LOW CAUSE THE PRODUCT IS BAD. THE BEST OF THINGS COME IN LOW PRICES AND PACKAGES!! LOL THANKS AGAIN OLAY!!
1,"I've used so many anti aging creams, lotions, serums,etc.. None of them really did anything for the wrinkes. I have one, that has always bothered me and deepened on left side of mouth, on the cheek. I did not really think frownies would work, but thought I'd give em a shot, I've been religously using them now for almost two weeks, and that deep crease, wrinkle is so smoothed out, i can't believe it, I had to look twice, but that deep crease is almost gone. It's amazing, so I have no problem using these , because they work better than anything I've used. I still use my face cream during the day, and moisturizer on at night, around the frownies. They don't give me any problems, at night, I sleep with them on my face overnight. Try them, they are awkward, different, but they work Seriously, they work !!!!!!!"
1,"TMI alert - i use this for under the breasticles because I'm a chesty girl and sometimes it's hard to keep everything perfectly clean and good smelling in that area.  this cream helps me keep everything super sanitary, yeast free and awesome."
1,"I am a college student rosacea sufferer and have been struggling to find a moisturizer, preferably tinted to mask all my bumps and blemishes from the rosacea, for months. When I saw this at Walmart back in March, I just had to pick it up. I thought Aveeno might work since they usually do well with sensitive skin. At first I was pleased! It mostly covered my blemishes and made my skin glow. However, after using it for several months now I have had some issues.At the time that I first bought this product in March, I was suffering from some pretty nasty rosacea flare ups. I assumed the flare ups were caused either by my soap or my foundation. I stopped using both and started using the Aveeno tinted moisturizer in place of my Mary Kay foundation and replaced my soap with a non-soap organic coconut oil cleanser. Switching over to the coconut oil cleanser helped, my skin was clearing up a bit and I was using the moisturizer nearly daily for school. I would still have flare ups, but not as bad.Classes ended a month ago and since I have mostly been lounging around home, I haven't needed to dress up my face as much. I stopped using the moisturizer daily. After a few weeks, my face really started to clear up and I was so excited. However, the few times I would use the moisturizer, bumps would show up on my jawline. They were not as bad as they were in the beginning so I dealt with it. After having it recommended by a friend, I purchased an Almay smart shade foundation and have been using it only on special occasions. When I do use the Almay foundation, I would layer the Aveeno moisturizer underneath. After a couple times doing this, I noticed that my face was beginning to flare up again. Strange.Oddly enough, three days ago when my boyfriend and I went out for our anniversary, on a whim I wore just the Almay foundation. I was shocked that at the end of the night I didn't have any flare ups or bumps. Then yesterday I wore the moisturizer under the foundation again when I went over to my boyfriends house for Sunday lunch. Surprise surprise, by the end of the day when I had come back home, my chin and jawline was a broken out mess.Considering I was having problems with flare ups when using it daily or using it with foundation but have no problems when I just use Almay's foundation alone - I think it's safe to say that the moisturizer is causing my sporadic breakouts.BOTTOM LINE: I really wanted to love this product. I'm giving this three stars because I love Aveeno in general and the moisturizer DOES have good coverage. But, it doesn't work well with my rosacea. I recommend the product to those who do not have overly sensitive skin.If you have rosacea or other skin sensitivities, I would use with extreme caution or stay away all together!!"
1,The product works great and my skin allergy from normal shampoos is gone. My hair looks great with this shampoo.  The shampoo arrived on time and it was packaged well by the shipper. DHS might consider putting no spill flaps on the neck opening under the top. There was some leakage from shipping.
1,"I am enjoying this line of liquid hand soap very much. It smells great, lathers up nicely and a little bit goes a long way."
1,If you're kind of heavy handed like I am with my right hand then be prepared to apply polish twice a week. Last week (week of Jul/15/13) of my first time receiving it; the polish started to chip within 3-4 days. This week (week of Jul/22/13) of not being so heavy handed my nail polish stayed on for a whole week. So I guess it depends on what you do with your hands. I'd recommend it but not to heavy handed people if you don't mind applying nail polish twice a week. I'd recommend it.
1,"Ran across this at a local store for just under a dollar on Clearance!!  Decided to buy it and give it a try.  Wow...its great!!  Sometimes I get muscular tension headaches, stemming from the muscles tightening in my neck.  I've rubbed this lotion on my neck muscles and my face and forehead and it is amazing!!  The aroma therapy alone is so soothing, but somehow the effects of the peppermint on my skin and muscles really makes me feel better.  This is a wonderful lotion.  I also let my friend at work use it when she had a bad sunburn, and she said it really helped cool the burning sensation and also helped to heal her skin so it would not peel so bad.  The ingredients seem to be very good.  I am glad this is available on Amazon.  I highly recommend it."
1,"I have pretty fine long hair but alot of it-little over the shoulder in length.  These give volume and a nice soft wave. Clips hold fine for me but sometimes leave a slight crease mark. Heat up very, very fast. Easy to use.  They would be more perfect if there were 6 of them but I can make do with 5. I still have to use the big curling iron for the small shorter pieces of hair around my face.  They almost give that look that the hairdresser can get using the big velcro rollers and then have you sitting under the hairdryer.....Very pleased!"
1,I love this soap and its great for people who are sensitive to fragrances. I dont usually like bar soaps but this one makes my skin feel smooth and it lasts for a long time. I have always been a fan of the Dr. Bronner's soaps. I am currently trying the tea tree one to see how it does compared to this one for my sensitive skin; so far so good!
1,"I have ordered several items from Auric Blends so far and have loved every one of them.  Lover's Moon is my favorite so far.  A light cool floral with staying power.  As with all perfume oils, a little goes a long way.  This is a great perfume for a great price.  I hope they keep making them!"
1,"good, I can feel it working.  Rated #1 with consumer reports above all the high priced lotions & potions.  However after awhile my face shines a little and I prefer a more ""matt"" look"
1,"My hair is super straight and thin. It also doesn't take heat very well. What's so great about this curler is the adjustable heat settings. 7 works great for me and I just hold it there for ten seconds. Not only that but the curls actually stay. Most times, they go wavy after the first 30 minutes, no matter how long I hold it on for. But with this it lasted me two hours. I'm so impressed and especially for the price. You cannot beat that."
0,I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT AND IT WASNT THE REAL. I GUESS THEY MIXED SOMETHING ELSE IN THERE THATS NOT DERMA BLEND. I PUT THE PRODUCT ON AND IT CAME OFF IN TWO SECONDS ALSO THE PRODUCT RUB OFF ALL OVER MY HOME. DO NOT BUY!
0,"I wish I could give this product ZERO DAMN STARS!!!! I ordered this piece of crap wanting blue AS SHOWN IN PICTURE. I know it says it matches to your body chemistry, which is cool and everything. I thought it maybe was gonna turn a darker blue or something but NOPE!!! It turned bright, hot pink. If I wanted bright, hot pink, thats what I would have bought then!!!"
1,"Good color payoff - opaque. I got it to wear in spring, but it's a bit darker than I had anticipated - probably a good Christmas color w/ a gold accent nail."
1,"Honest review here:My hair came out SILKY SOFT after I curled it with these curlers. In comparison, I have some electronic hot rollers and my hair comes out a bit charred. ;) I didn't even realize my hair was getting fried so much until I had the comparison to Caruso and had SOFT SILKY hair.My hair is already pretty soft naturally. So for my hair to be crispy with electric rollers/curling iron and then to compare them to Caruso SOFT hair??? CARUSO showed me that it's possible to HAVE silky soft hair!!!! Let me say that again-- CARUSO SHOWED ME that it's possible to have silky soft curly hair. I mean really?!?!It does take awhile getting used to putting one foam curler at a time on the steam machine. And then the transition of the curler to hair, curler cap to the steam, then hold the foam curler as the cap gets heated, then put cap on curler--- yeah. That takes awhile to get used to but for silky soft seriously amazing hair? And the avoidance of split ends?? I think it's worth it.Because my hair is so fine, it damages SUPER quickly from blow drying, curling irons, and hot rollers. I am looking forward to amazing looking hair without the split ends. Before I wouldn't be able to grow my hair out quickly because of my need to cut the ends off all the time due to styling everyday and therefore MAJOR split ends. Caruso has helped me see that I could actually grow my hair out (shoulder length to mid back is my goal) while still styling it every day because I won't be damaging INCHES of hair as it grows. HEALTHY HAIR, HERE I COME!!!!!!!! *EXCITED!!* =DAlso the curls you get from Caruso stay in better and longer than electric hot rollers or a curling iron. This is comparatively WITHOUT any hair product to help the styling tools. Caruso, gives a sweet cute little curl. I feel so delicate and pretty afterward with my hair.To note, when you take your hair out of Caruso curlers, you will have a line where the curling cap laid on your hair. I combed my hands through hair but it was still there. So I just used my blow dryer to shake my hair out and the lines disappeared! wonderful. I also chose to style my bangs with a blow dryer bc i didn't like how Caruso curls looked on them. But that's not a problem for me.My hair holds curl REALLY well so I can't speak for those with flat fine hair with difficulty to curl your hair. But I can speak about fine hair that gets easily charred.Caruso will leave your hair SILKY, SHINY, SERIOUSLY SOFT and leaving you feeling beautiful! Sweet curls? I felt like a beauty today. ;)"
1,use this one your face on your body ..... leaves your face and body smelling good and your face is clean and cocoa buttered up
1,"I have short hair and I don't think the bristles brush my hair very well. So I could not imagine someone with long hair liking it that much. Now, it is ok for blowdrying and styling ones hair, it does shape the hair nicely."
1,i got my belly button pierced and this product is so hard to find in stores in my area so i purchased it online. it came with helpful instructions and it arrived quick :)
1,"I have nothing but love for this gel. I have natural 4a/4b hair. The best thing about this gel is it does not flake. After washing my hair, using a leave-in conditioner, shea butter, and the holding gel...my twist outs turn out defined and curly. They last through the week too..doesn't not have to keep reusing the gel to get great results, and after it dries, it doesn't flake or leave a residue. Just soft, nice hair. I've used other gels in the past that leave the hair smelly and hard. Not IC Fantasia, which has a pleasant scent.If you're afraid of build up...use a clarifying shampoo (as I do) every two weeks to a month. It lasts for 2 to 3 months at a time if used once a week. Can be found at your local drug stores though for a reasonable price.Ingredients: Purified Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Carbomer. Troethanolamine, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Dimethicone Copolyol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Polysorbate-20, Benzophenone04, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylchlorioisothiazolinone Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum)."
1,"I wanted to use a product that doesn't contain mineral oil, petroleum, DMDM Hydantoin, Methyl Paraben and other harsh ingredients. My frontal hair line was receding and so I purchased this product after reading the reviews.After just a 3 1/2 months of use, I noticed my hair which I was losing is growing back in like crazy. This product works! Family and friends have been noticing also. Some thought I had hair transplant surgery! Highly Recommended!"
1,I use this under my eyes and its works better than most eye cream yet its great for the whole face.
1,Great polish. This is my favorite red.  It is perfect for any skin tone.  Lasts a long time with top coat.
1,I purchased the Suave Naturals Coconut hair conditioner at our local low-cost department store as we are trimming expenses. I thought I'd give the Suave conditioner a try and I was pleasantly surprised at how the conditioner worked. The conditioner left my hair easy to comb out and smelling faintly of coconut.Recommend.
1,"they are really long, and thick, but it really gives that dramatic boost to your lashes, perfect when youre rocking a black smokey eye, your lashes would never get lost with these"
1,"There is no cure for cellulite in a bottle or jar.  Cellulite treatments are relatively expensive and require a series of aggressive treatments and getting these treatments on a regular basis to try and maintain a smoother appearance of the skin where the cellulite exists.  Even lipo may not eliminate cellulite.  Skinny people even have cellulite.  People who are physically fit (exercise on a regular basis) and eat clean also have cellulite.  Some people can have their cellulite below the muscle which is even harder to reduce/treat.I have used numerous creams (some very expensive for a small size bottle/jar) and have had numerous cellulite treatments (endermologie, ionithermie, herbal and seaweed body wraps,dry brushing, steaming, hot yoga, etc.) ... you name it, I've tried it.  I was introduced to Fat Girl Slim at the Bliss Spa at the W Hotel.  I had the Fat Girl Slim wrap/treatment on my torso, hips, thighs, mid/low back and triceps and I saw a HUGE improvement in the texture of my skin (smoother, firmerm tighter and cellulite appeared less dimply) in just one treatment.  I have been dry brushing and applying the Fat Girl Slim in these areas 2 times a day (after morning and evening shower) and it seems to have maintained the results I had gotten post treatment. I am planning on doing a few more of the Fat Girl Slim wrap/treatments at the W in the future to try and improve my cellulite.The great thing about Fat Girl Slim is that a little goes a long way, it's not sticky/tacky like some of the other cellulite gels/creams, it is easily absorbed in the skin and the container is customer friendly (you can get/use every last drop of product).  The Bliss Spa at the W (and their online store) carries the larger sizes (better price) and you accumulate points towards other products and spa services that Bliss offers."
1,"Awe, this color Marshmallow by Essie holds a special place in my heart. I used this white nail polish for white on white french manicures for 10 years and I used to get compliments non stop. I wear short dark nails now but I never forgot where it all started for me, with Essie Marshmallow. Best white polish ever."
1,"I got the short flare ones!  They were a little longer than short lol but they looked so natural and real, I think I'm switching from lash strips to individuals lol"
1,"My four year old daughter has extremely sensitive skin. She was having rash after rash and other odd skin conditions until the dermatologist suggested this brand for all her cleanser, shampoo, conditioner, ect.  This cleanser works great and does not irritate the skin.  We  use for general hand washing and for bath time with ease.  My daughter doesn't love the same, mainly because there isn't one.  But it's a great product and would recommend."
0,"First of all, it does pull out stuff from your pores, bet very little bit. Just to explain: if you use strips on your nose (I think most of the girls know what strips I talk about), then you pull it out, you see some pore stuff left on the strip, but most of pores still not cleaned. So this mask working much less than strips for nose. It takes some stuff out, but its nothing, doesn't make sense to use.I couldn't find some good pore cleaner, until I try proactiv. Even if you have no pimples, try to buy just a cleanser from proactiv (the first one from regular kit), it's like a scrub, but it's first scrub in my life that really clean pores instead of scratching skin. So, put the scrab on DRY face, scrab it all for minute, especially your nose. After 2-3 use your pores will be clean. I promise."
1,These are so stimulating as well as relaxing to use in the shower. I feel like my hair gets cleaner and my scalp is stimulated.
0,"worse product I've ever seen, the stick was dry, smells bad.. can't use it at all.. it doesn't even work"
1,This soap smells amazing and it works great.  Doesn't take much and its not greasy like some of the concentrated dish soaps.  All natural ingredients so you don't have to worry about tricylsan or petrochemicals.
0,"As a transitioning natural and natural I wanted so bad for the Denman to become a staple product. I've purchased it multiple times hoping each time would be different. But the end result is always breakage. It is worsened by the fact you cannot feel your hair breaking, just see the little hairs falling. In order to use this, your hair must be in a very healthy state, otherwise it will just further rip and break up the already splitting and damaged ends. This is a no no for transitioners!"
1,I would recommend this to any one.  It smells great and also softens my hands.  I can't wait to order more. definitely five stars.
1,This color is so pretty. It looks great alone or ontop of another polish. It's a sheer and sparkley color. Very flattering on the hands.
1,"I've been buying my toners from the local drugstore for years. I haven't been able to find one that I was truly impressed with. I bought this about a week ago and I'm happy to say that I will be returning to buy more when the bottle is empty!What I like about this toner:The smell. It isn't overwhelming, it's a nice, faint whiff of rose.The softening effect. It leaves a clean, soft, and refreshing after effect.No Alcohol. No alcohol means no drying, or harsh products on my skin.Aloe Vera - helps soothe the skin.It doesn't do that great at removing my eyeliner but I can always use makeup remover pads for that."
1,"This product surprisingly works but it's temporary. For long term effects, just get botox - it works wonders for forehead wrinkles and crows feet/lines. I look 10-12 years younger because of it (botox)!!! :)"
1,I heard that orange nail polish is this summers color.  And they were right.  It even looks good on my pale hands.
1,"A woman's review:  I purchased this for my fiance and when I ran out of shampoo I ended up using this. Now I've repurchased this shampoo many times for myself. Usually, I don't like Suave shampoos at all (at least the ones I ever bought for myself).The scent of this shampoo is cool and reminds me of peppermint & it's not too masculine. Above all, I love how my hair is when I use this shampoo. I have baby fine & wavy long hair, this shampoo really clarifies when you use it, without stripping it too much or drying it out.  It leaves my hair feeling nice and clean and when I use my Pantene smooth conditioner after this shampoo, my hair is tangle-free. Also, I have to admit that I've used this as a shower gel too...SHHHH...don't tell my fiance!Overall, I'd highly recommend to men or women."
1,"I use this to add to the flax seed gel that I make at home.  After my flax seed gel cools, I add in a few squirts of this.  This doesn't thin out the flax seed gel like adding aloe vera juice does and seems to result with getting the same benefits."
1,"i used for a lil while. cant say i was too impressed, but it did its job eventually.it's ok."
1,This is a replacement for the same brand that finally died after years of use.  Good product. I have recommended it to friends.
1,"The best lemon oil I've ever bought, very real lemon scent.  I used it all over the house, but especially in the fridge, around the gaskets etc.  Very clean, delicious scent for my food areas."
1,"This polish is great and this color looks good with my skin color, and would probably look good on any skin color."
1,"I am so happy to have finally found my go-to facial cleanser. I have heard this removes makeup like a dream, but I normally remove my makeup separately anyway just because I am so nervous about leaving any residue behind. I break out SO easily.That being said, even after makeup removal, my previous cleaners have still left some of the makeup behind, as evidenced by the tint to my cotton pad when sweeping a toner over my skin. However, this creamy, wonderfully-scented gel product smoothes on like a dream and removes any trace of whatever may be on my skin. What amazes me the most is that it does so without drying out my skin, and actually helps to leave it soft and smooth. I feel so refreshed afterwards. Also, just to note, I use this with a Clarisonic.I find many people do not like if a product doesn't foam, as they like to see where the product is on their face when removing it afterwards. In that regard, I find this product does NOT foam, but that's never been a concern of mine. I can tell when the product is removed because of the amount of slip it has. I just wash until my face isn't slippery anymore.I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, which flares up and gets red very often. In the mornings I use this with a toner and a sunscreen moisturizer, and in the evenings I use this with a toner, retinol product, and a heavy night cream. On the weekends I use a salycilic acid scrub and a mud mask. This combined regimen has helped to reduce my redness and calm my skin without tightening or drying it out. This cleanser has been an amazing addition, and doesn't burn, itch, or cause redness to flare.I feel there has been an improvement in the softness and radiance of my skin after regular use of this product. I absolutely love it and will continue to buy. My only complaint is the price, but as many others have been doing, I will continue to pay it for the quality of the product, especially since I have not found anything quite as effective as this so far. Also, the ingredients listed in this product can be relatively expensive, so I feel satisfied that I am not being charged an arm and a leg for sub-par ingredients.Two thumbs up!"
1,"This was a little darker than the color I really wanted, but Essie is nice! I just don't like how the brush is small. But that's not really a big problem. I like it and would recommend it."
1,"I was just recently diagnosed with Guttate Psoriasis and initially, this was the only thing that keept my skin moisturized. Then it seemed as if I need something thicker.  Cetaphil is good but not thick enough for the kind of moisturizing I need.  I no longer use it."
1,This leave my scalp moist and I don't even have dandruff anymore. This stuff works great just massage it into your scalp. I do it Every other day and or at least once a week after I wash my hair. Highly Recommend!
1,"I watched the infomercial, and was honestly very skeptical.  How many of us have seen informericals or segments on various shopping at home television networks, to buy products and for them to come out not so great?  I have done this many times.  I especially like this product.  It is light, covers well, and provides excellent sun protection.I like that you can add a little more or a little less for extra coverage.  This powder is so incredibly light, and easy to put on.  With the use of a good quality brush you can make sure the foundation blends in perfectly to your natural skin tone.  I like this powder does not have extra filler or any other ingredients that may aggrivate your skin.  I have very fair skin, that is sensitive, I have never had any issues of this product clogging my pores or causing any adverse skin conditions.I have been using this foundation for about two years now, I love the light easy to put on foundation.  It is easy on the skin, and provides SPF protection for you.  I also how natural this is, and how well it blends into your own skin tone.  If you have even thought for a second to try this product, you definately should give bareMinerals Foundation a try."
1,"I'm not sure if I love this product only because i&#34;ve never used a base coat, or if it IS simply amazing. When i didn't use a base coat, i used to sit i class everyday and peel my nail polish off. And because i'm starting a new year, i want to stop spending study time painting my nails and actually study. I started using this base coat last week and everyday since, it's been a habit to try and peel the polish off, fortunately, no matter how i tried, i could not peel the polish off. I used this base coat with china glaze nail polish and inm out the door top coat and could not be happier. Now i won't have to paint my nails every night but still have them looking gorgeous. Shipping was way faster than the expected time (I think it came in about three days) and the packaging was excellent. I usually don't write reviews unless an item is awful or awesome so i hope you take my word that this product is soo worth it."
1,"It doesn't curl, but it will create a wave at ends. It doesn't blow dry quickly because high speed is equal to the lowest speed on a normal blowdryer. I'm not in love with it but it will work for occasional use, otherwise I would be really annoyed."
1,"I only wash my hair with non sulfate shampoos, so I wanted to give Avalon Organics a try. The shampoo has a strong lavender smell. Not the sweetened watered down type either, but the smell of lavender essential oil. It lathers up very nice. It doesn't have tons of suds like sulfate shampoos, but suds do not equal clean. I feel that this shampoo suds up perfectly without overdoing it.Overall, my hair feels clean, but not as soft as with other shampoos. I am using the conditioner that goes with this (a little bit goes a long way, too). While I do not dislike this product, it is a bit too drying for my hair. I wash daily and need something a little more moisturizing. I will probably give their other shampoos a try."
1,I love Essie polishes and this one is now one of my favorites! Its adorable and stays on forever. Gorgeous color.
1,I love using this on my skin.  It made it noticably smoother.  I use it day and night and am addicted to this stuff.  A little definately goes a long way. I only use one pump on my finger and dot it on both checks forhead and chin.  I've got a little more than half a bottle left since March and it's now October.
1,"THIS IS THE BEST MAKEUP REMOVER EVER MADE! I CAN TAKE OFF EYE MAKEUP IN ONE SWIPE. I HATED WEARING MASCARA BEFORE I FOUND THIS PRODUCT, BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT WOULD TAKE FOREVER TO GET OFF, BUT THIS PRODUCT MAKE IT SO EASY! EVEN THE KNOCK OFF ONE OF THIS IS AWSOME. LOVE IT AND WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING ELSE."
1,"OMG, this brush is amazing. It's very gentle on my scalp yet it still manages to give my scalp a much needed soothing massage. Great for removing product buildup on the scalp."
1,"I hate the creamy feeling when i use the other product no matter what they claim as oil free i still feel really uncomfortable after few hours after uses, but this one gives me a light but enough strenght to keep my face clean and hydrated."
1,"I'm one of those people who had a sprinkling of acne as a teen (which was taken care of by Retin-A) and then nothing until later in life. For some reason, when I turned 35- BOOM. My skin went haywire. I went to a dermatologist and he gave me a variety of things, but the basic advice was stick to a ""clean"" soap (I usePurpose Gentle Cleansing Bar, 6-Ounce Bars (Pack of 2)) and use a deep cleaning product with salicylic acid.The Aveeno Clear Complexion pads REALLY worked. I don't use them everyday, maybe three times a week, because they are very drying. But they definitely clean the skin well. I also use them in conjunction with a pure sea salt scrub (I dip the pad in the loose sea salt and scrub my face) and it does an AMAZING job of cleaning my skin and keeping it clear without turning it into a dry painful mess.So, I highly recommend this for anyone dealing with fussy skin!"
1,I try and remember to use this every day on the cuticles on my hands and feet.  Especially after a Shellac manicure...it's a must.  It freshens up your nails and keeps your hands looking manicured (even when they haven't).
1,This is my absolute all time favorite Red. I have been using it for almost 2yrs. It's not a pink red it's a very bright orange red. Once the initial brightness wears off (if you don't like attention don't use this color!)it turns into a completely beautiful copper color. I've tried other reds and I always come back to this one. I hope Feria never stops making this color because I would be heartbroken.
0,"ended up using maybe a total of 3 times, because my babies. Twins. Decided that they like the taste of the stuff, when it actually tastes I bit hazardous and toxic in my opinion (though I'm sure it can't be) I was too scared to continue because they just suck it right off, and Keep right on sucking their fingers."
1,"I have used this cream for years, even on my face. Terribly, it smelled a little like sulfur... not very pleasant for getting &#34;up close&#34; but Thank you Margarite for changing the formulation to smell better! It works the same as always :)"
1,i received my mother's special blend skin toning oil today.i hope it minimize my stretch marks.most of the reviews talks good about it so am hoping for something good....i will give it 3 stars cos today is ma first time of using it.
1,"This is my go-to moisturizer. It's light (maybe a little too light for winter if you get really dry skin), and it has 30 spf which many doctors recommend nowadays.  Given the 30 SPF, this is by far the cheapest facial lotion I've seen here or anywhere else.  It absorbs well into my skin, does NOT smell strongly of sunscreen or anything really, and the pump dispenser is pretty good (though if you are a vigorous pumper it will look like something... gross and white... got squirted on you). The little plastic cap is good quality  --- it has never cracked on me like some other bottles. Even after months of use, it seems to treat my acne kindly, which is to say it doesn't really have an effect on it either way. Best of all though, this lotion never stings even if I get it close to my eyes.My only complaint is I wish they made 3oz bottles so I could take this on a plane."
1,"I use it for conditioning treatments and very been happy with it for that so far. I took away one star because of how loud it is. Another, con is that since it came with no instructions on how to lower the bonnet, I find myself sitting on pillows to raise myself up to reach the heat. I called the company  and even they did not know how to lower the bonnet."
1,"It helps but because I have a t-zone it doesn't really help the oily section.  I keep breaking out.  The acne disappears, but I would need to apply it  several times a day.  It's not strong enough but it does control the acne break out."
1,I really like this color! On my dark brown hair turns out exactly like in picture on the box. I have very little gray hairs and the color seems to be lighter on them... so I would not recommend for someone with lots of gray. I use it every 6-8 weeks.
1,"Good clean fresh scent.  I prefer Thierry Mugler cologne but this is a cheap alternative.  Both smell very clean and soapy, good for any occasion."
1,"Two quick things: I have been lazy for years(!) about cleansing my skin at night, so I will always have enlarged pores as a result (and if you were crappy about your skin care, you will, too!); and (2) the first, oh, half dozen times I used this thing I used it incorrectly and thought it was a piece of crud (and if you don't love the thing, you probably will, too). Phew! Now that those things are out of the way...What this will do:1. If you've washed AND exfoliated your face, even if you use this incorrectly it will help, though you won't see wonders.2. If you've done both of those things and are willing to spend time bending over your vanity and staring in the mirror you WILL see this work.3. It will NOT shrink your enlarged pores (which are enlarged due to your neglect) down to a newborn baby's size. Nor the size of a teenager's. In fact, the best you can hope for is that they won't look scary. But, honestly, if you're worried about huge pores then you've got no one to blame but yourself. What, you didn't think all that bit about washing your face religiously was about you? Puh-leze.4. This WILL, if used correctly, both clean out the superficial junk (as in, you won't be able to express -- or ""squeeze"" -- crud out of your pores) and keep your pores from doing the ice-pick, lake-sized thing.Now, here's how to use it:(1) For those of you who want to use it OUT of the shower: wash your face using warm water and your favorite cleanser. Rinse at least a half-dozen times. Run a cheap, rough wash cloth under warm water. Hold it against your face until it cools. Now, lightly scrub your face with it. Fill the reservoir of the Panasonic with warm water and splash your face with warm water, too. Next, starting with the big end of the vacuum attachment AND on your largest pore areas move the Panasonic across your face. Do NOT slide it. Do NOT rub it. Do NOT think of this process as running it over your face. Move the dang thing slowly. A count of four is good. A count of ten will probably leave you looking blotchy. So, you know, pick something between that. Oooh, and if you've got good eyesight and can watch yourself in the mirror, YOU WILL SEE IT SUCKING THE SEBUM OUT OF YOUR PORES! Don't get carried away. Just do it daily -- at night, ideally -- and eventually your skin will look better than it did before you started neglecting it.(2) For those of you who want to use it IN the shower: See above. But don't bother filling the tank. Also, you probably don't get to watch it suck the crud out of your skin. Pity. That's kind of fun.So there's the instructions. If it's not working for you, then you didn't follow them. That's not this product's fault, it's yours. Then again, if you were good at following instructions you'd have followed your mother's advice about ""always wash your makeup off"" and ""let your skin breathe"" and ""you look better without makeup, darling""."
1,"I've been using this for the past few years and really like it. The packaging has improved. The pump used to 'stick' so I would pour the bottle into another foaming soap container I had, but the past few bottles I've received have had better packaging and I haven't needed to switch bottles. very happy with this product."
1,"This is really and truly a metallic silver as in chrome of a car bumper silvery and not glittery.  This color is difficult to find and I used to wear the chrome silver by Sally Hansen until it was discontinued.  This is an exact match to that brand.  You will need 2 coats to cover thourghly though.  Mine hasn't chipped in 2 days now with lots of typing and work.  I love this as its almost identical to Sally Hasnen chrome. Dries pretty fast too. Very nice,  5 stars."

1,"I've been using this for about a month, I do like it a lot. Its much better for my hair than the conditioners I was using. I dont think its a super product but it is great and I will be buying it again"
1,i am a big fan of essie polishes and this one did not disappoint. it is a great neutral with a little bit more color.
1,"I bought this to help get rid of the keratosis pilaris on my upper arms and legs. The lotion did not help smooth out the little bumps and I found something better instead. Since I still had the whole bottle, I decided to use this as my night time moisturizer. I'm in my 20's so I have minimal wrinkles so I can't attest to how well it helps with those. My skin does feel tighter after using this though. Sometimes I use another moisturizer alongside this one because it can be drying. I wouldn't use it by itself if your skin is on the dry side. My skin has been smoother since I've been using this moisturizer and I haven't had a breakout in a while. I'm not 100% behind this product, but I think it is doing what it is supposed to for my face."
1,Love this conditioner.  I just use a tiny drop and it makes my hair silky and smooth.  The large size bottle will last me a long time.
1,The smell alone is enough to keep me buying this but it also works great. Lightly foamy and clean smelling product.
1,"Unfortunately a few reviewers found the scent to be over powering. Let me give my honest opinion. The rose fragrance is lovely, clean, and refreshing. Moreover, my husband uses it, and he finds it to be clean smelling; also invigorating; We love it. Cleaning, and exfoliating your skin; coupled with Thayer toner at the end of the routine will render your skin amazing without make-up. Furthermore, there are other things in life to be critical about, other than the smell of this stuff. As long as the product does the job, it is worth using. There is also a fragrance free version; but who wants that? unless your skin is hyper sensative."
1,Abit skeptical at first but it does work. Of course it wont erase all of it but i can see the different after my 2nd try.This will definitely worth the money and time.
0,"I have very dry skin and couldn't use these, but I have really sensitive skin.  I just cannot take off my makeup before bed or my eyes get a rash."
1,"This is a good mask. I have actually seen my pores diminish from the first try. I love how it hardens in seconds and when I remove it, my face feels fresh, clean and tight. I will definitely buy it again."
0,"So I ordered two of these Formula 2 PLUS, .25 oz bottles.  I chose SleekHair as my choice to get the product.  I think Amazon wasn't selling it Prime or something, I forget why.  Anyway, here's my experience...Took a little over a week to get.  I got the Formula 2 bottles instead, not the Formula 2 PLUS, and the wrong amount - 1/8 fl oz instead of 1/4 fl oz.  Contacted the seller, they said they were sending out 2 new bottles.Another week or so goes by.  I get the new box.  Open it.  Same FORMULA with a UPS label to send back the 1/4 ounce bottles of the same crap.  So they sent me the 1/4 ounce bottles of the wrong formula anyway so I'm in the same boat.  Still didn't get the product I ordered.  And yes, there is a difference.  It says so RIGHT ON THE BOX.  So I contact them again.Their answer?  They are very sorry but they don't sell the Formula 2 PLUS bottles but feel free to send them all back.  What?I specifically waited three days before writing this review.  They are still listed as one of the sellers of this product even though they don't have this product to sell.BUY FROM SOMEONE OTHER THAN SLEEK HAIR, they don't sell this product and will give you the same run around."
1,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  Reviews were good, and so was the price.  I have to be very careful with fragrances because I get migraines and so if the scent is very intense at all, it will give me a migraine.  This is very subtle and quite nice!  I am happy with it.  Thank you."
1,This is a great product for thinning hair coverage. Simple to use and I like the applicator that allows me to spray the product when parting my hair.
1,"I use this product every night to help keep my sensitive dry skin hydrated - which is a difficult task. It does the job well and does not irritate my skin. Has a light smell to it, but nothing too potent or irritating."
1,"My previous favorite hair regrower potion reduced their percentage of active ingredient so I went to this name brand. I have thinning hair at the hairline, esp on one side. I don't use this as often as recommended, more like a few times a week, and just at night (as its supposed to be contraindicated for women.)My hair is so much fuller, and while it will never be and never has been a lush mane (except in the back!), I am really happy with the regrowth. In fact the side I was concentrating on, which was the sparser side, now is the more filled in side!I hope it doesn't do anything untoward to my system, but in the conservative way I use it, I will take the chance. Vanity prevails."
1,"I've had this lotion on my shelf for months and kept using my 'fancier', good smelling stuff.  I guess you could say that I am sort of a 'lotion junky' because I have so many.  I even have some in a storage room because I don't have enough room on my closet shelves for all of them.  I have some that I love the fragrance and some that I just thought were better for some reason.  I don't know why because I hadn't even opened my Cetaphil lotion yet.  Maybe because it's in such a plain bottle.  But, as they say, ""don't judge a book by it's cover"".  I now know this applies to my Cetaphil lotion.  For a while now I thought Olay Quench was the best, but I finally opened my Cetaphil yesterday and all I can say is WOW!!  I don't think my skin has felt this soft in a long time.  Well, maybe I should say felt this soft and STAYED this soft.  This stuff doesn't wear off or evaporate like some others that have to be reapplied a few hours later.  My skin feels so soft that I keep wanting to feel my legs, arms, etc.  I will now be using this from now on as my first pick.  Who knew?"
1,"I love this mask, I'm at the end of my first bottle and just ordered another. I have very oily skin and it doesn't not dry it out or create excess oil. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. I would definitely recommend this product as it is one of my favorites."
1,"I've been using this for about 10 yrs now. My hubby introduced me to the product, His hands were always so soft, even though he was a welder by trade and a rough and tough outdoorsman, too.A little goes a long way, and it has lasting results. No Petro!! Multiple uses! It smells great too- a clean, woodsy natural scent.Use for:Dry cracked hands/feetLip BalmRoseacea ( I put it on my rosey face patches before bed, instead of using a night cream, ladies)WindburnDry itchy skin anywhereCuticle BalmCuts/ScrapesBug BitesDiaper Rash"
1,Great moisturizer but the lingering vanilla smell is just horrible.  I would prefer my face not smelling like vanilla.  Not sure if I'm noticing any skin improvement but it doesn't cause me to break out with acne or rashes.  So I may continue to use the entire bottle.
1,"Simple to use, not to heavily scented and did not appear to dry the patient's skin. Might be good for kids and parents on camping trips when water is scarce."
1,I use this for making my own toner. I mix it weigh witch hazel and a tiny amount of glycerin. Smells heavenly.
1,"I have very fine hair that is determined to be straight.  I had a set of curlers that were starting to go out on me (they took 45 minutes to heat up and did not hold the curl).  I recently decided to replace it with the Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Hot Rollers, since I was interested in curlers that would heat up quickly.  They heat up just as quickly as they say.  They are incredibly hot and do a great job of putting in a curl that holds.  Like I said, I have the kind of hair that wants desperately to be straight, and my curl stays all day with these curlers.  They are fairly hot on the edges, but I have yet to find any curlers that won't be challenging to handle for more than a minute.  I would definitely recommend these to any of my friends."
1,I Love this product. I have adult acne and this product does a fantastic job covering any flaws or acne I might have. Love this product.
1,"I have 4 a/b type hair and I bought this along with the Roux Shampoo, Porosity Conditioner and Mendex treatment.  This review is for the treatment.  It smells really nice and it give great shine and moisture to my hair.  I've used on both wet and dry hair and follow up by sealing with an oil or butter and it works very well.  I will continue to use this product."
1,"Not really smelling anything but ""Baby Powder"" when using this, but I love Baby Powder smell, so this is not a issue for me. I give it a 4 star rating due to the miss-leading name. I do love this Body Wash, it lathers really well when used with a scrunchy, but not with a wash cloth what so ever.The bottle size is impressive and can easily leave a family of 4 1 to 1.5 months. I feel like my skin is already starting to appreciate the ""All Natural"" effect of this product. I will order this again, but in a different scent to try.The texture is very creamy & you do not need a lot & it has the added bonus of the pump & the kids really think that is the coolest thing ever (4 & 5 yrs old)Definetly would recommend this product or any of Jason's Products to anyone looking for healthier skin/hair (yes they make shampoo & conditioner)."
1,I have a small hand but these work fine.  I had someone with a larger hand try them on and they stretched to easily fit those hands too.  The fingers feel tight but stretch a bit.  I suppose they need to be tight to do the work.  The wrist part is a bit loose but I imagine it would be uncomfortable to sleep with a tight wrist.  These are very comfortable to sleep in and easy to take on and off.  They machine wash and dry just fine.  I've only used them for a few days and already feel the difference on my poor dry hands.
0,"I use the moisturizer and love that, however, this tinted moisturizer is very cloudy and goes on very thick.  I am still trying to figure out how much to use.  I won't purchase again."
1,"I love to go barefoot!  The moment I enter my humble abode, or anywhere else where bare-feet are tolerated, off come the shoes.  It's a little rebellion, I think, from all the wear and tear my feet and legs have had to endure as an RN. Those little pinkies just scream to be free from the confinement of those, very necessary, athletic shoes.Going barefoot has its bad side, though.  My feet become very dry and calloused (yep, I can walk on rocks and acorns without flinching), and my heels are prone to cracking. Not a pretty sight!  I have tried every remedy out there from, 'Miracle Foot Cream,' to cow udder cream, all to no avail. Some seemed to actually make the situation worse.I was already enjoying Aveeno's Stress Relief formula for overall body moisturizing, becoming increasingly impressed that it actually DID moisturize for 24 hours, as advertised. So, I put it to the ultimate test.  I applied it liberally to my feet, put on some light socks, and left them on overnight. I was absolutely astonished at the difference in just one night.  My feet were soft, and the cracked heels began to heal.  After a few more overnight applications, my feet are almost brand new, for the first time, in years.If this lotion can moisturize neglected feet/heels resulting in this much difference, it is a no-brainer, that it can moisturize the rest of the body with ultimate efficiency.  And, while nurturing your skin, you can enjoy the scent of lavender, chamomile and ylang-ylang, all embraced in aromatherapy for their calming, stress reducing, properties.Give it a try!  A little goes a long way, and for the results received, the cost is fabulous!"
1,The price was good and it does what it says. I will continue with it if it does not skyrocket in price.
1,"I tried this product after success with other pca products. I use this cleanser in the morning and I use the pigment bar in the evenings. I have done this for 6 weeks now and I can truly see a difference in my complexion. My skin is less oily and much clearer. I like this combination because it seems to combat my acne along with scaring from older scars. I say this is a good first step into the PCA product line. I also utilize the A/C serum, the true tone, clearskin and oil free sunscreen. My skin has not looked better! If you suffer from acne I highly recommend the PCA line and this blemish bar is a good way to start building upon the line. If you are weary of dropping a lot of cash they do have ""trial size"" intro packets!!"
1,"results nor as promised  Followed directions, saw no results so do not waste your money. Go to the drugstore and the least expensive eye cream will serve you just as well."
1,its ok
1,"Sufficient. My lashes at long, so this is pretty ok for me because I don't really need anything to extend or thicken--just a little darkening. It doesn't clump which is nice--but it isn't incredibly thick. So...it's a decent compromise."
1,"Reasonably priced skin cream that can go on under makeup for daywear and apply liberally at night.  I have been using this for years and it does softens skin in an extra rich texture that has a pleasing and recognizable scent.Since I am allergic to lanolin and have had sensitive skin my whole life I first checked the ingredients on the back of the jar and found this is not listed.There is also no sticky feeling left on your hands or face after applying and no tightness present on the face. It feels so silky when applied after I have come inside from a hot day, relief in a small jar that can be applied over face and throat. I have noticed a big difference in how my face looks since I first started using Pond's Dry Skin Cream."
1,"This perfume is absolutely divine!  I have been trying for years to find a light, sweet, floral perfume that didn't smell like sickening sweet cotton candy or bubble-gum.  I've found it.  I did a google search a few weeks ago entering in ""best selling perfume for women"" and the website Auric Blends came up with Egyptian Goddess listed on the site.  I took a chance.  I had no idea what the perfume would smell like ... I just knew that I needed to try something new and I knew that I did not want to pay $24 for a 1.07 ounce bottle just in case I hated it.  I decided to try the $7 roll on fragrance.  Oh, I'm so sorry that I didn't buy the larger bottle now!This oil based perfume is a sweet, soft musk smell with floral undertones... the minute I rolled this water of the nile on my wrists, my mood lifted tremendously.  I'm a big aromatherapy fan -- love incense and aromatic oils and fragrant soaps... all that great stuff.  This being an oil based perfume will ensure that the fragrance lasts.  Oh, I love this stuff so much.  Now I have two favorite perfumes:  Lalique (French) and Egyptian Goddess... I'm in heaven! ;)"
1,"It does help remove frizz and add shine.  It always gets crinkly on my hair and my hair takes much longer to dry with this in it. You can get rid of the crinkly, after the hair is dry, by using the Clear Control Pomade.  I'm not very good with this products so I don't do the whole thing nearly as well as my hair cutting person.  I actually hate doing the whole process, but I give it 4 stars because it does make my hair look better than anything else I've found.  You do have to use a lot of this Gel if you have a lot of hair, like I do."
1,The mask is very very thick but is fairly smooth. It definitely dries up the excess oil and is great on blackheads. I would recommend this for people with  oily to very oily skin. Don't use if you have dry skin.
1,"As for CND Stickey, I don't like the brush, and the tips of my polish rubbed off very quickly. Out of all the base coat products I have tried, CND Stickey is second best. (The best is China Glaze Strong Adhesion Base Coat.)"
1,"i loved the mascara but the brush is SUPER small, its even smaller than the brush i have for eyebrows. Other than that i loved it, ive used this brand for a long time i have tried others and i keep going back to this one!"
1,"I've been using this product for 3 years now.  I could not think of switching to another.  It is non greasy, with just the right amount of SPF."
1,"Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser is smooth on the skin and both cool and refreshing.  After using it, my face looks clean and clear.  I feel ready to face the world."
1,"I like Neutrogena, this one is really good, it feels light on your skin. Beware if you have sensitive skin that tends to redness - this will enhance the redness"
1,"Beautiful deep rich red color, and such a unique name! High quality polish, no streaking or chipping. Very satisfied with this brand. Similar quality to other professional polishes like OPI, China Glaze and Zoya!"
1,"gave my skin a radiant tone , great to hide burns or eczema on face or neck area..love it .wow"
1,"Bought this one after a long time research on body lotions. Finally get this one with no parabens(threw away my old lotions because of this). The smell is so good, not so strong and comfort enough. It does a good job moisturizing my dry skins and is non-sticky... Will definitely buy more in the future"
1,"I felt compelled to review this as I've just used it for the first time. I am a veteran home-colorer...been doing blonde in various shades for 15 years, and yes I still have hair left. First of all, don't even try mixing this in the teensy bottle they provide. Get an old bowl or a color mixing bowl. And if you have hair even past your collar bone, get two boxes. The consistently is thick, which is great for not dripping but not great for evenly applied color. You're going to need a lot to saturate your whole head if that's what you're doing. This is a nice alternative to bleaching, yes. But with drawbacks. If you have hair darker than dirty blonde, you're going to get brassy results no matter what you do. Only with extensive bleaching using a high volume peroxide solution will you get snowy white locks. I started with dirty blonde today, and my hair is a very, very light blonde now. I used the violet-tinted conditioner provided, and left it on my head for about 20 minutes which did counteract some brassiness I was left with. I'd recommend using a violet tinted shampoo and conditioner for maintaining your blonde and keeping brass toned down, especially if you have hard water. You can make your own purple or blue tinted conditioner by adding some manic panic or Jerome Russell dye to a large amount of cheap conditioner.If you found this review helpful, please click 'yes'...thanks!!"
1,a great prodcut that does not dry your skin out but blances out the oily and dry areas. I love all the OBAGU products
1,"For once--a beauty product that actually DOES what it SAYS it does. In just one application, it dried up my t-zone oil slick, shrunk my pores (which are big enough in which to carry loose change), evened out my skin tone, and softened my skin to baby's butt softness. It even seemed to tighten my fine lines. The minty scent is truly refreshing (AND relaxing). The clay texture is soft, smooth, and feels nice going on--very therapeutic. Oh!...and it lasts forEVER....oh!..and it's inexpensive. OH..my God..............I love this stuff.Bottom line: Stop spending ridiculous amounts on more expensive brands with fancy packaging and get something in a butt-ugly package that actually works. Period."
1,"I tried this soap based on research I had done online about natural soaps.  This one got high reviews so I thought I would give it a try.  It has a strong, but not heavy lemon scent.  I can smell it in the shower, but it doesn't stay on my skin.  The best thing I love about this soap is that it doesn't leave a residue.  It washes clean from my skin.Some possible cons:*It does have a very yellow rinse.  In other words, the color of the soap is the color that washes down the drain.  This can be a nuisance if you don't rinse it off the side of the tub, as it leaves the yellow color behind.  It washes away well, as it doesn't seem to stain the tub.  It doesn't stain my washclothes either, which is a good thing and I have used a white washcloth with it.*It doesn't seem to last as long as other soaps.  Make sure to keep it in a dish that drains, so that it doesn't sit in water or you won't have it around for long.I personally love it, and the cons I listed above aren't cons to me, but may be cons for someone else so thats why I listed them.  I started using this soap 3 years ago and haven't bought a different kind since."
1,This works well for thinning hair. I spray along my part line for a thicker looking set of hair. It works great unless I spray too much and then my hair looks clumpy. So just be careful not to spray too much.
0,"I used Feria's Starry Night because I wanted to make my dark brown hair a gloss black. After I washed the dye out, I noticed I had brown spots on the back crown of my head. It's very odd since I've never had this problem before with the other brands. I thought it was a fluke like I didn't follow the instructions properly. So I tried it again. Same thing happened. I'm really disappointed."
1,"I thought it would make my sensitive skin scream, but it does not. I also believe that even though I don't use it religiously, I have noticed a change in the deep 11 wrinkle between my brows as well as significant fading of some hyperpigmentation on my cheeks. Thank you ROC!"
1,"But just because it doesn't smell like cotton candy and more like a fruity concoction, doesn't make it a bad product. Just should be called something else like passion fruit. It lasts a long time either way and I find I like to take a bottle like that and mix that one with Midnight Rose by Tresor and Victoria Beckham's Intimately Yours. It makes my own scent that I get a lot of compliments on at work and they ask what I'm wearing. I'm like... &#34;Stephanie... by Stephanie.&#34; :-P"
1,"First tried this over a year ago when it was on sale, 2 for 5 bucks, and have been hooked ever since. This stuff is AMAZING, I usually hate most lotions/creams for one reason or another, too oily, smell, etc but this stuff is the BEST. I won't use anything else now, if you've hated lotions in the past but have dry hands do yourself a favor and just try it, I bet you wont be dissapointed!"
0,"Very disappointed in this soap.  The scent is not ""lemony""...it stinks of ""old lady powdered perfume"".  If you know what I mean by an old powdered scent...you'll know what I mean.  You get this on your hands and you will have to smell it for hours.  It's horrible raising food to your mouth with this ""perfume"" on your hands.  You can't wash it off either.Besides that, after washing a few cups during the day, I noticed my hands were now chapped and burning.  The detergents in this soap opened the cuticle of my skin on my hands so horribly that they felt like someone had taken sandpaper to them.Absolutely horrible stuff.  Oh, your dishes will smell of this perfume too.  I raised a cup to my mouth to drink coffee and smelled the powdery perfume smell in the cup.  Had to rinse and rinse and rinse.  Never buy again."
1,"I think I got it the next day, .and perfectly wrapped...and what a beautiful color for either feet or hands."
1,This is perfect if you have allergies to fragrance as I do.  I use this but also love the Neutrogena Rainbath.
1,"I have bleached hair that i've been coloring silver/white for the past 3 months. A week ago i got a little ""adventurous"" and tried to add a slight blue tint, and to my horror my hair turned a dark royal blue! after washing it 20 times and using Color Corrector from the local Sally's TWICE, it was still a medium purple/blue color. I literally had to wear a hat to cover it up for the past week! Last night i picked up ColorZap and used it. BANG! The purple/blue is ALL gone, my hair is left whiter than ever (it still has some pinkish and blueish tints at places, but it looks really neat i rather like it :-)). Overall I'm VERY happy with the result, thanks ColorZap!!!! will definitely use again for my next hair coloring disaster!"
1,"I bought a bottle of this a few years ago and it had tea tree in it and it was absolutely amazing stuff and really great for my itchy scalp. My hair never looked better. Now, they've replaced the tea tree with aloe and it now has a better pina colada type smell. Delicious, summery smell, by the way. Without the tea tree, the product is not as good as it used to be, but I will continue using it because the ingredient list is top notch and the smell is so yummy. There's really no need to spend more money buying salon products when you can get stuff that's just as good or better for a fraction of the cost. One bottle of this is $2.50 at my local Wal-mart. You can't beat that!"
1,"I love this leave-in conditioner and it's so hard to find! Glad to get it in an &#34;add-on&#34; deal. I'm a lap swimmer and have colored and highlighted hair but don't like wearing swim caps. Instead, I wet my hair and spritz this into it, so my hair is saturated and the chlorinated water rolls off. At least, I'm hoping that's what happens! My hair stylist suggested I do this and my color seems to last as long as it should."
1,"When ever I buy glycolic cream I know it's good quality when I feel a sting because I have really sensitive skin, but this cream only barely stung at all. I usually buy Alpha-Maximum 10% Glycolic Acid which works like a miracle cream but I haven't been able to find it in stock. Overall, this cream is just ok."
1,This oil moisturized great and was really silky going on and made my skin feel very silky as well and moisturized especially after showerin while skin is still damp. It smells like all cocoa butter products a chocolatey smell and it was a decent size bottle to last for a while. I love this oil
1,"I love this cleanser, it has a very clean fragrance and cleans your skin without drying it out which is what I look for."
1,"I am 58 years old. People tell me I look like I am in my 40's. I use this along with the very  ultra gentle cleanser. No breakouts, moisture and seems to lesson the lines to where you don't look in the mirror anymore and go ugh! How about that for this price!"
1,I use it as a skin moisturizer for my face and hands. It's pure and the skin absorbs it quickly.I've used it for years and I get about 6 months out of a single bottle.
1,"I recieved the cuticle creme in a pack for Christmas... and well. It's my favorite thing out of the entire ""healthy hands"" kit.I was a ritual nail biter since childhood, and now being 21 I have a reason to not bite them.I'm not suggesting this will work for everyone to deter nail biting, but I found that by taking the time to take care of my nails that I didn't want to ruin them by biting them any longer.I always had the bad cuticles and my nails were just overall gross... but now they're growing out nicely. My cuticles aren't frayed and my nails are shinier than they've ever been. They're actually so nice that I don't even want to polish them. It sort of looks like there is a 'clear coat' on yours nails after using this product from the very first day. After a while using them you actually feel your nail get smoother...AWESOME product."
1,"Great product.  I've used it for years.  I've noticed when I DON'T use it, I have a hard time controling blackheads and can't squeeze the buildup from my pores.  Makes me feel crisp and moisturized, lasts for months.  Smells great.  Perfect toner."
0,"I can't believe this company has the nerve to set a price of $38.  Amazon had it for $10.59 and I got it with some other alleged plumpers of about the same price to try it out.  The current price is $21 -- just ridiculous.  It is a pretty lip gloss with a slightly sweet taste.  It licks off easily so it doesn't last long.  It has no other effect, but the company includes a long information page in many languages with purportedly scientific details and the fact that you'll get best results when it's used in combination with several of their other products.  Incredible.  I don't give it one star because I save that for products that actually cause harm or are extraordinarily displeasing."
1,Now it is a real good deal & I really do love the lashes believe me you get more than enough with this deal XD but I have a little  Problem with it they do not look thick I mean in each knot there is like 5 lashes or less and there is a noticeable gap between them
1,"I love this face wash, I used with my MIA tool daily,my skin just glow.This product is very gentle,so if you use havy makeaup like me you need to wash your face couple times with it, which is no problem or maybe use a gentle exfoliant from time to time.Loooveee it, and would recomend to my best friend!"
0,"Either i received an old worn out, defective piece or it doesnt do what it claims. It cudnt even hold the oil for an hour for me. Also i broke out in two places. Not pleased at all."
1,"I have oily, acne prone skin (which also tends to get red and irritated). Combined with some other moisturizers, I have found a decent balance for my skin, so I am pleased with this purchase."
1,"This is a lovely real coconut lotion and I have been using it for decades. I don't think it has changed in all that time, except they have recently removed parabens! I thank this company for recently removing parabens from their products and they are also removing sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates. (These chemicals absorb into the body they are known toxins that can contribute to various cancers.)The main ingredients are coconut oil and aloe juice. It feels so light, smooth, and fresh, but not sticky or heavy."
1,"This is a good moisturizer. I have used it for quite awhile. The price is kind of high, but I usually can find it on Amazon for a few dollars less than anywhere else. It also lasts awhile too. I don't remember how many months, but it seems like it lasts at least half a year or so per bottle."
1,The best hair brush ever! Moves through thick hair without ripping or snagging. Hair comes out smooth when used with hairdryer. I misplaced mine during a move and was lost without it. The price is so good I ordered an extra one.
1,"WOW this stuff is great & it works fantastically!! I LOVE this stuff! And I love the smell too! I too am a fan of Aubrey Organics & use just about most of their shampoos & conditioners. (I use their BGA Protein + Shampoo & I love this shampoo too). I have thin, fine relaxed hair & when I use these products they always make my hair SO full & thick afterwards, I love it!!! I usually deep condition with this mask on dry hair & leave it on overnight. The next day my hair is always so much softer, thicker & fuller, it just keeps getting better & better. My hair isn't breaking and it's getting healthier. The jar lasts me awhile because I don't use a lot (a little goes a long way for me). However like everyone else, I wish it were bigger though. It is pricey (which is way I make the jar last awhile lol) but it's worth it if you have thin/fine/damaged hair. Thanks Aubrey for making such a fabulous product, I highly recommend it!"
1,Glides on your lips and lasts forever- I got so many compliments when I wear this shade- the PERFECT subtle red.
1,"I'm a fan of this shade from Feria - beige browns are hard to find.  My hair tends to go red whenever I color it & the beige really tones down the red without going flat or ashy.  Also, Feria seems to give you a bit more dye for your money so I only use 1 box instead of the usual 2 for my shoulder length hair.  I'll keep using this product as long as they keep making it."
1,"Great stuff. This is the second time I order this. It really protects my nails and so far has been the only thing on the market that truely has made my nails strong ,..and also keeps them from breaking and chipping."
1,"I bought this for a bit more at Walmart becuase I needed it asap. My hair grows back at an incredible rate and if I don't trim it within 2-3 weeks, it looks BAD.This model featured a Powerdrive system that's supposedly more powerful at cutting thick hair more smoothly. It also sports this special detail trimmer that pops out and attaches to the trimmer blade like a silencer for a rifle. The only difference is that it makes 3 times more noise than the regular trimmer. It was so loud I couldn't stand it buzzing next to my ear.I tried oiling it to no avail, it's just very noisy and vibrates a lot. The regular trimmer is just like the old Wahl I had. In fact this trimmer looks and feels JUST like the old Wahl I had from the mid 90s.I didn't feel any difference in how smoothly it cut - it just got really hot really quickly.But it's new and it has a 5 year warranty. It would pay for itself in the 3rd or 4th haircut at home.UPDATE: After the 3rd cutting, the trimmer appears to be slightly quieter and doesn't get as hot.I oiled the blades and made sure it was clean.The small trimmer attachment got a bit quieter but I found that if I just wear earplugs I can handle the noise. No Big deal at all.The hair trimmer already paid for itself and I'm getting really nice and clean haircuts by myself.UPDATE:After about the 10th use, the longer trimmer guides vibrate and the smaller ""fuzz hair"" adapter vibrates right off of the main trimmer body.It still cuts great for such an inexpensive trimmer. It does the job of an industrial strength trimmer and after about 3 haircuts, it pays for itself. I can pretty much get a brand new trimmer set each year and still save over going to a hair salon/barber shop.My hairstyle isn't complicated: Guide #4 for the top, Guide #1 for the sides. High and tight. I see no reason to pay a barber ten dollars to do the same thing."
1,"It really lathers up well, you only need a little bit on a poof.  Love the scent. I have not used this on my hair yet."
1,I've been having a lot of frizzy hair problems and couldn't find a shampoo and conditioner that worked. This shampoo and the rinse did the trick. My hair is softer and tamer than it was.  My hair doesn't get greasy. I love this stuff.
1,"I was using Aveeno Skin Complexion Skin Care before I tried this one. In preparation for the summer, I thought I would get an Aveeno product with SPF. Unfortunately, I got 3 big pimples after I started using this Aveeno product. When I returned to the Aveeno product I used before, my skin  cleared up, and honestly, my skin hasn't looked this great in a long time. So I guess this a recommendation for Aveeno Skin Complexion Care b/c I'd rather not have pimples. I still have the almost-full, used bottle of this stuff. Oh well..."
1,"I needed to buy the bigger brush now.  This was ok, but my hair is thick and it is too small."
1,This amber butter is so wonderful.I own 5 pieces and just ordered 2 more!As I do not listen to negative reviews I can only relate my own experiences from using it.Although there is a tiny amount in the wooden container it is a spot on amber fragrance andyou only need a tiny amount of this great butter which is long lasting.I have started to use it as a deodorant and personal fragrance as well.Every container I received was fresh and extremely good smelling.There are too many chemicals in commercial deodorants.And expensive mens' fragrances are just that...expensive.I highly recommend this amber butter to anyone..male or female who is looking forthat special fragrance which smells wonderful and serves several purposes.Have also found the amber fragrance in this little container keeps me grounded andcentered.I stocked up on it as amber butter fromAuric Blends tends to sell out quickly andI cannot find it at local health food stores.Tom's Incense is the best seller on Amazon and their customer service isoutstanding.  I highly recommend them.  And the Auric Blends Amber Butter.
1,"I really love this product and have used it for years. I have sensitive skin and eyes, and this was recommended to me by my optometrist."
1,"Close observation of this particular product line has left me with only one answer: ""All the buzz about Burt's Bees products is worthy of our attention."" They promise and they deliver. Each product is like a work of art.These products speak of honesty and down-to-earth goodness. They make no false claims and they tell no lies. The Burt's Bees products are pure, good for your skin and make you feel pampered from head to toe.It seems there is a run on the Burt's Bees products at times because I often find the grocery store box of lip products empty. Have no fear because you can order them here.This particular ""gift set/sample set"" is perfect for gift giving. The Apricot bath oil can be used to refill nail oil bottles. It is deliciously rich and you can use the oil on dry areas of your skin. The cuticle cream has a lovely ""lemon meringue pie scent"" and of course the lip balm is the best on the market.There are samples of the other skin care products, including:Peppermint Shower Soap - invigoratingRosemary Mint Shampoo Bar - tinglyOrange Essence Facial CleanserAlmond Milk Beeswax Hand Cr&egrave;meCoconut Foot Cr&egrave;me - soothing for heels and dry feetMilk & Honey Body Lotion - smooth silky lotion to baby your skinCarrot Day Cr&egrave;me - healingLemon Butter Cuticle Cr&egrave;me - lemon meringue scent and healingHand Salve - especially good in the winter or when gardeningBeeswax Lip Balm - my favorite lip balm of all time, don't make me live without it!Once you try them, you will be hooked!~The Rebecca Review"
1,These are nice and hold up and work well for the handmade hair bows and clips I make for my daughter and sell to others.
1,Long lasting coverage.  Doesn't come off on my glass  when I drink.  Doesn't dry my lips out.  I'm very happy with it and have a wide variety of colors.
0,"Got this in the starter kit and it sheds leaving single strands in my makeup compact, blushes and allover my face and clothes. Not really worth purchasing. It works OKAY but not great as it is poorly made."
1,"I LOVE Nars cosmetics and this blush is an awesome color. I have fair skin and it gives me the right amount of color that I like on my cheeks. It is a very high pigmented blush, so be careful on how much blush you put on. The plus side to it being high pigmented is that it lasts all day, no need to reapply."
1,This polish is a beautiful hot magenta color with subtle fine gold glitter in it. It also looks lovely as a matte. This polish is my top 5 favorite nail polish by O.P.I
1,"My problem with normal lip gloss is the heavy feeling of goo on my lips. It feels less like something to make me attractive and more like something to draw flies to their death, getting hopelessly stuck in the goo.This gloss is different. It is light but shiny, it is sparkly but not glittery. I am a matte lipstick person, so this was a new look for me. I like the transparent colors and same Burts Bees protection that I have come to love."
1,My girlfriend loves all colors for her hair and she likes to mix them sometime she was very happy with the result
1,great color very dark plum and vampy and rich lookin  would recommend to anyone who wants to purchase thanks again.
1,"A good mascara for everyday use, but not what I choose for a dramatic look. Looks great and lasts all day when used over a lash conditioner (to thicken and lengthen) after lashes have been curled. This is one of the darkest black formulas I've ever used, and it looks great. It's a long lasting formula with minimal clumping and no flaking. The only thing I hate about it is that if it gets in my eyes while washing off, it BURNS so bad! Same if I cry while wearing it! Loreal and Rimmel mascaras do the same thing, but not as bad. This mascara burns more than any other I have tried."
1,"Normally I veer away from thin bands as I have thick hair and usually end up chasing/catching the bands when I bend my head or move them away from my glasses.  These are great:  wavy pattern on top holds hair back, hair comb-like tips don't give extra pressure with glasses and add extra stability."
1,Very good product for moisturing your face.  It makes the face feel soft and it gives it a nice dewy glow.
0,read the reviews and tried it.  used for a month and saw no difference at all.  i am over 60 with a few fine lines on my face.  i really like dr graf the best which really showed a big improvement on my skin
1,"If this was the version with SPF, I would have given this a 5 star.  However, Amazon doesn't sell the version with sun protection."
1,"I basically bought this product because I wanted to get the free shipping if you spend over $25 and had a few more dollars to go. But, this hair brush has made life so easier... I have long, thick hair and typically don't like the bristles on these brushes because they tend to snag my hair and hurt my head overall. I was so excited the first time I brushed my hair with this brush just after getting out of the shower. This hair brush is amazing.. it brushes each strand of my hair straight down without pulling out any hair from knots. I haven't used this brush with a blow dryer because I'm not totally convinced that the brush will hold up as long if I do. I can definitively tell why everyone is giving this hair brush 5 stars and it's well worth buying this brush for $6.00!"
1,"So as a guy, I never considered using any kind of facial stuff.  Well I was convinced to ""try"" a mud masque.  Let me tell you, in just one use, I could definately see an improvement.  If you never used a masque before, its not that bad of a feeling.  But when I was done I could see how my skin was more ""tight""  the effects lasted for about 1 week.  I've done this masque 2 times since then and every time there is a dramatic imrpovement.  I'd recomend this product over the Green one.Queen Helene Masque, Mint Julep - 8 oz"
1,"I usually use Avon's make up remover to take off my waterproof mascara and liner, but I find myself unhappy with the results. I was running out of the Avon remover and wanted something different to replace it, so I popped on to Amazon to see what was available. I ended up buying this make up remover based on the price and reviews and I'm actually really happy with my purchase!Here are a few things I've found about this make up remover:*The bottle is about the size of the palm of my hand*Fragrance-free*Great price, especially the subscribe and save*The product is an oil, which can be a little messy*It is very moisturizing, which I love!*If you plan on putting make up on after using this make sure to get every trace of oil off of your eyelid and eyelashes or your new/fresh make up won't stick*I squirt this remover onto a cotton pad or cotton ball and gentle wiggle it back and forth on my eye to remove my liner and mascara, the make up slips off easily. I tightline my eyes so sometimes that liner doesn't come off with just wiping the cotton ball downwards, which is why I wiggle the cotton ball around on my eye*After using this product I wash my face normally, and make sure to rinse around my eye area to remove the remaining make up remover*A little goes a long way*Didn't hurt too bad when I accidentally got it in my eye (I accidentally got Avon's eye make up remover in my eye and it was awful)I definitely will be repurchasing this product, it's wonderful. I've found my new favorite eye make up remover, sorry Avon!"
1,"I have a small rash problem on my shoulder area that is exacerbated by swimming  in a chlorinated public pool, so I was looking for a cream or lotion to mitigate the problem.  This not only did not help, but it made the situation worse (mostly the rash started itching even more).  However, it does have a pleasant scent, and, at least for my hands, it is a nice cream.  It comes in a nice dark round jar with a good lid, but you don't get much (4 fl. ounces) for the price.  It does have kind of a greasy feel to it  and it doesn't rub easily into the skin (or be easily absorbed by my skin). I finally found a great product  that works on my shoulder rash; it is called  Renew.  Check it out.  Great stuff!"
1,"Electronics hobbyists, beware...Read on for more.I know that this is an oldie and a well-loved cologne, but I absolutely could not stand it. Personally, it would be a 1.5 star rating out of 5. But since I will factor in others' opinions about it, I will give it a neutral 3.I'm a 21 year old college student. I'm quite mature (I've been told) for my age, and I think my colognes tend to reflect it. I have only started getting into colognes recently, so I do not have the best nose. I can't tell you what notes are in each colognes, or what the base is of each one. But I do know what smells good to me and what doesn't. I've currently got UR by Usher, Chrome, Burberry London, 1 million, Le Male, Armani Code, and Blvgari Black in my regular rotation/collection.I tried this cologne the other day, and my initial impression was that it was very strong. The alcohol content of this cologne must be much higher than comparable EDTs. The only one I have smelled with more alcohol has been Nautica Blue. The alcohol overpowers the top notes.The dry-down is where it gets interesting. I can swear that Hugo smells exactly like breathing in the saccharin-sweet fumes from using rosin-core 60/40 lead solder while chewing 2-hour-old spearmint gum. It's uncanny. And it's not just my skin type. I let several friends and family members borrow it, and I smelled exactly the same thing on them. Soldering fumes and gum. I did notice that, for my friends and family that have never soldered anything before, they found this scent to be quite pleasant. However, anyone I knew that had soldered anything before or has been around someone else soldering knew the smell without me having to tell them anything.I haven't ruled out the possibility that I got a bad bottle/batch. I will certainly give it another try if I see it in a dept store. So although this is a classic frag, beware. Try it out before you buy it. Especially if you've ever soldered anything before and you didn't enjoy the fumes. It's definitely a unique scent."
1,"This is a beautiful color! It wears smoothly and I love how it looks, especially with a little bit of Turkish Delight lipgloss on top of it. :)  A beautiful pink color for any color of skin."
1,"I've used this product, and the plain, non-grapefruit smelling kind, on and off since Junior High. I have never had super bad body acne but every once and awhile (especially when I'm more active or playing sports) I'll have issues on my back between the shoulder blades where a sweaty sports bra rests. This soap keeps me in check. Squish some onto a back scrubbing sponge and go for it. The grapefruit smell is also nice."
0,"I really hoped this would have worked, but unfortunately it was a let down. I have mildly curly and thick hair (but not coarse). I straighten my hair almost daily. I tried all the tools and still hated it! It doesn't even get hot, even when left for about 10 minutes. The straightener SUCKS! The crimper is even worse...no matter how long you hold it, how small the section of hair, or even the amount of hairspray put in before using it....it wouldn't do the job...just wave it the tiniest....making it look like my natural hair anyway. The curlers aren't impressing either. Seriously, I'm better off using my mother's hair tools from the 80s.....I would throw this thing out, but my mother bought me this for Christmas only a couple months ago."
1,"My dog has really sensitive skin, so I did a lot of research before settling on Buddy Wash. I could not be happier. The wash is a combined shampoo conditioner. It smells nice and is not overpowering and more importantly it does not hurt his skin. It makes his coat shinier and he has a nice hint of lavender for days. I think the price and value is spot on and you only have to use a small amount per shampoo (my dog is only 17lbs so please keep that in mind). I also really appreciated that the item came shipped in a sealed ziploc like plastic bag. I have tried a lot of other &#34;natural&#34; based shampoos but this is hands down my favorite so far."
1,"My skin is pretty oily and the pores are larger than I'd like. After using this cleanser for 3 months or so, I do notice a difference.Texture was what I picked up on the first time I used it. It is pretty thick, and the beads are definitely micro. It didn't feel real grainy, which I liked. A little goes a long way, and since this tube is so big it should last a while. I haven't even used a quarter of mine yet.I use this along with Origins Zero Oil Moisturizer and Origins Clear Improvements Charcoal Mask. I found them to be pretty effective at making my pores look smaller, cleaner and less overall oil production. It has a really good price point. Many a department store cleansers can cost 3-4X as much.It does work over time, so don't expect to see much difference in the beginning. I will buy it again and continue my routine. I've seen good improvement in the last few months."
0,"I wanted to switch to natural products so I tried Burt's Bees.  I'm 24 and  haven't had pimples since middle school, but when  I started using this a month ago my face popped up with pimples.  Most of them have cleared up but the breakouts left marks and discoloration on the side of my face.  My face was smoothe and pimple free; I never had to use powder or foundation.  Now, I have to use concealer and pray these marks fade away.  Using this product was the worst decision I ever made.  To BB's credit, when I called up to complain on their customer service line, I was refunded the amount."
1,I've been using this product for years.  They use high quality ingredients that don't dry or tighten your skin.  The entire line of Earth Science products are well worth using.
1,"I curl my hair pretty frequently, I'm a fan of Old Hollywood style and have been on the lookout for a good pair of rollers for ages. I was hesitant to get Conair ones because most of my other cheaper hair supplies have been disappointing, but I read some good reviews and decided to go for it.So glad I did! These rollers are great, they get super hot and retain heat for forever. I have really thick heavy hair, but letting these rollers cool while in my hair ensures I have bouncy awesome curls for DAYS. Love them!"
1,"As I am approaching 40, I noticed my face sagging and wanted to derail it. I ordered this device from QVC and have been using it twice a day for a minimum of two minutes for the past year and love it. I have not had problems with lines. My jaw line has improved considerably, my cheekbones have risen and my overall muscle tone in my face has improved. I am an addict!"
1,"I suffer from spurs or pointed sides on the bones of my two small toes on each foot (little toe and next one to it) and get soft corns. For those who do not know what soft corns are, believe me, you DON'T want them! The pain from them is excruciating.Having worked in the printing industry all my life, standing on my feet for up to 18 hours a day, this of course was exacerbated. Some years ago I discovered these little ""babies"" and believe me, they are wonderful! They are soft and so they do not feel like you have something stuffed between your toes, and they are also washable whereas the sponge or fabric ones are not.Even though I am now retired and do not have to stand as I used to, I still keep these on hand for the times when I have been out all day walking or shopping for ""wonderful"" quick relief from the unbelievable pain that comes from my toes rubbing.I have never had a problem with them ""coming apart"" or ""flaking"" as other(s) here complain about....wondering if perhaps they are not washing them (which I cannot imagine) or something.They're inexpensive, and last for about 2 months, which certainly is worth their ""having around"" when you NEED them!Once you've tried these, I guarantee that you will want them on hand.~operabruin"
1,"I have been dyeing my hair various shades of brown and red for years and usually pick great colors. I have a medium mousy brown naturally.  I decided to get an early start on my darker ""fall look"" by changing my very light brown and blondish tipped hair to a light to medium chocolate brown with slight golden hints (as pictured). I hoped it would look closer to my natural color..but with more depth. And well, this dye turned it very dark brown, nearly black at the ends. I hope it fades soon. I have to say, it doesn't look so bad, I had black hair for years in college. It was a bit of a shock and wish I had read reviews on it before purchasing in the store! I gave three stars because I'm remaining optimistic that it will fade a bit!"
1,"Instead of using nail corrector pens, I am now using these to clean up cuticles and other nail polish mistakes. They don't shed fibers all over the place, hold their shape well, and are all around a good product I will purchase again in the future."
1,This product keeps my skin feeling refreshed and keeps my complexion fairly clean. It is light enough to use everyday!I had light acne and did not want to use harsh acne medication and products so I had to look for an alternative.I was a little skeptical at first since this product didn't offer much in the first couple of uses but it seemed to keep my skin beautiful and clear!I highly recommend this product because of it's price-value and quality.Price: 5/5Everyday use: 5/5Quality: 5/5Keeping you beautiful: 100/5
1,"A good mask and i can feel it cleaning my pores and makes my skin feel really soft, also really helps control my normal/oily skin during the summer months. The only negative is it doesn't help acne that much and it burns around my nose really bad. I don't recommend this to people with sensitive skin."
1,"This product works as well as people say it does. excellent for very dry hair. Restores the moisture and life in your hair. Mine hair is heat and chemically damages, but this product really made a difference after using it only twice. It's now part of my routine."
1,The best lotion you can buy and very good for you skin and won't break you out! Love it very much!
0,After using this I started developing little red pimple like bumps on wherever I used it. I gave it away to my sister I'll just stick with CeraVe SA it's a better lotion.
0,"Frownies, I learned after receiving them are ADHESIVE PAPER TAPE. You can purchase an entire ROLL of this at a local art supply or home depot store for 4 dollars. Frownies are perforated into triangles, but have extremely sharp edges that have to be trimmed with scissors or you will develop NEW lines. After &#34;activating the glue&#34; with water, you stick them on your face and it keeps you from making facial expressions. It DOES NOT remove the lines on your face. Now this does over time help with the 11's as the less you furrow, the less your lines will deepen. However, with this company, I informed them that the stupid tape wasnt even sticking (falling off after a few minutes, I believe it was simply a defective batch of tape) but they advised me to buy a &#34;special activation spray, made just for frownies&#34; - Which I did. After getting this 10 dollar bottle of scented WATER, of course, there was no change. They didn't want to give me a refund because it was opened, and I spent entirely too much time going back and forth with their rude customer service MEN who knew zip about the product much less about a womans facial lines. After 20 or so emails, they did finally agree to let me return the &#34;magical&#34; tape, but I would have to pay the return shipping and there's wouldn't guarantee they'd refund the money anyways. Needless to say, the company sucks and so do the frownies. I did go to Michaels and buy some adhesive paper tape and with regular water, it works fine! Since you'll have to trim the sharp edges yourself anyway, I would recommend you get the 4 dollar 30 foot roll of tape and you can customize the sizes for more specific to your face coverage and not have to deal with these clowns. Yes, they are clowns. Amazon should have vetted these yokels."
1,"i love it, i used other gels that cause dandruff, but this didn't, really good gel, and i totally recommend it."
1,I bought 2 of these conair instant heat curling irons and I love them both. I got one in 1 inch and another in 3/4 inch. The iron does have ajustable heating temperature from 1-25 and fast turbo heating. They heated up nice and hot really fast.  They made shiny lovely bouncy curls in my hair. The iron has weight to it and not flimsy at all. This iron is affordable and gets the job done so I highly recommend it.
1,"If you like a subtle, clean fragrance, especially for summer, Amazing Grace is for you. And the other great thing about it is that a little goes a looooong way, so this 16 oz. bottle will probably last a good long while, and at Amazon's great price, what's not to love? Plus this is the greatest shampoo ever, I can't believe how clean and bouncy my hair is. My favorite hair stylist even said something about how great my hair was looking. In my experience, a combined shower gel/shampoo type product usually isn't such a good shampoo, but Philosophy in its usual style managed to make a product that treats both your hair and your skin equally well. Love this product! And thanks, Amazon, for carrying the Philosophy line."
1,"My daughter says I smell like candy when I wear this, it's soft yet sexy smell, lasts a long time on my skin. Tones of berries, with a hint of vanilla and a sexy musk"
1,started using it right away. takes a few times to use on one pimple to get rid of it but works
1,"I bought this for my hair, and I love it. It makes my scalp feel great. However, I found another use. My husband loves back scratches and I hate giving them. Dead skin under my nails creeps me out. This brush is perfect for scratching. So I have two brushes now - one for my hair and one for him."
0,"I don't know why people use crap like this.It is full of chemicals that I would not put on my body because those chemicals you put ON your body go into your body.So what does one use instead?Well just about EVERY brand you can buy online or at the drugstore uses bad ingredients.So it's better to use natural stuff like:shea butterCoastal Scents Unrefined Shea Butter, 16 Ouncejojoba oilorganic coconut oilYou can easily mix this stuff together and make your own 100% natural and CHEAPER creams and oils for your face and body and not risk getting cancer from all those bad chemicals.Check out this info:beautyoffood.com/?hop=nfopowerUnfortunately the ""beauty industry"" will put any crap into a product if it will make your skin look or feel better but they don't give a dang about how it might affect your overall health.Don't be a chump, use your own cheaper better creams and oils - some stuff like cucumbers which you can rub on your face, are So cheap and work better than anything!"
1,"It works just as well for a hair shampoo amd body wash.If you like a soothing powdery smell,this is a great product."
1,"Very nice nude-pink color. Subtle, sophisticated color. Easy to apply, I highly recommend it if you like nude tones.Might need to get an extra bottle in case they discontinue it."
1,Can't beat OPI!  This is a pretty color with a subtle shimmer.  Great for all seasons and I think it goes well on all skin tones.  Love this color!
1,I have used this product for several years. Along the way I have tried other products but none moisturize as good as this one. Ever since I have started using this my skin is softer and smoother. It works no matter what phase (dry/oily) my skin is going through.
1,I love this hot air brush.  I have course wiry hair and this is the only brush that will tame it and make it look good.  I have two of these brushes in case one goes belly up.
1,Great product but came a shade darker than I anticipated.. Would be good for a spring or summer look but Not for winter. =/
1,I actualy noticed more ripping of my hair with detangeling combs than i have with using a brush. But for people to like the combs better this is a pretty nice cheap one.
0,"I bought this to try because the American (blue bottle) version was not available for a time. It smells like the anti-itch animal shampoo we used for our dog and was very very watery.Stick with the blue bottle US version of Nizoral. It is a thicker consistency and while it doesn't smell wonderful, it smells much better than this stuff."
1,"The tops of my hands suffer with multiple hand washings per day. They get so dry that they crack over the knuckles and none of the creams my dermatologist suggested helped much.  They were thick and oily, but they didn't seem to penetrate deeply enough to help. They simply rubbed off and my chapped knuckles were just as dry underneath.Udderly smooth penetrates really well. It penetrates fully in just a few seconds, even when you apply a thick layer. It dries to a silky finish rather than a greasy one or a silicone-coated sticky feeling (like ""Working Hands"" does).The only thing I don't like is the fragrance, which is like baby powder, but fairly strong. It would be better unscented, for sure. When I want fragrance, I use my perfume - and I prefer my lotion not to interfere with the scent."
1,"I used to spend a fortune on salon brand shampoos and conditioners, thinking they were much better for my hair than the ""grocery store"" brands.  Then when traveling and not being able to find my shampoo in an ""under 4 oz."" size that I could carry on the plane I decided to wait until I reached my destination to buy some shampoo.  I bought this one because I like the name brand that it is comparable to, but also because it was cheap and I wouldn't feel bad about leaving a good portion of it behind at the end of the trip.  (I gave the remaining shampoo to the person at the hotel front desk).I was so surprised to find that this shampoo left my hair just as soft and manageable as the more expensive brand.  I couldn't tell the difference!  Still, I thought maybe it was just the difference in water or the weather at the place I was staying on the trip.  I bought the shampoo again at home when I ran out of my salon brand and found that it performed just as well with the local water, weather, etc.  That was 4 years ago and I have been using Suave shampoos and conditioners ever since.  I haven't found a single one that I don't like and I've saved a bundle on shampoos and conditioners.  Two thumbs up for this product!"
1,"I used to use a mug for my wet shaving, but the mug was too deep so it was hard to swirl my brush. I read good reviews on this bowl and noticed it was not too deep. I am glad I bought it because it makes lathering alot easier than with a mug. I don't use the lid at all, so thats not helpful for me, but overall it is a nice product."
1,"love this alot ,I use this in the morning and micro sculpting at night my skin stays soft all through the winter and no drying!"
1,Love Love Love.  I use to have one of these for years and loved it.  Saved my hair from bad heat damage.  Love that I have another one and I use it every day.  Thank you for the fast shipping and great price.
1,"Do you like Lipstick? But, do you find that your lipstick makes your lips dry, chapped, or crave Doritos? Well, Revlon Superlustrous is for you! It almost has a balm feel, and is highly pigmented (it only takes one ""coat""). I like this color because it kind of has that Minaj-esque pop of pink but very much subdued and casual Friday appropriate."
1,this lil thing is very handy for holding all of my bathroom supplies. the size is what i need for my stuff.
1,"I bought this product as a dry shampoo alternative. I felt that all the dry shampoos I've tried have left my brunette hair dry and powdery looking, so I thought I'd try this instead. I don't like to wash and style my hair every day because it leads to damage, so I try to go every other.First off - the smell was not appealing to me, so I went ahead and added some drops ofNOW Foods Lavender Oil, 2 ounce. Much better - it seemed to completely cover the original fragrance. Then, with my back towards the shower, I lean backwards and squirt the product along my scalp from top to bottom. I do this in sections; maybe 5 times total. It is very runny, so drips are a possibility. After this, I rub it into my hair and put a towel on my head as I finish getting ready. I don't completely saturate my hair - I mostly just focus on the root area where I get oily on day 2. I then proceed to blow-dry and style as usual.My first reaction was that my hair seems fuller using this method. I have more lift at the roots. It smells nice, and looks alright in the beginning. By the end of the day, not so much. This is a good method for me to look presentable on day 2 of not shampooing - but it is not something I would do when trying to look my best. My hair definitely doesn't have the movement, feel, or smell of freshly washed hair. I can't imagine using this for two or more days in a row.The ingredients are also a bit suspect - deionized water, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, propylene glycol, cocamidopropyl betaine, diazolidinyl urea, methylparablen, propylparaben, fragrance and citric acid. Basically a slew of chemicals."
1,"I like this shampoo for my hair. It leaves it super clean although it also makes it harder to detangle. The reason I didn't rate this with 5 stars is that maybe I haven't seen very dramatic results. Yes my scalp has less buildup, but it has not vanished completely. It's great that it comes without fragrance, and it does smell nice anyway."
1,"After hearing all the great reviews about Burt's Bees and their ""fantastic"" lip balm, I was curious enough to buy several of their products to try.  I purchased three of the lip shimmers, one in Rhubarb, Champagne, and Nutmeg.First off, the Rhubarb color is, as a prior reviewer mentioned, a little intense.  It is slightly deeper than a bright fuschia, once applied.  After application, it has a very cooling peppermint feel to it.  The feeling reminded me of the ""Softlips"" brand.  The ""zing"" does last for awhile and while I enjoy it, others may not (It's like forgetting to wipe Listerine off of your lips).  I also like the fact that the lip shimmers  are sheer and 100% natural.  It has some mica in it to give it a pleasingly soft (almost imperceptible) shimmer.Things I did not like about the product:  While it seemed to glide on smoothly, upon further inspection, I noticed that the color tended to settle a bit too heavily into the lip creases.  It also accented dry patches all over my lips that I didn't know I had - I applied my regular lipstick (Lancome Rouge Sensation/Dior Addict Lipstick) to one half and Lip Shine to the other half and inspected it.  With the Lip Shine, I got patchiness.  On the lipstick side, no patches.  I have never seen ""patchiness"" like this.  But I've got an entire stick to get through now, so I guess it's going in the purse 'till it's done or I lose it.Verdict?  It's a decent way to touch up color if your normal stuff wears off, but I probably wouldn't purchase it again.  I think I'll try a different brand, such as Shea Terra Organics or Beesworks next time."
1,"Can't be wrong to purchase this size toner. More efficient on cost. When I use it, I just pour it to lil (travel) bottle ."
1,This is the only product I use for aftercare of my piercings! It's so much easier than making it yourself! Well worth the price!
1,"This is a great - I call it curling iron.  Very high quality, and handsome also.  I recommend this product.  DAME HILDA"
1,"This product is very gentle on the skin. I was so pleased with the fact that you only need a little and it goes a long way. I like the smell, it is not heavy and is easy to enjoy. I could see myself buying more."
1,I use it regularly and have no complaints. Remember a little goes a long way in coverage!A 3.4 oz tube lasts me over a month!
1,Maybe my hair is too thick or something it doesn't really work on me. It's just thinner than normal towel so it's easier to wrap my hair. just OK.
1,"This is one of the best face scrubs overall and the best one offered by Burt's Bees.It does smell like a blend of pumpkin pie spices and citrus but everyone in our family loves it!I laughed at the reviews that said it was too pasty or hard because although the jar is small it is filled with a more concentrated paste that, when some is scooped out and mixed with a few drops of water becomes a more spreadable product - AND THE DIRECTIONS TELL YOU THAT IF YOU READ THEM.We use a small plastic spatula to scoop into the palm of the hand and mix just a few drops in to form a spreadable paste. Then we apply to the face like a mask and walk around for 10-15 minutes smelling the yummy citrus spice bouquet and then either remove with a moist wash cloth or can be done right before a shower and can be scrubed off in the shower.Leaves skin smooth and soft and ready to soak up whatever fabulous moisturizer you have waiting!My only beef is that I prefer products do not come in jars due to a higher cross contamination potential but due to the thick paste it probably makes more sense, but then, probably most people do not have skin care spatulas handy like we did so I bet a lot of people are dipping their germy fingers right into the jar. A small plastic scooper added to the box would be a plus."
1,"It's a light pink with silver shimmer. It's very office safe but the shimmer gives it something special. The formula is a little thin, I use 3 coats. It's beautiful, very flattering on my pale skin & extremely delicate."
0,"It was a cute idea for travel, but for my purposes, it had too few rollers and never quite got hot enough. I ended up buying and keeping the Conair Compact Hairsetter (in blue); it's a little clunkier to travel with but delivers much better results and has the right number of rollers."
1,"I like to start with a facial wash, then I use this mask, and finish off with moisturizer.I think this has to be my favorite mask so far.My skin feels so soft and I love how it's a peel mask, it makes the clean up so much easier."
1,"This cream has virtually halted the itching of my eczema prone skin in its tracks. It is the best product that I have ever used to combat the symptoms of eczema (I have tried dozens, literally)."
1,This nail thinner is worth its price in gold. Its a great addition to anyone who loves nail polishes and want to keep them in excellent condition for as long  as you owned them.
1,"I never thought I would give 5 stars to something that tastes so nasty, but it works.I bit my nails for years and years, but finally kicked the habit when I became a nurse and realized how disgusting a person's hands can be. Unfortunately, I have been stressed lately and started biting again. It's such a gross habit, and I knew I had to quit again. But I just couldn't.In stepped Mavala. It is so disturbingly gross that I have to be careful even when eating things with my fingers to ensure I don't accidentally get any in my mouth. You do get *slightly* used to the taste, but not enough to allow you to want to purposefully put your fingers in your mouth.Works on pets, too! lol. My brother's dogs kept chewing on a corner of a hammock stand. I slathered the stuff on it and the chewing stopped right away. Just a thought."
1,This product is not heavy and absorbs quickly into the skin - with no oily reside.  After only a couple of weeks I can see a major difference!
1,"I've been using this foundation now for a couple of years.  I love that it is all natural with nothing harmful in it.  I love the coverage. The color for me is perfect.  I've been a user of Bobbi Brown, Lancome, Estee Lauder foundations etc through the years but on finding out about all they have in them searched for alternatives.  Since using this - I can easily say this is just as good as any of the best out there but this leads the way because it is also safe.  I highly recommend it and will continue to order it, it's a great foundation!  Great company too."
1,"If you aren't familiar with Dr. Bronner's soap, you're missing out on a natural, effective all-purpose cleaning product.  I use it to wash my face, body, clothes, dishes, and countertops.  I recommend buying a smaller size along with the gallon so you can refill it and easily move it from room to room - much easier than lugging around that heavy gallon bottle.  The lavender scent is evident, but not overpowering.  It leaves behind a pleasant relaxing fragrance - all natural of course.  A little goes a long way - I dilute it heavily when cleaning the kitchen or bathroom.  While Dr. Bronner's Peppermint soap is my favorite of the line, the lavender is a close second."
1,"Essie is 1 of 3 top nail lacquers I prefer, the colors are endless and the coverage is impeccable with a 4 step polish manicure, this color looks good on anyone and even on toes."
1,"When I am in the mood, I mix one hot oil treatment tube with an equal amount of olive oil and some Aussie three minute miracle deep conditioner. Then, I heat it just a tad in the microwave for an intensive ""conditioning pack"" treatment.Once you have this all on your hair, you cover it up and then you can use a blowdryer to heat up your hair to let it all absorb nicely.Or, as I recently found out, you can just go get the Frizz-Ease Smooth Start Shampoo and the Defrizzing Conditioner and you will be thanking me for telling you about it! ;)Realistically, you need both. You need the deep conditioning treatments and the daily shampoo/conditioner miracle of Frizz-Ease. Bless them.~The Rebecca Review"
0,"I ordered a handful of different creams to experiment with, and this is the one that I've found least compelling. I've actually gotten up from bed to wash it off as it was burning me. Maybe--- maybe the burning/stinging is somehow a good thing, but it made me nervous (and, of course, hurt a bit!). I've read that retinol is not suggested for people under 40 or maybe 45 and maybe it's just a mismatch between me and the product. Hence, why I was experimenting!"
1,"I have severe dry skin, especially in the winter months, that affects my elbows and knees.  After following the directions, and about 2 to 3 days, my skin is soft and has that natural color.  There is a light fragrance so it doesn't make one have an overpowering scent.  The lotion is soft and not 'oily'.  It works better than other more expensive premium lotion out there.This lotion is really worth a try."
1,Absolutely love this brush!!! Save my hairs and make them SOOO soft. Best brush I have ever used. Way better than the other ones which look similar!
1,"I bought this at Target after seeing my sister using a similar type of hot air brush. I had never seen one before but knew instantly I needed to try one. I chose this one because Target had limited options and this one came with two sizes of brushes.I have very fine shoulder length hair. The directions suggested I use the smaller size brush. I dry my hair with my normal hair dryer until it is just little damp, about 80% dry. (I know I could use the attachment for drying but I don't want to burn the thing out by using it on the ""high"" speed for a long time. Plus changing attachments was more difficult than it should be. Mine doesn't pull apart easily.)Anyway, I comb the tangles out and add a heat protector cream and then use the Hot Air Dryer. I first part my hair into six sections then I finish drying it on the ""low"" speed and then curl the ends  by starting out at ""low"". I then blast it on ""high"" for a couple seconds and then blast it with ""cool"" for a couple seconds. I turn it off before letting the curl out. This works really well and doesn't fry my hair.Despite everything I've heard/read about the Ionic part supposedly cutting down on the frizz I have not found that to be true compared to my regular hair dryer. I just use coconut oil to smooth the fly-aways after I am done.As for the longevity of this product, if it lasts even six months of daily use I could consider it a great achievement. If you use it on the ""high"" setting often then it will probably burn out real quick. I turn mine off in between each section of hair I dry just to give a couple seconds to rest. You have to take the product for what it is and not expect it to be a hair dryer. It isn't.I would suggest pulling any hair in the brush out of it before you use it (not after or you will get burned!). If you let hair build up in the brush it will burn out. I also brush my hair well before using it and I usually only have to pull out one or two strands the next day.I took off one star only because the attachments don't change out easily. It could be just mine though."
1,"Have used much of this soap in the past, and enjoy using it.  Unique smell but no lingering after odor.  Definitely different."
1,"I am almost 50 and I use this... for me it doesn't leave my skin oily and does seem to help with wrinkles, though I use multiple products. It is very lightweight, which I like and doesn't feel heavy on my face or make my face shiny."
1,"I think this will be one I will re-buy for years.  I tried it at the salon first (a good way to test drive if you're getting a manicure anyway) and got so many compliments on the color that I bought it.  Great on it's own or as a base for designs, as it's got a lot of blue/pink/mauve to it so almost anything goes.  If you want your nails noticed without going completely off the wall, this color will do it for you.Great durability, i use base coat, 2 coats of color and seche vite top coat (re applied every 2 days) and i get a good 7 days out of my manicure, no problem (actually, i usually get more, as i'll crackle it or stamp on it after 5-7 days and keep that on for 3-4 days)"
1,"I was very happy to purchase this zinc cream for my occasional acne. I don't see it making a huge difference but it is tinted which I didn't know and anything that sort of works and doesn't dry my skin out is fine with me, then again, it doesn't cover that well either! It doesn't hurt my skin and who knows, maybe it will help down the line. It's a lot of product for the price, so I'll keep using this up."
1,"My case is extremely dry, sensitive, and has multiple allergies.  I have a terrible time finding body care products that work well without irritating my skin.  Neutrogena comes through again!  This oil smells great (light but pleasant) and has a very light texture.  It does not feel greasy at all.  It absorbs within a minute or two.  I haven't had any ""oil stains"" on clothes or sheets like I used to get when I used pure coconut oil.  I have never found any other oil or lotion that moisturizes better.  As a side note, if you have keratosis pilaris (those little red chicken skin bumps on your arms or thighs) this is a miracle worker!  Within a few weeks, my skin looks dramatically better."
1,"This product makes my face feel so super clean!  I have super sensitive skin and this cleans perfectly. Many other products I have used in the past (Netrogena and even Aveeno)  meant clean skin equalled redness and irritation,  If that sounds like you, then GET THIS!  You will be amazed at how much cleaner (and for longer) your skin will feel!  I have been using this product since 2004, and will as long as I can keep getting it.  Oh, and BTW Amazon's prices are much better than Philosophy's!  Thanks Amazon!"
1,"Beautiful hue, more cherry red than brick. Pricey for lipstick. Nars is a great product, if you need to self-indulge. Lipstick stays put, not drying like other brands. I love wearing red lipstick--this is definitely a bold and timeless look if that's what you're trying to achieve. Definite statement maker."
1,"It's okay, but perhaps the formula didn't work for me or something. If you don't put on enough layers and let the nails set, then they kind of dry out and even chip. Perhaps I should have a curing LED lamp or something. Essie, Julep and gel nail polishes seem to only work when you dry them in expensive curing LED lamps versus just drying them naturally. It's as if the polish is so rich it can't be dried normally and get a nice dry finish without it chipping, looking dried out, etc."
1,"This review may be a bit premature but I've used BBB twice and it seems to have worked like magic. A few weeks after I received this I felt a sore spot under my skin, which is the sensation I get when a pimple or cyst is festering. I dabbed the sediment on the area and the next day, soreness gone and no redness (which is usually next), no nothing. Same good result twice in different locations. Sometimes these things will go away without erupting, so I cannot prove it was BBB.  I will see if these good results continue or if it was just coincidence. I can update the review later after more use. **Update:  It has been a while now and I have used BBB on a few pimples that appeared with little warning. Applied it at night and by morning blemish is just about gone. Hard to believe it works so well. I think it's great stuff. :)"
1,"I REALLY like this product.  It smells a lot like pumpkin pie but not as strong and I've never used a face cream that smells anything like this.  It's really dreamy, actually.  Much like holiday ""comfort food"" but for your face.  (It really does put you in a pleasant state of mind.)  And the consistency is very silky and well-blended yet a tad thick.  (This is NOT a product that you would copiously slather on.  Use sparingly.)  Even though it's thick (and probably should be a night cream instead), it is so creamy and smooth that it seeps into the skin quickly.  You just can't use a ton of it.This is really a dreamy product that I fell in love with instantly, mostly based on the smell and creamy consistency.  I use this withBurt's Bees Naturally Ageless Intensive Repairing Serum, 0.45 Fluid Ounces.  I put the serum on my clean face first and then follow it up with this day cr&egrave;me...then I'm done!  Super easy!  I can't give a testimonial on whether it's helped with wrinkles because their Burt's Bees Naturally Ageless Intensive Repairing Serum does plenty of that.  I just needed a ""follow-up"" cream for my very basic face care regimen and this cream is it!  It's a thousand times better than the other Burt's Bees day cream I used."
0,"gives the lips a bit tint, i dont like the strong smell though, smells like the lipsticks from the 80's./ not a lipstick, but this is a gloss with tint so dont misunderstood that, stick is hard, and dont glide easy,like an old stock,maybe it is. :/"
1,This is a great and gentle product. No alcohol!! It really helps to smooth and rebalance your skin. I will never use any drugstore toners again. This is the one you should use! It also smells beautifully and is very refreshing to use throughout the day.Not sure why the shipping jumped up so much. I remember it being prime not long ago.
1,"These are awesome!  Love them for facials, massages and make up applications.  They keep the hair out of the way without messing it up too badly!"
1,I have always purchased Spornette brushes if I have the option. This one is well madeand being that I have long hair the bristles brush through my hair just the way I like it.
1,"In the past I've purchased a ton of LUSH beauty products because they make them with lots of essential oils. What I've realized is that I can make some scented liquid soaps myself by using essential oils and this Jason's Body Wash. Simply put a combination of oils in a small plastic bottle and add in some body wash. Shake and use. Some of my favorite combinations are sweet orange, neroli and rose. I've also tried Ylang Ylang, Patchouli, Lotus and Sandalwood. I'm looking forward to trying out new combinations as I have a big collection of essential oils. I also like Balsam Fir Needle which is refreshing. I find the body wash works well with a body brush.~The Rebecca Review"
0,"I found that having to put the color boost in a week or 2 weeks after dying my hair was annoying.  I also found the instructions for the color boost to be confusing, since I had no idea what it was or how it worked.  It didn't seem to be any better than any other coloring I had used before, and, maybe, not as good.  Lastly, it LEFT STAINS ON MY PILLOWCASE!  There is now a section of my pillowcase that is stained with a brownish (Lighter than the color in my hair, thank God) area where my head had rested during sleep (and, yes, I rinsed it VERY well).  I have NEVER had a hair color leave color on my pillowcase before.  I was shocked to see it, and VERY annoyed.  I HAD a subscription for regular deliveries of this product, but I cancelled it.  I won't use it again."
1,"This stuff smells amazing! I'm totally addicted. If you use toner you have got to try this brand! It's alcohol free (so it doesn't dry my skin), Paraben-free, Propylene Glycol-free and used un-distilled Witch Hazel. And most of these ingredients are Organic. It's scent comes from natural rose water! Plus, all Thayers products are vegetarian and never tested on animals."
1,"I am very happy with this hair wrap. I don't know if it actually reduces my hair drying time. I just like the way it stays on my head so tight. I can get so much more done with wet hair than ever before. I can run up and down the stairs to the laundry room, brush my teeth, put on my makeup, drink my coffee. Could not do that with a regular towel wrapped around my head, that is for sure. I squirt some of my leave in conditioner into my hair before I wrap it (if I remember) and I like the way it feels when I finally take off the wrap. I might have to make this my standard girlfriend gift this holiday season."
1,"SMELLS SOOOO GOOD and works well what more could you want? I saw this on sale and since I love lavender scented ANYTHING I had to try it. Not only does it smell good, but it spreads well and I use it right after shaving my legs without ANY burning. I think its calming to the skin and a calming smell. TRY IT I dont think you'll be disapointed."
1,"I didn't even know a product like this existed until it popped up one day on Amazon. I didn't really know what I was going to use it for, but I wanted to give the idea a try. It turns out that now my thigh-high stockings stay up, and oh my gosh- even my below-ankle socks stay on all day! I didn't think that was possible! It's a lot more tricky to get a shirt or a bra-strap to stay up depending on the material and thickness, but it's possible. I love this product."
1,"My dermatologist recommended this for fading out dark spots on the face. Some call them age spots and some liver spots but it had the key ingredient in it he recommended. So far I see some fair results and to be fair it has only been a few days. Never had acne or facial break outs. Just tired of buying all of the different items and they do nothing for you, The price is good on Amazon compared to other stores."
1,"I've been using this cream since I was forty-four and I'm sixty now. I used to use it very steadily but now I take breaks from it. You do get immune to the cream after about a year. Finally it barely works and you have to take a break for a month. In any case, when you first use it it will make you feel really good, and will make you sleep like a baby, which is the best part of it. Those effects do wear off unfortunately. But I will say that I'm sixty and have no osteoporosis and my face isn't aging too badly, and I attribute that to the progesterone cream."
1,"I use this oil for baking and for making cleaning and beauty items.  It smells heavenly and, for the price, I don't have to be so conservative with it."
1,I use Olay Complete on my face in the morning and at night before bed. It makes my face feel so soft and smooth.
0,I read all the reviews and decided to try. It didn't make a difference for me. It didn't improve or dry out or change anything with my acne. It's like I rubbed lotion on. It does have a tint to it which made me look clown-like so I decided to only wear at night while home. This has worked for many and people have praised this but it just didn't work for me
1,This mask ALWAYS helps my skin clear up fast whenever I have a breakout. One of my favorite masks of all time.
1,"This is really good lotion for hairstylists ! It really soaks into the skin and keeps your hands soft. I mixed it with a little of this Victoria secret lotion , just a tad because that one is too perfumey so when I mix it with the skin trip it calms it down and makes it softer ,I will be ordering more when I run out I love it . The scent alone is good too tho. I love coconut I was just bored one day and decided to mix it :)"
1,"So i'm 24 with sensitive, dry, light-medium skin. Bare Minerals was my first and only foundation I've used. it covers my blotchy and red cheeks, freckles, blackheads, AND lasts all day (with the Mineral Veil)  Here's my daily routine that worked for me:-I wash my face + moisturize at night (if i do in the morning it gets dry and flaky)-in the morning, i use my Prime Time Primer, and leave on for a minute while doing other stuff-Then I use my Maximum Coverage Concealer Brush with my bisque concealer and put over any red areas-I then use that concealer brush with my BareMinerals Matte Medium-light foundation on my nose (the regular one made my face shiny)-Then i use my handy buki brush for putting my foundation all over-And finish off with the mineral veil with the same handy buki brush.Lasts all day (until night), and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, i would definitely recommend it."
1,I use this on my face every morning.  It does help with acne but it also leaves my face very tight and dry.  I also use this for bikini bumps/ingrown hairs and it helps.  I had previously purchased Thayer Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner and I think I like that better and will probably switch back.
1,"I feel my acne is based on high sugar consumption and using wrong products.I don't know why I ventured into liquid cleansers because those typically aren't the best for my skin.  Also, a certain moisturizer broke me out with big bumps.  Additionally, I was eating a bunch of chocolate and other junk food.  Tsk, tsk.SO!  I dumped the liquid cleansers, specific moisturizer and heavily decreased my sugar consumption.I added this soap for my cleanser & Yes to Carrots moisturizer.I can't tell you how quickly this soap cleared my skin.  Amazing!  I'm sure my change of habit/product use also helped!I've used this soap about 12 times now, and my face is 70% clearer than from 4-5 days ago.  Seriously!I REALLY encourage those who suffer from acne to give this a try.  I say, don't bother with the peroxides and acids.  Keep it simple and try to pinpoint other factors that may contribute to acne.This last breakout hurt because I'd JUST gotten my face back to normal after another bad breakout months before.  Back to square one, I thought!Believe me, I know how difficult, painful and annoying this all is.But hang in there.I hope this helps!Thanks!x"
1,"The description says they use a non-soap forumlation, but look at the list of ingredients: one of the first ingredients is sodium tallowate -- which is basically a fancy name for soap!"
1,"I bought this color because it looks gray in the bottle (and Essie even describes it as gray), but it changes from grayish blue to grayish purple to gray depending on the lighting.  A little disappointing because I've been dying to find a great gray but I'll have to keep on looking."
1,"The best lotion on this planet.  A nice thick lotion that absorbs quickly and keeps the skin soft for hours. Paraben free, the lavender scent is my favourite."
1,"This conditioner isn't just for dry, brittle hair, it's for anyone who wants luxuriously soft hair. You will find a big difference in the look and feel of your hair with this one. I've been using it for over half a decade now and absolutely swear by it."
1,"I was looking for a dual-purpose rose water and I have realized, after the fact, that what I really need is a true hydrosol. Since I read the consistently high ratings for this brand at the time, though, and the budget friendly price, I decided to go with this one. I received it yesterday and used it last night in my face cleaning routine. The smell is okay. Maybe I just don't like roses as much as the next person. It was by no means offensive, but I personally wouldn't want to wear a perfume that smelled like this. I transferred this into a fine-mist spray bottle and spritzed it on after cleaning my face and neck and applying Hyaluronic Acid, and before my moisturizer. Since I have several steps in fighting the melasma, wrinkles, and adult acne, my face gets dry by the time I'm ready to put on my moisturizer. I will definitely continue to use it, as it does seem to keep the dryness at bay while I go through my routine. It is refreshing on the skin and I had no negative reaction to it.For the dual-purpose part: I had Lasik eye surgery 10 years ago and I've been suffering from extremely dry eyes for about two years. I wanted something without all the synthetic ingredients that all the OTC drops have. Many people have commented that rose water drops are very good for dry eyes. Turns out, this rose water is just distilled water with rose essential oil added. I need to do some further research, but I don't think this is going to work. For skin moisturizing purposes, though, it's fits the bill."
1,I deal with cystic acne and I hated my trial and errors of finding a good night cream. This is amazing stuff. I never wake up with new pimples on my face and it keeps my face moisturized even though I live in a very dry house with the new central air system in the house. I love olay.
1,"I have long hair, so this just got tangled and didn't do much. So I gave it to my friend with shoulder length hair because I could see the potential. She has never been able to do her hair until now. She's been talking about how she finally has good hair for a month now! It's just a curing iron (with awesome heat settings) with combs coming out of it - simple but genius!"
1,"Reasonably priced, light, works well, you can turn off the heat so that it's just blowing room temperature air which is safer for your hair...got it for the GF who loves it.  Amazon's price is much better than anything I could find locally."
1,"It does work well. I have very fine hair but a TON of it, and as long as I work in relatively modest layers it grips all of the hair and doesn't outright make it frizzy. I docked 1 star because sometimes hair can get caught between the rubber handle and the actual brush, and also because its anti-static properties don't always seem to work. When they don't, it's VERY staticky.For what it's worth, I'm using this with theBaByliss Pro BABP2800 Porcelain Ceramic 2000-Watt Dryer, Black(which I love) andJohn Frieda Frizz-Ease Straight Fixation Smoothing Creme, 5 Ounce."
1,"I don't have severe huge white-head acne, but do have moderate acne where my face is pack-full of bumps everywhere. I have tried every. single. lotion/acne-clearer possibly available on the market from the time I was 13 (I am now 22). To make that search all the more difficult, I am incredibly SENSITIVE skin... the kind where I have to be careful to wash my bedsheets with odor-free detergent. Sometimes when putting on shirts (that I wash with a nicely scented detergent) if it touches the side of my face it begins to itch and then I have an allergic reaction in that very spot. I am *that* sensitive. Hence, most of the ""Guaranteed"" products out there made me face swell up like a red water-balloon literally (Proactiv).I don't know the technical term, but I suffer from a vicissitude of extremely dry & extremely oily skin. My chin and lower half of my cheeks and around my mouth get extremely dry, peel, itch, and then if I itch form red spots, etc. I stress all this as I find it EXTREMELY important when giving this product the review I'm going to give it.To not digress further, I went to my dermatologist and decided not to use Acutane due to the risks, and was put on Monodox ""as needed"". When I'm breaking out badly, I take one for 2-3 days consecutively and then stop for about a week and repeat the process. So, this is my explanation to explain my acne condition.As far as MOISTURIZER, I've been so desperate to find the right moisturizer that would help give me that 'soothing' feeling versus itching, stinging, or masking my face with oil. If it stung, it would end up itching after a while, and hence make my condition worse, not better. If it simply felt like a 'masked' feeling in the face, then it simply did absolutely nothing for me and didn't help the dryness at all.This is the ONE and ONLY topical product I have ever used that's helped me. Not only have I found the absolute perfect moisterizer, but for my personal skin condition, it truly does all it states. I *LOVE* the tingly clean feeling! It's like having mint on your face and walking outside on a cool, crisp morning. It has 0 oil. None. I leave it on for hours and it's perfect. The best thing is that it somehow doesn't irritate my capricious face. I was fed up with my face and bought this on a whim. For the first time in my life, I reached for the save.I wish I could give it more than just 5 stars.  Very happy customer!"
1,"This is a great blush. It's a nice coral with a bit of a golden shine to it. I have fair skin, and it looks beautiful on me. Granted, if you don't care for shiny blush, then this might be a bit too flashy for you. I've read that this shade is universally flattering, and I can attest to it's lovely appearance on fair skin. Since it is so shiny, I recommend using a small amount of powder to begin with, and building up the blush from there."
0,"I decided to purchase this perfume based on the great reviews written but unfortunately, it is just was not what I was hoping for. The scent is so light, I feel as if I have to literally douse myself to smell anything.  I am suspecting that the item that I got is an old batch."
1,"I started using this creme about 6 weeks ago when I realized my 51-year old face needed more maintenance than it was getting.  I'm a Florida native with blonde hair and fair skin, so after a lifetime of sun my face had issues with some sunspots and a blotchy complexion.  I don't have problems with breakouts and only have a few faint ""laugh line"" wrinkles that I'm not worried about yet so this review won't address those issues.Since I can't afford constant facials I did some research and developed my own skin-care regimen.  Exfoliating dead skin cells is important so I decided an AHA product would be useful and ordered this creme and began using it most nights after washing my face.  I leave it on anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and then use an eye cream and moisturizing lotion.  I had some very mild tingling the first time I used it but nothing after that - if you have sensitive skin you might want to try the 8% version first and work your way up to the 10%.After doing this for about 6 weeks I can see a definite difference in my skin that can't be attributed to just the moisturizing.  The sunspots are still there (and always will be) but they are much, much lighter and less noticeable.  The blotchiness has evened out considerably and I feel like I could run up to the store without makeup and not worry about frightening small children.  [...smile...]  As I said, I don't have much in the way of wrinkles so I really haven't noticed whether this has done anything to clear them up or not.  I doubt any skin product will do anything for serious wrinkles anyway, and if that's your worry you'll need to look into some kind of doctor or aesthetician's services.I highly recommend this product for anybody who wants to get serious about taking care of their skin."
1,"The first 2 that I owned,  each lasted more than a couple of years; almost daily use on coarse, long (past below bra strap), not so straight hair. After the second one broke, I went back to the retail store and I couldn't find this particular one on the shelves!!! I was so looking forward to buying it a third time. I think I got my money's worth for each one. I did purchase a third, similar, Revlon RVTH500 Tourmaline Heat 1500W Hot Air Styler w/ Nano Ceramic, it works great. It's definitely not the same, but it does what I need it for. I haven't used it as much as the previous two, because I've been keeping my hair shorter."
1,"This stuff is a godsend. I am 28 and all of a sudden started getting small acne all over my forehead and lower cheek and mouth area. I tried and tried to get rid of it. Finally turning to Paula's Choice product reviews online (her skin care advice really helped me in my youth) I tried this Salicylic Acid treatment from Clean and Clear. SA is great for mature skin apparently and not as irritating as Glycol which had really turned me red and sensitive. After the first night I had already seen a huge improvement...color tone was calm and even zit drying up and disappearing, skin really smooth. I'm so glad I remembered her product review page because this really saved me and I didn't have to break the bank to do it. I'm going to switch my other products over to ones  she recommends in her Best Choice area. Remember that Salicylic like any exfoliation treatment can be a touch drying. I use it only at night and put a really good moisturizer on first then I spot treat or do thin layer across forehead, nose, cheeks. I also switched my moisturizer to her recommendation of Neutrogena Extra Gentle Facial Cleanser Lotion Fragrance Free in the morning and the extra gentle foaming one at night because it takes my makeup off well. Skin is getting so perfectly balanced now. Also make sure there is Nooo alcohol in your toner. That is one of the worst things you can do to your skin it dries skin out without exfoliation or any benefits and can actually cause the skin to breakout more. Toning with a cotton ball should be about wiping away dead skin cells and adding nourishment. Paula doesn't really have any good inexpensive recommendations since she is a bit indifferent to toners but I have found and love the Thayers Witch Hazel alcohol free Rose or Lavender toners.  Hope this helps you on your journey to clear glowing skin."
1,"This works pretty well, but I haven't used it very much at all because I don't have very long hair."
0,"I need a cream with a little more weight for my 3b porous hair. This also didn't stand up to humidity particularly well. And the scent, well....it reminded me of the 'setting lotion' my grandmother used with her little pink plastic curlers: kind of unpleasant & chemically. I like the convenient pump bottle, but that's about it."
1,I'm a major fan of body oil without the synthetic chemicals. I'm also a big fan of lemon scented products so I am doubly pleased with Burt's Bees. This stuff smell great and gives you very supple skin. Just apply a small amount on damp skin right after a shower and you won't be disappointed.
1,This is a good brush. I only use this brush with my hair wet and with lots of conditioner. I don't brush my hair when it's dry. Great for my curly hair!
1,Only use YSL mascara and lip stain.  Best on the market in my opinion and love the tie dye nail polish if I could find it.  My grand daughter loves it always sold out.
1,I have been a user of the Olay Regenerist line for years.  I am 50 and people say I look early 30's.  I will keep using this product.
1,I've been using this product for years. I use it under a moisturizer morning and night. I'm 58 and my skin isn't wrinkly at all. I'm sure this serum has helped. I use other Olay products as well and highly recommend them.
1,Great product! It's the Second time getting this and my skin looks amazing. I'll get this product again in the future.
1,I love this. I used to over in over color my hair blonde from Loreal and thena toner. omy it costs alot. I tried ash blonde and got purple tones.. so one day I waslike ok try this.. I am amzed. My hair is a light diamond blonde it is gorgous.I use the loreal shimmer blonde shampoo and cond. with this and wow so pretty.The color lasts me three weeks and feels and looks great. I also use a silk drops to makeit soft. It is nice. thanks..
1,"I got this compact hair dryer to replace the same model, which I'd had for a decade or two but the cord started to wear. I found my old one to be very reliable and with a surprisingly strong air flow for the compact size of the dryer. I'd taken it on several dozen trips and used it at home often as well. This new one seems to be of equally good quality and has all the features I'd liked on my old one. I was so glad Conair still makes it!"
0,I normally don't go with Frownies I go with another brand...well on the other brand I saw so many people had stated that Frownies worked better. So I decided to go with the Frownies this time. All I can say is I am disappointed with these...they didn't stick and no one had mentioned that these are just pieces of thick cardboard with a slightly sticky side. In the directions it basically says you need to buy more creams and lotions just to get these to stick on your face. In the description it seemed like they just stuck by themselves and were comfortable but absolutely not. if these did actually work I wouldn't be able to sleep with a hard piece of cardboard on my face. Im extremely disappointed with these and will more than likely never buy these again :/
1,Its flexible and large and has a loop to hang this comb on a hook. Cheap and a great buy.
1,"After using this for a week or two, I noticed some improvement in my &#34;backne&#34;. Its not great, but it still is a good cleanser for your back and it helps enough for the price I paid."
1,"I purchased 2 shades, (creme cafe, and golden beige). My complexion is olive , medium tan. These colors are very similar, but the creme cafe was a tad deeper in color. A perfect match for me. The creme cafe feels like it has grit in the foundation, almost sandy.. but after smoothing it on, the grit dissapears. It has a slight painty smell to it. The other color is nearly odorless, and with no grit. Both containers were unsealed, and the original stickers were obviously scraped off. (Likely the clearence stickers). They didnt however, appear used. The containers were full and there was no excess makeup on the inside of the lids. the cost of these shades vary, but I got 2 for no more than $9.00! Way better than drugstore prices. The finish of this makeup is somewhat dewy, a healthy looking glow. If you have oily or combo skin, like me, you will want to wash, then tone, then prime your face before applying this, then follow with a powder in order to get a shine free look."
1,"Its good, and leaves hair soft, but Morrocan Oil for me is much better. bought 2 because my sister does not like Morrocan, prefers this one. so, each of us have different opinions."
1,"The picture depicts the color pretty accurately.  It's OPI, so that's self-explanatory. Try it, you may like it.It goes on smoothly, covers nicely with two coats. It's a combo of two colors. In low light it appears as a rich dark matte burgundy,almost black, but when light hits it, it shows a slight glisten of subtle glitter, a bit of surprise. Very nice, complimentary."
1,I use it on my face. It's got all the ingredients of thicker heavier face creams in a nice light lotion. I frequently add a pump or two of Jason Ester C Serum for a little more wrinkle fighting power. You'll enjoy this lotion.
1,This is great for preventing dog-butt-looking hair on my husband's curly head. I mean it gets rid of the dry poof frizzies.
1,"I always go back to this mascara. I love the look it gives. Very soft and fluttery, my lashes but x10 better and not fake and clumpy looking like other mascaras. No gross smell either and I have no problems with flaking or smudging, lasts all day. I also have the waterproof version and it works but smells. Love both. Will always repurchase."
1,"I enjoy using this product....its herbal like, doesn't smell all ""sweet"" and stuff, but it does the job. After the first wash, my skin looks clearer and feels cleaner. I will also mix it with corn meal as a facial or body scrub."
1,L'oreal has a great product line. Pick the shade closer to your skin tone and you will not be disappointed. I am in my fifty's and love anything that will enhance my skin naturally.
1,Enough said. You don't use a product that you can only buy via mail-order for 25 years if you don't love it.
1,Moisturizing works well and its not irritating but I don't like using this because it leaves a white residue on my face.
1,"I ended up buying this by accident without realizing it was tinted. I was very dismayed the first time I used it, especially because it is SO dark & makeup looking.**THEN I tried putting on my other moisturizer (Aveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer spf 15) before, & only dabbed the Tinted Moisturizer on after. It works perfectly! With the combination of the two moisturizes (the spf 30 being thicker) my skin is so soft & moisturized! I especially love how my skin has the very subtle, polished look usually only accomplished with makeup. But since I hate makeup this is much better & actually healthy for my skin.I have very sensitive skin but using only these two products (plus Aveeno Ultra-Calming Moisturizing Cream Cleanser every morning & night) my skin is smooth & soft.QUESTION: Since it's winter & so dry I've even started using the moisturizers at night which my skin seems to really like. But I wanted to try an actual night moisturizer (preferably Aveeno since my skin seems to really like it).Does anyone have any suggestions for fair, sensitive skin?? THANKS!"
1,"My husband has struggled with acne for years, and this is the only product that works for him. I've also found it to be effective on the few occasions I've had a break-out. I would definitely recommend it."
0,"Whoever designed the jar should be sent to a North Korean labor camp to be reeducated! I don't know about others but I certainly find the jar extremely inconvenient. It's a rounded small jar with a small opening that makes it a task to get the creme out. What's more bizarre is that it comes with a plastic stick that one's supposed to use to scoop out the creme but who on earth has the patience to meddle with it? And where would they leave it afterward, on the counter? In the drawer? Or just let the dog eat it?"
1,It is a nice product but burned my eyes when I used mu normal make up remover.  Gave it to a friend who loves it.
0,It seemed to break me out after using. I was only applying every other day in the interest of acclimation. I had better results using a glycolic wash previously. I think maybe this was just too strong and staying on my skin a longer period of time did not agree.
1,"I purchased this product only about 2 weeks ago and really like it so far. I had a Thayers: Witch Hazel and I noticed that it was 14% alcohol and recently I have been trying to purchase more natural facial products. I searched for witch hazel toners with no alcohol and I decided on this one. I have been using it 1-2 times daily after cleansing and it is doing a great job picking up things my cleanser leaves behind! The product is a great value (you get so much for so little!) and I am sure it will last for months and months. It has a nice natural rose scent as well. Witch Hazel is supposed to be a great acne remedy and I think the rose is suppose to help sooth the skin. So far, so good! I have seen a reduction in my acne and I do believe continued use of this will clear up my skin. A wonderful, natural product to use. I would highly recommend."
1,"This eyeshadow is awesome, the color payoff is great and the color (i got Lhasa) is beautiful. It is a bit more than i am used to spending for a single eyeshadow but I really liked this color and couldn't find a close doupe for it. I regret nothing!"
1,"I give this product between 3.75 and 4.0 stars.  There are several good things about this product but a couple of negatives that bring my rating down a notch.Pros:*Long lasting.  It stays on all day, from morning until night*No flaking, peeling, fading, or smudging.  It stays exactly how you applied it and doesn't give you racoon eyes.*The color is so rich, black, and dark.  The color really makes my eyes pop and gives them that extra oomph.*It dries quickly and doesn't feel wet on your eye lids.*It's affordable and you seem to get a lot of product for the price.Cons:*It is somewhat difficult to remove at night.  I use makeup remover and I have to rub at it a little more than I do with other eyeliners to remove it completely.*It is a little difficult to apply in the sense that not a lot of product gets onto the brush to transfer to your lids.  I have to screw the cap on, shake it, and then remove the brush about 3-4 times to get the look I'm going for.  I don't know if I just got an old produt or if the formula is drier because it's waterproof (I think that's the reason), but it's not a huge deal unless you only have a little bit of time to apply this liner.Overall, this is a good liner that gives a dark, dramatic color and stays on all day without flaking or smudging.  I found it to be a little difficult to apply and remove at night and had to spend a little bit more effort doing this than I've had to do with other liners.  It's affordable and I'd reccommend it to try, but I'm not sure if I would purchase again; I would probably try other liners before coming back to this one."
1,"I discovered this shade at our local nail salon and I'm glad Amazon (of course!) has it. True pink shades look awful on my nails because my skin tone goes best with warm shades of color and this is perfect. This is my ""go to"" color because it looks great with everything in my wardrobe and can worn in every season.I would definitely recommend this to a friend."
1,"This body wash smells so good, that I feel that I must warn anyone with small children to be careful so that they do not try to eat this.Now for the rest of us, this smells great.  We like to use this as a bubble bath.  The whole bathroom smells heavenly, both during use and even afterwards."
1,"I love this thing. It's not very fancy looking but it works very well. It reduces clutter in the shower, minimizes wasting your products, it's super easy to install and easy to refill. I'm buying one for the guest bathroom as well"
1,"I have tried numerous face creams, moisturizers but Jason's product is excellent. It provides long lasting moisture to my skin, smells great, and I see a difference as far as minimizing fine lines  This is a subscribe and save product for me."
0,I am usually a great fan of OpI and never disappointed by the color. Generally what you see is what you get. If your counting on getting a pretty rose color as pictured think again. What arrived was nowhere near the color or color family. It's more a shade a muted clay mudd. Don't know if I received something that was accidentally mislabeled or defective. Save your money if your looking for a ros&eacute; pink.
1,"I have been using this eyeliner for years and was pleasantly surprised that it is still around. When I use it, I put eyeshadow on first, then line my lids. I haven't had any trouble with it peeling/flaking off. My only complaint is that when I take it off, it doesn't want to come off--even when I use makeup remover. You really have to scrub."
1,"This did not work for my 3.5 year old daughter, but I think it's due more to the fact that she is very stubborn. I applied every other day, but she still chewed on her nails. I think I will try again but apply everyday this time."
1,Targets nasty situations. It is economical too and goes a long way. Disappears with no residue. A little drop will do ya!
1,I love my regular size Denman hair brush and was excited to see one in a smaller size.  This size fits into my travel bag perfectly.  I use my regular size brush for both myself and my daughter when we travel to brush our wet natural hair. I look forward to our next out of town trip so that we won't have to pack the big Denman. Great buy!!!
1,"I have been using this brand of rosewater for years. It's refreshing with a great scent and is excellent for &#34;setting&#34; your makeup. I use the plain rosewater in summer and the glycerin in the winter. Try it, you'll like it!"
1,This is just another moisturizer I have tried in a search for something for my skin.  It may work for some but I am still looking.
1,"This calming gel will soothe your skin. I found a small sample in a sample kit and was impressed with the ingredients. Peppermint, Lavender, Rosemary, Safe, Aloe Vera, Witch Hazel, Tea Tree, Chamomile, Camphor and Bergamot oil top the list for healing.This formula helps to neutralize any bacteria and is especially good for oily skin. You can use this over your entire face or just for spot treatment.Also look for Pore Shrink Deep Pore Cleansing Mask and the Start Up Exfoliating Face Wash.I'd like them to make these containers twicethe size, at least.~The Rebecca Review"
1,I am very picky with moisturizer and this one is great. It is so light-weight and not greasy. I think it smells clean and am very happy with the purchase.
1,Another great product.  Just love this Biotin B-complex thickening conditioner.  It really helps the hair to look fuller and to grow.
1,"A lot of products claim to be made for sensitive skin, yet, I always found a sensitivity to them became apparent after a few uses, regardless of brand or pricing.  Not with Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Sunscreen Lotion.  I'm into one year of use and absolutely NO reaction!"
1,i bought this mascara based on reviews here and on youtube. it was just ok. did not see any drastic change with this. would not buy again. maybe it was the way applied it. it seems to work when combined with other mascaras.
1,"I am a huge fan of Neutrogena Deep Clean Oil Free Face Wash, so when I had hard time finding my stand-by scrub, naturally I grabbed this. Having had irritation problems with other scrubs, I was cautious to only use this on my forehead prior to using it on the rest of my skin. After using this on my forehead my skin was smoother, but when I moved to my chin a few days later my chin broke out slightly. Although my skin (especially in the chin area) is slightly sensitive-I haven't had friction induced acne in years!This is a white cream with micro-beads in the formula. The package claims these beads are Beta Hydroxy, but after reading the ingredients I cannot figure out what they are. This has a nice fresh scent-citrus but not girly. This has salicylic acid in it-so it does have an acne fighting component.I will continue to use this product and hope my skin can build up tolerance to it, because the areas on my face that did not break out look very nice and are smoother.Skin type: oily, few lines, 20-something, slightly pigmented, semi-sensitive, acne proneIngredients I got off the package: water, sodium methyl cocyl taurate, polyethylene, glycerin, cocomidopropyl, betaine, glycol distearate, stearic acid, acrylates/c10-30 alkyl acylate crosspolymer, linoleanidopropyl, PG-dimonium chloride phosphate, neopentyl glycol dicoprlate/dicoporate, salicylcic acid, disodium edta, xanthan gum, magnesium aluminium silicate, sodium hydroxide, cetyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, mathylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, putylparaben, agar, mica, titanium dioxide, iron oxide, red 20 lake, fragrance."
1,Love this conditioner. My hair is very fine and where I use this conditioner it gives my hair the body it needs. I also have theshampoo and it works great. I recommend it to anyone who has fine hair.
1,"I gave this a 5star for service , product, prices and speedy delivery. I truly love Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion its the best for Dry skin its so moisturizing to the skin and not sticky feeling. I cant be without it ... Great Vender will buy more in the future from them ... thanks"
1,People always ask me what I use on my face.  I love it!  I put this on day and night. At night I use a thick jojoba moisturizer.
1,product as described. good quality- no complains. satisfied customer and will repeat order in the future. Would also refer to friends
1,"For over 20 years, the Conair has been the only brand of hair dryer I've purchased.  I've never experienced any kind of problem with a Conair dryer, and I've only replaced them when I've wanted something smaller or with new features.This little travel dryer is the best Conair hair dryer I've tried yet!  Despite the small size--which tucks easily into your suitcase--the 1875 watts provide a strong, intense stream of air, helping me to have less drying time while traveling.  In fact, this product works so well that I also recommend it for home use; the folding handle would allow it to fit into even the smallest vanity drawer.  Highly recommended!"
0,CANNOT TELL THAT THIS PRODUCT HAS ANY AFFECT ON MY SKIN AT ALL. IHAVE USED IT NOW FOR  ABOUT THREE WEEKS. IT DOES HAVE A BURNING SENSATION SO THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE DOING SOMETHING???
1,"Throw away your curling iron and the burns that accompany it! The heat stick curls hair, never burning it or you. Even those of us who are all thumbs when it comes to this sort of thing can achieve dramatic results. Buy this!!"
1,"My husband's fingers crack in the winter time, non-stop. It is very painful. Every night he puts this on before he goes to bed and then he applies it once or twice throughout the day. It has helped his fingers a lot. It is very greasy and it has some menthol in it so it has a weird sensation on your hands before it sinks in. It was recommended by a nurse that he apply this and then wear rubber glover for an hour or so after applying it for better results, he refuses to do this, but I thought it sounded like good advice."
0,i used all of these and the creme i actually ended up getting few months worth and took them for 3 months and its not worth the money these did nothing for me
1,"Nice and stiff, makes your skin feel great! The handle is just long enough and you can remove the brush for ease of use."
1,"Level one rinses only last a week or two before your original color pokes through again. Level 3 is a permanent rinse - so when your hair grows, the different color in your roots has a stark contrast. I love the Natural Instincts level 2 rinses. The color lasting power varies depening on the color of your natural hair and the color you select. I leave color on for over the maximum 20 minutes or it just won't take - but the color is truly natural in appearance and doesn't look like some freakish tone - even when it fades after about 30 shampoos. It starts to gently fade at about the time different colored roots start showing, so you don't get a stark difference - it just looks like your hair is changing colors on its own - slowly and gracefully - giving you a day or even a week to put off before coloring your hair again."
1,"I found this product about 7 months ago.  it's the exact color result I had been looking for.  I've been using permanent dye for years and wasn't getting a consitant color for whatever reasons.  After doing research it occurred to me that all i was really after was having a red ontop of my natural shade.  After buying a box of this brand I called the company to double check something (something I do when ever I switch brands now because of bad experiences) and I was actually told that this product is NOT recommended for use over permante hair dye.  (not just henna and metalics like it says on the leaflet).  that they recommend you wait until your hair grows out before use.  And that they can't guarentee it won't cause hair breakage if used over past permanent hair dyes.  So for a few months the box sat unused.  I ended up trying it anyway, I LOVE the color.  It's the best red I've been able to find and it's consistant.HOWEVER, I've had to buy a much better conditioner in order to continue to use the product.  if I don't my hair becomes too dry and has more breakage.  i can't stop dying my hair but don't want to continue to wreck my roots if I don't have to, So I am continueing with this product vs a level 3.  The hair that was never dyed with permant color (6 months of roots and bangs) is soft and not dry at all.  So even though it doesn't say it on the package the company recommends this for natural hair, call them and see for yourself.  However with the right hair care you can still use this product."
1,This brush is wonderful.  It's very soft and feels great on your skin.  Its easy to tap off the excess so you can apply just the right amount of foundation.  It's also easy to clean with mild soap.  When its dried it feels like it was brand new.
1,BETTER THAN PERFECTER
1,"Never disappoints. I love this mascara because it is tried and true and lengthens and thickens just enough for everyday wear or put on more layers and use eyelash curler for a more dramatic look. I have to use waterproof and this one is awesome, no flakes. Doesn't smudge or make my eyes water, and yet is still washable. Good value. just note if you use a lot of layers, you will need a stronger face wash to remove it, or baby oil."
1,"It's been only a week since I started using this product, so far nothing new. I also didn't realize that the cream was so small."
0,"- It peel off nothing. I don't have blackhead but just a little dead skin around my chin. And dead skin is even easier to peel off than blackhead, but this thing can't even take it out. Disappointed."
1,"This product is seriously my favorite it works great! Worth the price! Best of all, it smells so good! I will definately buy this again! Highly recommend it"
1,"I've never had much acne till I hit 30.  My hormones must have gone out of whack. Most acne cleanser irritate my skin and I've become allergic to anything with sycillic acid or benzole in it. I started thinking maybe I have rosascea.  No facial cleanser were getting rid of the red bumps on my face.I came across this product and have been using it for 3 weeks now and most of the red bumps are gone.  I am thrilled to have found something that is sensitive to my skin, smells good, & clears up my pimples.My skin is still a bit red ,so who knows, maybe I do have a minor case of rosacea."
1,Recommended by my Dermatologist.  Like it and use it.  Very light and creamy.  Does not last all day like some but is nice to use often.
1,"This is my favorite toner. Its light and refreshing, has a slight rose smell. My bottle lasted about a year and I can't wait to repurchase!"
1,"I love these -- usually, the ""large"" rollers in a hot set are too small and will curl your hair.  These are big enough to just give some body and shape. Theyre exactly what I wanted."
1,"Great brand and works wonderfully. I am at that peri-menopausal age and this really helps some symptoms.  It's easily absorbed and has no scent.  Also price is a bit better than some of the other creams.  I also like this has no estrogen, only progesterone."
1,"Don't know yet if this product is actually helping my skin in any way but after I have thoroughly washed my face and rinsed off with cold water I put some of this on with a cotton ball and let it dry before putting on primer (if it's morning and I'm going to wear makeup) or before putting on my night cream.  What I like best about it is its scent though, I don't know that it's actually making any difference in the overall quality of my skin."
0,"This product does not live up to its name.  While the mascara is soft, it is not full.  To get a desired full effect, I have to apply the mascara at least three times.  The mascara also takes a long time to set and dry.  I will not be buying this product again."
1,"I do like this brush, a lot.  It works great with the BM line, and gives the coverage it promises.  My only complaint is that it seems to shed a bit.  Which means I'll have to replace it sooner rather than later.  But it's a great product and delivers what is promised.  Shipped fast, arrived in great condition."
1,"I didn't mind the smell of this at first, but after a day or two I am finding it doesn't mix with my body chemistry or something.I have fine, thin hair that is growing out color.  This left my hair a little more oily at the end of the day than I would like.  When it was wet, it did seem to manage the tangles ok.For me this isn't the best choice, but the water and climate and hair type make all the difference."
1,My doctor recommended this because it provides good moisture and a safe physical (non-chemical) barrier to the sun. Love it.
1,"Might as well review one of my long-standing, best beauty products. I buy several of these at a time because I seriously NEVER want to run out. No oiliness after, gets all mascara and eye shadow off easily. Love this!"
1,"I'm sure I'm not the only one but I use these to clean my ears with, even though the labeling tells you not to. Just be careful!"
1,I'm so happy to have found this soap on here. I used to find it here and there if I was lucky. Mostly I just found variety packs of the soap. This is the only scent I truly like out of those variety packs. These bars smell wonderful and last pretty long. I couldn't believe I was getting 12 bars hehe :D
1,I love how it makes my skin feels.  Its not greasy like other products.  My skin feels hydrated.Not sure if others has the same habit as me but with how this products makes my skin feels and easily absorb to my skin...It has me using it daily.... it became a healthy habit to just grab and apply everyday.  I cant say it help with any wrinkles I have (that if I even have it..hahahha)  But definitely great for just keeping a healthy hydrated skin.Great buy.
1,"My favorite product hands down, can't go a day without it! Use with PCA Smoothing Toner and PCA Oily/Problem Face wash. A&C Serum also works very well if you have systic type acne. EyeXcellence is also my favorite anti aging product to prevent future wrinkles!"
1,"So let's face it, the advantage of this product is the scent, pure and simple.  There are many less expensive dish detergents that do the same or even better job but don't have this wonderful lavender aroma that envelops you as you do the dishes.  It takes a chore and makes it just a little bit more pleasant, as the gentle scent of lavender wafts upwards while you scrub dishes.  And then it rinses away, cleanly... 100% gone.  No residue in my experience.If you want a little luxury in your kitchen, try a bottle of this.  Often it's on sale at Marshalls in the home section if you just want to try one bottle before you commit to a case of 6.  But I'm hooked on this stuff!"
1,"i have super dry hair, & i was skeptical about this shampoo. i saw great reviews on it, all of which were 5 stars, so i decided to give it a shot, & i'm so glad i did! i was a little worried, because it didn't lather much, like other shampoos do, but i noticed a major difference in how my hair felt as soon as i rinsed the shampoo out of my hair. it was so much softer & felt healthy, unlike most shampoos, which strip my hair & leave it super dry. it smells great too! i will be purchasing this product in the future for sure & i recommended it, especially for those with dry damaged hair like mine. you won't regret it!"
0,"I used this twice just to make sure I wasn't imagining the smell. To me, it smells exactly like urine. My fingers reek of it and I can even smell it on my face. I only bought this because it was $1 or more cheaper than the others. It is probably just a bad reaction to my own skin oils because in the bottle or on the cotton ball, it smells great.I'll be buying another brand this evening and NEVER buying this again."
1,"This has been one of my favorite perfumes for about 10 years now. It lasts a long time, it is light smelling but effective, and I always get complimented whenever I wear it. It also is cheaper on Amazon than it is at the Clinique counter at Macy's."
1,I use this toner for several years. I love the rose water and also I use it for mask several times. I will buy another one next month.
1,"These hot rollers are the bomb they don't get tangled in your fair cool to touch no burns and very nice curl, This was a great purchase"
1,"I love exfoliation, I exfoliate daily in some way shape or form and this is one of the better exfoliants I've used. It does leave my skin red for a little while after using, but I see the results and love how my skin looks and feels since using it."
1,"The wife is as happy as squirrel that just found a sack of fresh peanuts.  She really likes it, it works great for her and all is well at our household."
1,"Not only can you still smell the fragrance on your face 45mins after you put it on which I think is completely unnecessary but it is listed as the 9th inactive ingredient which puts it right at the top. Why fragrance is so important that they need so much of it in this solution I do not know but I think it irritates my skin. I have fair skin that is ingredient sensitive. I usually use neutrogena's tinted moisture with retinol and my usual moisturizer underneath. I liked that this one has an SPF 30 instead of 20 and that it claimed to improve texture and dark spots. I haven't been able to use it long enough to find out because every day I use it my skin becomes more red, which leads to sensitivity, which leads to blotchiness and breakouts. I've also noticed that my eyelids are drying out because of this even though I put moisture on every day. If you aren't okay with overwhelming fragrance then this may not be for you. I wish they had an unscented version so we could see what this product can really do but for now I am sticking with Neutrogena's Tinted Moisturizer."
1,"I got my first wrinkles going on my forehead so I bought all the creams and stuff, including this.  After 4 days of the other stuff I decided to also throw in this toner and wow, I felt and saw a difference.  After applying it, you feel it as it's drying and my wrinkles definitely looked not as imprinted on my skin.  So now I always apply this first after washing my face... then the other stuff."
1,"the best &#34;soap&#34; out there, cleans, no after film, good for entire family, great for face,good clean face and body"
0,"I just purchased this cleanser and found it to be harsh. I have good skin, but it's sensitive and was quite disappointed to find my skin very tight and dry after using it. I think it's better suited for normal to oily skin.If you want a high quality skin exfoliate that doesn't leave your skin dry, check out louisebianco.com - they make a product called Derma Polish - it's not listed on their website so you have to call them to order it.  It's about $25 but it's remarkable in that it removes dead skin and leaves your skin feeling moist and looking great."
1,This works amazing. I had no idea it was going to be so professional. Will be buying more as gifts.
1,"I recently had an outbreak of something on my face around my eyes.  The Dr. told me it was an allergic reaction to something....could be anything.  Several internet searches points to eye eczema, but it's not Dr. diagnosed, as I did not see a dermatologist, but a general MD.  My eyes became very swollen and very red.  My eyelids and cheekbone area looked like a horrible sunburn or maybe like I had just had a laser treatment.  Very uncomfortable and itchy as well.  At night I woke up several times and wanted to scratch my eyes out.  I found this cream after doing a search for eczema treatment on Amazon.  The reviews described many of the symptoms I was experiencing.  So, I ordered it ~ what I was using seemed to make things worse even though these creams had helped with my prior breakout of whatever I was experiencing.  I waited 2 days to try this...I was afraid to make things worse because everything I had tried just wasn't working at all.  Last night, I gave this a whirl.  After 15 minutes, I was feeling relief from the itching and the redness and actually what swelling I had going on seemed to lighten up.  I woke up with about 1/2 of the redness around my eyes that I had been experiencing over the past 5 days.  The cream is a tiny bit gritty, but nothing major, it is pretty greasy, but for me it did soak in and give me almost immediate relief.  When I woke up, it had absorbed into my skin and I finally looked like I had rested.  I will continue to use this and give it a 5 star rating....it really is good stuff.  I'm also on prednisone for my symptoms and that also may be the reason I'm feeling somewhat better, but the relief I felt shortly after applying this cream to my face is the big thing for me.  This cream gets 2 thumbs up!  :o)Update:  I began using this on the heals of my feet and it works amazingly well there too!Update 2: I experienced a lot of itching on my neck and scratched too much.  I used this and the redness and swelling along with the itching subsided.  This stuff is amazing and works on so many things.  I keep it on hand at all times."
1,"I absolutely love this stuff and I swear by it! I've been using this witch hazel for about 4 or 5 months now and I'm still on the same bottle! I use it everyday (sometimes twice a day) as an astringent after I wash my face and before I moisturize. The product is great and helped clear my moderate acne. The only reason I gave the product a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the smell. It reminds me of a bonfire (burning wood). I got used to the scent after about a week but it still bothers my boyfriend, who can smell it on my face sometimes if I'm sitting or laying close to him. The product works so well that he's going to have to get over the smell. (:"
0,"It didnt make me break out but I think its fake, my last mac smell different and had a smooth finish. This is chalky"
1,"i love this powder, it never makes my skin shiny. its the perfect color for my skin tone. and i will buy again and again"
1,"I love this  Vitamin E oil, nice and thick so you can pat it on without dripping (like under eyes before bed). I have also mixed it in with other oils, like jojoba or almond oil if I wanted a thinner mix for my skin. It absorbs well and makes my skin very soft. Great for healing dry skin."
0,"I received a 2 oz sample of this in my new beauty test tube. I tried using this recently for a few days morning and night. I used it as directed (leave on for 60 seconds). First of all it smells exactly like bug repellant spray lol. Not a big deal but thought I would mention it. But yeah while washing it has a slimy texture, it doesn't foam up unless you were to really make an attempt but that's not an issue just mentioning. There is *some* foaming action but not much. After using my face looks mostly okay but doesn't feel clean (and I only use mineral powder or bb cream). If I had a breakout then that area would be reddened after washing. After the first day I could tell this just was not working for my skin. My skin felt dirty, pores were larger, face seemed irritated. After the third day I was breaking out a LOT. I was getting crazy huge pimples all around my mouth and chin area. And I was getting pimples in strange places like the tip of my nose and around my eye sockets lol. Something in this was quite irritating and didn't wash off my face probably. I don't personally feel that this face wash is gentle or effective. For reference my face is sensitive oily and clog prone, Acne prone especially with irritating ingredients. Therefore I cannot recommend this face wash and I will have to figure out what to do with the remainder as I never throw anything out that isn't expired (and neither should you!) maybe I will use as a brush cleaner."
1,I had never used this item before.  My father used to use it all the time.  Now I see why.  It really does give you a closer shave and reduces skin irritation.  You only need to use a small amount.  And make sure to wait about 15 seconds for it to dry before shaving.
0,"I know they advertise this make-up as one that will not make you breakout, which is actually why I used it for a couple years.  But after about a year of use, I began breaking out and just thought it was my skin.  I tried different cleansers, changing my laundry detergent, chemical peels, facials and still would get acne on my chin and cheeks.I went to a dermatologist and she told me to stop using the Bare Escentuals and see how my face does.  I stopped using it and started using Jane Iredale, Glo, and YoungBlood makeup and my face is totally clear!!  I couldn't believe it was the BareMinerals making me break out.  According to my doctor, Bare Minerals does not use pharmaceutical grade minerals like the Jane Iredale and the other mentioned products I now use.  I still use the Bare Minerals eyeshadows, as they don't bother my eyes.  If you have problems with acne and use this makeup, I would try switching to a pharmaceutical grade makeup and see what happens.And as a side note.... stop using Tide laundry detergent if you have chronic breakouts.  It contains a lot of residue that can make you break out.  I now use Dreft on all my pillow cases, sheets and towels I use to dry my body and face.  This was the first step in my quest for clear skin and it helped tremendously.  When I switched makeups, my face totally cleared up."
1,Revlon lipsticks are all amazing. There are so many shades and they all apply creamy and beautifully. If you don't want to splurge on mac then get revlon lipsticks. They're highly pigmented and feel so nice on the lips. I don't even need to use a lip liner with them. They last about 1-2 hours before I reapply them. They might last longer but I always like to reapply my lipstick about every hour unless it is a liquid lipstick.
1,"Originally purchased to help with my grandson's excema, now the whole family uses it! It doesn't have much of a smell to it, and moisturizes very well."
1,"I like the brush, wish it has more bristles in it so that it would hold on to the hair better, or maybe just longer bristles. The point at the bottom doesn't do anything for me so I wonder if we really needed a point at all."
1,Use daily and love it! I am a philosophy woman and will be for life! I Love all your products.
1,"Color is great. It might be a great product had it not arrived in a used like condition. Seriously, whats the point of a review if its going to be unfairly deleted? This was my experience. If anyone wants a bottle of makeup that can honestly be questionable...Ill dig it outta the trash for you. Its not going on my face. If I were happy w product Id say so. I'm not. Theres makeup on the side of the bottle. It doesnt look like it poured out from the top. What am I supposed to think and why send a lil glass bottle of foundation in a bubble mailer to begin w? Theres better ways of sending off products.UPDATE: Im going to change my stars for this product.  Sometime after my review seller apologized and sent me a brand new product. For their effort in correcting the situation, they deserve props. Color of make up looks great. Thank you! Wore it to work today and three people said my skin looked great. Which is weird because nobody ever notices my skin."
1,This is a very nice product.  It works great and smells like baby lotion.  If you or anyone you know has problems with taking a bath or shower this product is the next best thing.
1,"it didnt seem to work, my pore look the same as always, and it is a little stingy because of the alcohol."
0,"My sister recommend this 'green' product to me, and at the time I ordered it through Amazon, I didn't realize I was purchasing such a large bottle.  I used it once and couldn't stand the smell, so I'm saving the rest for my sister's next visit, to give to her as a gift.  The odor is strong and I don't enjoy having my face smell like a tree.  I'm sorry... I just don't like it at all."
1,I love this product because the brush bristles are nice and face and applies the makeup evenly. I like it even more knowing I paid a great price and got it shipped straight to my door.
1,"I was looking for a lotion with decent full-spectrum protection that was also not oily, would not clog pores, and gave me good moisture. I sometimes still use a thicker moisturizer on my T-zone, but I have this on hand at all times."
1,not any thing specail .i don't think that's is worth me to spent money to buy again .better pass guy
1,"I've used 3 or 4 bottles of this product and it works for me, as it doesn't have a fragrance and doesn't dry out my skin."
1,"You can't tell by the picture, but they are curved at the ends.  Other headbands hurt the back of my ears.  But since these are curved, they slant away from the ears.  They are flexible, fit perfectly and stay in place.  I have not found any others that are curved like these."
0,"I am not a perfume wearer, but I heard that this is very light and unlike any other perfume. I got this in the roll-on and I don't care for it at all. Just like all other perfumes, it makes me nauseated. I'll be giving this to a relative for Christmas."
0,didnt like it i prob will keep it and later throw it out or give my mum see if it works for her was waste of money!
1,And she loves it. I also use 100% aloe to seal the cuticles of the hair after shampooing as well.
1,"I have begun to explore the Olay skin care products as the moisturizers and facial cleansers I usually use have become way too expensive, and friends have literally raved about Olay skin care products.I recently tried &#34;Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream&#34; and the results are amazing. I learned that one doesn't need to spend $100.+ to get a great result. However, please note that one's skin will not show improvement unless used regularly for at least a  few months. It also helps to use a good facial cleanser, (Olay's Regenerist line has one), and a toner to restore the skin's pH balance. A good toner, (again, Olay has one), will remove any residual oil and cleanser from facial skin. Please believe me, I am not a &#34;shill&#34; for Olay. I am just amazed that their Regenerist line works as well as the very expensive skin products in illuminating the face, fading spots.An FYI...Traditional toners consist of moisturizers, oils and extracts that help soothe your skin. Astringents, which are generally alcohol-based, tighten the skin and pores and remove oil. Fresheners work similarly to astringents by tightening the skin, but they are made of ingredients like caffeine and green tea instead of alcohol.This fast-absorbing deep regenerating cream really does hydrate one's skin. I have been using this cream for 2 months now and I am totally satisfied with the results. This relatively new Olay formula, with a brightening complex, fades the look of dark spots, age spots, sun spots and discoloration. My skin is a lot more evenly toned, brighter looking, and the dark circles under my eyes are lightening. This is not my imagination - I have received compliments, My skin has the same &#34;glow&#34; that it did with the more expensive products I used before....and at one third the cost!Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream facial moisturizer DOES hydrate the skin, providing the total anti-aging power of moisture fused with vitamins and antioxidants. It is color-free, fragrance-free, oil-free, fast-absorbing, dermatologically tested, and non-comedogenic (won't clog pores). Its rich, non-greasy formula instantly softens the look of fine lines and wrinkles.Amino-peptide plus B3 Complex penetrates deep into the skins surface to wake up tired-looking skin. I would recommend putting on the cream while the skin is slightly moist - not wet!The moisturizer comes in a one 1.7 fl. oz. pump bottle. Use twice daily, after cleansing and toning your facial skin, in the morning and before bed.

1,"I have been using this deodorant for about fifteen years now and I love it, if you can love a deodorant!  A little goes along way and you put it on and forget it as they say. I used to buy it from a name department store till I found on Amazon.The only way to go. Would not think of trying something new."
1,Overall this was a good lotion. The scent stays around for a long time but for use over the entire body it just ran out to fast for me. It is good as a hand lotion.
1,I just started using so it is hard to tell how effective this is in reducing deep wrinkles.  I would imagine I would have a better idea after using the contents to the end of the tube.
1,"I just got dying my hair with this. Picked it up at my local health store. I had roots growing out from summer and extremely light hair. My hair is brown, but I sun in'd the hell out of it mid summer. This didn't really have a smell and if it does it's slight. Beats the hell out of that chemical crap. That stinks! I didn't like the conditioner, wasn't enough for my hair anyways. I have hair past my shoulders, it's curly and thick. One box was enough for me. It seems a bit dark for me, think I'll go a lighter color next time. I'm just glad to use something without chemicals."
1,"A little messy at times....but it is super convenient if you don't have the time or place to change pads/tampons throughout the day.  I use a backup liner just in case.  Clever idea.  I don't like using bleached cotton tampons (who wants to stick bleach IN themselves??)  Totally unnoticeable.  Great for swimming, tight clothing, anything really.  Make it part of your shower routine and you'll have no issues."
1,"I don't know whether the gloves would have eventually helped to keep my hands mositurized after application of hand cream, because the area below both thumbs begin to itch a lot after sleeping in them several nights.  Once I stopped wearing the gloves at bedtime, the  itching stopped."
1,"I bought this instead of the moisturizer by mistake, and thought I'd give it a try.It works better than most other cleansers I've tried for my more mature, slightly acne prone, sensitive skin. It's gentle, but effective and my skin feels really smooth and great after I use it. I've noticed that it seems to make the Alpha Hydrox Moisturizer more effective. Definitely a plus. The size of the container is ample, and I use about a quarter's worth for my whole face and decolletage, so it will go a long way."
1,"I usually forget to put on lotion, but this smells so good and goes on so smoothly, I always remember. I use it instead of perfume because it smells better than the (expensive) scent I have."
0,"This brush iron does a reasonable job on the ends of my hair, but it is definitely not for smoothing or adding curl or shine. It just doesn't get hot enough. For my long, fine, straight hair, it is just ok at taming the bangs and ends. If I want curl, body, bounce or shine, I don't even plug it in, I just go for my better styling tools. I was really hoping this would be my go-to tool after letting my hair air-dry, but it was a disappointment."
1,"I originally got this as a little sample cup from Sephora with another purchase and liked it so much I decided to get it. I really like the smell, it is kind of a clean natural smell. I usually like stuff that has more scrub to it to clean off dead skin but this is really smooth, but it hasn't been bothering me and if is feel like I need to get some dead skin off I can use it with a wash cloth. I also have sensitive brake out prone skin and it seems like some cleansers actually make it worse but this is doing well and I have been using it for a month or two."
0,"I love the foam and how soothing it feels, I do not follow after the first poo since all the product, oils, and dirt is washed out in its first application.  My only knock on the product it has way too much protein that causes my hair to tangle and knot up. That's why the product only got 2 stars, now if you are not protein-sensitive go for it."
1,This is the very best soap I have ever used.  Highly recommend it.  My very dry hands never hurt or itch when I use this soap.
1,"I like this product. It creates a good matt base coat and primer which helps nail color go on smooth. It fills ridges in pretty well too. But it took almost 2 weeks to arrive, so next time I will just go to the store and get it myself."
1,"I am very happy with this OPI color although I have to say I am rarely displeased with any OPI. I have tried several different bran of polish as I get a manicure every 7-10 days and OPI stands up to the rest. I will say I ALWAYS google the color (French Quater For Your Thoughts ), brand (OPI) and ""swatch"" to see the true color on nails. It can be hard to tell in bottle and unfortunately the OPI swatches on the website are almost never close. I always purchase from XPRESSURSELF, I have NEVER had a problem. Quick ship, fair prices, and he combines shipping. This is a BIG plus for me since I tend to hold off and buy 3-5 different colors at a time."
1,"Have been using this for years at night and under makeup. Absorbs quickly. Leaves skin smooth. Does not cause breakouts, Hydrates. This is my favorite moisturizer. I never bought the larger size before, but it is the same product as in the smaller bottle.Seemed like a good value."
1,"Fits my needs, does its job, always use Q-Tips and always will as long as the quality continues. Good buy"
1,I love Affirm 3x it is such a good retinol product. It makes my skin beautiful again and I got it for a great great price.
1,"I always seem to come back to this mascara after trying many others.  Now that I'm older, I want a mascara that gives me a more natural, soft look, and this does the trick.  It doesn't clump, or smudge on me, and it's always easy to remove.  I'm sure I'll probably still try other mascaras to see how they are, but I'll undoubtedly come back to this one!"
1,"I have trouble with hand creams because my hands sweat more than the average person's. As a result, I find this lotion to be somewhat slow absorbing. It almost feels like a thicker version of aquaphor - very rich and emoliant, maybe even a bit greasy. However, I notice that my cuticles are very well moisturized when I use this and the effects last several hours. I suggest using it sparingly. It won't be my holy grail hand cream, but I will definitely use it in conjunction with a more fast absorbing and lighter lotion."
0,I was really hoping that this product would work for me. Unfortunately this product did not do anything at all for me.
1,This really works well. It reminds me of a product from 50 years ago for the same purpose. Looking forward to showering with it.
1,"I just received this as a gift for my birthday and I love it. I haven't used it much, but I absolutely love how it works and how it makes my face feel. It's non-foaming, since that's typically an added chemical that's not needed and I enjoy the scent. My face feels clean and refreshed after using this Cleansing Milk!"
1,"As a former hair stylist, I can say that one of the most difficult colors to achieve and maintain is a soft, natural looking red shade. Reds tend to be garish and fake looking. Subtle reds fade out shortly after coloring. With my rosy complexion and hazel green eyes, I was &#34;born to be a redhead.&#34; My natural color is a boring dishwater blond, now peppered with grey. I have tried so may reds, and looked like Woody Woopecker, or like I dumped my head into a henna vat!  I tried this shade and it is gorgeous! My hair is a soft, reddish blond & my friends can't believe it when they learn I am not a real redhead. The conditioner that comes with the package leaves my hair glossy and full of body and smells awesome. Unlike other red shades, the color lasts and lasts and is just as fresh and natural looking as the first day that I applied it. With other red shades I've tried, the grey in my hair turned orange, but with 9GRLT, the grey strands become a glistening golden red blonde hightlights....no need for expensive highlight jobs at the salon. So if you want a luminous golden red, instead of looking like a fire engine, you must try this color!"
1,I like it a lot . Really keeps my manicure on for a long time. I will be using this a lot.
1,I got a new flat iron (which I'm returning Rusk heat freak ) my hair is salt n pepper. It made the salt part yellow.My hair designer tried to get it out with a toner..still some left. Got this n used it..took the yellow right out.
1,"soft on the scalp, and in between the long bristles there are little ones that help straighten and remove and fuzz or anything in your hair.  This a great bush I use on my daughters hair as well as mine.  So gentle she does not mind it."
1,"Quick service! This mascara came out in the 90s and I can still remember the commercials with Sarah Michelle Gellar. Or was that full n' soft? Any who... this product is great. It gets the lashes other brushes wont reach and it is gentle on my lashes, not cakey."
1,I use this to hydrate my nail after taking off the gel nails. Great to use around the cuticles also...and I have also used it on a few of my small scars with success !
1,I smell like a BBQ... or fireplace! I actually love it. It's super drying on my skin though. Even worse on my face. I feel clean though.
1,Love this Hot Tools 1 1/2&#34; gold curling iron. Has an adjustment heat that works perfectly for any hair type.
1,"When I first put it on there was a strong peppermint smell, and a really tingly almost stinging feeling. That kind of scared me. But it went away as the stuff dried. I think it takes more than 15 minutes, but thats ok because you can multitask. Very green in color, I looked as scared as I was at first!I took it off using two washclothes. The first to get the majority off of my face, and the second to make sure residue was off. Pretty easy.this stuff is cheap, and the results really only last a day. But for the price it is great! My skin felt tighter and firm, while not drying it out too much and leaving it soft.I don't really know if it dries out acne like it says, I only had twp spots and didn't notice a difference. But oh well."
1,"Sometimes you find a product that becomes a staple.  Agree, this is just a super hand wash with a great scent and excellent texture. It is never harsh on your delicate skin.  Many times a repeat buyer for years. Highly recommended."
1,"I use this product when I just want my nails to be clear, and I will layer on 3 coats.  It dries very quickly and works extremely well as a nail strengthener, as I can definitely tell the difference in my nails.  However, it chips off ridiculously easily, which is frustrating.  Maybe if I had time to layer on another coat every 1-2 days it'd be okay but otherwise it's not worth just using it by itself.  As a base or top coat, it's great."
1,"It's like getting a real facial for less. It leaves my skin feeling smooth, radiant and less ashy. Its so worth it!"
1,Have used it for years and it works well. It moisturizes my face and neck all day. It is light to the touch.
1,Ive been using lancome and saw this and read the reviewa..I enjoy the sent and I like that theres no Alcohol in it..I am acne prone but havent had any issues yet like I read on a review..will continue to use this vs my $25 lancome.
1,"Most definetly worth the money. I love this blush, goes on so nicely and gives you a great glow! Beautiful color that lives up to the hype!!!"
1,"I was very happy to get this palette, now I wish it was offered in subscription form like some of the makeup we use daily is.  In this unnamed set you can do a lot of blending, sculpting, highlighting and concealing.  The product is nicely pigmented, it's smooth and applies well then blends out beautifully. I have normal to dry skin as I'm 59 years, this works wonderfully under my foundation.  I also use a silicone based primer,which works well for my skin type to give me the fresh, dewy look I love.You get a good amount of product for your money here, so this is well worth the cost.  What more can you say, if one is willing to repurchase a product then that says more than mere words."
1,Liked the pore tightening first two uses then &#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; it seemed like air may may ruined pump...It simply did not work after that. NOT for dry skin. Does not moisturize if you need that.
1,"Doesn't matter how my skin is when I woke up...If it's dry, this is my water (yes, it is actually a quenching feeling).  If it's broken out, this is my quick repair.  If it's cold or warm, it gives me the rosy cheeks I adore (without blush or pinching).  This product works really well for me. I have combination skin with an emphasis on combination.  Some days, super oily and others super dry.  Either way, hope mellows my skin the minute I put it on.  Sometimes later in the day, I seem to have a sheen over my skin if I am having an oily day, but overall I love love love this product.  A coworker gave me the 8oz one time for $40 and it has been a struggle to not buy another jar...I gave in.  The texture, the weight, and the results of this product are amazing.  I can always count on my skin returning to a natural and comfortable state as soon as I put this on.  As an added bonus, it really does exfoliate during the day....without having to do any hard work ;)"
1,"I have used this lotion for two years, it is comfortable lightweight and helps protect against sun damage.  I trust the Olay brand."
1,"I've been dying to find a replacement for my Remington wax core curlers that I've had for years. They finally gave out when I was in London and didn't use a transformer. My bad.This set is a bit bulky, but it does the job! I need something that gets REALLY hot, retains heat well, and has enough curlers for all my hair. While I wish it heat up a bit quicker, I can't complain as they get super super hot! They also keep the heat for a long time, which I need for my coarser, long hair.I need a few more curlers, but I'll live. I hate the tiny curlers (6 total) as they are teeny tiny and don't get super hot (or mb I just can't tell since they're so small in width). I do wish the set were packaged a bit more compactly. Also, the roller sizes are very specific for each: the bottoms of the rollers have a horizontal slot so they only fit in specific spots and the openings are set for very specific roller sizes! A bit of a nuisance for me, but most roller sets have something similar where the big rollers fit in specific places.All in all, a solid curler set that heats up in 15min (for the temp I want), gets uber hot, and retains heat. I've had them about a month now so far and am pretty pleased."
1,"After running around to so many stores looking for this color, I decided to try Amazon.  They have it. It was so easy to order and I got it right away.  I am 75 and this color looks so lovely on me.  I have been getting lots of compliments. Love it. I will keep ordering it from amazon. Easy to order, fast delivery and a great product."
1,"The Olay products are a true value.  The quality is good and so is the price. I can pay a much higher price and not have as good of a product. It works well. I'm never going to stop the aging process, nor am I going to receive a miracle, but I can do all that I can to take care of my skin. I can pay more. I can pay less.  Olay products are quality for a good price."
1,"As a rule, I stay away from tube tops. They don't stay, they don't make me feel secure and I have always felt they don't look good on me. Enter the ISB adhesive. I was dismayed when I had wear a dreamy tube dress for a friend's wedding as a bridesmaid. A beautiful bird in the gym whispered this product and I am so glad I used it. I used it generously too - for the strapless bra as well as the dress. Danced some in it too and all things were in place at the end of the night :)Both the dress and I are free of any traces of the product. Every woman should have this."
1,"I been using this product for the past 6 months from someone who recommnded it. I absolutely love it, i use it on my hair as well as all my girls hair in which all of them have different hair textures, it smells great and even softens the hair, i havent had breakage in my hair or any of my daughters, i use it daily as a moisturizer. I would recommend it to anyone"
1,HG face moisturizer. its the only kind i can use that wont break me out with repeated use. wish the spf were higher. i only use the classic formula with zinc.
0,Cool little device. But all it did was add moisture to my hair so it didn't hold curl because it was moist. (It takes a long time for my hair to dry with any amount of water in it).
1,I bought this for a coworker as a joke but it really it working! His nails are not stubs anymore.
1,Received product in perfect condition and timely.  Use it every day.Second one I have owned as I find the older you get the more you need magnification.  I broke my other one and plan on being more careful with this one.  Would order from company again.
1,"This is the most gentle brand available.  It contains 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide.  All other brands are extra strength and have 10%, which eats away at my face and burns.  This takes a few applications to fully rid my face of break outs, but it is worth the wait to avoid any burning or injury.  I have really sensitive skin and roseacea.  My dermatologist recommended this for me.  I am glad that I took his advice.  :)"
1,"I have been using this as a body soap for years ( never on my face) and that's a keeper, it keeps my skin smooth even when I do not use body lotion after. I notice it also gives my skin a glow that I do not get when I use other body washes. However , I don't know about clearing scars, clearing anything for that matter. For me this is just a good smooth soap, nothing more."
0,"I've been a Bare Escentuals BareMinerals user for about a decade. I usually buy direct, either from the store or online through the store's website. The last time I was out, I decided to check Amazon and ended up buying this. Unfortunately, the product I received through Amazon did not have the right consistency nor the right coverage that I've come to expect of the real BareMinerals.Recently, the real Bare Escentuals had a no shipping fee special so I ordered a container direct from them to compare. Right away, I became even more suspicious of the Amazon sold makeup. There are subtle marking differences between the two containers; the kinds of things you might expect a counterfeiter to get wrong. Also, when I shook out the two out side by side, the makeup in the Amazon container is significantly drier and lighter.If this is not the real BareMinerals, and truthfully I don't think it is, then I worry about what I was putting on my face for those few weeks. :-(Caveat emptor. If you want the real BareMinerals, I suggest buying direct from Bare Escentuals or via one of their stores. If you want a fake, your local drugstore has several knock-off mineral brands that are properly labeled (and even cheaper)."
1,this product came on time. was packaged poorly . this tube it self was dirty and scraped. I like this product because it does what it advertises but only for a temporary time.I would recommand this to a friend.
1,I bought this cologne for my nephew in Canada. He loved it. The only cologne he wanted to use is this one.
1,i have been using these for years to relax and this is the best quality one for the price. i love the sage color and the smell is to die for. i close my eyes and put this one and it relaxes me so much i fall asleep within ten minutes and it usually takes me 30 minutes. best buy in awhile
1,"Like the price, how well it works and the scent is not over-powering like other removers. Like the little wand that comes inside to get little misses when polishing my nails."
1,"This is my favorite OPI color, and it is no longer sold in stores since it was part of a collection.  I love it."
1,"I've been using this serum for years. It does what it claims: regenerates my skin! I first got to know it via a sample I received. As soon as I put the serum on my face, my skin instantly felt soft and smooth. After a few days of use, my skin continued to stay soft and smooth. When my sample was used up, I noticed my skin became not that smooth again, so I knew it was this serum that did the magic. Then I went to purchase this serum ASAP. I don't have sensitive skin, but I prefer the fragrance free one since I believe less fragrance, less irritation. I've been using it every night before bed, and never stop using it ever since! Sometimes I use it on my body skin, i.e. hands, elbows and knees, to keep them soft as well. The product has done a great job keeping up its quality over the years. Highly recommended!"
1,My grandson has dry & sensitive skin and his parents need to lotion him 3 times a day.  This cream generally goes on his face soothingly.  It keeps his face lubricated and helps minimize eczema when used diligently.  This is a quality name brand product.
1,"pretty and deep burgundyish red very vampy and sexy, this will be my winter/fall go to polish quick delivery and never a problem ordering from you Thanks."
1,"This is a great shampoo + conditioner, I have two Scotties, their hair can get pretty tangled if not brushed regularly, once I wash them with this it does help! (I admit i also use the conditioner by the same brand) but the shampoo helps. I wasn't sure about the Lavender & Mint sent when I was ordering it, but I did like it! And the scent lingers for a while on my dog's hair (up to a week, granted they don't roll around in the dirt) I also like that it's not tested on animals."
1,Works as said.  Bought to replace one we had used in our trailer.  This was about the same so had no trouble
1,"I've used this stuff on occasion for several years. It definitely makes a difference, especially in the summertime when I can sit in the sun by the pool for hours on end (make sure to wear sunscreen!). As it is still winter here in Minnesota, I use my blow dryer, which works just as well. In fact, I just put some in my hair, used the blow dryer for about five minutes, and I can instantly see a slight difference.I even used to use it on my heavily-bleached hair and never noticed any damage. Although, my best friend used to put Sun-In in her hair and found that her naturally curly hair seemed to stop curling. Despite this, she did have the most sensationally platinum blonde hair because of it!I am surprised that the reviews on Amazon and throughout the web are so mixed, but I guess results are very individual with this product. For me personally, it lightens my dishwater blonde hair into a nice beach blonde and makes it smell nice in the process. But if you're concerned about damage, I'd recommend lemon juice. It's messier (makes my hair crusty and requires an immediate washing) but you will get similar results. Sun-In works faster, though, if you ask me."
1,"This is the best face cream I have ever come in contact with. After first use you will notice the difference. After a week you will be shocked as to how amazing your skin looks. I am amazed at how well this product works. Reviva makes great products that are all animal cruelty free, I have not been disappointed by anything they make."
0,I did not seem much improvement with this product.  I was surprised because Olay has some good products out there.  Would not buy again.
1,"Opi is the only polish I've found that says on my nails more than a day or two.  I've tried many colors, and this is the perfect pink for me..not too bright and not too pale.  I like the fact that this one is slightly thin because it seems to dry more quickly even though I put on several coats."
1,Very high quality considering the low price. The only drawback is that it is highly scented. It has a perfume smell that doesn't appeal to me since I have a low tolerance to certain scents.
1,OPI is always my favorite...and now so is this color. It's a dull (not shiny) color...but that is just what I was looking for.
1,"Great color (usual OPI great color name, too!) Especially good for semi-bright, summer shade that will go well with a lot. Appears to resist chips, but I use Chip Skip with it anyhow, and OPI's top coat."
1,"I have been using Aveeno for a long time.  It is my favorite cleanser.  What can I say about it, other than it is a good product and does what it is supposed to do.  But just like anything else, you have to find the cleanser that works best for you.  I do not wear liquid make up.  I sometimes wear powder and blush, and I have tried other cleansers (Oreal, Neutrogena), but I like this best."
1,"This is one of my favorite reds, but I think it leans more toward orange. It is the most orange/red nail polish I can comfortably wear. Love it and highly recommend it, especially for dark skin."
1,The lavender version smells good.  It feels good when washing hands.  It's not harsh on hands.  I would recommend it.
1,"Solar Oil and Shellac Nail Polish is a must.  To take off Shellac you must use Acetone and it really drys your nails. I must put solar oil on my nails (yes over polish too) on my nails at least 5 times a day.  Especially at night before going to sleep.  My nails are only medium in length, so would hate to know what they would be like without my solar oil.  I like the big 4 oz. bottle to fill my smaller ones that I keep around the house and in my purse.  Love, love , love solar oil!"
1,"Happy with my purchase. Keeps skin clear and smooth. I bought this for my fine lines, and have noticed a slight improvement. That's all that can be expected from a topical product, so I am happy. Worth the money and since a little goes a long way, it lasts a while. I use morning and night, and use an SPF during the day."
1,"I would like to disagree with the advertisement and other reviewers on the claim that this product is ""non-greasy"". This lotion is not as greasy as Eucerin, which is very greasy (but also is the most moisturizing). This lotion is just as greasy and heavy as ""non-greasy"" Lubriderm, which I also find somewhat greasy and heavy.  What is non-greasy? I have found several lotions from Shiseido and Amore Pacific to be very non-greasy but they also cost about 3-5 times more than this lotion (based on volume).This lotion, however, does not LOOK greasy on my face, which might be the half of the value. It also does an excellent job of retaining moisture, but that is true of every lotion I have ever used.This lotion is also a decent value considering this is a 16 ounce size jar which is about 80% volume of a full roll of toilet paper (the jar is a circular shape as a toilet paper so I thought it would be a good comparison)If you are looking for an excellent moisturizer that does not look greasy, then this will do its job. But if you truly want a non-greasy feeling lotion, you are better off buying a higher quality lotion albeit at a higher price."
1,"So my hair has been dyed professionally before and I've always been left with a burning scalp and lots of hair fall afterwards.  I have very thick, coarse hair, so I knew I wasn't going to go bald but it was bad enough for me to worry about what effect the dye was having on my body.  I recently decided I wanted to change back to a blonder color but, being a grad student, I am on a shoestring budget and didn't want to pay to go to a hairdresser and have highlights done that just grow out within a month anyway.  So, I came across this stuff here on Amazon and selected the Wheat Germ Blonde.  The first time I used it my hair came out golden-red but only at the roots.  So weird.  Then I went out and bought a box on the Light Ash Blonde color to try and tone it down.  It did work a bit but there was still a bit of orange gold color to my roots.  This past time, I went to the store and bought a box each of the Light Ash and the Light Dawn Blonde.  I was very scared my hair was going to turn either full blown orange or go platinum.  I mixed half of the Light Dawn Blonde and half of the Light Ash Blonde into the squeeze bottle (I just eyeballed it) and crossed my fingers.  My hair came out a couple shades blonder, no hint of red or orange, and it has highlights!  So, I'm going to keep mixing half Light Ash into any of the colors I use and continue to gradually lighten my hair up. I want it to eventually be a medium colored ash blonde.  Also, I noticed the scent of this stuff as being kind of like licorice but with a chemical undertone.  Not nearly as yucky as the stuff the salons use, but I found it noticeable when I was applying it.  Also, my scalp did burn slightly when using the dye but I didn't have the hair fall like I did with the other salon stuff.  I strongly recommend finding a really gentle shampoo and conditioner if your scalp is sensitive.  I use the Giovanni 2Chic Avocado and Olive Oil Ultra-Moist Shampoo and Conditioner and they save my hair and scalp from utter destruction.  I also use keratin masks once a week to keep my hair from drying out.  Here's my advice to other first time users of this product and first time at-home hair dyers:-if your hair turns out orange or red, mix half of one of the ash colors with the shade you want to achieve the next time you dye.  Using the Light Ash Blonde by itself didn't have much of a dramatic effect on taking away the orange in my hair, but mixing it with the other blonde shade (Light Dawn Blonde) and then applying that mixture did have a big effect.-make sure you really mix the color before you put it on your hair.  The box recommends shaking the bottle for two minutes before applying, I set a timer to make sure I do a full two minutes.  Don't let it sit and settle after you have mixed it either, as this seems to mess with how the color turns out.-use the shampoo and cream conditioning treatment provided.  Remember to leave the conditioning treatment on for at least the recommended two minutes. This seems to help how the color comes out.  Then I followed with my regular Giovanni shampoo and conditioner and left that conditioner on for another couple minutes to really soothe my hair and scalp.-visit the Naturtint website and figure out the closest shade to your natural hair color.  These dyes are only supposed to lighten your hair a couple of shades lighter at a time.  Mine is somewhere between the 4N Natural Chestnut and the 8A Ash Blonde but the 8N Wheat Germ Blonde shade still turned my hair golden red at the roots when I didn't mix it with the 10A Light Ash Blonde.-don't be scared to use a lighter blonde color than what you want to achieve if you are using it to mix with one of the ash colors.  I certainly don't want to be platinum blonde, but the 10N Light Dawn Blonde mixed with the 10A Light Ash Blonde lightened my hair a couple of shades without turning it red or orange and instead left me with lovely natural looking highlights.  My hair is still a light brown/dark blonde color after using this mix of colors.-I wouldn't recommend buying hair dye off of the internet sight unseen.  It's best to go to the nearest retailer that sells Naturtint and pick out the shade or shades that you like and try them.  Once you figure out what shades work best for your hair then you can buy them from Amazon.-I think this hair dye really is made for mixing.  With the Light Dawn Blonde and the Light Ash Blonde colors mixed, my hair has natural looking highlights and avoids that tell-tale dyed hair look of monotone color.Overall, I recommend this hair dye.  Just don't give up on it if you don't get it right the first time and remember to be gentle to your hair and scalp."
1,i love this curling iron its amazing but i hate how your hair can get stuck in it but the price was amazing.
1,"I have an oily forehead with dry nose and cheeks. I get blackheads and sometimes acne, especially if I don't follow my skin reggie.The texture is white and thick, clay-like. It tingles on the skin. I let it sit on my face while brushing my teeth or during the shower, then rinse with cool water. I use every night, as a mask once a week.My skin reggie:Neutrogena Cream Cleanser every morningNeutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser OR Neutrogena Blackhead Cleaners as a wash every night, as a mask once a week.Formula 10.0.5 mud mask once a week.Apricot Scrub once a week.Change pillowcases every few daysUse a separate towel for face only, change every few daysWash face morning and nightFollow with moisturizer always and sunscreen for the day on top of moisturizerTry not to touch my face, don't pick blemishes"
1,"This is an amazing cleanser, I've yet to find one that works as well as this one does, and I've tried at least a 100 of them. The first time I used it, after showering I saw the difference right away. My skin was very smooth and softened, makeup went on much better too. My friends even commented and asked what I was doing different!!The product is a pearly white cream, nothing really special. The consistency reminds me a bit of clearasil, it's pretty thick. It lathers up very nicely though, and the smell is kind of a light citrus-y smell, nothing special there either. I have mild acne, and a few fine lines, and this cleanser really helps. I LOVE the effect it has on my skin, like I said nothing else really comes close, I'm pretty sure they sprinkle magic into this or something.I'm so glad they have it on Amazon, because it's not available at my store anymore. This is the only cleanser I've bought a second tube of, and I'm definitely going to stock up. Everyone should try this!!"
1,"I have read the reviews and saw this in every magazine touted as &#34;THE CLEANSER&#34; so I decided to give it a try since my proactive began to dry out my skin a bit and I wanted something gentler.  Well, I am a convert.  Here's is why :1.  I love the texture of my skin.  This leaves my skin remarkably soft and I must say my sunscreen and night creams go on much easier now.2.  I love the light smell it has as well - not overpowering.3.  I no longer use a toner since I tried using one after washing my skin with this but nothing was in my cotton swab so Purity is doing its job well.4.  I was worried it may make me break out but it hasn't.  I also use an organic tea tree oil after I use this so I know that helps.5.  Overall, I would say it is a cost saver since a pea size amount goes a long way vs. my proactive where I had to use more and it felt like it was stripping my skin lately.6.  I REALLY removes waterproof makeup.  Yes, I am used to using a make-up remover before washing but no need with this.  Waterproof comes right off and no feeling of that clumsiness when it's washed off.So, I am a convert.  I do love it and will stick to it.  A great buy."
1,"Well it's Nars so...I prefer to put a bit of a shimmer over, it's just a little bit not shiny for my taste. Also, over time it tends to run. Maybe need to use lip pencil or something."
1,I couldn't live without this! I came across the Badger Balm line by chance and picked up a few of their balms. For the price you can't go wrong! I have been using this every night since I rcv'd it and I have to say I sleep like a BABY when I use it. The few times I didn't I tossed and turned. I can't say enough great things about the sleep balm-a must have!!!
1,I really like that you can tap out exactly how much powder you are going to use and then lock it back up.  I hate it when lush spills everywhere.  I have been using this blush for a few weeks and I find that it stays on my face all day.  The container is also very sturdy.  I will buy this blush again.
1,"I LOVE this mask.  I have extremely oily, rough and acne prone skin, as well as large pores.  After I've had this mask on, my pores are much much smaller, my blackheads are much much better and my skin is softer.  I also break out less.  Can't beat this price, either!!"
1,I love Essie Nail polish. This color comes out like a pearl seashell color. I love this use this color and I sometimes use it as a layer up after I applied a darker color on the bottom. It adds an extra shine to the dark nail polish. I recommend this color.
1,"When I first got these, I was concerned over how old it looked. The cardboard box it came in was faded like it sat in the sun for a long time, and it was all beat up. But I thought I'll go ahead and give them a shot.I have the rollers in my hair right now and my first impressions are how hot they didn't get. I let them sit for a good 15 minutes before putting them in my hair and they weren't very warm. Every other rollers I've had get so hot that you can hardly stand to handle them, but these were barely warm at all. In addition, they didn't seem to grip my fine, straight hair very well. I had to reroll each one multiple times to get it to stay in.Disappointing. I'm going to wait until I take them out to see how they do, but my hopes are not high."
1,"I poured this witch hazel into a small, travel-size spray bottle to use it as a refreshing spray. Has a lovely, old-fashioned rosewater fragrance. Very cooling and soothing on sunburned skin, too."
1,"This is not so great as a one-and-only conditioner for me since my hair is pretty healthy. It's also pretty fine so It really tends to weigh my hair down. But I use it on the last 4 inches of my long hair and it keeps the length healthy. I noticed my scalp was a little oily when I was using only All Soft.If you have thicker, drier hair, this is THE BEST. The avocado oil keeps your ends looking great. Might not be great for finer hair though."
1,"This basically gives a &#34;your nails, but better&#34; look - it is a sheer and ladylike pink. Good for everyday or work wear as well as for more formal occasions. Easy to apply, goes on smooth, dries pretty quickly, and reflects the light beautifully. Recommended."
1,"I really love this! It reminds me of BedHead's After Party (smells different of course.)Nice cream to add to wet or dry hair. Makes my hair soft & silky feeling. It helps a LITTLE with taming frizzies, but not a huge amount.I would definitely buy again though."
1,"LOVE how my skin feels soft & smooth after using this mask. I do think it aids in the drying of pimples, and I've used it as a spot treatment - overnight AND very light (blend w/ q-tip) under makeup. It didn't dry me out too bad but I do recommend using a moisturizer after. I've only been using this for about 2 weeks, so it may help more as time goes on."
1,"Love this nail polish! It is the perfect nude pink color! It's very light, but so pretty! And so long lasting!"
1,"I love dark polish!  I was a faithful OPI wearer, but quickly switched to Essie; there are so many more colors, and Essie polish is much richer.  The polish last longer and are easy to find.  I purchased this with poor lil' rich girl, and both looked the same, but are absolutely different once you put them on."
0,"I tried this spot treatment for four months. I applied this salicylic acid treatment almost nightly to any acne blemishes. It burns pretty bad but, beyond that, I don't think it works. I ran out of this stuff a few weeks ago and my skin looks the same, if not a little better. I should mention that I may be finally adjusting to the ortho-tri-cyclen that I was prescribed to help with my moderate acne but, all I know is my skin didn't seem to improve at all with the use of this product."
1,"To be truthful, I can't use the stuff. I am alergic to fragrances and even just the slight fragrance that it has set my sinuses into freefall. The reason that I rated it like I did is because I gave it to my friend to use. She does not have my alergies. She is reporting that she uses it faithfully every night. I have to say that I see a good difference in her skin. It is looking so much softer and her face lines are much improved. Ok, don't tell her I told you that she is in her late 70's and her shin is much improved. I so jealous :). If they ever make one without a fragrance I will try it myself."
0,"I tried this again after 15 years, thinking by now it would be better than when I was younger. NOPE. I applied coat after coat, and still it looked like nothing. To make matters worse, it also smudged and smeared. Even the naked eyelash look was better than the messy look from this mascara."
1,"very happy with product, will order again  love the double sided point swab, never encountered these anywhere. I will order again"
1,Another high quality product that I bought to add to my homeade hair grease. My hair has been growing rapidly.
1,"This is a fine skin cream , it reduced pore size, improved my complexion's color and uniformity , didn't irritate it and didn't induce acne. I wear it daily prior going to bed and at afternoon if I am not going out ..definately improved my skin overall.Edit : after using this cream for more than 3 weeks now on daily basis I can say it has no effect on my age spots however, it does improve drastically pore sizes and makes my skin looks smooth and soft. will definately re-order"
0,"I've been blow drying my hair for 20 years and this is the worst blow dryer I have ever used. It takes forever to dry my hair and it doesn't give me the sleek results I'm used to. My hair dries to a wispy, flyaway state w frizz. It really doesn't get hot enough and doesn't produce enough air. Really terrible. Someone said it was heavy, but I find it lighter than most. It gets the job done just not well. I have to go over each section of my hair w a large curling iron to smooth the strands. I'm causing extra damage and wasting extra time for no reason. I'm going to go back to the Revlon line. It produces much better, quicker results."
1,"Not clumpy, never thick and the small brush lets me grab even the tiny lashes on the inner edge of my eyes without smearing. My favorite mascara."
0,This beautiful pinkish color looks great on my nails and is the perfect color for the spring and summer.  I apply a coat of gelcolor top coat over it put my nails under the curing lite for 2 min and my nails last for almost two weeks without a chip.I feel I must update my review.  I have only used this polish two times and it is already going on gloppy (less than 2 months old).  It has been sealed tight and stored with all my other polish.  My other colors that I bought locally are 2 years old and in better condition than this one.
1,"Decided to try this toner because I heard so much about witch hazel and rose petals. Besides the great smell, this toner does moisturize and cleanse. I haven't experienced it helping with shrinking the pores yet but I have confidence in time it will."
1,"I love it... even it is light in color, however the color will disappear once it dry.. amazing product for eye lashes"
1,always my dad's favorite.
1,Works very well keeps my skin hydrated and the smell is Devine. A lot of product for the money because a little goes a long way. Happy with my purchase.
1,This makes my skin feel soo good. I love Buf-Pufs. They are the perfect exfoliation tool. It's a must have!
1,"This CK One cologne smells so fresh, clean, and limey. It's a good size bottle and my husband is happy with it, so i am too!"
0,"This is the worst finger nail polish I have ever purchased. I have bought Essie before, but this stuff has no shine and it is like they put finger nail polish in it because maybe it was thick and out of date. I will never buy from this company again. What a rip off."
1,"My nail technician trains others in OPI products and uses them exclusively on my nails.  I normally get a french manicure (gel) on my nails with OPI products once every 4 or 5 weeks.  Just recently I started painting my own nails in between my manicures and have been getting amazing results with the Start-to-Finish.Using it as a base coat assures that the color doesn't bleed into the edges of my manicure (for when I want to go back to just the white tips) and also helps the color adhere well.  My technician did tell me that this base coat does adhere better to gel nails than bare ones, if that helps.  She also highly recommended that I do just three swipes (center, and each edge) with each coat.  Over-painting with each coat can cause some of the problems people have with chipping.Once I have my nails painted, top coated, and completely dry, I can get at least a week without chipping.  I even went on a camping/backpacking adventure and did not end up with a single chip."
1,"I love this product.  I use several times a day on my face,  love the scent.  I spray all over and use with the rose oil"
0,"This product did nothing for my hair growth and i took the pills as recommended.  Let me tell you it is so annoying to take 8 pills a day!  I have a life! I wouldn't recommend, I wasn't hoping for a miracle given the ingredients are vitamins and amino acids and I already was taking vitamins and eating extremely well. However, I was hoping to at least notice something. I have used for about 6 months since I had bought a package but will not repurchase."
1,Been using this every time I wash my hair for a month now. I still feel the itch. I don't know if it's working. It seems to less tea tree oil in this one than Nature's gate. The smell is ok - not amazing. Very light and delicate - much like the shampoo! I won't buy this again!
1,"You don't need makeup remover.  This product Philosophy remove all makeup.  I wash, rinse and wash it again gentle.  It works and it rid of blackhead, oily skin, and pimples.  I've been using 7 years after I saw on television HSN about new products &#34;Philosophy&#34; in 1994.  I love it."
1,"I received this roller set as a gift last Christmas.  I have fine, straight hair that just touches my shoulders, and I like curling it once and awhile for special occasions.On the plus side, I found that these rollers heated up quickly, and they gripped the hair well thanks to a combination of the combs on the rollers themselves and the included metal clips (although I would have preferred something a bit more updated--my old roller set from the 1970s had the EXACT same clips).  There are 8 medium-sized rollers and 4 smaller rollers, and this is the main flaw of this set.  First, these 12 rollers were barely enough to set all of my hair--and, as I mentioned earlier, my hair is relatively short (just touching my shoulders) and rather thin, so no way would this set work for someone with longer or thicker hair.  Second, the medium-sized rollers really didn't work very well for me, as my hair was too short for them (but yet there wouldn't be enough for someone with longer hair).  The smaller rollers were better, yet there was only four of them, so their use was limited.Overall, I was disappointed in this set.  There are definitely some good things about it--and it is certainly sized nicely for travel if that's your main purpose in purchasing it--but due to both the roller size and limited number of rollers, the usefulness of this set restricted."
1,I bought this for my skin but the product says do not use on skin. Opps.I am not into diluting things. I like whatever I buy ready to go. This is not that. This needs TLC.Overall I still would recommend to buy it because it smells good and I am still going to see what happens if I use it ona small part of my skin. It is 100% lemon. What in the world would happen. I will test it on a part of my leg first for a month.I'll leave another comment in a month or two.
1,Love how it's rich without being greasy and how it nourishes my skin. The scent is light and sex-neutral. Would recommend it!
1,"This is. Really great base oat. I'm someone who can't get nail polish to last more than a few hours without chipping. With the Seche Vite top coat I can go about two days. With this stuff and Seche Vite top coat, I can got 7-8 days without a single chip! Love this long lasting base coat!"
1,"Love this stuff. It's perfect for keeping my face soft and smooth, without breaking out. I especially like to use it at night."
1,"I use this polish to put over other polishes to give them a beautiful pearlescent look, love it!would buy again!"
0,"I don't know if this shampoo works as well as it used to, and I will probably never find out. This is not the same as the Suave Naturals Shampoo Daily Clarifying formula that I used to purchase. Pleeeeeze, Suave.... remove the scent which burns the back of the throat of other people in the next room, and replace it with.... well.... nothing! By the way, what is the point of the blue coloring?"
1,"I have thin hair that hates holding curls, but this is the only curling iron i've found that gives me curls that stay in all night- and my hair is still curled when i wake up the next morning after sleeping on it! the only problem is the spirals- they are a blessing and a curse. They are great when my hair will curl inbetween them, but sometimes it just won't go in between the spirals."
1,"I have purchased this mascara, tried others, and still come back to it. I do not however buy it from amazon anymore, because of this add on program...like JC Penneys, Ebay and oteher companies that made changes that eventually drove a lot of women buyers away, the same thing will happen if they keep this up, I dont like it but nevertheless, I dont buy as many products here as I used to but this mascara still is the best."
1,"I have begun to explore the Olay skin care products as the moisturizers and facial cleansers I usually use have become way too expensive, and friends have literally raved about the Olay skin care line.I recently tried ""Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum"" and the results are what I had hoped for. Just a few concentrated drops of this serum are super-efffective. Serums are made of very small molecules, so the skin absorbs them quickly and deeply. The thicker, heavier ingredients in facials creams form a barrier on your skin. That's great for locking moisture in. But it can also lock active ingredients out. Without these hindrances, the active ingredients in a serum penetrate your skin faster and more effectively. A good moisturizer should be used after the serum is applied and absorbed. However,during hot summer days, I find that I need not use a moisturizer if I apply this serum in the day time.The product certainty lives up to everything my friends have told me. Its feels great on application - very matte without any tackiness, and it is absorbed into the skin quickly. In fact, it feels lighter than the ""high-end"" product  I used before. Containing a highly-concentrated blend of amino-peptides, the serum seems to regenerate damaged skin, (in my experience), renewing the outer layer. The lightweight, velvety texture is a plus, as is the fragrance-free formula, which is important to me.I learned that one doesn't need to spend $100.+ to get a great result. However, please note that one's skin will not show improvement unless used regularly for at least a few months. It also helps to use a good facial cleanser, (Olay's Regenerist line has one), and Olay's Oil Minimizing Toner which removes residual oil, dirt and make-up after cleansing, without stripping the skin of its essential moisture. The toner restores the skin's pH balance. However, many women I know skip the toner. Please believe me, I am not a ""shill"" for Olay. I am just amazed  and enthusiastic that their Regenerist line appears to work as well as the very expensive skin products in illuminating my face and fading spots and redness.When I use the serum I don't have to use foundation to mask my skin's uneven tone. It is lightweight but not watery and absorbs in a matter of moments. I normally apply this twice a day, after cleansing in morning and evening, followed by ""Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream.""If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive skin care line, as I was, then I hope this review is helpful to you.JANA"
1,"Although I use Avalon Organic Rosemary volumizing shampoo, I love lavendar so much that I keep a bottle of this around too.  I use it as an alternate shampoo because I find that using one shampoo only long term means that some day soon that shampoo will no longer work.  This has no volumizing effect but otherwise it is also a lovely shampoo.  The odor is out of this world to inhale throughout your shower, almost like aromatherapy. I use it on the rest of my body after shampooing because I like the smell so much.  My hair feels wonderful after shampooing with this shampoo."
1,"I really feel guilty reviewing this product because I am 68 years old and have only sparse eyelashes. This, of course, should make mascara clump more, and most mascara does. This is one produce that is true to its advertisement, and a great color as well."
1,"Since this is a product review, I am giving five stars because the product is perfect. It's yummy fragrance, indisputable effectiveness along with its ease of use make it a must-have, especially if you are like me and have problem cuticles that peel, crack, bleed and hurt if they're not given a bit of TLC.  However, I paid nearly eight dollars, having become lazy and assuming the price on Amazon would be as good or better than any only to discover that I could have gotten it from Ulta or Beauty.com for under six. Totally my fault, I know that, but maybe this will help someone else who is in a hurry and about to do what I did because of it.Still, it's good stuff and a couple of bucks won't kill me -- but, still, most of us would prefer not paying more than we have to; it's one of the reasons we read these reviews, right?"
1,I bought this product to help with an itchy scalp due to having a weave and it helps a lot. You put it on your scalp and the itch stops immediately.
1,"I initially bought the hand wash/hand cream set because I thought the containers were cute and unusual ... but now I'm hooked on the scent of the hand wash ... a nice fresh/clean/earthy scent, and I now order the refill.  I get lots of compliments from guests, so I often follow up by giving them a gift set."
1,"I recently purchased this at a store nearby for almost twice the price. I'm so glad Amazon sells it. The cheapest way is to buy it in bulk which isn't a big deal because you're never going to NOT need dish soap. It cuts grease really well. Some people have complained about the residual smell but a little goes a long way and you need to rinse well, as with all soap."
0,"I've been using this for years now..and this time not sure if redken changed anything in the ingredient or the seller is sending some duplicate which is not actually redken..this is making my hair all frizzy and dry which is odd. Well, anyways I bought it so will use it and then buy one in another store to make sure if redken really has changed something on this conditioner/duplicate product and will discontinue using this ."
1,"I bought this color to change my look, just a little bit. I didn't want to be to drastic. I like the color because it also covers my gray hairs and it makes them look as though I have highlighted my hair with wine tones."
0,"I bought this because the price was good.  I was using a store brand for the same item, but since the price was good, thought I would try the name brand.  I hated the smell!  It is so bad!  I went back to the store brand."
1,This is by far the best toner I have ever used. I was worried at first about getting the rose scent but it is gentle enough that it is pleasant and not overwhelming. It works great on the skin and has lots of great ingredients. This is a good stable for anyone's facial routine.
1,"I have never had terrible acne (but isn't ANY acne kind of terrible?). I rarely but occasionally break out from stress or whatever hormones...who knows.  But anyway, I had read somewhere that Cocoa Butter helps with acne and I remembered thinking that it couldn't possibly help because it is so thick and greasy.  But recently I had a nasty little hint of oncoming acne that was threatening to become an ugly mess at a time when I really wanted to look good, so I tried it.  OVERNIGHT, clear.  Dinner with the ex--I looked amazing (well at least my skin was clear).My son is a preteen and hasn't had any real issues yet, but his face is very dry.  This product took care of that almost immediately as well, with no pimples or any issues that one might expect from something as oily as cocoa butter on the face of a hormonal 13 year old boy.  I did some online research and apparently the acne cure thing is pretty common.Also, I scratched the heck out of my leg about a year and a half ago and it left a nasty dark scar down the front of my leg. I have an olive complexion that scars very easily. I have been using this product and have noticed significant improvement in the color and texture of the nasty leg scratch scar.That being said, as other reviewers have noted--this product comes very hard.  It isn't something you think you can rub into your body.  Some melt it and spread it, some say they make into little cakes and use it that way.  That all sounds very clever.  I am lazy however.  I crack out a little piece and rub it in my hands until it softens then I rub it in.  That works great for me.  It smells incredible.All of the other ideas sound great too.  If I ever get that motivated, I will try them and update."
0,"i like redken's all-soft heavy cream conditioner so i thought getting a leave-in product from the same line would give equal results but was sadly mistaken. all this product does is make my dry hair look wet, like crunchy, out-of-the-shower, towel dried hair....why do i want this look from the 80's? it hasn't improved my hair at all and the smell is awful. maybe my nose is sensitive but it smelled like a mild perm solution when i first started using it. i guess i've gotten used to the smell since then and it now just smells like a mildly rancid lemon.i wouldn't even mind it if it didn't leave my hair looking wet all day, but that's the last thing i was looking for in a product like this."
1,Love this product.  Like that it is a spray instead on blotting on skin with a cotton ball.  Leaves skin feeling clean & smooth.
1,the bar is so big i cut in to 2 pieces. my skin feels like silk and smells wonderful.  love love this product.
1,"Where has this been all my life, gives life to my flat ironed hair loves it will be repurchasing as soon as I have to"
1,"This is a great cold-pressed castor oil.  This is a wonderful oil for the face - will keep you hydrated and stave off wrinkles.  You can also use this for the oil cleansing method to wash your face, I find it a bit to heavy for that myself.  I use this under my eyes, on my lids, on my lashes and on my forehead as a mask.  Its a great quality oil and an awesome one to have in every household."
1,'Yoga-ta Get This Blue!' is a very deep cobalt blue. The image shows it much lighter than it actually is. It dries to a very shiny creme consistency. It applied very smoothly and only took two coats for full opacity. I love it!
1,"I had tried this moisturizer back in my 20's a few times and didn't really like it, I felt it wasn't ""doing anything""... Well I didn't have fine lines then lol. Now at 35 this stuff is great! Creamy, easy to apply and leaves your skin feeling clean and moisturized. The smell is nice to! Great buy :)"
1,"I have been a natural 4c kinky chic for over 10 years. But, only recently (the past 3 months or so) have I done research to get a real regimen in place to keep my hair healthy. My hair is almost APL or armpit length. And, I am over 6 feet tall so my hair is almost 12 inches in the back. When I heard about the CG method or Curly Girl method, I thought it would be a great match for me since I was having serious breakage and dryness issues. This basiscally consists of a hair care regimen that removes sulfates (found in most shampoos) and other harsh cleansers from the hair cleaning routine. Also, this method includes regular co-washes or conditioner washes in place of traditional shampoo cleansing.I chose this conditioner because although it is not 100% natural, it is very very mild. It has a great smell and feel. It has coconut, nettle, honey, and other humectants that have really improved the texture and shine of my hair. Since using this product (even when I use shampoo) I find that my hair is less tangled, I have fewer fly-aways, and the frizz is diminished. Also, I can mix this conditioner with my deep conditioners or detanglers to add slip.What really sold me on the conditioner was the results on my 12 month old daughters finer but coarse 4b hair. I was having a hard time keeping it moisturized. But, I found that this conditioner is even gentler on her hair than her all-natural, sulfate and paraben free baby shampoo. I have been co-washing her hair with a small amount of this conditioner and I have immediately seen the results (after only one week).I am sold. I prefer this flavor because of the ingredients. But, I am going to try some of the others soon. I really like all of the natural ingredients in this coconut version. Coconut is probably on of the best oils/products for hair and I swear by it in my regimen so that is part of the reason why this conditioner is so great. It is good as a co-wash, you can add to it and use it as a base for a deep conditioner, you can use it in a pre-poo for detangling or you can use it as a leave-in for a wash-n-go. I have started using the Everlasting Sunshine flavor for my detangler. It smells wonderful and gives great slip.I get it for $1.50 or less at Walmart, Target, or CVS. It goes on sale regularly. I won't replace it anytime soon. Buy it in bulk because it is just that good."
0,"I can't even use this color!! I have to run it under hot water to open, the day it arrived, and you can paint but as soon as you screw the cap on, done!! Forget about mixing it between coats!"
1,"I used to wear false lashes every day. It's really a hassle to put them on every morning. Once every two weeks I can put on these lash extensions, takes about 30 minutes, and fill in the lashes as I go along and I can go months without having to put the lashes on again.Advice: Clean your natural lash very very well before applying. They will fall off if you apply them to eyelashes which have makeup on them."
1,I have struggled with acne for over 20 years. This product seems to be clearing up my skin by unclogging my pores. My skin looked and felt polished after the first use.  It seems to be ridding the surface of dead skin as well making it that much easier for me to extract deeply clogged pores. I'm very happy with this product. Now I have to tackle these acne scars from damage done pre-Purity cleanser!
1,"This moisturizer was good, did not cause any acne, provides a somewhat dewy finish.  Not the best texture and perhaps alittle bit liquid like.  A decent buy."
1,I bought this for my son-in-law as a birthday gift because my daughter requested it. It smells really nice on him. Very masculine and clean. Excellent fragrance and great quality.
1,"i have tried many face lotions, moisturizers and creams, but i always keep switching back to olay because its the best!"
1,Great price for this amount I dry off every day with this oil. My skin is so much softer and younger looking from using this oil. I use it all over my entire body except my face and I love it.
1,"Today was actually my first day wearing fake eyelashes, well I put them on this morning with this glue & Ive been busy all day, its 12AM now and my eyelashes are still on strong even after not doing so well applying them lol"
1,"...that's all I can say! This shower gel is out of this world... it smells better than the perfume even, and that's saying a lot!"
1,"This is a terrific all natural treatment for hair and scalp. Although it is described as an oil to be poured on the scalp, mine came solidified. This was not surprising due to the cold weather. However, it has not liquefied even at room temperature. Nothwithstanding, it is easy to apply. It does melt in the hand. When solid, it is a dull olive color with a mild herbaceous smell. Once applied, the aroma dissipates. Apply one or two teaspoons and massage into the scalp. You then comb through the hair and leave on for a minimum of two to three hours before washing out. I generally apply it twice a week and leave it on overnight. It washes out easily. I must say I was impressed with the results. My hair is fine and color treated. Over the years it seems to have lost  both its luster and volume. After using this regularly for over a month, my hair looks and feels healthy. There is genuine shine and plenty of body. My hair seems to have grown faster but not thicker. I occasionally get a little snow on the mountain, so to speak and since using, have not noticed any grey. I think this is a good product that can help boost condition and shine. Recommended."
1,"I put this on subscription/save, it is much lower than in retail.  I use it every night, it takes several weeks to see a visible difference, but you will.  I recommend micro dermabrasion to clear skin and allow better absortion.  I can tell a big difference, my skin is much clearer, and smooher.  This is a very good product, and amazon offers it so those of us on a budget can afford it.  Add a good diet rich in vegetables,, exercise, sunscreen, plenty of water and you are on your way to younger lookig skin.  I am 63.  I have always used a skin product since my teens.  I live in the desert so it is very important to keep the skin nourished.  I have always been told, I appear much, much younger than I am.  The key is, diet, exercise, attitude, and skin care.  Go for it.As as added bonus, I went Vegan.  30 days now.  With a Vegan diet, the first thing you will notice while using this product is a reduction in red patches, and oiliness of the skin.  You will see a glow to the skin.  Smoother.  I had breakouts on my nose area, sorta pimply things with white puss, yuck, since I went Vegan I don't have these any longer.  So using this product along with the Vegan diet you will see a marvelous transformation.  People at work have taken notice, making comments like, you look younger, you look great, etc.  Nice for the ego.  I say go for it, it is easier than you think."
1,OK the shampoo surprised me with how well it worked and then the conditioner surprised me too. Happily it worked great and made my hair very smooth. Glad I found these two products for my straight hair.
0,"I've bought oils for the past 25 years everywhere from the bazaars of Saudi Arabia to the fine perfumiers in Paris and the French Quarter in New Orleans and have always been a fan of oils vs perfumes. For years I've made my own scents from oils mixed with various carriers as well. Disappointingly weak single note fragrance doesn't last long at all..maybe a half hour...poor quality and very weak. At this rate, it'll be gone in a few days. Not a good value for the $$$ would not buy again."
1,"I use this product twice daily, am and pm.  It is a perfect toner and feels great.  I have used it for years and will continue to do so."
1,This liquid liner is every bit as good as higher-priced brands and I highly recommend it. The brush is both precise and flexible - it's easy to draw a tapered line for a great feline effect. The color is rich and lasts all day and yet removal is a breeze. Love it!
1,"i work different shifts and this is part of my problem with insomnia, sometimes I work days and sometimes nights. I went to see my doctor about this problem and he put me on Ambien but I woke up feeling groggy so I stopped using it. I tried this on a whim. I got one for myself and one for my daughter who is a senior in HS. As I get into my night time routine i simple rub this behind my ears, on my wrist, lips, and on my temples. It relaxes me. I have a fitbit that records my nights sleep. I was averaging 5 hours a night and i had several periods of restlessness, I would lose a total of 3.5 hrs! this is time I was in bed but not sleeping. I would take more than an hour to fall asleep and when I awoke in the middle of the night it took quite some time to fall back asleep. Now I fall asleep within minutes and I stay asleep. I get a total of 8 hrs of sleep now. I wake up feeling awake and not tired, I feel so much better!My daughter who also has sleep issues, also loves this product. She is a light sleeper and we are a family of six so there is always something going on around us. She says she has a deeper sleep and doesn't remember hearing any background noise. She is in love with this so much she keeps it under her pillow.  2oz doesn't sound like much but it only takes a little bit. I love it!"
0,It gets too hot and is hard to handle without burning myself. It will go out for a garage sale.
1,"I bought this shampoo because I tend to breakout with regular shampoos.... This shampoo left my hair super dry, almost straw like... I wouldn't recommend it."
1,A perfext color match.
1,"You can see through these when you are in the tanning bed, and also them seem a little large and cover up part of the under eye on your face, so you still get raccoon eyes"
1,I use it every day and it keeps my hair moisturized and soft - my hair is now very manageable
1,"Silky, absorbs well and leaves a smooth matte finish. This makes it a good primer. However, as a face cream it's only average, and did nothing for my skin. I prefer retinol products, as those make my skin glow and prevent blackheads at the same time."
0,"I started using Philosophy products with their set, called something like Makeup-Free Skin. This was in there, and I used it for a couple of years. It was my first jump up from drug store brands. I liked it well enough, but the lack of spf was kind of a bother, and I never really felt like it sunk in. In the summer, my skin can get kind of oily, so this may be part of it, but even right after washing my face it just wouldn't soak in, so I'd have to wait a while to put any makeup on. I was very conscious that I had moisturizer on my skin. Like I said, though, I used it for about two years, so I didn't think it was bad at the time. Since I've switched to other things, I can't imagine switching back to this."
1,"This is magnificent!  I am 56 with very fair skin and somewhere along the way lost my &#34;pretty&#34;. I reevaluate my skin care and makeup every year at my birthday and recently decided to try the Regenerist products. I use the Deep Hydration as day cream.This morning, I cleansed, used the skin tightening serum, and moisturized with this product.  I was sidetracked before I could start my makeup, and when I returned to my dressing table, immediately started choosing a lipstick. It wasn't until I had applied the lipstick that I realized I had no foundation or blush on!  What!!!???My complexion has improved drastically.  No more redness on my nose and chin.  I don't need to use a primer before foundation.  I barely use concealer anymore.I love the pre-measured dispenser top, and that this does not have an SPF (I find them irritating) or fragrance."
1,"This little hair dryer really does the trick! I will admit for those with a thick head of hair this may not be the best option, but for me, with my long, thin and falling out hair its perfect. It doesn't get SUPER hot which is good because my hair is easily damaged so having a hair dryer that does not scorch my hair is a plus. I have not owned a hair dryer for the last 10 years but I was told that by blow drying my hair it will help natural oils come out that air drying doesn't release and so far I am very happy with the product. It comes with a diffuser and other small attachment as well. I love it!"
1,"All natural, gentle (DOES NOT STING), very light fragrance goes away when dry, and it helps relieve acne. Couldn't get better than that!P.s. Walgreens purchase, June 2011, paid around $6 for the bottle. It goes a long way. I use cotton squares to apply it."
1,"I use Neutrogena Body Clear in lieu of other shower gel or soap rather than in combination with it. One thing I like about it is it takes much less of this scrub to be as effective as larger quantities some other body washes I've used - one bottle lasts several months for me. It is also much harder to squeeze out of the bottle. Once you get down to the end of the bottle, you have to pry off the cap to get it out - not exactly convenient. The odor is a little bit too sterile for my tastes, but it seems effective as an exfoliator and leaves me feeling clean. While it hasn't really combatted my minor body acne/KP that I can tell, it has kept it under control. I haven't found anything better in effectiveness or bang-for-buck in terms of shower gel or bar soap. I recommend it."
1,"My sister visited me a while back and GAVE me a bottle and said-""Just TRY it..PLEASE!""...well I did and I love it. It makes my skin smooth and supple and has a tone ""evening"" quality.Now I can RAVE more as I found it here on Amazon and can REALLY save on the Subsciption plan!  yahoooo"
1,"This makes old nail polish come back to life. I am glad to have found it and I highly recommend,"
1,"This is the only sunscreen that doesn't make my face break out. I love it and I always get compliments on my skin when I'm using it every day. Highly recommended, especially if you have sensitive skin!"
1,This is one of the only conditioners I continue to buy because it does what it advertises. My hair is WAY less knotty and WAY more healthy with WAY fewer split ends than when I do not use this product. Even if I don't use this product everyday (I usually use it a few times a week) it does the trick. This bottle has lasted me MONTHS!
1,I bought this mosturizer based on other customer reviews and I was not disappointed.  I was looking for a natural cream free of harmful chemicals at a reasonable price.  This one fit the bill and it smells awesome to boot!
1,"I bought this soap for my husband and the first time he used it to wash his hands, I walked into the bathroom and the scent was heavenly!  (I made him slice me off a sliver since I'd only bought one in this scent.)I've purchased and used many Plantlife soaps and am never disappointed.  Their excellent products are all natural and last for months.  I highly recommend all of their soaps.  They make fabulous gifts to add to gift baskets for friends and family."
1,"GOES ON MATTE which i hadn't even considered until after it had shipped and was already in transit. Which was nice because I'm Jamaican/Mexican with a medium brown complection that looks nothing like the color of the product in the picture.I have incredibly oily skin, this product has not eliminated, but has done wonders for keeping the gross oily spots at bay, for the most part anyway.The only con and the one reason it isn't 5 stars is that i still have shine, but not nearly to the degree that it was before. this has done wonders for my self esteem. I would highly reccomend to anyone who has shine problems :)"
1,I could not believe I really found this shampoo brush.  It is just like the one I used at home when I was a kid...even the color is the same.  Only diference a good one...it was rubber then and vinyl now.  And it works the same...gentle enough not to hurt the head but strong enough to give the scalp a workout and really get the hair clean. Oh....and that was 70 years ago when I last used one.  Great product still!!
1,"Most ""moisturizers"" are oil-based.  However, it is really water that constitutes moisture.  This product has a component that attracts humidity from the air and binds it to the skin and hair.Oil-based moisturizers can only seal in the water that is already there.  When my skin is struggling in the winter, I use Sea Plasma first, give it some time to work, then top it off with some oil-based moisturizer to seal in the results.If you are skeptical that a watery-like substance such as Sea Plasma can actually provide moisture, I would strongly encourage you to give this a try.  Once you see how it works, you will probably not want to be without it."
1,"THIS PRODUCT DEFINITELY GETS RID OF AGE SPOTS.A little goes a long way and you can use on your face!!  and also hands or other places where you have age spots that bother you.  I recommend for anyone who is wanting to get rid of those dark brown spots.  It's the best product I've found for getting rid of age spots.  I've tried the home remedies, herbal recommendations but nothing worked like this!"
1,"This serum is very rich and moisturizes well.  Unfortunately, I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, and I broke out in a minor rash.  So, I can't say if it really works because I can't use it."
1,"The reason why it scared me is because this is my first time dying my hair and once my hair dried, it didn't look at all like the color. My hair looked like my natural color only with pink blotches here and there. I went to bed and the next day my hair color looked a little better and my hope was restored. I took a shower and noticed the water going down the drain was pink and I assumed the color was still washing out. When my hair dried this time, the color changed again! Now I'm watching my hair color as the days pass and it seems as if the color is still adjusting to the color on the box. So if you experience the same thing I am, don't panic. The color comes in eventually."
1,"I must admit when I first purchased this product I was a little skeptical because most Eucerin products I have got have been way too rich for my skin even when it claims to be lightweight .  Another reason I was skeptical was because I have never actually seen this product in the store by the other SPF face lotions.  However, I love it.  It is very lightweight and a little goes a long way.  Also the bottle size fits perfectly into my skin care organizer.  I think I will be purchasing this product from now on instead of my beloved Aveeno."
1,Love this facial cleanser!!  It's gentle but removes all makeup and doesn't leave your face stripped and dry!!  I have dry skin and it leaves it moist!!
0,"Purchased this because of the claims that people saw a difference in 1 day.  I am NOT one of those people sadly.  I have dry skin and experience hormonal break-outs from time to time.  I didn't notice a difference at all after using this product.  Maybe it's for younger, or even oily skin."
1,"Much narrower than qtips, these are great for neatening up polish mistakes and overdone brows. For nails, are almost as precise as old-school cotton over orange wood stick. Very handy to have at home when you need them."
1,"I am makeup artist and always need to have mirrors with me. This is the perfect size. I recommend it,"
1,Useful inexpensive addition to my drawer of creams to treat my dry skin both day and night. This alpha hydroxy anti wrinkle cream gets used day and night while the others sit around waiting forever.
1,I used the toner today after doing an at home facial and OMG it smells good first of all.  I didn't expect that because I never thought to smell it once it arrived.  It goes on soothingly and refreshes the skin.  I'm glad I purchased this product.
1,"This stuff really works.  I typically use it twice daily:  once in the morning and once at night.  In the morning, I typically let it dry and then apply a sunscreen moisturizer.  My acne has gotten better, my skin is smoother, and dark spots have gotten lighter.  At 6 fluid ounces and 10% glycolic, it doesn't pay to buy more expensive products that come in a smaller size like the souffle (which I also have)."
1,The Emerita Pro-Gest Natural Progesterone Cream seems to work well in taking the edge off my night sweats. Though I think I finally found the magic bullet for that: low carbs! Between doing a low carb diet and this cream my rampant night sweats are 100% gone. What a blessing that is. I will continue to use this cream if I start up on carbs again!
1,"Affair in Red Square is my FAV go-to color for my toes, and the best for nails too especially at July 4th, Christmas, and Valentine's day!"
1,"Not every red has to mean you are ready to get down.  Essie's Very Cranberry is warm red that is feminine and flirty, but definitely casual.Pretty much your standard awesome essie quality - long lasting, average chip resistance, great finish,. Color is true to the picture."
1,"I have always seemed to have flaky, peeling, very weak nails which i do believe is part nutrition and part genetics. I found this on pinterest and gave it a shot. I love it, my nails seem to grow faster but are stronger too. I can tell they curve more which is a sign of strong nails and they are not rock hard but there is a significant difference since i started using this product.The bottle was much smaller than i had thought but it really went  a long way, i used the whole bottle and must have gotten at least 30 applications using it on a daily basis. The best part is that it dries extremely quickly. The directions say use it once a day and i could get up to 4 coats on before it would start to chip and even with that many coats it never really built up on my nails, it was as if it soaked into them instead.The directions also say to stop using it when your nails begin to become healthier so i stopped after one bottle but bought another because i want to use it in the future to keep my nails strong."
1,"If you want organic and natural..........Dr. Bronner - Organic Citrus Bar Soap, 5 oz bar soap.....They are a good line of products!~"
1,"I brought it for my boyfriend who has itchy feet. It seems to be a problem from within because he has minor signs of athletes feet. However, I brought the Neem pills, cream, and soap with hopes of helping this problem. He noticed his feet feels better when he uses the cream everyday. The pills are working his system like never before (regulated his bowel movements), and the soap he is not sure, but let's it sit on his feet a while before washing off. It has been almost a month and I notice he has more energy when waking in the morning as well as little to none outbreaks on his face. We will continue to try it out."
1,"I am clumsy when it comes to applying mascara - I sweat, I hold my breath, yet I always manage to put mascara on my cornea - with regular mascara, that is. So I spent a long time looking for a mascara with the tiniest wand possible and one that doesn't smudge and sting my extremely sensitive eyes. I am glad that I found the perfect one for my with this Maybelline Lash Discovery Mascara! Since the wand is so small, it picks up just enough mascara to coat my lashes both top and bottom and it lasts all day even when my eyes get watery. I'll never look at another mascara again!"
1,"Out of all the eyelash curlers I have tried this one is the one that has been doing a great job. I have big eyes and natural long and full eyelashes so it's a little hard for me to use just any curler, but this one is a good size and it works perfect for me."
1,"If you're looking for a blue-based red that doesn't have any orange in it, this is the perfect shade. It's very sexy, and so rich. I love it."
1,My skin wasn't over-sensitive to the retinol in this cream. Keeps my middle-aged skin hydrated and line-free (as much as is possible given my over 60 age!). Good value for price
1,I use this product in the winter time.  I find that it is not as harsh or drying like the other brands.  I only use it on my face. I can't imagine ingesting it but that's just me.
1,"Nice moisturizer, under makeup, I also use Olay regerist serum, underneath the cream. It works well, and has SPF too."
1,"I recently decided to begin taking better care of my skin. I've always had pretty good skin, but now that I'm getting older I figured I should start really watching what I put (and don't put) on it. I read online (mostly Beautypedia) about the great effects of Retinol on the skin, so I began my search for a good Retinol product I could use at night. I have used products across all price ranges, but no matter how many high-end moisturizers/skincare products I try (I used to love Laura Mercier), I usually find myself coming back to Neutrogena products because they are well-priced (especially now that I'm on a student budget) and effective. I was very happy to discover that this product is rated a &#34;BEST&#34; on Beautypedia, and one of the cheapest of the kind.So far, I love how it feels on my skin. I have somewhat sensitive skin, so I prefer unscented products, which this one is. It hydrates my skin and makes it glow, and my skin is usually still soft in the mornings, despite being quite dry naturally. I honestly haven't noticed too much of a difference in my skin, but it may be because I haven't begun to develop wrinkles yet. But I think that long-term use of this product will probably help prevent wrinkles from developing anytime soon!"
1,"This is one of my favorite nail colors, especially when I go away on vacation.  Bought my own bottle years ago but was running low.  Glad to have found it here on Amazon and ordered 2 more bottles to stock up!  Color is a shiny, vibrant fuschia pink/purple blend.  Very eye catching"
0,The color shown on the product page was different from what I received. I was aware of this possibility but took the risk. Turned out it's yet another lesson not to buy colored nail polish based on online pictures.....ah!!
1,"I saw Happy to Be in an email announcement from Clinique when it first came out.  I wasn't really interested in trying it out because I thought I'd like Happy Heart but don't.  I was shopping in a department store one day and saw that if I purchased the $80 bottle, I got a nifty little tote bag with a very cute, small size bottle of the perfume.  I couldn't resist!Let me just say, I love the bag, but not the perfume!  It's too citrusy...  I like subtle perfumes and this one is definitely strong!  I think of the Clinique perfumes, I'll stick with Happy although I now own the whole ""Happy"" set."
1,This product is great. I have only usrd it once it makes my hair feel like its full and thick
1,I use this brush when I'm blow drying my hair to get the little curly baby hairs up in front. works fantastically for that
1,"Overall it is a nice brush. I like that there's not little ball ends on the bristles that will fall off over time... that was my problem in the past... It seems that i will hold up pretty well too, which I'm really happy about. I have pretty thick, long hair to mid back and it goes through just fine with it's dry, but a little harder when it's wet. Maybe I don't have enough conditioner in my hair for it to go through smoothly idk! I would recommend this brush if you want a quality brush."
1,"this smells good but unfortunately the scent doesn't last long :( as often as id have to refresh it, it wont last long, guess ill order the actual perfume the next time instead of the cologne, also noticed it smells almost identical to another cologne called 5th avenue."
1,"It's hard to know how to review this. I've been using it for a few months and while i haven't noticed any radical changes in my skin (my fine lines are still there), it is still my favorite moisturizer. I decided on this product based on the review at beautypedia.com, it seems to be a reliable product. It goes on very smoothly and dries quickly, you don't need to use too much. It does smell slightly like sunscreen lotion, but I don't mind. I like the pump design, and if you have read up on moisturizers you might have heard that you shouldn't use any product in a jar because it is constantly being exposed to air and bacteria. The packaging, spf, and anti aging aspects are unbeatable at this price (mine was $14 on Amazon at the time)."
1,"I love this color for fall.  It is a little darker than what it appears in the photo and it dried a lot darker than it looked in the bottle (which I know is typical, but seems more so with this color).  It went on opaque in only one coat and is shiny without a top coat.  This is only my second Essie nail polish, but I really like the quality and they have a lot of great colors I would like to own, so I intend to buy more."
1,"i made the mistake of trying a bunch of new products at once so i dont know if this actually was helping my acne or if it was the coconut oil i started using but the pills didnt taste gross, it was a very simple product to use"
1,"I was surprised there was no dropper (any type for that matter) when I opened this.  I have a diffuser and I tipped the bottle of this to slowly get it in there and it dribbled down the side and landed on my counter top instead of in the diffuser.  I just had to adjust the position of the bottle in the air so it would dribble into the diffuser and not on the counter.  It's a little disappointing, since I buy other Now Foods oils which have some sort of dropper.  I just wish this one did.  It would make things easier.  Otherwise, great lemon smell and product!"
1,I have very rosy and pulpy cheeks that I'm not a fan of. So I use this concealer everyday with my foundation to cover any redness that I may have. This is my seventh tube. I love it.
1,I have sensitive skin. This lotion calms down itchy dry skin very well. I always keep it on my counter and use it all over my skin.
1,I now have a new favorite color in my large nail color collection. I am wearing this color today and I'm sure it will hold up because its OPI and they have great staying power. I will order again.
0,These don't hold my hair back like I thought they would. They probably don't give you a headache but you'll get one anyway when you look at yourself in the mirror and notice you look hideous. I didn't care for these.
0,"This product was not what I had expected. For one thing, this product does not even keep the lashes stuck to you for long. However, the upside to this product is that there is no tearing of your regular lashes when you remove the false ones. Overall, this product was not worth the money. The seller was expedient in their delivery, and I received this product before the expected delivery date."
1,The price was reasonable so I decided to give this a try.  It goes on easily and does a good job on my extremely dry skin.
1,This color comes out a deep purple gray on me.  I love the deep fall look without appearing too goth or otherwise wild. Keeper!
1,"I use this cleanser when the weather gets hot and humid.(only around oily T-zone. Not around eyes)Or, when I am lacking sleep and know that the troubles are going to show on my face.Contains Benz. Peroxide which makes this cleanser very effective and quick.And I like the cool, refreshing feel after washing my face with it.This cleanser is more affordable than Proactive or Murad products but as effective as they are(if not better)!I would recommend this cleanser to others."
1,"I love this oil because it's so versatile. I buy it because it is lightweight, practically odorless and it mixes well with other oils. It's a head to toe oil for sure!"
1,"I live in a humid climat,am mid 40 and have very dry skin, except on my forehead at times??About 2 years ago I started getting adult acne, and it would not clear up no matter what I used.This is now my routineEvening: i wash my face with Aqua Glycolic Facial Cleanser. The description says put the cleanser on your dry face, I noticed that I use much less of it when my face is slightly damp. Make sure to wash your hand really good, any soap will do before applying. Massage on face, i am very sensitive to smells and this product even removes all my eye make up !I love to use Rosewater or any of the toners from lush (you can also find them on amazon) Tea Water etc.does not have to be the expsensive $ 28 sephora rosewater, which smells heavenly but wow the price!After the rosewater or any other toner spritz a bit over your face, neck, chest and with about 3 drops (I put them in my hands) rub all over . It is also safe to use around the lip area.I immediatly follow with a) either eqyptian healing creme, use only a very very small amount, I like to put this especially on areas that did still have some remaining acne healing going on. b) my preferred 98%of the time item i use after the hyaluronic acid is the reviva dmae Firming serum (all over the areas)My daughter also tried out the dark spot remover from reviva and their products are excellent ! will definitely try their hyaluronic acid as well in the future.I then use either any kind of moisturizer from the dead sea products(cheap ones) or any l'oreal creme, you will only need a very small amount since you are kind of layering all the products.But no worries, at least for me it did not clog pores and it indeed did clear up all breakouts !!! for the first time ever.I also like to use argan oil or maracuja oil, no big difference except the price (argan is cheaper)Lip lines, fine laugh lines, lines on my forehead are clearly deminished (no they will not disappear !!!!let's be realistic) My skin looks as good and fresh as it did in my early 30th.Morning routine, I only wash up with water, add the spritzes of toner, then the acid serum, the reviva firm serum BUT only over the lip ,laugh and forehead lines ! I do NOT finish with a moisturizer as i found it slightly makes my make up slide off. (you must put something on top of the serums otherwise your skin might dry out and flake) I found Mally Face Primer does work really well.I currently use MAC foundation, that I slightly buff in with a brush and my skin once again finally looks flawless, I still wish it would be a bit more dewey, but found when applying luminators, some take your make up off even if you use only a small amount. Bobbie Brown has a foundation with dewyness, but I did not find a good color match. I am a NC 40 in MAC. Try several samples between the NC 35 and NC 40 range if you have the average skin color.I think overall I finally found my perfect cleansing routine, never thought i would be to 99.9 % acne free !Hyaluronic Acid definitely gave my complexion an overall evenness, restored some moisture and definitely deminished the lines , especially also on my chest and neck, which really can make you look so much olderHope this product works for you , yes it seems like runny water as some negative reviewers commented. But give it a shot , try it for at least a month . Good luck !"
1,"I haven't seem life-changing results, but there definitely is an improvement in the number of skin eruptions, as well as in the tone and surface of my aging skin. I will continue to use it."
1,"I was told by my dermatologist that she could only strongly stand behind two products for moisturizing. Eucerin and Cetaphil. Since my skin is so dry, especially in winter and having to be on medications that dried up my skin even more, I have tried both. I think they do an equally outstanding job at ridding cracked, dry, red skin, the thing about Cetaphil (specifically the cream in the jar -- not the pump lotion) is that it is not even a tad bit greasy compared to the former. It eliminates dry skin within a few hours. My friend who has to wash your hands eight times a day or so was struggling so much due this winter. Both of her children also have hands that look so chapped you would think that they were sunburned. I bought this to give her a sample of as well. She keeps it right on the counter, and is one of the best testimonials of how well this product works. Besides its effectiveness, the odorless, nongreasy, tasteless, very thick and potent moisturizer to me is the gold standard for any topical cream that I have ever come across. I use it on scratches that I get very easily during the winter, I use it after shaving, even to calm down the sunburn over aloe & vera. At this price for two jars, it's a steal and depending on how liberal you use it, but jar will last at least a couple of months for one person. Just such a great product at a reasonable cost rather than paying an enormous prices for names like Avon or oil of OLE."
1,"I have been using Anti-P for my entire life, but I am trying to minimize the risk of building up metals and other chemicals in my body.  I ordered this product and am using it and it seems to be working just fine.  It has absolutely no scent and the ingredients all look safe.  I am pleased and will be odering more barring any unforeseen problems with it."
1,i loveeeee this brush although the handle fell off very easily i still use it its like the perfect brush to use!!!
1,My skin is oily in some spots and acne prone almost everywhere. This mask smoothes out my skin somehow and makes a bit clearer. I like it.
1,"This is the perfect red shade out there. Not too dark, not too light. It looks good on all skin tones and goes with everything. It's a shade every girl should have in her collection."
1,"Better than any more expensive ones out there, it brought my skin to the next level of smoothness and softness. Quite amazing when followed by a shower oil. I recommend using these gloves, and while your pores are still open in the shower steam, use some coconut oil all over your body. Amazing."
1,Bare Minerals foundation is truly like your own skin.  The air light powder foundation buffs on like feathers and blends in with your own skin so perfectly you truly do not know it's there.  It is healty for my skin expecially with the SPF built in.  I would never wear any other foundation.Update as of 9/20/12:  I recently tried Bare Escentuals new compact foundation and my favorite is still the original spf 15 foundation.  Your own skin only flawless.
1,"Just a fantastic cream and value. A little goes a long way, and it doesn't leave a sticky or greasy film. Just the right size to leave at the office as well or in my purse."
1,"I really like it, especially for the warmer times. For reference, I have oily and acne prone skin that can be sensitive to some products.PROS:-moisturizes fairly well-dries matte (and keeps me from being shiny for about 4-5 hours if I only have this moisturizer on)-affordable-mixes well with other products (beauty oils, facial serums, sunscreen)CONS:-no SPF (personally, I find putting on sunscreen can be a laborious extra step)The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I have yet to find a moisturizer like my all-time favorite one (Lancome Visionaire moisturizer). I would definitely recommend this product and would buy it again."
1,A great color for spring. Very feminine but not too girly. Goes great with a lot of colors. Safely packaged!
1,"Witch Hazel is highly underrated. It's relieves irritated skin, and it's a great toner and make-up remover. This product is a good value, there' s lot of liquid per dollar spent. It's gentle on the skin and I notices my skin feels cleaner after using it. One bottle of this brand usually lasts me a month or two depending."
1,This is the perfect red shade of nail polish ...not too red and not too pink. Just that right mix!
1,"Neutrogena Triple Moisture's hair product line is one of the best out there. This is to be used on the back end, after using their shampoo, conditioner, and the like. A small dollop and my scalp stays moisturized all day -- good stuff."
0,"I couldn't find any difference in the amount of dandruff at all. I went through the entire bottle used as directed and there was 0 change. Every person is different but this was a waste of money for me. Luckily, Selsun Blue (the medicated one) worked in ONE treatment."
0,"This didn't put out much steam, and wasn't very hot. Maybe it's because I'm in the mountains and water produces steam at a lower temp. up here. Anyway, I had a better facial with a pot of boiling water, and had to return this. UPDATE 2011: Want steam??? Use a ""My little steamer"" mini clothing steamer!!! CAUTION: Keep at least 12-15 inches away from your face.  I used distilled water, and this thing really puts out steam, and in less than a minute too! Remember...do not put it too close to your face!!! It generates VERY HOT STEAM!!!"
1,"Good for coarse wavy hair.  Buy some extra clips though, I got ones with clasp as the simple ones included don't hold shorter hair as well"
1,"Since using this, I need nothing else for natural curls. I use a small plastic bottle (the .97 bottles that walmart sells in the 'travel size' bins work for me.) to mix 1/3 water to 2/3 conditioner. This gives a good mix for morning for waking up dead head curls. The bottle I use gives more spray per squirt so I'm able to really wet my hair, as needed, and don't get hand cramps from using the conditioner's pump spray.I use the condition 'straight' for rainy or damp days to battle frizz. Even if I get caught in  the rain, the conditioner will help hair dry without frizzing. The conditioner's bottle pump is a little stiff and if you've got a lot of hair, you may want to get another plastic bottle to use it straight, to avoid hand cramps. I don't; but, for arthritis sufferers, it may be necessary.I also use it 'straight' as hair spray for 'setting' a style. It doesn't make hair stiff, but does hold the curls and hair will feel soft to the touch.Also, getting this via Subscribe and Save saves money as well as assuring I won't run out."
1,I am in love with this daily moisturizer. It smells so good I wish I could use it all over. It leaves my face very soft and with a nice natural glow. My skin has actually improved since I started using it about 3 weeks ago. I will most definitely keep buying. Its awesome!
1,Amazing price for a great performing product.  Quiet.Ships on time from a great vendor.  Now is the time to upgrade your outdated hair dryer.
1,Drys my hair very quickly.  I place it on my hair and scrunch it and it absorbs very fast.  It also washes well.  It's just the right size to travel with as well.  It's definitely my go to hair towel.
1,"i HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR AWHILE.  IT HAS IMPROVED MY SPLIT NAILS.  IN MY CASE, THAT HAPPENED IN QUITE A SHORT TIME.  I WILL CONTINUE TO USE THIS PRODUCT"
1,"I personally feel that my oily, acne prone skin does much better with Witch Hazel toner. This one has a pleasant smell also :)."
1,"I first purchased this product because I wanted a cleanser in a squeeze tube so that I could easily use it at the gym.  Pumps are hard to ""close"" so that they don't accidently pump into my gym bag.  I also wanted a cream cleanser because after I turned 40 skin dryness in my face became more of an issue even though I make sure to drink plenty of water.  I also purchased it for the price.  I didn't even notice that the packaging read ""oil free"".  I typically don't buy oil free cleansers because I want more oil in the cleanser to moisturize my skin.Well, don't let ""oil free"" fool you.  Deep Clean does not dry out my skin.  It works as well as cream cleansers that use the word ""moisturizing"" on their package.As of 01/06/2012 Amazon listed this product as costing $5.74 for 7 ounces ($0.82 per ounce) and $19.77 for 21 ounces ($0.94 per ounce).  It does not make sense to me that the cost per ounce for buying in bulk (the three pack which comes to 21 ounces) is MORE than the cost per ounce for buying a single unit.  Buying in bulk usually means saving money.  I will be hitting the ""1 pack"" button when I order and then once the item is in my cart I will increase the quantity.  I will not be hitting the ""3 pack"" button."
0,"PLEASE DONT DO IT! this just rachett the palette size is not like in the picture, the colors go on sheer, slides on face like wax don't expect  your makeup to stay put with this one. just spend the money for the good stuff. 2 thumbs down"
1,"Holy Cow, what a great cleanser! This is one of the best best cleansers I have come across. Don't let the cheap price fool you, this stuff works better than most high end brands. It is gentle but packs a serious punch! This stuff cleans your skin so well and will not break you out. It also has a great smell too!"
1,"I love that it comes with the facial cleaner brush, but the system itself is okay. I felt like I was not getting enough steam. I had to put a towel over my head to confine the steam to stay in one place long enough to open my pores better. I guess it's a safely measure. I just wish it had a control for the amount of steam it produces insteam of the timer. Overall, it does what it promises."
1,"I have had a few of these and I love it!!!  I ordered their newer model and ended up giving it to a friend.  I have very thick hair and it tends to be puffy and on the wavy side.  After I blow dry my hair, I use this and it smooths out my hair beautifully.  I can also flip my sides back and the bottom length under.  I hope that this isn't going to be discontinued.  It works way better than their newer model!  Please keep making these.  I recently ordered another because it works so well!"
1,"It detangles with ease, and the brush fits in most of my purses. The bristles are very gentle on the wigs."
1,I love it for exfoliating but its a little rough on my boyfriends insanely sensitive skin and I bought it for him
1,"This lacquer is excellent. I had it first applied in a Spa in Maryland for all my nails. It was so shiny and kept my nails beautiful for over 14 days! Unheard! Since then I simply don't buy anything else for top coat. I thing some Nail places just simply don't know the item exists, or actually do not want you good to go for such a nice long time. Not sure which one, but I can not have nails nicely finished without this product!Thank you!  :)"
1,"i love using this before i use a face mask, let it open up my pores so they can get in deep. i use it with a towel over my head to get more of the steam without resting my face on it. its not too hot. it feels really really good."
1,I'm a beginner at wearing eyelashes and this glue does the trick. I accidently fell asleep with my lashes on and they stayed on throughout the night. The glue hold really well
1,"My kids have been using this mask. I have 3 teenagers, 2 boys and a girl and they all like the smell and peeling off of their skin. Really cleans up their skin nicely. I would definitely recommend this product."
1,"For a natural or textured hair, you need this in your life for your hair. This should always be in your stapleYes get one."
0,"These rollers are 1.5"" thick and are too large for my thin, straight, long hair. They don't curl my hair enough. They do add volume and make my ends curly but I wanted a bit more curl. The deal-breaker is the clips though. They hold the hair well, but the creases look horrible. I end up throwing my hair up into a ponytail just to hide the creases...what is the point of that!? I will be returning these."
1,"This is great for myself, my husband, and my Tween girl!  It does dry out my older skin a bit, so I use it over the trouble spots and then lotion the dry areas I tend to get.  I LOVE THIS STUFF!!  It's great for my face, back, and the backs of the arms.  Seriously, it's worth a try.  I recommend this to friends and family.  I also recommend their Blemish Touch stick!!"
0,"I asked my husband to go out and get me a curling iron with a fat barrel and this is what he got me. It has a large barrel, it heats up extremely quickly, and it has automatic shut-off. Those are some definite pluses, but there are a few things that bother me. The barrel is short compared to my other curling irons. The stand gets in the way, though I can fold it back; and the the way the handle is designed, it's not comfortable to hold. I accidentally change the heat settings just trying to curl my bangs.It works, but all the little details make this my least desirable curling iron of all time."
1,Use this for my dog.  It has a mild setting that is just right for him after his bath.  He hates baths. He would not give any thing associated with it 5.
1,"I was in high school when these first came out in the 90's, the salt ionizer version.  LOVED THEM THEN.  This version doesn't use the salt and is a bit more portable (smaller) and the variation of rollers has greatly improved. Also, it steams faster!  However, the overall concept and ease of use is the same.I adore these rollers, short or long hair, course or fine...they will give you plenty of lasting volume withOUT any heat damage.  Best of all, they can stand the test of many year.A great hair investment, I must say!"
1,"Great adhesive!  I thought it would be difficult to work with, but it wasn't.  It didn't take too long to dry, but stayed pliable long enough for me to adjust and readjust my lashes."
1,"I ordered this in hopes that it would help moisturize my face and also help set my makeup, as it states on the back of the can.  When I got it the product was no longer than my hand.  I was surprised.  Other than that it was fast shipping and great customer service."
1,I bought this product for my mom.  She usually use it. And she is very happy with this fancy full product
0,I heard alot of hype using this product finally bought it and been using it over a few month period everyday I really didnt notice alot but for the most part its a silcone feeling serum almost like a foundation primer and it worked for me just as that it made the texture of my skin smooth just what a regular primer does anyways before I put on foundationwould I repurchase again? no theres other serums that will do more than this
1,"While I have tried other eye makeup removers, I ALWAYS come back to Neutrogena's eye makeup remover. This products never fails me. I love to wear lots of eye makeup and some eyeliners I wear have very strong staying power; soap and water will not wash it off. However, my eye makeup comes off in a cinch with this product and a little goes a long way."
1,"Have been using the Caruso Steam unit for years now and find the Medium just the size I need.  They last for several years and the different sizes are hard to find in the local stores.  Ordering online is the answer and thru Amazon is the best way.  I had ordered the jumbo's in error and they refunded my money within in days so I re-ordered the size that I wanted.  Love Amazon, you should try it."
1,Ordered this as a gift for a friend who is in love with this particular fragrance. She practically bathes in perfume so I had to get her the large version.
1,"Alba in general makes great products. This is a great value for the size. It smells wonderful and it's not over powering. Most sented soaps leave you with an over powering sent, and this does not, if you like suds, this does it! I would however check vitacost for a price on this and I know Amazon seems to not always have it in stock."
1,"This is a great price for a great curling iron. The cord is nice and long, there are several heating settings, and it heats up faster than you can pick it up off the counter (okay not that fast, but you won't even feel like you had to wait for it). It gets the job done, and I honestly don't see why most people would need anything fancier."
1,"I purchased this after researching what would best help/prevent my flaky, dry skin.  The extra gentle Buf-Puf is great for every day cleansing.  I use a dab of cleanser, wet the puff and make little circles over my skin.  It is just enough exfoliation to get the dead cells off, but not so much that it irritates my sensitive skin.  I follow up with my skin care regimen (serum, toner, moisturizer) and this little puff has helped make a world of difference.Being the first time that I have used one of these, I am not sure how long they ""normally"" last, but I have gotten a good two and weeks of daily use out of mine, before noticing that it was beginning to lose it's structure a bit."
1,I needed a facial steamer because I got tired of using hot rags or awkwardly placing myself over a boiling hot sink. I steam my face daily to help open pores and before I do any at-home facials. 10 minutes with this steamer will do the trick. It does take a while to get going (about 10 minutes) but holds enough water to steam your face for at least 20 minutes at a time.Not bad for the price.
1,"Face wash is very creamy and think which means you can use a lot less of it compared to thinner face washes, I do definitely feel the softness of my skin when using this, no strong smell, no residue, all in all I really like this.Eye cream is nice and smooth, I can already see a difference in the dark circles around my eyes even though this is the first use, you don't need the pearl sided amount, I just dot along my eyes and that is more then enough to get the job done.SPF 15 face cream, there is not a strong smell with any of these products which I like and so far no skin irritation even though I have never used retinol for anything before, again you do not need to pearl sized amount even though this is thick if your skin is warm it will almost melt into your skin and you wont need nearly that much. My face looks brighter and more clear and I have a lot of acne scars that are obvious.Please note I did not use the face wash that came with the eye and face cream, I used the Neutrogena anti-blemish anti-wrinkle cream I can not comment on the face wash that came with the system.Will leave another update if anything changes with these products."
1,"This is a good product and I would order it again, except for one thing: the reason I ordered it from Amazon is that it supposedly includes the the small travel size container of polish remover. The picture is extremely misleading. You might as well get something at Walgreen's. I contacted the company and they apologized and said they'd switch out the picture of the product, but they did not offer to send me the travel size."
1,"I recommend this type of nylon gloves for use in the showers.  I saw these in a Taiwanese supermarket and bought these on a whim.  They're pretty rough like the net cleaners for washing dishes but if you have ""old mud"" aka dead skin cells you want sloughed off, this might be a cheaper alternative to a loofah."
1,Serum goes on smoothly and sinks right in.  I always use the Perfecting Cream on top in daytime and the night cream over it in the evening. My skin seems clearer and softer after only about a week.
1,"I have been wearing Pheromone for many years.  This was a great purchase for the price.  The Parfum arrived in good order and promptly.  Therefore, I would highly recommend the product.  DAME HILDA"
1,"After hearing so many great things about this moisturizer for the past few years, I really wanted to try it.  I actually tried it about two or three years ago and found it to be too heavy.  But I think my problem was not the moisturizer but the face wash I was using.  I had always thought my skin was oily, so I was constantly using products designed for oily/acne prone skin.  I think I was drying my skin out, causing it to produce extra oil to compensate.  Anyway, I'm now using the Olay Daily Facials for Normal skin, which work great.  Up until about 3 months ago, I was using Olay Complete moisturizer for Normal skin, which was working fine but I wanted something with anti-aging properties, since I just turned 30.Since I've been using the Total Effects, I've noticed that my skin is softer.  It also appears to be a little brighter.  The tone is evened out some, as well.  I sometimes get a little redness around my cheeks and nose.  That has not completely gone away but it is diminished.  I have some fine lines across my forhead that seem smaller now, especially if I moisturize before bedtime (I use the Total Effects Night Firming Cream) but more often than not, I go to bed without washing my face or moisturizing.  Also, I use the Fragrance Free version (with SPF) and it truly is free of any perfumes.  The only smell I get is from the SPF.I like the pump design but it is a little difficult to tell how much is left in the bottle.  I have to hold it up against a light to judge the amount.  One bottle has lasted me from the beginnng of August until now (Oct. 21) and there is a little left, which I expect to run out any day now, so about 3 months.  I was getting about a year out of the Olay Complete bottle, which is 6 oz, so it would be nice if this came in a larger bottle.I'm very pleased with this moisturizer and will continue to use it, along with my other Olay products."
1,I purchased this lotion to go under my regular lotion in the morning. I absolutely love this product as it gives my skin a youthful glow. It is great a moisturizer by itself as well. I will be getting this again.
1,"I've been using this product a little over a week. After the 3 or 4th day--my 12AM to 6AM daily bout of hot flashes dwindled to a livable one or two. I am MUCH less crabby from lack of sleep. My family, friends and staff are exceedingly grateful.Oh---AND I tried the black cohash,maca and evening primrose oil methods and none of them worked."
0,"My constantly itching ear may be caused by something different from most here...my dr cannot seem to figure it out--I have tried anti fungals, antibiotics and steroids..and now this stuff....I really had no effect from it at all, other than grease on my pillow...I dont wear hearing aids...I dont know what it is, but this didnt help"
1,"Usually when I'm using an acne treatment, I'm kind of blindly hoping that it's doing something without really seeing any distinctly noticeable results. However, this spot treatment made a difference that I could immediately see. It really worked to help individual blemishes disappear faster, a little bit at least.However, when I don't recommend using this for deep/cystic acne. When I have tried it on large, deep, flesh colored acne blemishes, it seems to cause them to become more irritated and painful. I don't know why this is, but I've noticed it several times so will not be using it on those blemishes again. It appears that maybe it is causing those blemishes to ""come to a head"" when they normally wouldn't, which I suppose has it's benefits and might ultimately help them to go away faster. But it made they area so painful that it just wasn't worth it.Also, it doesn't seem to help red blemishes that already have a white head. I recommend this product mostly for plain red bumps, and maybe blackheads.It has an interesting wine-like fragrance."
0,"I'm half embarrassed that I even bought this product, but pushing sixty aren't we all looking for a miracle wrinkle remover?  Well, this isn't it.  I think I could do the same thing with duct tape at night as this product does."
1,Great Color and Staying Power. takes 3 coats to become opaque. Essie polish is always a little runnier and thinner than other polishes but the staying and anti chipping power makes up for it.
0,"I am a disappointed in this, it doesnt really make my skin feel as clean as I would like.  Vitamin C products work great on my skin, but this doesnt seem to have any affects of vitamin C.  I would recommend this product"
1,"I just used the oil for the first time. The fragrance is not as overpowering as a regular perfume, but definitely detectable and strong enough for me. My fiancee smelled it immediately without me telling him. The smell is clean, slightly floral and musky. I don't think it's as enchanting as some reviewers said, but I like it. For the long-term wearers who noted that the smell is not as strong as before, I'm wondering if it's just because their olfactory sense got too used to the smell to detect it.Bottom line, I enjoy the oil and the price, and would definitely recommend it to others."
1,"this face lotion has a nice smell and good texture and it's not to greasy on my (dry,oily combo) skin but moisturizes it perfectly. i love it."
1,"Let me start by saying, I am a first time hair colorer. Within the last 2 years I have been through some extremely stressful life-changing events that have caused my hair to begin to gray despite my age. I never thought I'd be gray before I turned 30! Needless to say, I tried to pluck them until I realized I couldn't keep up. Then I tried to accept them. Then I thought, why the heck am I putting up with this?! I'll have the opportunity to ""gray gracefully"" when I'm 60! So I picked this up at a local store after a recommendation from friends, and proceeded to agonize over a color choice. My hair is naturally a medium to dark brown and I wanted a color that was similar to my own, perhaps slightly lighter, just to cover my gray and add a little dimension. I chose this color (medium brown) because it seemed the closest to my natural color. Nowhere on the box did it say this color was auburn or red or anything of the sort! So imagine my surprise as my hair starts to dry and my roots are RED! The rest of my hair was lightened slightly and did come out a lovely medium brown with hints of red, but my roots are lighter than the rest of my hair which makes the red more noticeable. It's definitely not a horrible thing. I like it and aside from the initial surprise when I saw the red, I am pleased with how it came out. I just thought it was necessary to let other ladies know that this most definitely IS red, despite what the box says.That said, being my first time coloring my hair (and doing it completely by myself, no less) I was a little anxious but the process was incredibly simple. I picked up a few tips from videos on YouTube and covered the floor in newspaper, put oil on my skin just beyond my hairline to avoid staining my skin, and wore a towel on my shoulders. The process was as simple as mixing the solution and applying it evenly throughout my hair. If you have dark hair already, it would be hard to mess this up. I've heard it can be tough to color blonde hair on your own, so I'd advise not choosing this color as a blonde unless you're prepared for a lot of red. If it turned my dark brown into red, I can only imagine what it will do to a blonde!Regarding the gray, I was aware beforehand that it can be challenging to cover gray. This color did hide the vast majority of my gray though I can pick out a few areas where the hairs are quite a bit lighter than the rest. I realized right away that these were my gray hairs that did pick up the color but did not come out as dark as the rest of my hair. It's all good to me, though, because the gray is gone! It actually looks like very subtle natural highlights and I like the effect. Just be forewarned that this product is not going to completely blend away your gray and give all your hair a uniform shade. I would probably advise against using this particular color if you're heavily grayed. I am only about 5% gray but it was enough to bother me and I am much happier with my hair now! Overall, I was very pleased with the product's simplicity and the final result, but please choose another color if you're not looking for red in your brown. :)"
1,"I chose tiis moisturizer because it did not have SPF in it and it was advertised as not to clog the pore on my face.  I seems a little more pricey than Oil of Olay.  I have always used a moisturizer after shaving, it does a far better job of soothing the skin thanalcohol based products P.S. after about 1/2 of the bottle the pump no longer will pump and you are left with 1/2 bottle that you have to beat out with your hand to get it.... I won't make this mistake again of ordering this... Shame of them..."
1,"I love how this brush applys the makeup.  All the other mineral type foundations I have found, the brushes tend to get brittle.  This is so feather light when I use it."
1,"This is a very lovely perfume.  It smells of blackberries, with something deeper and muskier underneath.  The deep scent grounds the berries, keeps the scent from being too overwhelmingly sweet, and makes it sensual.  This is a happy scent, and one well-suited to wear in all seasons.  The one drawback is that this is not a particularly long-lasting fragrance, which is a shame, because it's beautiful."
1,"We buy this all the time.  Problem is some places no longer carry ti.  I purchased on line however when I could not find it.  However, I found it's quite a bit more expensive on Amazon then the one I finally found at Whole Foods Stores.  But the product is great.  Gentle and helps winter itch scalp."
1,This is an effective product. There won't be miracles but stick with it and you will see subtle changes over time. I think it has 1% retinol.
1,"I read about this brush in a magazine - a dermatologist was saying that she used this on her hair every night.  When I received it, I was stunned at its weight...that handle is solid metal.  The bristles are very stiff BUT, I have never had a brush make my scalp feel the way this one does.  I am someone who likes the feel of pressure on my scalp and after running this brush all over it (over the sides, underneath, over the top) my scalp has never felt so good! If your scalp is tender, this may not be the brush for you, if you like scalp massages, etc, this is the brush for you. You also can't beat the price.  I might even be giving this to all my friends for Christmas.  I don't think I would use this to style my hair as I'm blow drying, but it works beautifully when I'm brushing hair oil through as an overnight conditioner. Totally worth it!"
1,"Excellent cover, I am very happu with this product, it covers perfectly and lasts for almost all day! I will wait again!"
1,"I color every four weeks to keep it looking fresh and I love this color.  Use the conditioner, apply color to CLEAN hair, and IMO you can't beat the value.  I am a prime customer and have auto shipment on the product."
1,"The formula of this lip gloss is nice enough, and I like the mint tingle, as others have mentioned.  I bought this in Rhubarb, as it looked like it might be a darkish pink.  Unfortunately the color is all wrong on me- it's much brighter on that it appears to be in the tube, and it just looks garish.  I might purchase another one, but only in a much different color."
1,"I have very thick hair and there were not enough rollers.  I wasn't trying to do all my hair just some. There is nothing wrong with these, they are definitely compact and easy to use they just weren't great if you have thick hair and a lot of it. You would probably need at least 10 rollers."
1,I bought this because the reviews were good.  all it's done for my skin is make it dryer plus  my makeup doesn't look good since using this! Highly disappointed.
1,I'm very glad this stuff exists. Its great to use while pregnant. Its not as powerful as the non-organic stuff though.
1,"I used this years ago and it was very nice and left my skin so smooth and soft.  Unfortunately I ran out and the price then was more than now, so I stopped using this wonderful face moisturizer.  When I did use it, this cream was silky smooth, lightly scented and within days cleared up all dryness and soothed the irritation on my face.  I have very sensitive skin and this did not once cause a break out or rash, not even burn.  Now that I've found this cream again here on Amazon I ordered a couple, one for my grandmother since mothers day is coming up!"
1,"While I do like this product, it hasn't seemed to lessen my acne at all. Also, the granules in the scrub are not fine (as in small) at all so if you have very sensitive skin this might not be for you. I like how my skin does feel more soft after using it and it does not dry it out at all."
1,"if your toes are crossing in your shoes and you are struggling, this is a solid option.  I also bought the bunion socks and the gel protector sleeve - both of those I am using more frequently than these spacers but I think these would be the better option if I wore a lot of dress shoes.  I mostly wear clogs to work in now, and my toes are not pinched together so I find myself choosing the visco-gel bunion shield instead of the toe spacers.  I wear the toe spacer socks to Zumba class or to sleep in... these little spacers wont stay put really well for Zumba or for sleeping."
1,In the past I have spent a fortune on skin care for my face.  Then I discovered Olay. I use all Olay procucts now. I'm 57 and no one would guess that.  They have products that work for your skin type and their website can help you choose what is best for you.
0,"I was using this product along with Desert Essence Tea Tree Cleansing Pads ([...]) and at first, I noticed that I felt a bit of a burn and discomfort from both products. I tried using the products separately as well as together, and thought that maybe it was normal. However, after a few days of using this product, I ended up getting a severe burn all over my face, and broke out into a very painful rash.It started out as just a prickly pink, then went itchy and red, and eventually broke out into a severe burn, and was extremely painful and peeled for several days. It took weeks for my skin to stop feeling sensitive and raw.I'm not sure why my face reacted this way, but I'm really sad that it did, because I had been searching high and low for an all natural facial product, and all of my searching on Amazon pointed to this."
1,"I've had a conair facial sauna for years (and it was still working fine when I lost/misplced it) so I had to try another Conair.Well, this is perfect, even better than the first one I got. Why? It's got that safety timer, it tells you when it's ready, it comes with two cones to choose from. Plus, it comes with this free exfoliating brush and sponge. So nice. I used it last night and now my skin's glowing beautifully, like it got a polishing. It's a nice way to pamper yourself.Great price too!"
0,"I really think if your skin is like leather this is for you.  Otherwise, stay away.  I followed the directions and then started cutting back when I noticed it was turning into red splotches.  I finally quit after a week or so.  I was so embarrassed to go out of the house.  All I wanted was to get rid of the red spots that were left after pimples came and left.  I am a strawberry blonde with fair skin.  The alpha hydroxy is the culprit.  I had high hopes.  This product deserves zero stars."
1,"I've been using Mane & Tail shampoo for the past 10 years. I've tried other shampoos but would always return to Mane & Tail. Recently, I decided once again to try something new. I'd seen Thicker Fuller Hair in the stores before, but didn't think it'd actually work. Gave it a shot. My previously fine, limp, dead hair that would hold a curl for no more than two hours is now holding curls, tightly, alllllll day. My hair is much fuller and thicker in appearance too, just like the name says. Not to mention, soft and not at all weighed down. I can run my fingers through my hair and the curls are still there. Wind blows, curls are still there. Got caught in the rain the other day...curls were still there! I am a black woman with chemically relaxed hair testifying...YES! It works on our hair too, lol. I definitely recommend this shampoo and conditioner. I'd like to try their other products in the near future as well."
1,"I bought this for a trip to India and planned to use it as shampoo, body soap and laundry soap. (I like to pack light!) It was a good idea and worked well for my body and clothes. However, I found that it left a film in my hair, even after I lathered up twice and rinsed VERY well. It made my hair look greasy.It's possible it had something to do with the water in India. I'd recommend trying this bar out at home before your trip to see how it works for you, and bringing backup shampoo just in case if you're planning to take it on a trip.On the plus side, it didn't have any sort of strong scent (a bonus if you don't want to attract bugs!), and it lathered up fine. The bar is small but would last for approximately 2-3 weeks if used for body and hair for one person."
0,"I have never minded a product's fragance before, but this- blegh! On top of that, it made my skin feel sticky, didn't improve my hair, and is all around pretty useless. For reference, I have long, thick, smooth wavy Asian hair."
1,This is the one and only base coat that has ever worked on my natural nails to keep polish on. Everything else peels up in less than a day. I can keep my nails looking nice for a weekend with this stuff.
1,"Hey, We all have our secrets....this one is Mine. I don't use it as much as I should, so I will report any changes when I use it more often,"
1,"I have long, thick, wavy, frizzy hair.  I love to straighten my hair (looks good on me and I get tons of compliments), but have had a hard time fixing my hair with my new time constraints as a mom.  I had a cheap & old (10+ years) flat iron that finally fell to it's death on the bathroom floor.  Lucky for me, I got great advice from my hair stylist and a good friend.  They encouraged me to invest in a ceramic iron.  After reading reviews, I decided on this Solia ceramic & tourmaline iron.  Paired with the Chi silk infusion product, I have smooth and shiny hair again.  The difference is that it takes 5 minutes to straighten all of my long thick hair compared to the 20 minutes I spent with my old iron.  My stylist told me that the cheap irons lose their ability to get hot after a period of time and when you have thick hair with curls, you need max heat."
1,this perfumr is awesime. so many compliments. The only thing ill wear other than dream angels heavenly. It is long lasting as well
1,"I live in NYC and Duane Reade and CVS do not sell these anymore. I have friends who tried these and say that they are too greasy. But, I like the extra oil to run into my eye area. I've been using these for years, and am so happy I found them here at Amazon!"
1,"Find an Ulta or other store that sells this and try it first. It's hard to find a shade that matches best -- I had to try four or five shades before deciding which matched the closest.I used Dermablend when I had to cover a forearm tattoo. The tattoo is about six inches long, one inch high black writing. Dermablend concealed it entirely. But it didn't quite match, nor did it ever dry (the first time I used it, it was still smudging onto my clothes hours after application). The second time I used it, I brushed foundation and setting powder over it, then sprayed it with hairspray per the internet's suggestion. It worked perfectly. It stayed all day, didn't smudge, and looked so natural that nobody knew I had a tattoo there.This is a great product when you need something covered -- but it demands a little extra work to get it perfect."
1,I have been using this product for years and people always comment on how young-looking my skin is. It's deceiving because it's very rich feeling when it first goes on but it absorbs quickly and never feels greasy. An excellent product.
1,"This is the best body mist I've tried, of three. It smells as good as Prince Matchabelli, and the alcohol doesn't choke me.  This is a fine brand and a great smelling cotton candy spray."
1,"I bought a cheaper version of this somewhere and it was made of the material you use to pick up lint. Needless to say it picked up lots of lint and after one wash/dry, it stuck to itself and had all kinds of things stuck to it. I guess you could use your head to dust if you were wearing that...but the worst was that it wasn't enough material to fit longer hair.Well, the Aquis DOES fit longer hair and doesn't fall off. It also has elastic on the edge to keep it on your head. And it dries quickly. It's a must for drying long hair when you aren't a blow-drying type of person...and you could use it to get excess water out before blow-drying.The best thing is they sell them at Nordstrom Rack in SF for $10! I had only one for a year or so but I wanted to have a few to rotate out  so I could throw one in the laundry. They dry quickly so you can subsist on one but it's nice to have a fresh clean one if you want to wash yours - mine get sorta saturated with conditioner after a while. I like the non-white ones so if you color your hair and you use the turban, it won't show as much if the dye comes out in the material. I guess getting white would be a good option if you want to be able to bleach out any hair coloring that might end up on it."
0,I was instructed to use this 3-4 times a week. It has Not cleared up my dandruff. In despiration I switched to Selson blue deep cleasning shampoo with deep cleasning beads. The selson blue works so much better. I am sticking with the selson blue. My dandruff is not an issue now. This coal tar shampoo didn't do anything for it. A waste of money for me.
1,"Years ago, when wrinkle development bothered me, I researched and decided on Olay daily serum. Been getting regularly via Subscribe and Save, which helps w/cost and convenience.My skin is 60+ yrs old and sensitive. Stuff I've used in the past suddenly causes skin reactions, but NOT the Olay Daily Serum. It' goes on smoothly, takes only a few 'squirts' for complete face/neck coverage. No smell, and after about 10 minutes of soaking in, ready for makeup, if needed.There is no sun protection w/this, so if that's a concern, it's not for you. Also, if you're looking for wrinkle reduction, there's better but more expensive. Wrinkles are a fact of life, so my reaction to them was easier/cheaper to adjust than continuing a fruitless search for the perfect serum."
1,"This is some of the best and simplest face wash I've used - get yourself a small container and decant from this large refill as needed and it will last you months.It smells very earthy since it has no added fragrance and does a good job cleaning my face - better than some more expensive brands I've tried.  Just be careful not to get it in your eyes, that tea tree oil stings!UPDATE:I have been using this product exclusively for almost a year now and so has my husband.  I use it once a day to wash my face and I think that's been the key.  I've always had very oily, breakout-prone skin and I just don't find breakouts happening as much any more - partly because this cleans so well and partly because I don't over clean my face any more.  I have switched all of my facial care products to as natural/organic as I can stand and I now actually get compliments on my skin."
1,"well, i should guess that it is called cream it will leave some residue on the skin, so it feels like the soap have not washed away completely.I like that it has no smell to it, and lasts for about a month in the shower"
1,"I really love this moisturizer!  I goes on really smooth and soaks right into your face with no oily residue or sticky feeling, I use it daily under my makeup and really love it."
1,"I love aveeno and this product last for a long time (4 months) altough I use daily with my mia clarisonic still not harming my skin. However, I am giving 4 stars because I love the soft feeling (luxus) that regular foaming aveeno leaves in my skin. Yes, you must try...will safe you some $, since last longer than the foaming aveeno.xoxo"
1,"I'm a huge Neutrogena fan and was perusing their products on Amazon when I stumbled across this. I was about to run out of lotion and needed something that could handle how dry and flaky my shins and elbows tend to get - especially now when I'm flying a lot for work.The bottle arrived with the cap broken at the hinge unfortunately. Luckily, the oil hadn't leaked out and gotten all over, but it does make storage kind of obnoxious right now, so I'm going to have to steal a cap from an old shampoo bottle or something to replace this one.That aside, the product itself is great!  If I was choosing on fragrance alone, this wouldn't be my first pick, but the smell is very pleasant and is growing on me. Instead of rigorously toweling myself dry after my shower, I do a cursory drying, leaving my skin quite damp and then immediately use the oil. It soaks in much better and quicker that way and can proudly say my elbows haven't been ashy in over a week! I do also use this at times on my fully dry skin, and it's still great, just a little more oily feeling at first.This product is defnitely a keeper,. I just don't know how it took me so long to realize this exists!"
1,"I decided to drastically cut my hair last summer.  It was to the middle of my back and I had it cut all the way up to around my chin.  After I realized that my old curling iron (1.25 inch) wasn't really giving me the curls I wanted I bought this one.  I hadn't really thought about the fact that a larger barrell would only produce waves.  My hair has since grown out to about shoulder length and this iron really does the trick.  It heats up quickly, gives me great curls that last all day and was an exceptional value."
1,I love this Fragrance. First time I used it I wasn't sure but it has really grown on me and my wife loves it too :)
0,"I was very disappointed with this hand soap.  The bottle is really ugly (not great in a guest bathroom) and after a few weeks I couldn't wait to be finished with all of the bottles so that I could replace them with the better designed Method hand soap bottles.I also didn't like how watery the liquid soap was.  We ended up using more soap so even though a bottle was cheaper than other liquid hand soaps it lasted half as long.The scent was so faint you basically won't be able to smell it.Because of the ugly bottle packaging, watery consistency, and lack of aromatic scent I will not be purchasing this bottle again."
1,I love this nail polish. The color is absolutely gorgeous and stays on very long. It doesn't chip easily and looks really beautiful on your nails.
1,"I've used this product for several years and it kept my face and skin soft.  Not long ago, I tried an expensive &#34;anti-aging&#34; product that  a relative had given me.  Awful!!!  It smelled like paint stripper and after a couple days, my skin turned into sandpaper!  So.....now I'm back to this moisturizer and hope to regain the soft skin I had."
1,I bought this for a friend as a gift.  She loves it.  The color is nice and Essie is a good brand of nail polish.
1,"Superior product. Should never be more than $5, do not get overcharged! Thick and concentrated, but not greasy. I apply 2x a day to my thighs and stomach to help improve my skin's stretching power. Also, I layer this over the Massage Lotion for Stretch Marks, as suggested. Smells good and moisturizes all night until I shower next morning. Make sure to apply when your skin is already moist,  otherwise will have no effect. Have gone through 4 tubes so far in my pregnancy. Highly recommend."
0,"I was very excited to recieve this base coat.  I am attempting to grow my nails longer, now that I am getting older.  I would never purchase this product agaian. This base coat does not keep my polish on, and it creates not barrier for my darker polished. I put this on and then painted two top coats and my nails were still stained red from the polish.  I am very dissatisfied."
1,I purchased Ski Teal We Drop awhile ago. It is still my fave color. Sometimes it requires 3 coats (rarely) but it is a beautiful true teal color.
1,"A few years ago I began to notice little red patches all over my skin just as spring and the season of shorts was approaching. One panicked trip to the dermatologist later, I found out that I had nummular eczema, which is basically a fancy way of saying that my skin was a dry, finicky old hag who I needed to start treating with kid gloves: no fabric softener, no perfumed skin products, and lots of daily moisturizing. My doctor recommended that I start using Aveeno products because their natural ingredients are among the gentlest on the skin, and she specifically said that the Aveeno Active Naturals lotions tend to do the best job at moisturizing. $10 seemed a little steep when I bought my first bottle from a local drugstore, but I swallowed my complaints and started applying this daily after my morning showers to help lock in the moisture. Within a week, the eczema had cleared up considerably, and not long after that I actually started getting unsolicited compliments on how soft and smooth my skin was -- it had gone from ""angry hag"" to ""cooing baby"" in just under a month (Benjamin Button, eat your heart out).Aside from it helping alleviate my skin condition, this Aveeno lotion is also just pleasant to use; it's unscented and unobtrusive, and it rubs into your skin really well without leaving any funky, sticky residue behind. After a while I started using Amazon's Subscribe & Save service to stock up, which has saved me money (it's usually under $8 per bottle) and the worry that I'll ever run out of this great stuff.In short: Aveeno products may cost more than other brands, but they're worth it. Take it from a former hag-skinned girl."
1,"I bought this product along with the foaming face wash on a whim and I love it! I have used many (much more expensive) skin care brands in the past, but none are this consistently great for my skin. I have oily combination skin that is prone to hormonal breakouts. I use this product each night (start out using it every other night, as it might sting a bit at first). I have seen my skin even out and I've experienced much fewer breakouts! Horray!"
1,I love this moisturizer. It covers my face well and it is good protection from the sun. I will definitely keep buying this product.
1,"This may be great for some people but the information listed neglects to tell you that this is a flat barrel 1/2 inch iron which is suppose to give ribbon like curls. Although the package says ribbon curl I didnt realize the barrel was going to be flat and I was a little disappointed when I got it. That's the only downside, everything else like the settings, heat, and tangle free cord all work great and shipping was fast. So if your into ribbon looking curls then this iron would be for you otherwise keep looking."
1,"I was looking for a gentle, yet absorbent towel and this is it. I put this towel on my head and my hair is dry in about an hour, a great improvement from the hours it usually takes for my hair go air dry. I am trying to protect my hair from heat and this gas turned out to be the perfect tool. Towel was packaged well. I think I will pick up another one of these for my mother."
1,"I really like this color but it isn't for the faint of heart. It has a very army feel to it, but its not uberly trendy either. Nice color!"
0,"Doesn't peel off well....I usually have to scrub it off, which defeats the entire purpose. I wouldn't get it again, would prefer other brands I've used before."
1,"I've been using this product for two weeks, twice a day, and my skin is brighter, clearer, and healthier in look and feel than it's ever been. I am a big skeptic - but this stuff won me over, completely. I actually look forward to using it, because it balances out my combination skin, it smells great (some people say ""too old lady"", but I'm 29 and think it smells amazing), and it's refreshing. I rarely have to use moisturizer when using the toner twice a day. It cleared up what little acne I had, and it helps de-puff the bags under my eyes in the morning. I changed NOTHING else in my skincare routine, just added this toner twice daily, and my skin is better than ever. I sound like a bad commercial, but it's true. Haha :) It's an all-around wonderful product and I couldn't be happier."
1,"This color is perfect for fair-skinned, blonde, blue-eyed women! It has no orange/yellow undertone. It does have a blue undertone which perfectly complements cool-toned complexions. It lasts about 8 hours without significant eating/drinking. I have worn it through a dinner and afterwards still had color on my lips...only needed a small touch up. It is matte, so you need to layer with gloss. Again, if your blonde, blue-eyed lady looking for the perfect red lip this is the only one I've tried that looks beautiful and doesn't wash me out. This is the perfect red lipstick for me! That being said, if you're tan or quite warm-toned this will probably make your skin look dull."
1,"No need to pay a fortune for moisturizer, ladies. Research shows.... no significant improvement with $200 - $400 creams. Olay is the real deal. Enough said? Oh, one more thing.... the SPF version is just plain evil. Nasty smelling, nasty feeling, and WHITE! (This one is a faint pink color which looks less like suntan lotion when you apply it)."
0,"I read all the reviews so I thought it had to be good.  I will never buy this product again, it left a residue on my face that made my makeup roll off. I didn't have large pores untill I used this product, it makes my skin look hard and greasy. The best thing I've used is Olay regenerating serum, and I will stick to that from now on."
1,"I work in a medical office, wash my hands about 60 times a day and get very dry skin,especially in the winter and this is the BEST hand cream out there, and I have tried dozens of hand creams. It is greasy at first, but absorbs quickly and prevents cracking and dry skin if you apply frequently. This is a must in my purse at all times."
1,This is a product I have been using for years and love the light weight foundation powder. It always leaves my skin clear and hides any imperfections. You really cannot beat the price either.
1,"I love putting this into masks when I am doing a facial on a client, they love the smell too."
1,"This is a very effective product to relieve the itching as a result of moderate yeast infection or some itching as a result of allergy to latex condoms. It basically makes the area numb for a while, otherwise, it dose not have any anti fungus ingredient.However if the yeast infection is not moderate, the prescription tablets is a must and the over the counter cream is not working."
1,"This is a beautiful neutral shade. I like the texture, it goes on very smoothly and dries quickly without smudges, and is nearly odor-free. The nude shade has the effect of elongating the fingertips, even if the nails are shorter, like mine.  My only (slight) complaint is that I wish it were just a tiny bit darker, as I had trouble seeing it going on, and had to put my glasses on while doing my nails. I don't usually have to do that. I like this shade but the next time I wear it, I will probably custom-blend it with a slightly darker shade to get the exact pigment tone I want. I understand manicurists do this all the time."
1,Always loved Quantum.  My hair frizzes easily.  I have a few light streaks as well.  This is the only one tat makes for soft waves if used correctly.. and gets rid of my cowlick.
1,"I have had acne when I was a teenager of course I went to the doctor and got creams for it. I wish they had this 15 years ago. The teenager acne went away over the years and I never really had a problem with it again. I'm till about three months ago when my mother suddenly passed away. Flying overseas to see my family (we are a family and I am German) And all the stress and helping them with the funeral and everything ,plus the time difference, bad food -everything ..took it's toll on my skin.When we got back about a couple of days later I got the bill my skin broke out like I have never seen it before. It was worse than when I was a teenager and I'm 30 years old.For as long as I can remember I have always I cleaned my face every day with ""clean& clear "" facial cleaner and I put acne spot treatment on pimples that  just show up like everybody has them. Of course when I am close to getting my periode its worse. But I have never had it like this ! I had him on the temples of my head and my forehead and under my chin and on my jawbone. Also someone my cheeks, chest area and back..My husband had tried out Proactive the year before and I have tried it sometimes on my skin . but I have to say it always dried my skin out and burned and didn't really help. I sent it back and told them I am done.So when I have to outbreak I had no idea what to do . so I look on Amazon and read through a couple of things and I saw this and ordered it . because I thought I have nothing to loose.I took it and within two weeks my skin cleared up and of course I changed my eating habits again to my normal diet plan. But this really really helped!! felt that the cream also made a big difference in that and if you follow with it it really changes something in your body. After another week my acne was pretty much gone. Even when I'm close or having my period My skin has less pimples than before! I didn't even show any more than that iam on my periode!My skin stays clear all month long and I will be reordering because I am done now with my 60 day pack.I have never seen anything this effective and I like I said you should try it . for $13 you have nothing to lose but only to gain clear skin.On a side note :I also bought the "" clearzine"" u can buy on Amazon too and took that the first week as well additionally to the natures cure. I think it  made a big difference too but for the price it's a little bit too expensive but like I said I was desperate.Also I bought the acne spray from natures plus for my back . Again for the price a little bit too expensive .I have to say you can also use any facial cleaner and rub down your neck if you have a partner or boyfriend to do it for you. If not the spray is perfect because you can use it on any angle."
1,"so far this is the powder I usually buy along with cover girl, depending which is on sale and it is a good product."
1,"I've only used this twice and I already can't say enough about this curling iron. My hair is extremely difficult to curl - it's very thick and long. To give you an idea, I'm half Indian... have you ever seen Indian women's hair? It's ridiculous! Anyway...this iron is more capable of making flawless curls than any other I've tried. Since it's ceramic it's LESS damaging than metal curling irons are (although it will still damage your hair). It is also very easy to slide your hair through the clasp, while some other curling irons will snag on your hair if you try. Mine also came with a protective heat case to put over the iron for storage, which I find extremely helpful. With the protective case, you can put it away right away instead of waiting for it to cool back down. The iron also heats up very quickly and has multiple heat settings to choose from. I started out with the 0.75 inch and I ran out and bought the same iron in another size, because I have so much confidence in it. Although as previously stated, I have only used it twice; I have no idea as to the longevity of this product (although I hope it will last for a long time). So far, I definitely recommend it. I'm so glad I found it!"
1,"When my dermatologist was doing a skin cancer screening on me a few years ago, I was surprised when she said I had a mild case of seborrheic dermatitis. This made sense to me, though, as my scalp could get flaky and a little itchy at times. She recommended T/Sal. I figured, oh, great....I have to use a medicated shampoo now. I bet it will smell weird and dry out my hair.Well, not only does it smell like nothing, it works really well on my flaky/itchy issue, and to my shock and joy, it is not only gentle on my hair, but makes it super shiny and full. I would go as far as to say it is my favorite shampoo, period. Not my favorite medicated shampoo, just a great all 'round shampoo for everyone.I also use my wonderful Br&ouml;&ouml; beer shampoo, but I have found that the T/Sal even makes that work better too. I shampoo first with the T/Sal, then once with the Br&ouml;&ouml;. They are both free of harsh sulfates and the T/Sal is surprisingly simple in its ingredients. I believe the salicylic acid must be cutting any residue on my hair and so, making it behave better. T/Sal seems to make all my other shampoos and conditioners work better. I used to use Neutrogena's build up removing shampoo, but found it too harsh (sulfates) and too pungent. The T/Sal is far superior.This is a great shampoo if you have a &#34;reason&#34; to use it, and even if you don't . Gentle, mild, fragrance-free, powerful stuff."
1,Omg only been using this for 2 days and I love it! I bought this toner at GNC about 2 days ago and use it after I wash my face in the morning and at night and I have very sensitive skin which toner usually burns but this stuff doesn't burn and smells like fresh cut roses. I had acne scabs from popping my pimples and after using it 1 time before going to bed my scabs were healed and there was just a little redness from where they were. I have already noticed a difference in my skin after only 2 days. I'm so glad I found this toner!
1,"OPI is my favorite nail polish--it lasts a long time and covers very well. This is a great color--super fun for spring/summer, especially. My nail salon uses OPI, and my nails usually grow out before the polish starts chipping. This nail polish is expensive, but it's worth it."
0,I guess this would be a great product if you have a small head.  It doesn't fit mine so it was a waste of money.
1,This color was one of the first i ever bought from essie and i really like it. i would love it if the formula wasnt so thin and streaky when applying the first coat. but overall its a really beautiful color and lavender is a universally flattering color
1,This is a great color for fall and a continual favorite of mine. I love the pigmentation and ease of application. Slight shimmer and beautiful color. Cannot go wrong with NARS eyeshadow!
1,"EO's Refreshing Sweet Orange shampoo is scented with an especially beautiful orange fragrance that is not overwhelming, but subtle like a botanical bouquet of herbs and oranges.Organic White Tea, Dandelion, Lemongrass, Elder Flower, Hops mingle in a coconut cleansing infusion. This is a nutrient rich formula with vitamins and amino acids to give your hair the shine, body and nourishment it deserves.This is one of the few shampoos my husband asked me to buy again, so now we buy three at time.~The Rebecca Review"
0,i just recieve this perfume and also 3 more i was so happy about it box looked great bottle also but at the time that i tried na na!!! fake perfume smells like water with alcohol! this is so frustrating and dissapointing.
1,"My dog gets really dirty and smelly on his walks ,he is also allergic to many shampoos. I have been using this brand for years and he smells great and skin is soft with no drying of his skin. I feel bad because everytime I use this for his bath I keep wanting to hug and kiss him! So highly recommend for your snuggly baby : )"
1,"My skin is combination, tending towards oily.  This daily moisturizer gives my skin the moisture it needs without causing more pimples and other blemishes.  It leaves my skin silky soft and sinks in well after a shower - it doesn't sit on top of your skin like many moisturizers.  For the roughest of winter months, however, I do need a supplemental moisturizer (I use German Nivea creme on top of this), but I have found this is a pretty reliable, year round moisturizer."
1,This got me on name and color. it is a very bright reddish (slightly pink tone) color. I would almost say a neon red. I love it! its a perfect bright pick me up red and I plan on getting the gel polish of this color.
1,I used it on parted hair that needed a touch up and it was fine. Be careful not to color your scalp. Dampen slightly. Don't use too wet. I only gave it three stars because it really took a while to color the roots.
1,"I typically use Paul Mitchell's Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner...but, I'll be completely honest: I'm lazy, and Paul Mitchell is too expensive on Amazon (compared to in-store at Ulta). So, I decided to try this so I could have it shipped to me without driving 45 minutes to my nearest Ulta or salon. I absolutely love it! I do have very, very thick, frizzy, curly hair...but I've straightened my hair after using this several times and I have NO problem with any grease. In the shower, I wet my hair...use the Quidad clarifying shampoo....let it sit for the recommended 2 minutes...rinse...then I use my regular shampoo...and then my conditioner. That's my regimen. Love it! Will definitely buy again...certainly gets rid of all the build-up that develops after the gallons of hairspray I have to use to hold my hair when I wear it in an up-do!"
1,i really like this color. its really pretty. one thing is its a little clumpy but not much. overall I really like it. one thing I have to say is that when I first saw this I thought it came with all those colors that's why I got it. but that was my mistake. I would suggest to the seller to make take or get a photo of the color so other people wont get confused like me. but I do get confused easy lol. but its a nice color I really like it. :)
1,I am always on the lookout for the best mascara out there and this one is it! It's inexpensive and goes on so smooth and easy without having to coat and coat and coat.
1,Started using this lotion a few weeks ago and the first thing I noticed is that it caused me to break out -- I haven't had pimples like this since high school....YIKES! It hasn't seemed to change my fine lines in anyway so I probably won't keep using .....
1,"I am a self-proclaimed makeup junkie. I love shopping at Sephora to try new things, but I always order my old standbys here. Well, I had been hearing about this blush for years, and decided to order it here before trying it first. When I opened up the package I was first disappointed at the size. It was the smallest little compact of blush I'd ever seen and I'd never spent that much on blush before. The next morning when I was applying my makeup I tried it, heeding the warnings that a little goes a long way. I was blown away!! I usually look pale and a little washed out without lipstick, but for some reason with this blush a little gloss looks amazing! It brightens every feature; I have ivory skin with freckles and blue green eyes. My eyes were so blue green! And as for the reviews that say there is too much glitter, I would disagree. I notice a bit of shimmer, but no actual chunks of glitter. It has the right amount of glow for me, and I'm 37. My next purchase will be Albatross as a highlighter, hopefully I will be as happy as I am with Orgasm! If you are in doubt, just try it. You will be pleasantly suprised!"
1,I love this lotion.  I've been using it for  a very long time and it has improved the texture of my skin.
1,"I loved this- it seemed to add a bit of extra exfoliation to my skin without irritating it. And it smoothed out even the faint trace of lines I have around my under-35 eyes. My mom had a furrow between her brows which seemed permanent- but seriously, this product got rid of it! Amazing. However...sadly, this broke us both out within a couple of weeks of using it. My mom used it solely with Purity cleanser (which doesn't break her out), so no, it wasn't another product or a reaction of combining with something else. Such a shame, because it turns the clock back on your skin, and that is a RARE product which accomplishes said goal. The price of this is high, but for the results, it's worth it- if it doesn't bother your skin."
1,Maybelline shine free Loose Powder really leaves a nice finish on your skin. I use it over their makeup. It reduces the look of pours and leaves skin with a nice clean look. Very natural looking.
1,"this is a nice glue. stayed on all day, plus happy-hour time. The color is also a good match if you always use black eyeliner as  I do."
1,I've become more unhappy with the Walmart stores in the upper north west Kalispell MT and Northern ID. They seem to have lots of stuff on a shelf but the item you are looking for is blank half the time or all the time and or worse no longer even has a place. Clearasel pads are one and I couldn't even find Stridex. I tried stridex when I couldn't get the usual at another store and over time by the end of the bottle liked them. A bit rougher but the liquid seems to stay wet all the way through the 90 pad container. And I use these also behind my ears and along my hair line and just into it on the back of my neck for mild psorisias. I think the stridex seemed to work better for that. Not sure why but it is wetter so perhaps making better contact with the skin through the hair. So when wally world let me down yet again...I looked to mail order here on Amazon. And viola...three pack which for me is 5-6 month supply.
0,"The brush for this eyeliner is horrible. I LOVE brushes, and prefer them over felt tips but this is the exception. The brush for this eyeliner is VERY small and too soft. It's hard to make a straight line because the bristles are just all over the place. Additionally, when you go over to reapply liner in some places - when it dries, it tends to look very clumpy and unflattering. I had such high hopes for this liner because of the brush applicator and how beautifully matte the color was but this is a total fail."
1,"I have been using this on my stretch marks (stretch marks are old ones, about 8 yrs old) and on my scars (scars are recent, just a few months). It seems to help lighten the redness. I have noticed enough of a difference that I will continue to use it. It does not take away the stretch marks or scars,it just lightens them and makes them less visible."
1,"I have always spent a lot of money on shampoo. I am a fan of the original Pureology lines (not the cheap crap you get now at Target) and I love LUSH but they're both so *expensive*. It was the case that the only vegan/cruelty-free/high-quality ingredient/environmentally safe/people safe shampoos were hard to find and pay for. But. . .Finally! A shampoo that is:-good for oily scalp without stripping the life out of the rest of your hair-ok for color treated (mine is bleached)-smells and feels wonderfully cool and refreshing without a hint of fakey perfume-affordable (!)-good for the environment, animals, and people-made by an ethically empowered company you can feel good about supporting-responsibly packaged with post consumer recycled content-lacking in artificial colors, scentsThis is not quite the experience you get from a $70 bottle of shampoo, but it's darned good anyhow and you can't beat the price tag at a fraction of the cost of the salon bottles. If you have oily scalp but don't want to turn the rest of your hair into straw, this is worth a try and if you don't like it you won't be so broke you can't buy something else."
1,This bronzer is amazing. It works well as a contouring powder and a little really does go a long way. Use an angled contour brush to apply this and use a very light hand. You can build up coverage and it blends very well.
1,"I get extremely dry, itchy skin since I live in New England and am often outside in harsh weather. I have all kinds of lotion, and for some reason never tried Cetaphil. I bought this and it's now the only thing I use--it's that good! In addition to dry, my skin is very sensitive and allergy prone as well. I've used Aveeno with some success, since it's unscented, as is this. I found the main advantage in this as opposed to Aveeno is it's extremely moisturizing. I smooth it on in the morning and find that at the end of the day my skin is still very soft and not at all dry. It's the longest-lasting lotion I've ever tried. It's not at all too heavy though, or sticky and it absorbs well. It's nice because I can use it all the time without getting tired of an overpowering scent. I would highly recommend this to anyone, from people who just want good lotion to those with skin conditions (e.g. psoriasis, eczema)."
0,I'm on my hair journey and trying to find a leave in which keeps my hair moist when blow dried with very low heat. This (in small quantities) has done nothing for me. I don't find it good.
0,"I bought this because of the good ratings and am still hunting for stuff to deal with my thick, curly, coarse, long hair that is colored monthly and would be all grey if I didn't color it, so that might explain some of my problems with conditioning.  The first time I used it, it didn't seem to do anything more than if I sprayed my hair with water, and I can do that for free.  So, I decided to spray a lot of it, and the baby powder smell (some chemical?) really irritated my lungs and sent me running for my inhaler - I have asthma.  Now natural products and high end products never bother me; it is only chemical laden products and cheap products that cause this reaction.  At first I wasn't going to send it back, but now that it makes me ill to use it, I am sending it back.Dumb question:  Why do some of my orders have a button where I can provide a review, and some don't?"
1,"This is simply the best hand lotion I have ever used.  I love that it isn't greasy, and I can actually see the difference in my hands when used a few times a week.  The scent is not overpowering either.  I have paid a lot more for a jar of hand lotion, but I have never had these results.  I have a smaller size tube in my purse at all times, too.  This makes a great gift, and I have converted a lot of new customers for this product.  I highly recommend it."
1,"I may not buy a toner from a different company again. This toner is great and refreshing, and does not dry my face like other toners. I have combination skin with an oily forehead, and this cuts back on the shine and oil, and my breakouts have reduced since using this. I use it twice a day, and one bottle lasts me 2-3 months."
1,I love this peel off mask not only is it fun but its like a liquid form of pore strips. I use this after my mint julep mask because the sebum goes to the surface of the skin and become easy to peel off.
1,"I love the way it makes my skin feel; and it last a long time after applying it. This lotion works wonders for itchy dry skin, I will buy again."
1,"This curling iron works so well and I'm so glad I bought it. It's almost identical to a similar one I'd had for a few years that suddenly stopped. It's so hard to find this size but, once again, Amazon came through. Heats quickly, cord is a perfect length and doesn't tangle. If you are looking for this size, don't waste your time looking around. This is the one you want."
1,"I'm absolutely in love with this hand cream. Since it's winter my hands have been cracking a lot and feeling really dry. If it isn't the weather, it's washing my hands too often, but this cream has completely healed my hands. After one or two uses (overnight) my hands feel and look better! You need only a small amount to get this result too (:It does feel a little tacky after you apply it, but give a minute or two and it'll sink into your skin. It'll be like it's not even there!I totally recommend this product. No doubt in my mind."
1,This quickly dries into skin.  Does not clog up pores or leave oily residue.  Perfect for face and neck. Dries into skin within 5 minutes. After applying to neck and face my skin has a matte look.  Can apply makeup easily { I use non oily mineral makeup.} The makeup glides on effortlessly and the moisturizing cream gives me a smooth non-oily look.
1,"It is unlikely that I will ever use another blush.  This product goes on and looks beautiful.  Not greasy, doesn't smear.  Very light sparkle too.  Love it."
1,"I wanted to try this moisturizer since I love Exuviance foundation. I was hoping I'd also fall in love with this skin treatment. I can't criticize anything specific, but I didn't love it. It has a nice texture, and a little goes a long way. It does make my skin feel soft, and the scent isn't too heavy. For a similar price,though, I think I prefer the Olay Pro-X or Regenerist line. Primary reason? I did have a few small break-outs after using Exuviance Restorative Complex for a couple of weeks. Did the Exuviance cause this? I'm not sure. With the easy availability of Olay, I think I'll return to that family of skin care products."
1,"You cannot really compare no rinse shampoos to rinse shampoos. This product did end up leaving a residue and only masked the smell of unwashed hair temporarily (less than a day). Washing hair in the hospital is difficult, especially for someone who can barely move because of pain, but this product did give temporary relief and freshness to a bedridden patient."
1,"This green mud mask is amazing. As soon as I used it, and washed it off my skin looked so much better. It's like magic. My skin immediately cleared up. I try to use it every day because it really works so well. Love it."
1,This is probably the 6th bottle I've ordered over the years.  Gets the yucky black remnants of the mascara off from the lids and under the lower lid.
1,"Seriously, my fav color! Goes well with any skin color and its elegant and fun all at one, play it up with some white or gold or silver for a night out or let it be, it will still make you look nice with any color clothing and any season... seriously if you don't have this color you must get it!"
1,"This Tea Tree Cream product is amazing! It works for insect bites to reduce redness, and a variety of skin issues, I will keep this stocked in my medicine cabinet from now on and even give as a gift, its a great find."
1,It made my hair super soft and it smells really good. it actually made my ends look less broken then before.
0,It has sylisic Acid in it..It's really hard on your skin. My Skin was in horrible shape after I used this..
1,"This cream is really good at moisturizing and works generally well as a day-to-day sunscreen. Would need something stronger if you were outside all day or in a tropical area. My only concern is that if you look closely, it has little sparkles in it - that's what gives you the 'glow' it mentions - and I don't like the idea of covering my fresh-washed face in glitter."
1,"This serum by Olay is wonderful!  It makes my skin look luminous, it has helped my crow's feet, and laugh lines.  It blends in easily, is not greasy at all, and my skin soaks it up. I wear it day and night.  It makes my make up glide on, and helps keep my make up in place.  I really like the way this serum makes my skin feel: hydrated, smooth, soft, but not greasy or oily.  It gives a nice matte finish to my face.  I will use this serum as long as Olay makes it!"
0,"Darn! I'm so disappointed because I really had hopes this would smell like the Patchouli of days gone by. Unfortunately, it doesn't. The oil is thick and goes on smoothly with the roller ball but I detect no Patchouli fragrance. I even tested it with my husband who absolutely adores Patchouli: I did not tell him I bought this and when it came in I applied it in several strategic locations. He did not detect the slightest hint of Patchouli! In my opinion, the bottle I received may be old because it actually has the fragrance of cardboard. Very disappointing."
1,"I love the look of classic red nails.  I wanted a nice red that wasn't obnoxious, this was perfect.  The color is rich and beautiful, I love it."
1,"While the product itself was of very nice quality, it had a bit too much of something really unappealing to me.The strongest part of the scent reminded me of an old teacher I had in elementary school, or a grandmother.. a bit too baby powdery for my taste. It drives me crazy, because I WANT to like it, but alas, I cannot.Other than that, it goes on nicely and lingers for a good long while. Plus the little bottle it comes in is perfect to tote around in your purse!I'm excited to try out Night Queen or One Love though. Hopefully they will tickle my fancy."
0,"I thought I would purchase this after reading rave reviews. I have dry skin that is sensitive, the cream burned my skin, turned it red and made it itch, I had to wash it off. worst moisturizer I have ever tried. Gimmick!"
1,"I've used peel-off masques before, including one by Queen Helene at a friend's house, and I've used other QH products so I knew they were good despite the price.  I was at a beauty store getting some skincare products when I came across this and the Mint Julep masque, so I decided to get this gentle peel-off masque to use 1-2 times a week during the weekdays (less intensive) and then the Mint Julep masque to use once on the weekend.  I have combination skin (oily T-zone, normal/dry cheeks) and I've been breaking out a lot in the last few months so I wanted something that was going to help with the acne.I used this tonight.  I didn't expect it to pull out my blackheads like a Biore strip, because a gentle peel-off masque like this one isn't really made to do that.  What I expected it to do was tighten my skin and do a mild cleansing to my pores, and I felt like it did that.  My face is tingling gently, but in a good way; it feels clean and tight, and my skin is definitely radiant.  I also noticed that some of my big pimples have been brought to a head after peeling this masque off.  I didn't look too closely at my nose, where I have some small blackheads, but I'll see in the morning.  My skin felt soft and smooth afterwards.  I just put a light slathering of night cream on and wow, my face feels refreshed and revitalized.  Ahhh!Cons: It is goopy and messy, but if you are careful you can get it on without messing up too much.  I did this in bed.  Also, you want to clean your face first - preferably with warm water to open your pores a bit.  Get off the easily washable layer of dirt and dead skin so that the masque is really pulling from beneath."
1,"Well for the price its a fair curling iron, but it doesnt hold hair in a curl well, maybe with some type of curl setting product. It didnt even hold a curl at all in hair with no products. Its sufficient for the price though!"
0,This thing didn't last long at all.  The bristles fell out on my face and it had a slight odor.  Not like the ones I buy in the store.
1,"My dog is getting older, and let's just say hygiene isn't her primary concern (or even a vague interest) anymore.  Her little girl parts get kinda gnarly as she doesn't clean herself.  I've used baby wipes and those sturdier microwavable disposable washcloths, but thought I'd try this.  It's OK.  I did end up rinsing it just because I didn't want the residue back there in case she decided to go all 'bikini line' licking in the vicinity (which she didn't- just sat down incredibly quickly as the air hit her wet backdoor).  I doubt I'll reorder it again for her, but I'll use up what I've got."
1,"I've used this since I was about 22, about 10 years ago.  I use it only nightly, as I find it too greasy for daytime wear.  When I use it faithfully at night, I find that no matter what I am using in the AM (now a clinique gel) that my skin is clearer and evener than when I don't use it.  The price is affordable here, and in general, compared to other lotions that are of good quality.  I have tried many more expensive products but this works the best to keep my skin clear, without drying it.  My skin is prone to dryness and redness and I use this along with the aveeno calming cleanser and I don't use anything else on my face at night."
1,"I like Mrs. Meyer's products very much as generally they perform well and are safe to use. Thus far Lavender is my favorite since it smells like a moderate strength lavender;Geranium as it smells like a bushel of real roses (a bit overpowering); and then Basil for its very, very too light floral scent. I thought Snap Pea smelled like cut grass that had been sitting in a closed plastic bag and opened a week later. Although the suds/grease cutting  power is not as strong as Dawn, Mts. Meyer's product is much better than Seventh Generation's or Ecover's dish washing liquid soap. Of course it is also more expensive than the other 2 brands, as all 3 usually have an Amazon coupon offer at one time or another throughout the year."
0,"This oil smells like sweet herbs. I give it a rating of 3 at first because of the smell and feel. I love the smell, but I guess I have to wait another two weeks to see if it has made my hair thicker and longer. It feels really cool and moist on the scalp. I leave it in overnight.It's been a month now of me using this; it didnt do much. It does not make my hair soft at all. I hate coconut oil on my hair. It makes it crispy. I have natural african hair. I didnt use it 2-3 times weekly. I kinda stopped. I can tell after about 7 days when a hair growth product is working."
1,"I ordered the 3/4-inch hot brush for myself and after experimenting a few times, liked it so much I ordered the 1-1/4-inch as a gift for a friend and she is very happy with it.  It heats super fast, has many settings for heat needed depending upon hair type, and after a few minutes of experimenting I was glad I bought the hot brush style instead of a regular curling iron.  The delivery was fast, the items were packaged well, and the hot brush works according to description."
1,"Love this inexpensive humectant conditioner.  I have thick, fine, long straight hair and I only use it on the ends when I need it.  Works as advertised - just go easy on the amount!"
1,"Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser is the gentlest facial cleanser I have been able to find. I am highly allergic to several different soaps and preservatives, but Cetaphil doesn't cause me to break out, itch, or dry up.I'd suggest the liquid Cetaphil cleanser instead of their soap bar, as bars can cause one to have clogged pours (read: blackheads).The only downside is that it won't remove makeup very easily, so I only use it in the morning and use my trusty cold cream at night.This bottle is rather large.  I use it to refill my 4 oz bottle since it's cheaper to buy 16 ounces at a time."
1,"I love the color of this polish, it is a perfect bright purple, formula was ok, opaque in 2-3 coats."
1,"essie marshmallow is a pale, milky white. its really, really pretty. but the one HUGE problem i have with it is that its super streaky and needs three to four coats of polish for a flawless finish. thats pretty ridiculous. but i love the milky effect it has when its all applied and finished :)"
1,OPI has the best polish. I am a nail tech and I know about polishes. This is a great color for summer.
1,"Neutrogena lip balm is the same as Chap Stick SPF 15 without the 40% petrolatum. Neutrogena is clear, none tasting, no perfume, no wax, no PABA which is hard to find otherwise it has the same ingredients of Octinoxate and Oxybenzone. It is great when I am mountain biking but not great 1)in real hot weather or 2)surfing in the ocean. For that I use Carmex 15 in the tube since 1)tube is the best to hold in the ingredients when melting 2)nothing offers the protection of the petrolatum in the salty water of the ocean. Carmex is 90% Vaseline+wax but in a small tube with SPF 15."
1,"I love this lemon oil.  I add a few drops to my water every day.  I add it to unscented dish soap and hand soap for extra cleaning power and a wonderful fresh scent.  The only drawback is that for the four ounce size there is no dropper included, you need to transfer the oil or use pipettes."
1,"Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Good stiff bristles and the handle can be removed if you just want to use the brush by itself. Since I found out about dry brushing, my skin feels like a baby's. Try the AmLactin 12% lotion (also on Amazon) with this and you'll never go back to anything else!"
1,I actually do not see any difference between using this lotion and just regular hand lotion.  Hands are looking a little wrinkly and need something to smooth them out.  Won't be purchasing again and am on the hunt for something better.
1,"This is a very moisturizing cream that nourishes the skin.  It has an excellent, smooth texture.  I used it as a night cream during the winter and it was wonderfully soothing to my dry skin.  I also used it after a mild sunburn and it was very healing. The lavender essential oil makes it smell heavenly. The only downside is that it caused flushing to my skin which lasted a long time, so I wouldn't recommend this for daytime use."
1,I happen to like this shower gel and will continue to purchase it on a regular basis.  It is very emollient and smells good too.
0,"I'm no expert at beauty, so this is just one regular user's experience. However, I put it on and it stayed green, which had me worried. I blended it, and could see the blemish (red) peeking through, while the green remained stubbornly green. Given that it's a stick of concealer, it's a little insulting to think I did it wrong. Nevertheless, I removed it and tried again. Same result.So I went ahead and did my usual powder foundation/settling veil powder routine, and lo and behold - I could still see the blemish AND the green through my makeup.I'm not really sure what's going on. Perhaps I'm using the wrong color concealer? Either way, it really didn't behave or perform the way I expected or hoped it would. Good thing it was cheap because it has been sitting, unused in a drawer since day 1."
1,"I'm pregnant and early on in my pregnancy, I developed PUPPPS. It's the most awful rash ever and there's no way to stop the spreading. I did some research and found a lot of women tried this soap. First, it's not that bad smelling. If you're used to musk, fruit, and flowery scents, it'll get a minute to get used to. But besides that, it's a very good soap that gets the job done. I noticed an improvement in my skin over a week later and my symptoms were completely gone within three weeks on just one bar. I imagined if I used two bars, the symptoms would've disappeared even sooner.Get this soap. It's well worth the money and you won't regret it."
1,"i bought this mascara because i was tired of looking like a racoon when i went to pool parties. it has definately helped and will work if you dont rub your eyes underwater. it still drips a little in the pool, but not much. i have extremely long curly lashes and this made them appear very thick as well, which i liked. it clumps a bit at first, but after a week or so, it calms down. its a good buy for the price."
1,My skin is very sensitive and this is the only product I've found that works very well no matter what weather we're experiencing.  I've been using all Cetaphil products for about 7 years now and wouldn't trust anything else on my skin.  I LOVE IT!!!  I recommend this product.
1,This is by far the  best nude nail polish i own. Its a beautiful neutral color that flatters all skin tones. I doesnt have that negative beige undertone to it like most others do...it has more creamy pink tone to it. A real flesh color... awesome.
0,"Too small, thought they would expand when wet, do not. Was looking for looflas, these are nothing like that! Would not buy if I had known."
1,Cannot tell you enough.... I LOVE this blush! It's the perfect shade for me.  My favorite blush so far!
1,"I am a real fan of the Jason line of products anyway, but, I hadn't tried their Satin Shower Rose Water Body Wash. I am pleased to say that it smells terrific, brings my senses to life and offer moisture to my skin. All of these great benefits, and it made without garbage ingredients. Right on!"
1,"I use this product after I have cleansed my face. The top of the product allows you to control the amount of toner on the cotton ball or cotton pad.  This product does not irritate my skin and always leaves my skin mineral makeup free.  This product is alcohol-free, paraben-free, and propylene glycol-free.Made in the USA"
1,"I have this blush in the Golden Gate shade and I absolutely love it. I usually use a fantail brush to dab on just a hint of color, but it's easy to build this up into a more intense flush, if you so desire. It only takes a tiny, tiny amount of product to create a lovely color, so I am sure this small container will last until I am 90 years old (and I'm only 30 now). This is a cosmetic that's well worth the money!"
1,"What can I say it's face powder, it gets the job done. No funky smell or caking. Came as pictured and unharmed."
1,"THis product came highly recommended by a friend of mine that said that it really helped her a lot through menopause.  I've been using this along with a DHEA supplement and it's really made a huge (positive) difference in my symptoms.  Emeritus products are really good - they also sell supplements for menupause and other issues, so I'll be trying others.  BTW, don't order it from DAB.  They aren't very dependable with these products, and [...] sells it for nearly 1/2 off."
1,"I use this as an all over (head to toe) moisturizer year round. In the summers, I put my go-to sunscreen over it and it's not too much. I'm a bit of a product junkie, so in the past I've deviated from this to try other lotions and creams, but always came back to Cetaphil. I'm not budging again. It's economical, it doesn't contribute to breakouts (the skin on my face has an attitude), it moisturizes and keeps my skin that way throughout the day, and it seriously softens everything it touches. It's not greasy, soaks in quickly and well, doesn't interfere with any make up I use (that said, I only use a gel blush and maybe some powder) and it has a good ranking on the Environmental Working Group site (I think a 2 or 3) and contains no parabens. Sold."
1,"Bought this for my fianc&eacute; after looking at dozens of different overnight bags.  This was the best value by far.  It's made of a nice, soft leather, with ample space and great design.  My fianc&eacute;'s first comment was that he liked the design, with the zippered compartment below.  The top section is ample, but when it zips shut, it compacts it nicely.  So it holds a lot more than you'd imagine.I also liked that this is considered to be the ""original"" Dopp kit, as Buxton owns the original Dopp company started by Charles Doppelt, the man who first created this design of bag that eventually the US military distributed to all its men!At $24.95, I paid considerably less than pretty much any other comparable overnight Dopp style bag out there...including getting free Super Saver shipping from Amazon.  Highly recommended!"
1,"I would have given it 5 stars because the pigmentation is phenomenal. It is very dark brown almost black, matte and long wearing. Perfect for contouring eyebrows for those who have sparse eyebrows and have dark hair. Minus one star for the price, when I got this, I thought it would be bigger than what I received. It is tiny. I think my whole thumb is about as long as this with it's container. I don't know how long this will last in my make-up box but for $24, it better last a long time."
0,"I bought 2 items:  TheRuby Stone Nail Fileand theRuby Stone & Nail Buffer.They are exactly the same and both are TERRIBLE.They are like rubbing your nail with a long flat dull stone.  What I could do in 10 seconds with a cheap dollar store file, it would take me 5 minutes of filing with these.  I was so pissed I showed how weak they were to my husband and he laughed his ass off.""But they both got such good reviews on Amazon"" I said...And he laughed even harder.The next day I went back and tried to use them again (just to make sure i wasn't going crazy the night before) and yes, they really are useless.  Completely useless."
1,"I tried this conditioner because I've been hearing so many great things about it. First,I scrubbed my scalp with vinegar & water (really helps to keep the dandruff away and eliminate build up) and then washed my hair with Tropic Isle Black Castor Oil shampoo. I then used the GPB conditioner and was very pleased. It does have a very strong herbal smell (not medicinal but very strong) and is really thick. I don't know how well it would work on straight hair, but for thick, African American curls, it's perfect. There was much less shedding than I normally get when I finger detangle which is unusual, but I was pretty happy about that. I rinsed it out and put about 10 twists in my wet hair. The next day, my hair was very soft and shiny. Lots of shrinkage but nothing out of the ordinary. I plan to use this once per month and perhaps try it as a leave in to see what happens. I took one star off because I'm not in love with the strong smell, but as a conditioner, it was awesome. They sell it at The Vitamin Shoppe and Whole Foods in New York if you just want to pick up a bottle."
1,"I have very dry super curly hair. I get build up on my scalp whenever i use 'regular' shampoo/conditioner. I've been using apple cider vinegar to treat this but it doesn't always work for me.  After the FIRST use, this shampoo cleared up my scalp. It's squeaky clean with no weird off-white build up! Yay!There's also no smell! I've tried head and shoulders, tar shampoo and hated the smell.This stuff is fragrance free. I love it :)Btw, haven't tried the conditioner but I use my ACV/Water spray as a conditioner after this shampoo. Works wonders, super soft curly hair with clean scalp :)"
1,"Great smelling, concentrated and powerful dish soap with an addicting scent. You'll never go back to Dawn, Ajax or Palmolive again!"
0,"I had used this brand years ago and never had a problem. When my most recent tube of another brand ran out, I went back to the soft black great lash but the very first day I used it, my eyes felt dry and itchy - I thought it was odd and as normal, washed off all my makeup that night taking care to remove everything around my eyes. The next morning, my eyes felt worse - crusty red and irritated. Took some visine, thought maybe some soap had gotten in my eyes and that was the problem. Applied makeup as usual including this mascara, same day time issues, same problem the next morning with red irritated eyes. Being stubborn I tried it again day 3 - same problems. Nothing else in my regime changed except this mascara. Now I am reading reviews on this same brand in blackest black that there is something causing the same problems for many other users. Something is up with Maybelline. I would take it back to the store if I kept the receipt. No star."
1,"My father says this color looks like poop in a bottle, but I highly disagree. It is a chocolately brown and being OPI you know the coverage and staying power will be top notch. Who doesn't love cowboys anyways? Definitely worth the price I got it for."
0,I'm still using this and been using it for weeks with no result.  I should stop because it hasn't gotten rid of any of the pimples on my face.
1,"I have this tinted moisturizer in light/fair and I thought it was decent, but not great. It has a lot of sparkles in it, and I find that they rub off easily. At first I didn't notice the sparkles, and thought I was secretly a stripper at night(Sleep stripping?). Turns out it was this product. The bottle is very poorly designed; product builds up on the outside, and then dries up, and has to be removed. It's kind of gross. It wastes product, too. I ended up discontinuing use of this product before I ran out, because of how much glitter it contains."
1,This is a fantastic neutral that is a brown mauve color. It looks very sophisticated and goes with many different color outfits. I have Out the Door topcoat on it and it's so shiny I am amazed. Be warned that it doesn't look exactly like the bottle color but it is a must have if you like neutral shades that stand out.
1,"I love this gloss and was happy to see it listed on Amazon.  It's the prefect sheen and consistency.  It's thick enough to stay and feel smooth, but not so liquid that it wears off quickly or feels slimy.  I like it better than the all silver container version of this product (think that one's called XL?).  This one is thicker and has a nicer effect.  Nothing works miracles and it certainly doesn't plum my lips like collagen might, but I'm happy with this product and find that the container lasts for years of intermittent use.  I like the clear one better than the colors and I'll be buying it again as long as it's available."
0,Don't believe the favorable reviews.  These are useless and tiresome.  The adhesive is doesn't adhere and there is no noticeable difference even after you tape them overnight for a week.
1,"It does the job, so I have no complaints. I will buy it again, when the current one wears out."
1,I got this as a present for my dad and he loves it!  It was just as nice as the picture makes it out to be.  It's solid wood so it's sturdy.  We didn't have any problem with the lid as referenced in other reviews and were able to find soap to fit it without a problem.  I would recommend it for any classy gentleman.  Makes a nice gift!
0,I returned this hair setter because the ends of the rollers get too hot to handle. The rollers are also very small.
1,"t's very good to use as base or top caoat or dry fast coat. it makes loly 30 sec to dry yr nail after coat, so amazing. really love it. you won't disappoint."
1,"YUMMMMMY and TERRIFIC Shampoo.You will love it!Try it, it is GREAT!As a user for many years of Ouidad products, I would rate this as the Best Shampoo, and Best smelling shampoo I have ever used.Not strong, just clean.You are in for a treat.Although I am deeply disappointed in some changes Ouidad recently made with their Curl Quencher products, I would still buy this shampoo."
1,"I absolutely LOVE these towels. I got one as a gift years ago, and fell in love with it. I somehow lost track of it, so I replaced it with this one. For someone with thick, long hair, this is a MUST-HAVE. It normally takes me about 10-15 minutes to get my hair dry (using a blow dryer), but if I pull my hair up into this towel, it can cut that time down to under 5 minutes. I don't have an issue getting all of my hair into this smaller size (my hair is about 9 inches past my shoulders, for a reference point). However, the towel is left pretty wet after I unwrap my hair, and it takes it a while to dry out. For that reason, I upgraded to the larger 29&#34; x 55&#34; size later on. I still use the small one for traveling, or when the big one is in the wash. I've had this one for about 4 years and it's still in good shape. **Remember, don't use fabric softener or dryer sheets when you wash your towels - it leaves a residue or coating on the fabric, and makes them less absorbent."
1,smells so good stays in forever I love the smell I always buy it pricey but its so good .
1,this is something else that I bought myself. I love the Bare Minerals  line of make up it is my own personal chose to use it I like the way it covers I like how it looks on.
1,"I would not buy this liquid liner again.  I do like that it is waterproof, but I do not like that I have to apply, and reapply it several times before I can get it right.  I am used to being able to use an eye liner brush to smudge, and blend, or correct the line on my upper lid, and you can not do this with this eye liner.  If you do not like how you applied the line, it will flake off, yes, peel, and flake off, and you will need to start again.  But, once you get it how you want, it does stay.  I would not buy this liquid liner again though."
0,"Easy to mix. Very messy. Like Coney Island chili.  Keeps dripping from hair, will need a towel to stop drips.  Left on more than required time.  Time consuming to rinse out. Crumbles all on the floor.  Does not color dark brown to black hair at all.  Does not cover gray.  I'm still seeing the gray.  It only subtly colors hair that is already naturally light or dyed a light honey blonde.  The color is barely recognizable.  Makes hair tangley.  Doubt I will waste any more time with this."
1,"I've had awesome nails my whole life, but they've become brittle over the last couple years and have been cracking and splitting like crazy. Changing my diet didn't help, so I've purchased a few different nail products hoping to find a solution. This is the first product I've used that's made any difference at all. My nails aren't perfect yet but in just 10 days of using this product, there's already a huge difference. So excited to have found something that works!"
1,"Karma is one of LUSH's signature scents (Ginger being the other one), and I'm torn about this soap...do I like it? Do I not like it?I really like the refreshing scent of Karma soap, but I am not a fan of patchouli, which is one of the main ingredients.  Karma smells mostly like oranges, but it still carries a slight spicy kick to it (not like Red Rooster though!).  When I first bought this soap, I really liked the smell in the store and when I first started using it, but as the soap got used more, the smell started to turn spicier.  Maybe because it's handmade, I got a part of the soap where the spices were stronger.  Anyway, Karma soap still left my skin really clean and it last quite a while, even though it is glycerin based.  Don't think I would buy again because LUSH has so many other soaps that I love, but would use again if I got it as a gift."
1,I was looking for the softest pink & of course OPI never disapoints!! Perfect for the long hot days of summer..This shade looks great on everyone & stays on & on! Love it:)
1,"WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FOR $40+ DOLLARS.  This product is perhaps the greatest I ever used on my chest and back.  It completely cleared up my acne on those parts of my body and kept it clear.  So, as you can imagine, I was pretty upset when I heard it was discontinued.  I never found anything quite like it.  Today, I went to Walgreens and happened to stumble into the face/body wash (essentially acne) area, and saw a tag for this bar!  I was so happy!  I asked the clerk if it was being back into production and she said yes!  If it's not in your local store yet, it should be by the end of this week (September 17, 2011)!  Don't pay $40+ for it, it's coming BACK IN STOCK for around $8.50!"
1,"This palette was a decent price and I was looking for a few different shades. This palette conceals decently, however, it does somewhat cake up and crease."
1,Any gal who wears mini lashes (like me - I usually buy a full pair and then cut each in half to make two pairs to make mini lashes) for the middle of my eye; this adhesive is the best and I've been using it for 15 years!  Just can't war it in water and your lashes will come off if you cry!  Love it; it does the job when you want that extra bit of glam w/extra lashes.
1,"I tried the Nailtek Foundation No. 2 because I have a lot of ridges in a few of my nails and it worked beautifully to smooth them out.  Unfortunately, it also chips very easily.  To fix that problem, I use a coat of OPI Nail Envy underneath, then put on the Nailtek No. 2 foundation, put on polish and then use another coat of the OPI Nail Envy as a top coat and it works like a charm!"
0,"I wasn't even able to give this product a chance. After just one use, I could not believe the smell. It smelled like burned plastic after applying it to my face. It made me sick to my stomach. The smell was even on my baby when I laid him down to sleep and I took a baby wipe to get it off of his head. It just smells so bad!"
1,Love Essie nail polishes and this color is very nice and I find it to be quite unique. It's a very light purple but still quite vibrant. I always use 2 coats to get a completely opaque look.
0,"I was re-stocking the guest bathroom and bedroom and got the bright idea to get a collection of Avalon, which I've always liked, so everything would match.The lavender scent is not pleasant and is not the lavender I am used to. In addition, the way the products are labeled it's almost impossible to tell which is lotion vs hand wash without a lot of light and glasses.The ""off-lavender"" odor of the lotion is very strong, almost overpowering, and the lotion itself is cloying and greasy.This was not a good choice at all - I should have looked more carefully at packaging and such before purchasing. But who can mess up lavender? Avalon. That's who.Can't recommend."
1,Love the nailtiques protein line. I recommend the line to all my friends no matter what state their nails are in. The #2 protein helped my nails become stronger and I could see less cracks and strains in my nails within a matter of weeks. You can feel the difference in your nails within a week though. Great investment!
1,"this gray cover up works well - sort of resembles a crayon and is a bit on the dry side, but it does work !"
1,"Or when combined with the Regenerist serum.  I've been using it faithfully each morning for several months and it makes my skin feel good as well as protecting from further sun damage...I can tell because the color of my skin is very pale now (too hard to find a matching foundation).  It's a good value, too."
1,"I think this is way too heavy for a day creme.  It goes on thick and greesy.  It is very heavy.  The greesiness subsides but I can still feel the heaviness.  I feel like I have a mask on.  It is not light like Burts Day Radience which I think is a much better day creme. However this creme seems to be good for really cold winters.  If you put it on with some water and really rub it into your skin it seems to lock the moisture in, which is good for cold winter days that have a drying affect on skin.  Also I think it's a great night cream.  Once again, I rub it into my skin with some water to help my skin retain moisture.  So for a cold creme or intensive creme to protect against cold weather I'd give it 5 stars but not as a day creme."
1,"I got this rather quickly after I ordered it and I must say for the price, it's a fabulous product.  It is not too greasy and gave me good coverage until I need to color again.  I did not notice any rub-off on my clothes either so I much appreciate that.  I have black hair so the black blended in quite nicely - no one could tell that I used the stick.  It's also small like a lipstick so I can take it in my purse whenever I need it.  For the price and the gray coverage it provides, you can't go wrong."
1,"I think it makes my skin better. There were other factors and changes that I made from between my skin was doing badly and when it got better, so I can't say with certainty that the improvement was due to this product. But, I definitely feel that my skin tone has evened out a bit. And really, I just love the smell."
1,"This is a good face wash, nicely clarifies skin. The pump works well. It's a good price too. Thank you"
1,"This rosewater smells exactly like what it's supposed to, but it's not powdery at all. I use it as a toner after oil cleansing my face. I want to put it in my spritzer bottle next."
1,"Doctor recommended dove for sensitive skin for my baby girl and vanicream moisturizer. I liked the moisturizer so wanted try the soap also... Used it and found it amazing, very soothing and mild soap. Have been using this for about 4 years now for my kid. Also whenever I get some skin problem like dry skin etc, I use this. It quickly calms my skin. Just love all the vanicream products"
1,"I like this when my knuckles get very dry.  It is kind of vasoline like.  I like the smell which is I think is slightly menthol, like vics vapo rub but not as strong.  It is a little greasy so I have to get it off of my palms.  But when I put it on it also works well to rub into my cuticles."
1,"I bought this moisturizer for my 93 year old mother. She was very overweight when she came to live with us and had a lot of loose skin under her chin. She had lost over 25 pounds since living with us, and much of the hanging skin under her chin is gone. Although some of this is due to the weight loss, I believe this cream has helped. I have used it on her every night for the last year and a half, and the chin is disappearing in addition to wrinkles on her face. For 93, she looks pretty darn good."
1,This towel really absorbs water. I am ready to start on my hair only a few minutes after wearing this towel.
1,"This color is perfect for me, and the quality of the lipstick is top notch. I will use this forever."
1,"I love the 60 second instant heat-up & that it has 30 temperature settings. At first, I had a little problem with a ridge from the clip, but with some practice I was able to adjust the angle of the iron in order to eliminate that. Now, I get nice smooth curls.The only real problem I can see is that the heat setting dial is in a bad location. With every curl, my thumb would accidentally change the dial. I had to make sure, after each curl, to check the number on the dial. That's not so hard to do for the price!"
1,"Nice lather, washes off clean. And yes it is unscented but unlike some other products this is very pleasing to my nose."
1,I am always in a hurry after I take a shower and this product doesn't dry my hair well.  I should probably leave it for 5 to minutes on my hair so it will dry it thoroughly.
1,This is not black or grey or brown. It is like a mixture of all 3. I have enjoyed this colr and out sparkle on top.
1,"Leaves my face, fresh, super clean and free of acne. Have started to use it on my hands and arms to prevent wrinkles too."
0,"This stuff is super thick and in a bad way. It has NO slip whatsoever, so it's thick and goopey and doesn't spread easily at all. It also has a strong, annoying scent, and did not effectively moisturize my thick, coily AA hair. I would not recommend."
1,"My hair is naturally a medium dark blonde. This product turned it a very intense dark &#8216;carrot top&#8217; red. I actually did like the color, but it isn&#8217;t at all what I planned on.Now I am going to dye my hair with a permanent dye that actually first bleaches the hair, and then for livening up the color between colorings I will use a quick rinse with this. Just enough to give it a strawberry color but not the &#8216;carrot top&#8217; color that it gave me before.I was really happy that it took about 6 weeks to wash out of my hair, even though I wash my hair with a &#8216;clarifying shampoo&#8217; every single day. Now that is lasting power!"
1,"I use and like most all of the Olay lines of products.  This one is great because it is not only a sunscreen but a skin treatment as well.  I can't wait for the one that has a ""hint of tan"" in it along with the sunscreen to be on the market. I heard about it, but apparently it is not out as of yet."
1,I have been using this product for years and sometimes it is hard to find. I have it on subscription at Amazon and they are so good about having it to me every 2 months. I love the feel and silkiness this gives my skin and cannot imagine anything else working as good.
1,"I normally only wear soak off gel polish - or nothing at all.  Tee hee.  In between gel manicures I like to use this color to add a little bit of shine and strength to my nails.  I only use one coat, with no base or top coat.  It dries really quickly and looks very natural, because it is quite sheer.  This is the perfect shade if you want your nail to look unpolished, and is not as shiny as a clear polish.  Multiple coats will give a creme pink that is kind of blah. Unlike every other regular nail polish I have ever tried, Essie polishes do not easily chip.  I work in a job that is really hard on my nails and normally I can't go a day without a chip in the polish.  Soak off gels give me the durability I need, but I am really bad about peeling them off which is awful for my nails, and leaves them looking like crap.  They need a rest, so they get their ballet slippers for about a week every month.  I keep a bottle of this in my desk drawer and at home."
1,"I have changed an earlier review on this product. My fault, I was a newbie to the reviewer world and I failed to realize the importance of tried and true testing. 160 reviews later I get it. It took 3 different products and a very specific combination of products to achieve the texture that I was looking for.Me - 28 this month. V shaped hairline. Hairstyle - long enough to run a comb through, usually let it grow for 1.5 months then cut back.The Biotin B-Complex conditioner is a daily counterbalance to the Biotin Shampoo. The Shampoo is harsh but effective. It leaves my hair feeling like a brillo pad and the conditioner helps break that apart. When used together the signs of balding are significantly reduced (seeing your scalp through the hair). Also, my hairstyle is a lot easier and fuller looking (messy and pushed up in the front).Even with the combination I found my hair needing a break from the two. I use Organix Coconut milk conditioner once a week to soften my hair. This is an extremely effective break.The proportions I use suit my taste. The appearance of thickness is all I really care about. I know i'll go bald eventually which is why i'm putting the work in the gym now. You have to be in shape if you're bald :)"
1,it really stays on.  I love the way it doesn't just chip off when I make my hands wet. which today is often.  the color is so pretty!!  it shines and really sparkles.  reds are the only real color I wear.  this floats my boyfriends boat!!  the seller got it to me so quickly.  that was very nice!!
1,So nice to be able to get this great color!!  You just can't beat the OPI nail care line for a great long lasting nail polish and the incredible selection of colors.  My personal favorites seem to be the more natural creamy beige-tan-caramel colors.
0,I purchased this hand soap based on the rave reviews but I don't see anything special about it.  I think it cleans well but the scent is somewhat &#34;fake&#34;.  I don't like it.  I may try other scents.  I prefer hand soap from Bath & Body Works.
1,I am pretty hard core when it comes to acid peels and such. I had been using the Avon peel pads which supposedly has 35 percent glycolic acid. However those pads do not sting like this cream. I must say I am very happy and will continue to use this as part as my day cream. I used the skinceuticals 1.0 retinol at nit. Let me tell you my skin has NEVER looked this good!
1,"I can't use any other fragrance than real rose.  What a great addition to witch hazel. So multi-purpose, refreshing and lovely to use. Love it!  Need more!"
1,"Excelente producto, muy suave y fresco se puede usar de diario, recibi el producto en el tiempo estimado, lo recomiendo."
1,"I'm goona go ahead and call this a miracle bath. My skin was very dry from an allergic reaction I've had to a detergent and this immediately moisturized my skin, Never oily and lightly scented. Simply a  pleasure to bathe in."
1,"This mousse is ok I suppose, but, it is really, really stiff..I like the idea that it tones my hair and all but, I like mousse that is more pliable.  Won't buy it again..I mix lots of water with it and it works more like hair spray."
0,"honestly, I have a lot of blackheads on my nose.. its starting to really bother me therefore, I purchased this pore cleanser. OK, this product doesn't take out my blackheads. It does open up my pore and make it easier for me to use a stainless steel blackhead remover to scrub off my blackheads but this suction doesn't remove the blackheads. That is why I think its a total waste of money. Let me suggest you all to take a facial steam for 5-10 minutes and then use a metal (professional blackhead remover) and start to scrub off the blackheads. That works much better."
1,"I am using acne kit from acne.org.  i got this to compliment that kit.  I use this once week, but mainly for spot treatments.  As soon as i feel a zit coming i apply this to it few times through out day and zit never really makes it starts healing away right away.  Great lotion.  And for spot treatment this bottle will last for years."
1,"It tastes horrible.  The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because it takes a long time to dry and I don't particularly care for the texture.  Aside from that it gives my nails a nice gloss and it tastes like battery acid, which is exactly what I was going for."
1,"I bought this cleanser after reading the rave reviews (I'm a sucker for reviews).  After using it for 2 weeks, I have to say that it's nothing special.  My face feels neither better nor worse using Philosophy Purity than any other drugstore brand (Neutrogena, Aveeno, Clean & Clear).  For $20, I was expecting something special.  Maybe the people who gave this product five stars are experiencing a placebo effect where they feel like it's more effective/better for their skin because it's a more expensive cleanser.  Or maybe this product just works better for them, who knows?  But coming from a girl in her 20s with a normal or combination skin-type, I can't see even a tiny bit of difference.When I run out of Purity, I'll be returning to my regular $10 cleansers thank you very much.  While I'm not recommending against anyone buying this product, I wouldn't say it's a ""must-have"" by any stretch of the imagination."
1,This mascara is just okay.  No length or volume that I can see.  It does leave your lashes feeling soft so that's a plus.
1,"Just don't get it in your eye.  Clean, fresh smell and this product works great on my complexion.  Few scrubs are better in my opinion."
1,"I bought all this soap when I bought an infrared sauna.  The medical labs recommend that you use a glycerin soap like this or Black soap to clean the toxic waste off your skin that sweat brings to the surface.  I used this soap when I was a teen and remembered its scent--which I like.  The soap is a bit drying so I have to moisturize with pure almond oil afterwards.  I did find raw Black African soap from Ghana that I like better--no petrol or chemicals in it.  And, it does not dry like this soap does.  I bought it from a site on Amazon and frankly, I like the Black soap the best.  Four stars because it dries the skin--but if you are very oily you might need that!"
1,"I wasn't sure what parsley scented liquid hand soap would be like, but I really like Mrs. Meyer's products so I thought it'd give it a try. It's more like a floraly soapy smell with a hint of parsley that gives it a nice freshness. It's different and really nice. I kind of smile when I go to wash my hands with it, and always give them a little sniff afterwards because I like the smell so much. Some scents have been ruined a bit for me because so many products have them (lavender, I'm looking at you) and sometimes have them in a really unnatural smelling way, so I'm glad Mrs. Meyers has come up with some different scents that are actually great."
1,"I use Botanical Boost on my 2c/3a hair every morning whether I'm going curly or wearing a wavy roller-set style.  I originally got this when I purchased the  3-product Ouidad Expert Curl Kit over a year ago when beginning to use the Ouidad product line.  It has rice proteins and aloe in it which is great for keeping moisture in your hair. Smells good too!  I've learned that for my hair I need to apply an oil after using Botanical Boost to seal it and really lock in that moisture.  Once I've sealed it, the Botanical Boost locks in moisture and keeps my curls nice and fresh (I seal with a little Jojoba oil or either Ouidad's Climate Control Frizz and Flyaway Fighter).  If I don't seal after using the Botanical Boost, my hair tends to look dry which makes it appear dull even though it is moist to touch but is lacking that moisturizing sheen I adore. If that happens to you when using this product, just seal it by applying a little Jojoba or Almond oil after misting with Botanical Boost and you'll notice that you will have all of that great moisture you were seeking.Ingredients:  Water, Panthenol (Provitamin B5), Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydrolyzed Wheat Starch, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Rosa Canina Leaf Extract, Spirulina Maxima Extract, Methyl Gluceth-10, Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, Benzophenone-4, Benzalkonium Chloride, Fragrance, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin."
1,I love this curling iron! It does have a learning curve to understand how the handle works as it twists but overall I am thrilled with this purchase.
1,"I love this cologne; any time my wife smells it, she thinks of when we met because this was all I used to wear back then. For the price on this size bottle, I don't think this deal can be beat anywhere. The only problem (and the reason I gave this item 4 stars,) was that there are two caps in the package. One is the regular bottle cap, the other is the spray nozzle cap. The spray nozzle cap was bent in to the point where it would not go on the bottle. I fixed this problem by lining it up, then using a heavy lighter to knock the cap down to the threads, and used the threads to widen the cap the rest of the way by twisting it on. Now it has a perfect (if not tighter than usual,) seal...and I have no complaints. I would definitely buy this from Amazon again; even if the spray nozzle cap were mangled beyond use, they would have replaced the entire item at no cost to me, so there would have been no loss; just a longer wait."
1,"This is a thin, absorbent, small towel. It does a better job at absorbing water from wet hair than a regular towel and is very lightweight so you aren't doing a balancing act while it sits on your head with your hair twisted inside it.While it absorbs water a LITTLE better than regular towels, it's not life changing. It will still take a long while for your hair to dry while being twisted inside it. The key difference is that the water doesn't seem to weigh this towel down. So when you're walking around the house with your hair wrapped in it, you're not walking around with a heavy waterlogged towel on your head.As a few reviewers said, if you have long hair, you will find this towel's dimensions a little restricting. Read the measurements and then measure your favorite towel to get an idea of it's size. I really have to pull it tight in order to wrap my hair into it like a turban, so that it won't fall off my head at the slightest movement.Also, I have a pet and read some reviewers state that it works best on drying waterlogged fur. So I tried it out. I found that it does not work any better than a regular towel on fur."
0,"I have acne prone, oily skin.  But this was way too drying. I have since learned to use gentle cleansers (soap free) on my face and my skin has improved greatly!  I actually thought of hanging onto this for emergencies (when I'm out) but this is really not that great for anyone's skin in my opinion.  I now use a cleansing balm that is mostly oil based and my skin is soft, smooth, kind of glowy, with smaller pores (because they are happier), and less wrinkles due to the drying cleansers of my past. Including this one."
1,"so this is a product that def kills two birds with one stone, being 27 I am wrinkle consciousness but i have still not have outgrown my occasional adolescent breakouts, I have used everything from dermatologic, to philosophy , etc proactive , murad, and for drugstore, this with my clarisonic brush works the same if not better!"
1,"Non greasy, fragrance free, absorbs fast, base for makeup, moisturizes, lasts all day and can be used under or over another product. Olay lotions are the best I've ever used. I will burn down cities if they stop making it. Not really. I will probably just be incredibly sad. Love olay."
1,"Gets the Job Done perfectly! Curls my hair like a 100 dollar curling Iron, does an excellent job and it is also ceramic which makes my hair hair feel healthier!"
1,Good product if you are fair-skinned and burn easy.  I took this lotion to Florida to the beach and I did not burn.  There were no heavy scents and it absorbed well into the skin.
1,"I like the brush. It's large in circumference and I can spin my fine hair on it easily to dry it. One little odd thing. When I first opened the brush package, I wondered what the stick out thing on the end of the brush handle was. It seemed odd and looked like a hazard to me. But I figured out to pull it, and found it's a tiny comb thing to part hair. Not big enough to do much good, but a nice idea. I'll probably toss it so it won't poke me when I'm drying my hair. That's the only reason this isn't a 5 star."
0,"I really wanted to like this product. Priced right, smells great, feels great, and the reviews were all great both here and at Sephora, but it make me break out. I don't have acne issues at all, never had. I continued to use it for several weeks but it just left me a little oily. I have normal/combination skin and I'm still in search of a good cleanser and moisturizer. Trying Murad now."
1,"It's just a great conditioner! I wish it was a bit bigger but it is worth the price! I recommend this for all hair types, especially African-American hair."
1,"Didn't want to spend the money on Bobbi Brown's so I tried this. The coverage is heavy enough but without being goopey, lighter coverage than Bobbi Brown's. Super easy to apply, love the portability of this product.Only complaint is that it's a little drying so put on a good moisturizer before applying."
0,I have used the cream all the way to the end. It caused my skin to break out. I will not buy this item again.
1,"I bought FERIA'S VIOLET SOFT BLACK at a drugstore because I couldn't find theGarnier 100% Color Vitamin Enriched Gel-Creme Color, No. 210 Blue Blackin store, I'm going on a trip and don't have time to wait for shipping, so I went with this color.The color isn't bad, but it's not even close to the color on the box. I know there will be some variation, depending on what your natural hair color is and what color it is currently, but I started out with faded out blue-black hair!My end results were dark burgundy-plum color, which isn't bad, but not what I was expecting at all (see my pic I posted above).Although I like the burgundy colors and have had my hair that color many times, I was looking for a change which is why I switched to Blue-Black.The color isn't bad but it is a let down if you compare it to the box. I can't imagine what color it would be if you started out with light brown or blonde hair, but I'm sure the reddish-plum color would be intense!I would say that VIOLET BLACK is just a tad darker thanL'Oreal Feria Haircolor, Chocolate Cherry 36, 1 Application.If you're looking for a blue-black color or even a soft black color go with a different shade of black than this one because this will be more red (warmer color) than black."
1,"Amazing Amanda is my favorite Bare Escentuals eye color.  It's a soft, natural shade of light copper which works well with blue or blue-green eyes.  Almost all Bare Escentuals eye shadows are very believable though I tend not to like their blue or bluish shades because they look too brash on me (extremely fair skin, blue-green eyes).  They stay on for a long time, usually until I wash them off and I've never had an allergic reaction to them."
1,I bought this to help with certain parts of my hair that like to curl in weird directions.  It also is wonderful to use to give some more volume under your bangs.  I think it would even be better to buy a bigger brush head for the bangs if that was an option.  It heats up quickly and I use it every day.
1,"I use this under my face powder rather than makeup. I love it. IT's amazing and I'll never use anything else.,"
1,"I used this to help bathe my mom who was sick in the hospital. She was in the final stages of lung cancer. She could barely walk, talk, or move. Just standing was difficult, so going to the bathroom to shower was out of the question. She stayed in the hospital for around 3 weeks. I just put this solution into a tub of water and gently wiped her body every other day. The smell was calming and not intense. It did not leave a residue or stickiness. I also bought the no rinse shampoo."
1,"There is nothing special about this ""shampoo"" bar. It is a bar of plain old soap (oils, lye, and water), the kind you can make in your kitchen with a little knowledge and some standard chemical safety gear. It is extremely small, about 2 x 2.5 x 1 inches. If you don't like making your own soap (or if you're just too busy, like me), there are more economical bars out there. I usually buy an online brand that comes in a 6 oz bar (about 2.5 x 4 x 2 inches), for about 5 dollars.For those people who get a build up from washing their hair with natural soaps in hard water, a couple of table spoons of apple cider vinegar in a generous glass (16 ozs) of hot water makes an excellent rinse. Just don't get it in your eyes!Only three stars for this since it is so small for the price and claims to be more than what it is - a standard bar of soap."
1,The IT Stays Roll-On Body Adhesive holds my garment down for several hours but I must press the garment down with my hand throughout the day.  For that reason I gave it 3 stars.  I cautiously recommend this item.
0,"I expected this to be the texture of a flexible bandaid but it's cardboard paper like a paper bag from the grocery store with a sticky back and in little triangles. I have used it for a few nights and notice a difference on the forehead line but it's too uncomfortable for me to keep on my face and eyes. You're supposed to keep it on for at least 3 hours and they say it's best to leave it on overnight. I would almost rather use scotch tape. This product was disappointing. I really wanted it to work. If you like this kind of thing - I would recommend ordering strips instead of these triangles - when you try and cut them to fit specific areas, the corners are sharp and pokey and it leaves little parts that are useless you end up throwing away. I'd do it in a flexible bandaid type fabric and make them strips."
1,Love this product. It does wonders for my face! Gives me a glow I haven't seen in years! I am 59 and really recommend this product!
1,"It deep cleans without stripping my skin.  It doesn't make my skin produce more oil because too much has been removed.  After use, my skin is able to be moisturized.  I've used other toners and this is by far my favorite."
1,"I've used this for years. I'm not super crazy about the tint since it doesn't match my skin tone at all. I wish it was just white or something, but since I only use it before bed it doesn't really matter. It does a good job of drying out blemishes, and helping to prevent new ones, but I'd say it works best for healing a scab or lightening pigmentation since it helps the dead skin flake off. I use it as a spot treatment since it can be very drying and cause irritation in used too frequently especially without the use of a moisturizer. Overall a good buy and a great alternative to b. peroxide which I can't use."
1,"Most of Olays productions are very moisturizing as well as this product. I haven't seen any changes in my slight wrinkles I have so we will see. It also has a light smell, not overpowering. I would buy it just for the hydration part."
1,"I saw people on youtube in the natural hair care community with this wide tooth comb, and I received mine and I love it I keep it in my shower."
1,"I like it.  It doesn't make my face super shiny.  However, it makes my face feel thick (it's not that bad).  So far my blemishes seem smaller."
1,"This is my second time to buy this flat iron.  The first one I bought 8 years ago just bit the dust last week so I had to get a new one.  But I had no problems with the last one in 8 years so I didn't even look around, just bought this one again."
0,"I was interested in trying the Bare Escentuals products after I went with my roommate for a consultation.  I bought a number of products because I LOVED the way my skin looked in the store.  It evened out the scars left behind from acne and just made my skin look fresh.  However, after using this product for about a week, I developed red bumps in the area near my lower lip and chin. I went to the dermatologist and turns out that the Bare Escentuals products were to blame. My doc prescribed two topical medications and the dermatitis went away.  I haven't tried the product since then, but don't think that I will given what happened last time and the reviews of others with sensitive skin.  A lot of my friends and coworkers use this product and I always admire the flawlessness of their skin, but it just doesn't work for me.The best substitute I have found is the Super Moisture Liquid Foundation by Clinique.  I hate that its a liquid but it works for me.  It doesn't irritate my dry, sensitive skin and gives it a similar look to Bare Escentuals."
1,"I have since cut my hair and don't use these, but they were great.  Didn't snag your hair and gave a great curl."
1,Leaves my face soft and not dry. That is a good thing because I have used other face washes that irritate my skin.
1,"The color is still a beautiful lilac which is very in right now, however it is not nearly as bright/vivid as I expected. It's more dull and darker. Oh well I'll still wear it. Fortunately it might be more work appropriate because it's more subtle than I anticipated."
0,"This did absolutely nothing, brassy tones are not reduced at all. Cant really say any more about it than that."
1,This is my favorite anti-perspirant.  I buy it in bulk on Amazon.  The price is great and the product works!!  I love Almay products and this one lives up to the Almay name!
1,this product is great for controlling my frizz compared to this company moisturizing curl quencher gel. It keeps curls in place. Just a drop on each parting after co washing my hair works to keep things under control. My hair also stopped getting greasier and heavy since my old products weighed my hair down. Would really recommend for efficiency and frizz control.
1,"I love this oil, it is light and smells wonderful!!  Great for after the shower !  Will be buying again!!"
1,I have been using this lotion for years I love it! It has SPF in it too! ?I feel like it keeps my face mositurrized all day and the SPF also helps. It works great under make up .I highly recommend !
1,I bought this as a gift for my daughter-in-law who have very dry skin. She says she feels her skin looks a lot better since using this.
0,"I understand the positive reviews posted here are based on immediate results.  What about long term?  What about cancer?Doesn't that BOTHER any of the people posting that they're using this product?  It says right here in the product description and on the box that this product can cause cancer. How is it that women can be manipulated to believe that temporary relief from menopausal symptoms is worth the RISK of cancer or dying from it?  I'll keep searching for a natural remedy.  Possible side effect, cancer? HELLLLLOOOO!!  NO THANKS!If I'm missing something, that someone wants to point out to me....have at it!  I'm all ears."
1,"I've tried all sorts of high end foundations - Makeup Forever HD, Korres, Benefit, etc. and I finally got around to trying Bare Minerals. I'm glad I did! It gives a NATURAL finish that I love, since I'm trying to get away from the made-up look. I had no problem guessing to find a shade that matched me perfectly. I have a feeling that this stuff will go quickly since I use it pretty much every day, but it's worth it to me. It lasts all day and doesn't sink into the lines under my eyes too bad (although it will if I layer it over another concealer). I also have to be sure to wear a primer, especially around my nose, because this stuff accentuates my pores a lot. The finished product is worth it for me though... I will buy again :)"
1,"I usually use China Glaze and I love them but I got my first OPI nail polish from the Espana collection. I do love it, I can't remember the name but its a beautiful deep plum berry color. Ulta has a OPI minis set called senoritas that has three colors and a fast dry top coat in it for only $10. If I can afford more of the OPI i will start buying more of them, they're gorgeous colors."
1,Rapidly removes nail polish without damaging your nail and keeping their beauty. Helps strengthen weak and sensitive nails. Very affordable price for such a fabulous product!
1,I apply hand cream nightly and wear cotton gloves.  I think I've tried probably 30 creams and I had never found one that actually works consistently so I kept changing from one to another.  Well I'm here to say I won't be changing again :)  This stuff works GREAT!  I also bought a jar for a friend who suffers with the cracks on her fingers.  So far she likes it too.  Overall I'll definitely be buying this again!
1,"It is a nice color but I am on the fence with it. I think I'm going to try golden sunset next, I feel this is a bit too red for me personally.It really is a pretty color though."
1,"This stuff smells amazing.  I put it on my damp hair after showering and I don't have to worry about running a brush through it and ripping my hair.  A little goes a long way, so this bottle will last me a while.  I love this product!"
0,"Let me start by saying, these curlers were not my original choice, but 'looked good on paper', so I decided to give them a try. They don't hold a curl, they are not very easy to use and I don't like the way they make my hair feel. I would have sent them back, but because there is no defect, I wasn't able to, so I'm stuck with them. May try to get rid of them on ebay one day soon....."
1,I received this item much more quickly than I had hoped and at a fantastic price. L'Oreal's Hi-Lift products seem to provide the best anti-brass protection in hair color.
1,"Others have mentioned the fragrance, but I like it. Nice hold, and non-toxic! Rated very low on the EWG website."
1,"It didn't come with directions or a dropper so it's hard to get into a small nail polish bottle. It cost a bit more than I would have liked. The smell is awful so use in a well ventilated area, I know it a solvent but man did the smell linger, and gave me a headache. On the plus side it shipped super fast."
1,My Mom always told me the importance of a toner to keep the skin moisturized.  Living in LA my skin is dry dry dry because of environmental damage and climate.  I think it helps but to be honest I just keep using it because I love the way it smells and it is a witch hazel based toner versus and alcohol based one.
1,"I am very hard on my nails.  I work at a desk where I type on a keyboard for 8 hours.  Then I go home and type some more.  I wash my hands all the time, maybe 50 times a day?  Other polishes I've tried have chipped within the week.  Not this stuff.  Opi Nail Lacquer is the best nail polish I've ever used in my life!  The color is solid and vibrant and almost feels like melted plastic or latex paint once it's dry.  I would recommend it to anyone who is hard on her nails!"
1,"I bought several of these and installed them in the rooms at our bed and breakfast. As I don't wear make up it never occurred to me that women would like to see their pores expanded to such an alarming size. In any case, the mirror has two sides, one with a normal reflection and one 5X. It is easy to flip from side to side. I wall-mounted them in a matter of minutes and they telescope out and tilt so people of varying heights can easily adjust them. Nice, clean design and good for the purpose they serve."
1,Don't want wrinkles? Want to lessen wrinkles? I have used this product since I was 16. It's great. I love it. You can see it work.
1,"I've been using this serum for at least 6 years.  I love the fact that Olay eventually came out with this fragrance-free version, that in itself is a huge selling point for me.  And it works!  Most people think I'm at least 15 years younger than I really am.  I have a few very fine wrinkles only when I squint, and that's it.I am a normal-to-dry skin type in the winter and normal during the other seasons.  This serum really helps keep my skin hydrated with the harsh winter winds, and in the summer sometimes this is all I need as a moisturizer if I'm not going to be outdoors - otherwise I also apply a high SPF product if I plan on being outside.Yes, the silicones in this help with the dryness and they also help to blur the fine lines.  I also use a dab of this on my crows feet.  But you may need to watch out if you have a problem with milia.  I occasionally get a few, but I do with just about every other product I have tried so it doesn't matter what I use.  I like the results with this; I've tried other brands without the ""cones"" and they just don't work for me.This serum contains many ingredients that are beneficial to your skin such as peptides, niacinamide, several vitamins and green tea, which are often found in much higher priced beauty products.Pros:  Hydrating; almost instant blurring of wrinkles due to the silicones; great ingredients; no discernable fragrance.Cons:  The silicones can cause milia occasionally; Olay tests on animals and this bothers me & I wish they would find another way to test their products before putting them on the market -- other companies do, why can't Olay?I recommend this for anyone with normal or normal-to-dry skin.  If you have a problem with acne, probably not, but maybe if you are brave enough, you could do a test first."
1,"True to its name, this curling iron heats up fast (literally 1-2 minutes), and a blinking light turns solid when it's at temperature and ready to use. It gets extremely hot -- settings range from 1 to 25 and even a ""5"" is too hot to touch; I've used it at ""13"" for several months now with great results. Its clamp holds hair securely but doesn't snag hairs in the hinge. A sturdy wire foot and a plastic tip keep the hot barrel off the countertop. It has an on/off button and will automatically turn itself off (but not until it's left untouched for about an hour). The iron cools in the usual amount of time (touchable in 5-10 minutes, completely cool in 15+ minutes).I mostly use the 3/4-inch model -- but, with my very short hair, I also use the1/2-inch modelduring the first week or so after I've had a haircut. Highly recommended -- they're the best curling irons I've ever used."
1,DHS Clear Shampoo is working for gentle cleaning of my hair and scalp.  I use it in conjunction with the DHS Conditioning Rinse.
0,"I wanted something to fill in my nail ridges without exposing me to harsh chemicals. This does that. Unfortunately, it seems to have caused my nails to peel! Fail!!"
1,"During the past two years I've been struggling with some scalp build up problems and I pretty much have purchased all the drugstore products I could find to solve this. After months and months of trying to find a solution I decided to give this a try even though I thought it was quite expensive and yes, it did start to get better right away. However, it wasn't as quick of a process as I wanted it to be so I decided to buy Head & Shoulders Clinical Strength and use it combined with this and this combination REALLY solved it in a matter of days. Since I've done that I haven't had any problems, my scalp is super clear and I couldn't be any more please. I never really stopped using this product and I don't plan on doing it but just keep in mind that this product by itself didn't really do too much. In terms of the smell I don't really like it, but it's nothing intolerable or disgusting."
1,"This stuff is great! I'm so used to buying products that are oil free, but I have been shedding my old ideas about oils and I've been getting great results. I have combination skin that is prone to blackheads and breakouts, and my skin has been totally clear since I started using this stuff about a month and a half ago. Recommended."
1,"Jason!  Cruelty free and top-of-the-line. What more could you ask?  A small amount of this conditioner in the palm of your hand is all you need -- it is so luxe and a little bit goes far. My hair felt full and thick, but not weighed down by product!"
1,For women who have had to undergo radiation of their breasts.  It keeps them soft and supple.  I bought for a friend who had breast cancer and underwent radiation.
1,"Softsilver Red is a light strawberry red with silver shimmer. Has a little bit of pink and hints of coral too. Very pretty color. I actually like this color so much, I have it on autoship.  :)."
1,"I love lemons to begin with..this oil is strong and will sting your skin in sensitive areas, but it smells so good...just like a basket of pretty lemons."
0,I tried this and it only made my hair feel dirty and weighed down. I have fine hair and it was not for me.
1,"When buying skin care products lately, I'm selecting items with antiaging ingredients. That would be a variety of antioxidants and healing herbal ingredients. This product has an impressive list.Ingredients: Aqua (Purified Soft Water), Anthemus Nobilis (Chamomile Extract), Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Almond Oil), Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower Oil), Glycine Soja (Soybean Oil), Glycerin (Vege), Ester-C Liquid (Vitamin C), Stearyl Alcohol, Aloe Barbadensis Gel, Glyceryl Stearate, Symphytum Officinale (Comfrey Extract), Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Pinus Palustris (Pine Needle Extract), Persea Gratissima (Avocado Oil), Panthenol (Vitamin B), Allantoin, Potassium Stearate, Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Alpha-Bisabolol, Oxybenzone, Tocopherol Linoleate (Vitamin E), Methylparaben, Beta-Carotene, Super Oxide Dismutase Liposome, Propylparaben, Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Vitis Vinifera (Grape Seed Oil, Citrus Aurantium (Citrus Oil.).Grape Seed Oil contains powerful antioxidants to limit free radical damage. The oligomeric proanthocyanins (OPCs) in grapeseed extract also strengthen blood vessel walls and reduce swelling. Chamomile Extract is known for its skin healing properties. Aloe helps the skin heal faster by stimulating the body's repair process.I have to admit to seeing results after the first week of using this product. Needless to say I bought another container immediately. The Ester-C in this formula is eight times more effective than water soluble Vitamin C. That explains it! I have never seen my skin change so rapidly.Benefits of this product:Protects the skin by neutralizing free radicalsPromotes cell renewalBoost CollagenMoisturizesReduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinklesEvens out skin tone - if you have sensitive skin, you might be rather impressed withhow smooth and even your complexion becomes.Gives you a radiant complexionJASON products feature only the finest food quality ingredients and they are a much higher quality than the chemical grade used by other cosmetic manufacturers.

1,"I'm not too thrilled with this eye makeup remover.  Contrary to its claims, it does leave a greasy film.  Unfortunately it also leaves behind eye makeup, particularly waterproof eyeliner and mascara."
1,"I have been using this moisturizer for a few years now and I really like it. It smooths on nicely, keeps my face moisturized without being greasy, and does not cause me to break out. I generally put on a light coat after showering and then mix the moisturizer with my foundation when getting ready for the day. One of the best things about the product is that at the end of the day I don't have that ""I can't wait to get this stuff off my face"" feeling. I also use their night cream (Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment) and like that too.As for the anti-aging claims - who really knows if any lotion is working? This lotion keeps my face moisturized, so the lines probably don't show as much and the UV element probably helps too. Can't say that I look younger than before I used this product and can't say that I have aged beyond my years since using it either. It is effective, but certainly not a miracle cream. (When someone finds one of those would you let me know - lol.)Effective product at a reasonable price."
1,"I purchased this in the middle of a head cold and pounced on using it.  I was finally able to get some relief that I could get in the shower or in a closed bathroom with the hot water steaming up the room.  This concentrated the steam where I needed it.  I did not find it too hot, so that is great.  It is also great for opening pores before I do a mask or use a strip to remove those pesky blackhead that get in one's nose."
1,"I have a little chihuahua/terrior who never really smells bad (except when she rolls in poop) and an American bulldog mix who usually smells kinda fowl especially right after a bath.  The little one has allergies, so I wanted to try something without a ton of un-pronounce-able ingredients.  I washed both dogs with this shampoo and could not get enough!  Oh my goodness!  Even my big girl SMELLED SO GOOD!  I literally could not stop myself from snuggling them.  I really don't like overwhelming scents so it's not like it was overwhelming, but it is definitely noticeable and oh so pleasing!  I almost can't wait for the bottle to run out so that I can try another scent!  I hope you'll enjoy it half as much as I have!Bonus: It says on the bottle that humans can use it too and I totally believe it!  I have not had the chance to try it yet, but I'm sure that I will some day."
1,"I was really excited to try this because of the wonderful reviews.  I put it on right before going to bed. The 1st through 4th days were wonderful. It did exactly like it promised. My face looked much brighter and clear.  However on day 5, I woke up with red itchy pimples all over my face and neck.  After a series of expensive test and research, my derm said it was contact dermatitis from using this product. She said that it had the preservative Diazolidinyl Urea in it.  She went on say that a lot of companies are moving away from this preservative because it causes problems with a lot of people. Keep in mind, I do not have sensitive skin. That being said, if they would discontinue using DIAZOLIDINYL UREA in their product, I would definately try it again."
1,"this is a cool color, very beautiful...but its not as dark as the picture shows. It doesnt look that black. Its a very very dark wine color. Usually with reds you have to put several layers before it gets the dark color you intend...but this one is pretty dark after the second coat. But its definatly isnt ""black"" cherry.I give it 5 stars because of a plesant surprise."
1,"This hair wrap is such a great invention.  It's basically a headscarf with compartments that provide a place for gel pack inserts so that you can deep condition your hair without being tied to a bulky hairdryer. I purchased this product because it was suggested on a natural hair blog and because, as a student, I didn't have time to sit under a dryer all day. I had to study! This product was definitely the solution.To use this hair wrap, all you have to do is microwave the gel packs per the instructions written on each pack and then put them into the the wrap's compartments. Then you fasten it on your head and you are free to go about your business for about 30 minutes of deep conditioning. After 30 minutes, the heat is gone. I prefer to boil water and place the gel packs in it for 5 minutes rather than using the microwave because I have heard that the inserts can burst if heated too long in the microwave. I have never had a problem with boiled water method. When using this method, I even find that the wrap is often too hot to put on my head so I have to let it cool a bit before wearing it.I have two reasons for giving this product 4 stars instead of 5. The first is that when you put the wrap on your head, part of your head will not come into contact with the heat. You have to reheat the gel packs and then turn the wrap around to condition your entire head and that's just annoying. The second reason is because the material is really abrasive for your hair. You definitely can't just put the wrap on your hair without some sort ofElastic Plastic Processing Capto protect your hair. Even when just the edges of my hair touch the wrap, I notice some breakage. I just have to be extra careful to make sure that my entire hairline is under the plastic cap when I use this hair wrap.That said, I would suggest this product because it has made my life easier and served its intended purpose. Just make sure that you carefully heat the gel packs and wear a processing cap this hair wrap. Happy conditioning!"
1,"This product is hard to find on shelves in my area, on the rare occasion I or my mom would see it we would buy up like 3 bottles at a time. I have just started buying it on Amazon instead. I love that it absorbs quickly and doesn't leave my hands greasy (I HATE having greasy hands) but still leaves my hands feeling soft and moisturized. The scent is light and pleasant, similar to the scent of the other aveeno products. I'll also use it on my legs after shaving and on any other dry/itchy patches I might have on my skin and the oatmeal in it really does seem to help calm the itching."
1,2 mins after putting this on my hands no longer feel greasy nor rough. It leaves them soft thought a couple hand washings as well. A little goes a long way with this so dont be freaked when you get it and it looks like jelly coming out the tube!
1,"I have lost a disgusting amount of hair to an autoimmune disease. I'm 34 and had long dark brown hair. It's all broken off now pieces up to my chin! My hair is destroyed. I used this shampoo one time! And my hair feels amazing, I even received my first compliment in well over a year about my hair looking ""nice today and really shiny"". I was so happy I almost cried. Buy it, it works miracles"
1,"I really didn't expect anything spectacular with this dryer,but i am satisfied with the product overall...the seller did not tak elong at all to get my product out to me and it arrived packaged nicely and undamaged. I am using the dryer now as i write this review and even though it is very cheaply made i am impressed with the heat settings. High is indeed very high heat and perfect for when i do my deep conditioning treatments...the airflow is not bad either considering where the holes are place...all around the top of the hood, and then the airflow from the opening in the back. I can actually see this doing a good job on my hair if i were to roller set and get under the dryer no problem...if you are just looking for a cheap but gets the job done such as deep conditioning with heat for 15-20 minutes type of hair dryer then i say buy this one. Its ok for its price."
1,"Update on order. I ordered this color polish based on the fact I loved it and used it all the time several years ago. When I received this product, it was definitely not the same as I remembered. I contacted the seller and they offered a complete refund with no return. I will definitely order from this seller again."
1,Non greasy and really absorbs into the skin fast. I had really dried out cuticles and nails that made my nails look ugly no matter what type of poish I used. This stuff may seem pricey for some but it last a long time because all u need is a little bit. I read a review that said if u don't use this product everyday that your skin n cuticles will begin to peel. That is true. I didn't use it for like 3 days n the skin around my cuticles began to peek. Not very bag but enough to look ugly. Other tha that I love this stuff.
0,"Suave is one of the cheaper shampoos out there.  But hey, they usually smell good and they're good in a pinch.  Especially considering that a bottle lasts awhile.Tropical Coconut smells good.  It's sweet and definitely smells of coconut.  I guess the tropical comes from the fact that it is coconut, because I don't sense any other ""flavors"" in this mix.  No pineapple or anything.  And it clings to your hair, so hours after taking your shower, you can still smell the coconut.  So it is a bit strong.The effects on hair are debatable.  It does get it clean.  But it also dries hair out a little bit and I've been noticing quite a few more split ends than normal.  And since this shampoo lasted me two and a half months (being used on hair that's to the middle of my back) that's a long time to be torturing your hair.  But I hate wasting stuff so I stuck it through.  I also noticed that my hair wasn't quite as shiny and healthy looking as it used to be (although I cannot definitively blame the shampoo for that).  Still, it makes me nervous about using it again.  It does lather up quite well compare to a lot of natural brands.  Bubbly and foamy white lather that only takes about a nickel sized drop to generate.I'm not really sure how this shampoo is considered natural.  There's a long list of unpronounceable ingredients and only a few of those are actually natural that I can tell.  It just isn't something that should be continually used on your scalp in my opinion.  Splurge for a little bit better.  With ingredients like Ammonium Laureth Sulfate and Cocamid MEA, I'm not really sure that this is shampoo or rocket fuel.  I don't know what most of the stuff is.The bottom line is that this is cheap shampoo, with a decent scent, but probably not something that should be used on hair that you care about.  I recommend avoiding it.Review by M. Reynard 2013"
1,Thank you for this hair mask.  I use it weekly and it softens and thickens my hair after putting it on before shampooing for 15 minutes to half an hour.
1,"For me, I have tried so many different blow dryers for me baby fine and hard to manage hair. And these previously tried blow dryers blew my hair dry fast of course (I have thin hair), however, they dulled my hair and also damaged my hair as the drying velocity was much too strong and the heating was just too hot!So I tried the Conair 1875 blow dryer and was AMAZED and BLOWN AWAY (no pun intended)! This dryer I have found to dry my hair quickly and gently. Also, my hair is shinier and much more manageable.If you have baby fine hair like I do, this is the blow dryer for you!"
1,"This color goes with everything you may be wearing, except bright red, or dark brown. Many people have asked what shade I am wearing as it  looks really good and is flattering to almost everyone. It stays on a better than  average lenght of time, unless you eat or drink. I often put gloss on top for a more dramatic effect."
1,This item is really awesome and the price was great. It came earlier than I expected. It was exactly what I expected.
1,"I used this body wash and it made my skin soft and moist not dry. This bodywash I would recommend to anyone, it is GREAT, I love it and it takes the DRY out of dry skin."
1,This is a really nice peel-off mask that I've used for years.  It's getting harder to find and sells out quickly at the local drug store so I'm happy to have found here on Amazon.  It is a true peeling mask and exfoliates/peels leaving my skin feeling super clean and invigorated.  The Queen Helene Mud mask is great too.  I use both a couple times a week and I'm always pleased with the results.
1,"I've been using Bare Minerals for about 7 years now, I have very highly acne-prone skin, and I needed something lighter than a liquid foundation. Honestly, this stuff has been a God-send for me. You can use as much or as little as you need for your current skin condition.Obviously Bare Minerals has a very strong following, but if I can make just a couple suggestions...First, go to a Bare Escentuals store if at all possible to have them help you choose your color. Do not guess. Then come back to Amazon next time to save a couple dollars, as the price on here is cheaper than most stores carry it for.Second, especially if you are acne prone like me, I highly recommend using this product to apply it, in place of the brushes:Beautyblender 2 + Blendercleanser Combo, The Ultimate MakeUp Sponge Applicator + CleanserI wash the Beautyblender sponge with the cleanser before every single use, and then use it while it's still damp to apply my Bare Minerals. You wouldn't believe how quick and smooth it goes on. Plus, makeup brushes are a haven for germs, but SO difficult to wash, and cannot be used wet/damp."
1,"This creme is super heavy duty, but tends to disappear as it soaks in.  Great for hands and feet. Being in Arizona, I am always having to apply some kind of creme to my heels and hands to combat dryness. I've run through about a dozen, high-end and low-end, but nothing works quite like the Norwegian Formula. Must be all the glycerin?I wouldn't use it on my face, obviously, but anywhere you have itchy, cracked or super dry skin, go for it."
1,"This is the best mascara remover I've ever used. It is easy to use, takes off all eye makeup including waterproof mascara and does not burn my eyes."
1,THIS COULD BE A SISTER OF NORELL BY FIVE STAR FRAGRANCE.  A VERY GREEN DRYDOWN ON IT.  THE POWDER THAT I LOVE SO MUCH FADES INTO THE ABYSS.  I WANT POWDER NOT NORELL. I AM NOT A BIG FAN OF NORELL.  ITS NOT THE WORSE THING IVE EVER WORN BUT NOT MY FAVORITE BY A LONG SHOT EITHER.
1,"Confession time. I don't know why, but I've gotten where I put off taking a bath for way too long. I'm retired, and I tend not to leave the house unless I have to, so I know lack of a schedule is part of it; but my grandmother hated to bathe, so maybe it's a genetic thing. Anyway, I finally faced up to the fact that I just do not want to get in the bathtub or shower and sought an alternative.I mixed up some of this no-rinse concentrate and put it into a spray bottle, which I use to spray on my hair until it is wet. Then I scrub my scalp really well with it, towel dry, and style. It works fine as a no-rinse shampoo. The little bit of residue is almost like a light styling lotion and helps keep my fine, short, curly hair looking good for longer.But the real pleasure comes from mixing up some in the bathroom sink and scrubbing myself all over with a Salux cloth, which works wonderfully to exfoliate the skin and is large enough to use as a backscrubber (like you would a towel). This No Rinse Body Bath works very well to get me clean and fresh-smelling with little effort. I can take a whole bath quickly standing at the sink or seated on a bathroom chair, and then it's just a matter of toweling dry...or, as I do sometimes, just air-drying. The cloth rinses clean and can be hung to dry (quickly!), and I've hardly used any water at all. I plan to keep a small spray bottle by the toilet for a quick spritz when needed. I'm pleased with this product."
1,"I love this rose toner for its gentle formula and subtle rose scent. I was purchasing this off of Amazon until I saw cheaper price at Whole Foods. I like how this is a large bottle and lasts for a good amount of time for me. I use cotton sheets with this and just smooth it over my face after cleanse. It's gentle enough for sensitive skin, and the rose scent calms me down. I actually tried the lavender/cucumber one, but switched back to the rose one because it works better for me personally."
1,"I've used this product for years ... I get the unscented. Very gentle, very effective. The only kvetch I have is that, for the size of the container, the manufacturers have only filled it half full of product. The container really should be smaller, but then maybe it wouldn't have such presence on the shelf. It's a little like bait and switch. But, the deodorant is the best."
1,"My mother has been using this product for years and swears by it,it takes all her make up off nicely and her skin looks fantastic for her 79 years of age,she will not try anything else and is glad that Amazon has it for where she use to get it,they no longer sell. Highly recommend."
1,Have used it just once and have already noticed a difference. I'd been suffering an itchy scalp for a couple of months and looked up several solutions. Purchased this due to the customer reviews and am extremely happy with the result.
1,"I use The Purpose Cleansing Bar for my face only. I have real oily skin and this works very well to combat against the oil. I find it to be more effective than some of the liguid gels I've bought. Compared to the others, it is very economical...it lasts a long time."
1,"I ordered this to try because most body washes irritate and dry  my super-sensitive skin.  This does the trick, it is very mild, and cleans without leaving your skin with that tight stripped feeling.  Nice, effective product at a good price. It is not heavily scented or as fancy as some other body washes, no bright colors or gritty beads, just a light natural scent (no added fragrance, which is  a big deal because fragrance is a major cause of allergic reactions) and an effective gentle body wash.  I highly recommend it, especially if you have sensitive skin."
0,"This had so many good reviews that I was really excited to try it. My hair hates it, however! I have fine, wavy hair, so maybe this is for people with thicker hair. It made mine kind of stringy and weighed down- I tried to lessen the amount I put in but that didn't do much. I have such bad luck with hair products, though, so I'm not really surprised. I did give them an extra star for using the biodegradable packing peanuts :)"
1,I have been using this product for a month now. I don't see any difference in my skin tone. The product has a very pleasant scent.
1,I use this soap everyday and if I don't I can definitely tell the difference. Plus this bar will last a long time.  I love PCA products.
0,"My hair was already platinum and I was simply trying to get the last of the extremely faint neon-ish banana yellow out, as my toners were not doing the trick and I did not want to bleach again.  I thought for sure this would do it, as it was really only ONE LEVEL to lift and this dye promises seven.  My hair STILL came out with yellow in it.  It's a VERY THICK substance and even with my extremely short and thin hair, I think it may have worked better if I had purchased 3-4...however at that point I may as well go to a salon or just bleach it again, it'd be cheaper and end in better results.  Basically, unless you are already an extreme platinum, this dye will not make your hair the colour on the box.  Furthermore, my dark blonde roots turned out neon orange."
1,"Even though I am pushing 50, and my skin is pretty dry, I still keep this clay masque on hand. Why? Because I have large pores that are getting (ack!) even bigger as I age. With one use, I can see my pores visibly reduced. With two I'm almost back to ""Pores? What pores?"" This stuff is super cheap, you get a lot for your money and it works.General 411: I usually put this all over my face (except eyes and mouth, of course),leave it on 20-ish minutes to let it dry. Rinse with a wash cloth then follow with a good moisturizer on my drier bits. The next day I exfoliate really well to get rid of any dry skin flakes. After this 1-2 procedure, I look like I've had a professional facial!Unfortunately, there's no way to ""cure"" large pores, but this masque certainly helps keep them in check."
0,"I didn't want blue, but this is what they sent. The black of this brand is pretty good but blue? I wasn't looking for Halloween makeup and I'm not going to any raves soon. They wouldn't take returns so I guess I'm stuck with this."
1,"This is extremely thick and it's hard to squeeze out, and you only get a little at a time, and then it's hard to spread on your face...I did manage to kind of peel it off, but since you can't put it on smooth, you can't just lift off the mask like you can with some.  So it is okay but not sure I'd recommend it.  I am just using it on my dirtier spots instead of trying to smooth it over my whole face---too much work.  I know there are other better peel off masks.  The Helene clay masks are good and I've always been happy with those but I didn't want to have to wash off all the product, so am looking for a peel mask."
1,"I love the smell of this product. I wish it were easier to lather on, though. I love the company because it's eco-friendly."
0,"This product is decent if your skin is mildly dry, but it doesn't effectively heal the skin of the moderate-high dry-flaky kind. Even after I apply this to my face or neck, where my skin is dry and flaky, it's as though it dismally staved off and forestall the inevitable shedding of the skin. I apply this ""liberally"" both in the morning and at night, like it suggests, but haven't had impressive results. I gave this product two stars, because it is decent against mild-dryness, but that's the limit of Cetaphil's capability. Also, I will admit, one jar lasts me a very long time. Even after applying a liberal amount, twice a day, it's taken me months to topically consume the entire jar. It's probably the most long-lasting/durable product I've possessed. But there may be a reason for this. One reviewer noticed that his didn't contain a foil seal and may have been a counterfeit product. Looking back, I also don't remember ripping open a foil seal on mine."
1,The bottle opens like flask. It smells sweet and has a little bit of vanilla undertone. A little goes a long way and doesn't fade.
1,"Nice sheer white color, three coats makes the bottle color. Not an opaque white, good for jelly sandwich nails design."
0,"I am a rarity, but I hate Essie polish.  The color is very streaky, even with 2 coats and I feel like the brush is too small.  Go with OPI."
1,"Hey, Ive tired alot of different hennas and this one is one of the best. The dye release is very good, and the color is vibrant. The paste itself is good quality. I make it with Red Zinger Berry tea and the results are excellent and I have a fair amount of gray hair aswell. The color is just amazing,and I cant tell you how many compliments Ive gotten from people right off the street over the years from it."
1,This product serves as a better top coat than a base coat. I found that my nail polish chipped more when I used it for both base and top coats than when I used a different base coat and this as the top coat. I saw no difference in nail strength when I used it alone.
1,"I was excited to try this product on my puppy-dogs after reading the reviews. I concur. This product smells wonderful, its fast drying and deep cleans your dog, especially around their mouths and eyes. And the shampoo is non-irritating to their eyes. My puppies are fresh, soft and very shiny. No need to use a conditioner, it's in this shampoo.Dogs like to be clean and fresh. My dogs like to strut and prance around after their baths and this product simplifies the process with outstanding results."
0,I have very dry skin others commented on how great product was they didnt even need moisturizer.  Well if you have dry skin you do not want to use this it is VERY drying.  Had to stop using.
1,I really like this aloe vera jelly it really works. It's very soothing and I noticed the affects right away on my skin. It definitely helps your skin heal faster and I also like to put some on my hair to make it curly.
1,"Literally smells like maraschino cherries. I haven't really noticed that it's done much for my cuticles. It does make them softer and soaks in within about a half hour or so. I've been trying to track down the reason my cuticles are so chewed up without cause. This didn't solve it, but it is lovely if you need a little boost. Now on to the next solution for me..."
1,"I have spent so much money over the years on skincare ! Bought all the expensive brands ( Estee Lauder, Lancome etc ) My skin is sensitive and on the drier side and almost everything I used did not work .  I use this for my face !  I am 53  and this stuff is incredible ! It makes your skin very soft and not greasy at all ! I  Great under your make up too . The glycerine is the ingredient that will do the trick !  I have used it now for years and I will not buy anything else . You need so little that it lasts a long time too ."
0,"This product didn't work for me, but that's not to say it will not work for you. My issues with this product was that I burned my fingers each time I tried to put the roller in my hair, you only get a few clips with the product and they didn't work very well--At least they didn't work well for me. I gave this product away and even that person didn't want it. I may be a fan of some Conair products, just not this one."
1,"I started using these little scrubbers some 20 years ago.  I still use them.  I have had to use store brand imitations for a number of years however because they are so impossible to find.  Then about six months ago, I finally saw one in my local store.  I couldn't believe the difference!  Still as powerful in cleaning but not as harshly abrasive.  I get compliments on my skin all the time. I always tell people that its because of Buf-Puf.It doesn't matter what your age... It is never to late to start exfoliating!"
0,you can put make up on after you put on this lotion on.  it will cause he make up (eyeliner or shadow) smearit is expensive too for just a tiny tubewill not buy again
1,"It's small, folds down and is great to pack for a trip instead of your big hair dryer.  I just wish you could set it on cool and blow as fast cuz it does get pretty hot.  Very convenient item if you travel."
0,"This product is just ordinary discount sunblock in a fancy tube, so don't waste your money. If anyone has a recommendation for a real wrinkle moisturizer please let me know."
1,"This is going to last me forever! You only need a nickel-sized dab to foam up and wash your entire face. It's going to last me several months!!It's nice and doesn't dry out my face too much, and I LOVE the fact that it's a face cleanser and takes off all my makeup at the same time - EVEN my eye makeup! :)"
0,"I bought this based on its cult following but I have to say I'm not a fan. It goes on greasy, takes a long time to absorb, and smells like mothballs. Yes, the smell dissipates, but why bother when there are so many other pleasant smelling and/or fragrance-free options? The color and texture are similar to nasal mucus. It's just a big fat no all-around. I'll stick with Aquaphor."
1,"I'm not having much luck using this to color my dark hair, or more specifically the gray hairs.  I see lots of others have had luck, so I'll keep trying.  It does really smell awful, doesn't it?!  LOL!  It smells like that muddy muck that you find in the shallows of a natural pond on a hot summer day. But it is natural...  I'm just glad I'm not trying to do my whole head with it!  I'm sure it's great, but I'm struggling with finding the right way to make it work for me.  There seems to be a trick to it!  I'll have to read a bit more online on how to best use it.  I've used it with the vinegar, and I've let it set for a few hours to get dark first. I'll figure it out and update this review when I get it to work on my hair."
1,It works great and leaves your skin clean and soft. It clears skin and removes makeup easy. I love it better than the clothes.
1,"This is the best cleanser I have used in years.  I have 30 year old skin that is starting to look a tiny bit tired after two kids and lack of sleep.  In addition I have break outs still on a regular basis or should I say I did until using this product.  Since using this product my skin is looking refreshed and I have ZERO breakouts, even around that time of the month.  I ran out and was using some sample products I had on hand and what a mistake, my blemishes came back almost instantly.  As soon as I returned to using this product my skin was clear and feeling great.  I use it once a day in combination with the Neutrogena lavender face wipes at night.  This product is not a scrub, but a creamy sort of cleanser.  I would recommend this product for sure, no hesitation."
0,"I began using this about a month ago.  I have had issues with acne since I hit puberty.  The only thing that has completely cleared my skin was Proactiv and hormonal birth control.  Proactiv is horrible for your skin and would dry mine out.  Hormonal birth control is not good for your body either, so I tried to go organic.  After about three weeks of using this, my acne got worse; I kept getting huge pimples and whiteheads all over my face.  I guess I will just have to keep looking."
0,After reading the disclaimer that it is known to cause cancer.  Haven't used it yet because I'm too afraid!!
0,"I washed my face with this once yesterday, and once the day before and yesterday in the evening, a good portion of the right side of my face and a few under my chin broke out in ugly hives! It itches horribly and it really hurts. To make matters worse, I had to go to work looking like this. I didn't want to put on makeup that would irritate my skin so I was forced to leave the house looking like a pepperoni pizza. :(And also, when I was washing my face with this, I noticed that the scrubbing beads in this were SCRATCHING my face. Not a comfortable exfoliation, but like sandpaper. And this cleanser has a very noticeable chemical smell to it. I wish that I had never wasted my money on this product, and I wish that I had never put this on my face!"
1,"I've been using this dilligently for 4-5 months and love it.  It works, it works, it works!  I had a lot of sun damage and fine wrinkles on my forehead that are simply gone.  And it's completey smoothed out my skin.  I had rough patches here and there, plus oily T-zone and this cream was great on my entire face.  No breakouts and the texture of my skin is fantastic now. Concealer and make up go on a lot smoother now. The ONE thing I hate about this product is the heavy perfume smell which is completely unneccessary, but I finally got use to it. I wish ROC would lessen the fragrance or take it out altogether. But I've tried expensive dept. store brands and this one works just as good and great price. I saw results in the 3rd week I started using this.  I don't use it every night anymore, like 2-3 times a week now that I have the results I want. Love this cream."
1,"This is a great product that gently exfoliates and moisturizes leaving your skin smooth & silky!  I love to use it at the end of shower, slathering all over my arms & legs.  The 'salt' rinse off easily, and the essential oils are left behind to continue moisturizing.I will also use at the sink as a hand scrub.  This not only does wonders to your hands, but it activates all your reflexology points providing an all-over boost whenever you need it!I have used other scents, but I REALLY enjoy the Tangerine!  Provides the perfect 'pick me up' to start my day!"
1,"Well... for something this cheap I would say it is good for a quick fix, heats up properly and... I guess it is pretty good."
1,"If your hair is color-treated, you absolutely need this product, especially if there is a multi-shade difference between the color you apply and your natural shade. There's no real way you can comb your hair to cover up those awful roots.If you don't have the time to devote to a re-touch, Roux Tween Time Instant Haircolor Touch-up Stick is what can save your appearance. When your hair is wet after shampooing, just section it out and apply the color directly onto the roots where they show the most -- around your part, on your hairline, etc. The ultimately finished effect when your hair is dry and styled is 100% better, and will last 'till your next shampoo.It's a great idea to snag this product on Amazon, because the Auburn shade is almost always sold out elsewhere. (It does come in many other shades.) If you travel, get an extra one to keep in your suitcase so that you're never without. Once you try it, you'll realize how essential a product it is."
1,"These were remarkably less money than charged by CVS, As for the effectiveness, well, my wife has not gone bald."
1,"I'm a facial product junkie (hello, Sephora addict!)  I'm always trying new skin care products and looking for something that will make my combination skin clean, balanced, and fresh.  This stuff is by far the best toner I have ever tried.  The Clinique stuff always dried out my skin too much (because of the alcohol).  And then some toners that are alcohol-free don't actually do anything to clean your skin, so they are worthless.  It's hard to find a good one, but this is it!I use this product after using my cleanser because I want to make sure I get any residue or debris of make-up off.  This gets my skin smooth and clean without drying it out.  Plus, I find the subtle rose scent to be quite pleasant.I will absolutely buy this again."
1,"Detangling has never been easier.  Haven't actually used it in the shower, but it's great for getting through my hair when it's wet.  This comb is cute, sturdy, and functional."
1,This is a very nice color from Essie.  It seems to be a winter color to me and I have it on right now.  It is a very deep purple with a brown tone to it.  Almost coppery.  Essie polish is always easy to use and has very nice colors.
1,"A few years ago, I purchased this Skin Success Fade cream along with the Eventone body lotion, hoping to recover from an uneven tan/ sunburn gone stale (read greyish!) before a long awaited wedding of a close relative. My complexion is a light medium with a neutral tone, and in the sun I tend to burn on my face, shoulders and feet and tan and burn on my arms and legs- like a lobster left on the fire too long on one side only, not good and VERY uncomfortable!Once the skin burn had healed, I used the fade cream right after cleansing my face with the Clarisonic- it stung for a minute or two the first week and I got used to it after that. The results in just a week were extraordinary. Not only was all the grey gone, but my skin was transformed- I looked airbrushed right out of bed and had the bride from that wedding I attended ask me what I was doing! My skin was never perfect with an acned past, but this fade cream seemed to have exfoliated a layer or two of it away! I've never seen such results with any of the expensive Caudalie/ Organics/Estee Lauder/Artistry/ Clinique skin care products I've used in the past, and especially so much so fast. Needless to say, I'm taking it easy and do not use this cream constantly as I don't want to overdo it and harm or burn my skin. I use it for a month every alternate night and then quit for another 2 months, skipping it in Winter altogether. As I use the Clarisonic regularly, I would think that the results last longer than if I were to use the fade cream alone.The Even tone body lotion is just as good as the fade cream and I use it through Spring and Summer- it truly does seem like I exercise every day even though this just brightens my skin!"
1,"I have been using this for about 10 years now and I absolutely love it! Once time, I decided to go cheap and bought a knock off version of this, BIG REGRET! Ever since, I stock up on these. They don't ever run out at my house. Another reason I love this is because my face is really prone to acne and this product has NEVER broke me out. :)"
1,"I love NARS eyeshadows, lip glosses, and foundations, but I've not had the same luck with their blushes. I love this shade of pink, which is flattering even to my pinkish skin tone, but it's caked very hard in the palette and is difficult to get on the brush. I had to really dig my kabuki brush into the color, which--over time--created a &#34;well&#34; in the center of the palette where the mirror is showing. If NARS would make their blushes just a little easier to apply, I'm sure this would be a knockout.Although I don't really care for the powder blush, I'm in love with NARS Orgasm Illuminator, a highlighting cream that gives my face a shimmery, refreshed look. So I can still enjoy the color with this product."
1,Great product!  It really does work to help your hair from breaking off while blow drying!
1,"Oh, I had such high hopes for this lotion. My hands get so dry in the winter and I was thinking the coconut oil and aloe would be super moisturizing, not so much for me. The smell is pretty good, again, not as good as I expected. I won't purchase it again."
1,"I like the product, but it's not the best for me.  I tried it because I prefer its pump bottle format over the jar that my night recovery comes in.  This product gave me tiny clogged pores, almost like milia on both cheeks.  Also, the fragrance is a bit overpowering for my allergies and asthma.  So I'm back to the Regenerist Night Recovery treatment, which is a much better choice for me."
0,"I liked this at first, but after a few months several of the rounded tips at the end of each bristle came off, creating a brush that is very scratchy.  I will not use it any more.  My husband doesn't seem to mind it so he is using it."
1,I tried so many leave-in treatment and come back for this one always!  I use it before drying my hair and it makes the hair really soft.
1,This is okay. I like the actual mask but the smell is sooo so overwhelming. It smells like liquid antibiotics.
1,"Price:-Typically retails around $20-Cheapest on Amazon or if you get it as part of a skin care bundle kitWhat's the product like:-No foam facial cleanser - this is a cream.  For people used to a soapy foam this will initially feel like it is not cleaning your skin; it does effectively clean you just have to get used to the no foam.-Neutral scent - nothing too strong, it's not unpleasant, just a light fragrance-Little goes a long way - you don't need a palm-full of this cleanser, a squirt the size of a nickel should be plenty to clean your face and neck; the package size is not huge but this will last for several months with daily use since you don't have to use a ton-This cleanser is nice to use with a Clarisonic as it's not overly-drying, so with the Clarisonic exfolitation it's probably a good idea to use a gentle cleanser like PurityResults:-Product effectively removed make up-Impressive eye-make up removal, soapy, salicylic acid cleansers I have used in the past burn my eyes and don't really do a great job with waterproof mascara and eyeline - this product is great for removing stubborn make up (which I was really surprised by because it's so gentle)Overall:-Besides the waterproof makeup removal there is nothing extraordinary about this cleanser - there are plenty of cream cleansers out there, I don't think this one is as magical as some reviewers claim.-I think there is a very loyal following of Philosophy consumers that like their products because they do such a great job marketing to their shoppers, their products make you feel good and have ""hope"" that they can help make your skin better.  Their marketing techniques, packaging and approach to connecting with women almost make you feel like they are your friend, not a company trying to make money off of you.-I like Philosophy products, all the ones I have tried have been effective and appear to be good quality, but I think in the future I will stick to there ""treatment"" products.  I do like cleanser, but will not repurchase due to the price tag and the fact that it's not really that much better than any other cleansers I have tried.-If you're trying Philosophy for the first time, I would recommend trying one of their ""treatment"" products that aims to improve your skin in some way besides just washing make up off (lots of products can do that) - I think it would be a better use of your money to try something like Philosophy Help Me retinol cream, one of their facial peels or facial lotions."
1,I love the smell and it's a natural product. Doesn't leave a residue on my skin. I also use the Jason Healthy Mouth mouthwash religiously. Love Jason products!
1,Cheaper than pressed powder for oily skin.  I like it and will buy it again when i have to buy it.
1,"I alternate this shampoo with Regenepure DR. I love both shampoos, I especially love this shampoo because Biotin is listed as the second active ingredient! It makes my hair more full and manageable throughout any given day"
1,"I cannot say enough good things about this toner.  It is amazing!!!!!  Alcohol free, leaves my skin toned and refreshed.  Wonderful!"
1,I am really enjoying using this Hot Brush it gives a great curl. I would recommend it to anyone. Easy to use and the curls stay in a long time.Great seller and quick response. Thanks so much.
1,I'm new to Atopalm. Just decided to take a chance on another moisturizing cream. I was instantly impressed. CeraVe is also good but I think I'm staying right here with this Atopalm. It is so moisturizing without being goopy. I use it day and night. Also I started using retinol and this atopalm cream keeps my skin from drying out and flaking. Excellent stuff
1,"I love this face mask. After washing and exfoliating, I put this on and within 15 minutes it's ready to be wiped clean. I take mine off with a wet, hot wash cloth (gently) and reveal softer and smaller pored skin. No, it does not magically erase my pores or pimples but it does reduce them and my skin feels so smooth and clean without over drying.I have combo skin and I am 25, but now that I live in a humid climate... it gets oily quickly then what I'm used too. I use this mask once or twice a week. It's cheap and works better than some of the expensive masks I've wasted money on, plus you can buy it in most places where you also get your groceries. I will never stop using this. I follow with a light moisturizer that won't clog my pores. Always satisfied with this product...it never stops working after using it for years!"
0,"I won't lie, I am very new to a skin care regimen.  I started up recently because now that I'm in law school, I feel I should...because the other women are doing it.  I have always had a young face but apparently there is always room for improvement.I started using this the day after I received it.  I am using it this in the morning following my Olay recommended regimen.  They are:Olay Pro-XOlay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System (twice a week for microdermabrasion, twice a day to clean my face on non-microdermabrasion days, once a day to clean my face on microdermabrasion days)Olay Total Effects Nourishing Cream Cleanser Skin Care (twice a day)Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Eye Treatment (twice a day)Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Night Firming Treatment (at night)I had originally signed up to get it through the Subscribe and Save because, well, 15% off isn't bad.  I had read reviews that said it was a light moisturizer, they saw results in two weeks, this that and the other.  I have seen no results from this.  After the night treatment at least I can say I like the way my face feels.  This makes my skin feel oily, makes me extremely shiny, and has caused me to break out.  I am giving it 1 star for the sunscreen since, well, it's sunscreen and I can't complain too much about being protected on my 20-minute drive to school.  I am giving it 1 more star because Olay has a money-back guarantee I'm going to try to go after.I am reducing this a star because even though the most often subscribed amount is 3 months, I am in no way sure how you get even one month out of this.  There's not very much in this container and unless you're up to smooshing your face, it does not go very far.  I am reducing this another star because I hate the way that it dispenses.  I never know how much I'm going to get per pump so I have to watch it and go slow.  Even though I use the same amount every day, I use between 1 and 8 pumps due to the erratic nature of the delivery system.  I also know that toward the end of this, there's going to be some left in the bottom that I'll never be able to access or use.  This wouldn't bother me except that I do like the way the other creams are just in a jar and I can take or leave whatever I need.  My guess this delivery system is because of the sunscreen, since that has to be in a light-proof container to prevent a reaction.  I am reducing this one last star because every time I use it, I break out.  While I certainly can't fault being protected from the sun for 20 minutes a day, I cannot in my life imagine how anyone can put this on every two hours per the directions.  I put it on once in the morning and I am oily all day.  I thought that this would go down as my skin became used to it but I was admittedly wrong.  I did not start out by doing the every two hours when I realized how deep this did not go.  Many days I have to blot it off.  I know what you're thinking--&#34;Oh, that's your makeup!&#34;  I don't wear makeup.  I really cannot stand the feeling of something on or around my face.  Don't want, don't like.  I honestly am only two weeks into the regimen but for that last reason alone, I can't do it anymore."
1,"I am African American w/very oily skin and after my 3rd pregnancy I began to have very bad acne. This product has worked wonders with removing the extra oil on my face. Typically my face is shinning like the sun by 11:30 am. I am now going the entire day with my skin looking normal. No more going to the bathroom to try & soak the oil up with a paper towel. EXTRA NOTE RE: ACNE IF INTERESTED I tried Mary Kay Classic - no results positive or negative. I tried Proactive - negative results leaving me with a ton of scars & hyperpigmented skin. I made changes to a more natural routine, African Black Soap as a cleanser, unrefined coconut oil as a night moisturizer, only when needed.  No more MAC make up, changed to mineral foundation. These changes have produced great results as it relates to Acne. I'm not saying Mary Kay, Proactive, & MAC are bad products, they just didn't work for my skin. My skin is very sensitive. The Kiss my Face Pore Shrink along w/the Glycolic 35% peel, should remove the hyperpigmentation - I am seeing positive results from this peel as well, I've used it twice. Hope this info helps someone."
1,"I chose this product because is the best for me, there's nothing I don't like about this product; I will recommend this product for goung and middle age ladies out there...."
1,I will no way be without this! Great after toner . I usually spray this on after cleaning but will spray on just about anytime to feel like queen of England. Ha! My mom does not care for the smell of roses and she used this and loved. Will not be without!
1,"First of all, you need to buy a foaming pump to use the refill size of this product or you're not getting the most for your money! I read a few reviews saying they were just pouring it straight into their hand. This product is VERY liquidy, and you would be pouring most of the product down the drain with each use if you poured it straight from the bottle.Okay, now for the review:I bought this back in November of 2013 and wanted to continue using this for a while so I could really give a good review. It's now been 4 months of (mostly consistent) use so, this is my opinion for ya. Hope it helps!In my foaming soap pump I originally poured this product in straight, no dilution. It has a very strong tea tree oil smell, it was..different, since most face washes are fragranced to be flowery and girly, but I didn't mind. It washed away and didn't linger. My skin was very clean after use. Squeaky clean, even! I immediately had to put moisturizer on or I felt way too dried out. I have combination skin so the dry parts seemed to get very tight and flaky, whereas the oily parts seemed&#8230;normal or on the dry side of normal. After a few days my skin freaked out and I looked like a lobster :( It was terrible! It cleared up, but it took around 3 days, during that time I had switched to using a sensitive Olay face wash, using it very sparingly and putting aloe on after (I mostly just splashed with water if I needed to refresh throughout the day). I was so upset that I, 1. looked like a lobster and, 2. couldn't enjoy this product like the positive reviewers! It was such a good deal, I was so bummed!I stopped using this product because I was very wary about having my skin react negatively again. A few weeks later I was planning on writing a review for this, but instead I decided to read through some more of the reviews already here. I was hoping to find someone else who had a similar reaction and if they had tried anything to help. Well, a few mentioned diluting the product with water. DUH! Why didn't I think of that?! I went on to dilute it to a 1:1 ratio, a few uses later it was still too drying for me, so I added even more water (it's probably now a 3 or 4:1 ratio)The foaming action of the pump is really so helpful, 1. You're not wasting product, which is awesome. 2. You don't need to make the lather, it's already there! It's nice when you're feeling lazy and just want to go to bed, but you know you need to wash your face first 3. You're diluting it, so you're going extend the life and use of this huge refill bottle. I haven't needed to buy face wash since I bought this, and I won't need to for quite a while. The original bottle looks like I haven't even used it. I use this face wash almost everyday (I did have another face wash I was using along with it occasionally). I only need 2 pumps to have enough lather to clean my whole face.It takes off facial make up pretty easily, but I do NOT recommend using this on or around your eyes. I can't say much about this face wash clearing acne or anything, I haven't seen any improvement&#8230;but I also haven't seen any adverse reactions with the few pimples I do get. Honestly, I *would* repurchase this because it was such an awesome deal and I finally figured out how to make it work for me!TL;DR / The Short Version:*Very liquify, not a gel*Buy a foaming soap pump*Dilute, dilute, dilute*Lasts a very long time*Can be drying*Didn't notice it helping OR hurting pimples*Smells very strongly of tea tree oil, but it does not linger once washed off*I feel that it is a great dealHope this helps :)"
1,"Order was processed and delivered quickly. Years ago I worked in shop that sold imported soaps, and it carried this brand and was very popular. The packaging is beautiful, so  I hate to tear it open. I like bee motifs, and I like sandalwood scent. It comes in a couple other scents, but I've not tried them. I'm old enough to remember other products that used to have extra paper wrap and seals, like old Lea and Perrins, and Angostora Bitters, among others, so this has a nostalgic Victorian quality for me-not that I'm so old, but my mum had those bottles from her grandmother. The soap is basic, it is molded with a little pattern, it lathers nicely in hard water. The fragrance seems strong at first, but it dissipates so it is not obnoxious. The soap itself seems aged, which  to me is good. Aged soap has less water so it lathers well and lasts longer. These are small personal sized bars. Such a nice little extra in a gift bag. As far as 'exotic' soaps go, this has a great price, works well and looks lovely."
0,"After years of hearing this blush hailed as the ultimate color - I bought it. The color is beautiful - but the longevity is nonexistent!! The pigmentation was NOT good, after a few hours it travels and disappears. I have dry skin, so traveling makeup should NOT be an issue, but this was. The only way I could get it to stay was to put cream blush on underneath and layer it over it, which of course changes the color. Shouldn't have to do that for the hefty price, IMO. I would not recommend it to anyone. The second star is for the color, which - in theory - is perfect. But overall: this stuff is literally Wet -n wild quality..."
1,"I used to have acnes all over my back since I have really oily skin, but after using this there are only a few left. It is also very easy to wash off and have a really nice smell."
1,"I first bought this Olay moisturizer cream because it's unscented.  (Hurrah, if I want perfume, I prefer what I use!)  I've been very happy with it ever since. It's not messy, is easy to apply and has sunscreen in it.  If you wear make-up it'll go over the moisturizer with no problem. The anti-aging must work as I get a lot of comments that I don't look my age! (85) I don't wear make-up except for eyes and mouth, so what people see is what's there, wrinkles and all.Recommend highly."
1,"For the past 40 years of needleworking, I have been searching for a hand cream that absorbed fast and left no residue on my linen, silk, threads, etc.  Well, this Udderly Smooth Udder Cream is IT!  A very little moisturizes my hands just enough to use my needles without any greasy feel or transfer to my fabrics or threads.  Now, I can feel the needles and wool, cotton, or silk threads and no longer worry about stains or snagging from dry skin.  FINALLY, the perfect cream for needle crafting!  I just re-ordered, and also added 2 tubes of this marvelous cream for travel.  Amazon, you're the best!"
1,This shower detangler works great.  The only problem is that its so flexible that sometimes its a little bit harder to detangle.
0,"The product arrived in a timely manner, but the packaging it was in could use some improvements. First of all, it came one of those yellow manilla envelopes lined with bubble wrap. Inside, the product box was crushed. I believe the seller should start shipping the product in a small box instead of an envelope to prevent this from happening in the future.Secondly, the product I received did not match the one in the picture. The one in the picture seems ""newer"" - newer, more modern packaging and font. The one I received looked like a lotion bottle from the 90's. I'm not sure if I received an outdated product or it was just in outdated packaging, but the lotion itself left much to be desired. I followed the instructions and applied the lotion to a clean face, morning and night. My face looked really smooth in the morning when I first woke up...until I had to wash it again and reapply the lotion. It made my face red and made all my imperfections stand out more. Definitely will not be buying/using again."
0,Sorry I purchased so much of this product... when you apply it ...it looks shiny on...so you can't use it during the day when you need for the puffiness to be reduced.  I will use it at night... and never buy it again.
1,It can be a little greasy but that doesn't bother me since I use a glycolic acid cleanser afterwards.I never have to use a lot to remove my mascara. I feel like with the non-oil based ones I waste so much. This is a good consistent product.
1,Didnt last long. But in order to save money and buy same product you might want to buy a bottle of castile soap from the same Dr. Bronner. Would last you longer
1,"I used this all the time and my hair becomes soft and smooth. My hair is black but I use this rinse to give myself a rich healthy look when I need it. I love the fact that it colors the hair and makes it really soft and it also smells clean. It lasts for about three washes, but I don't mind reapplying it."
1,"Perfect caps for what I wanted to use them for, I use them for deep hair conditioning and treatments. No problems with them."
1,I love wearing headbands but they always end up giving me terrible headache in 10-15 mins. I ordered these because of the fantastic reviews and it IS  true! no headache for real! and the end have comb-teeth (am sure that's not the right term!!) they help keep small hair away from your neck and prevent the typical post-headband look.Love this product! hope they had more colours!
1,"great price. good for healing the body, great for hair softening and highly recommend this brand. also get the wool cloth"
0,"I don't recommend this makeup. I am a very youthful looking 32 (no ""fine lines"" yet) and this makeup made my skin look terrible. It's too thick, to start with. I tried applying it with a brush and with a powder puff and neither worked well. It highlighted every small flaw and looked too thick and ""makeup-like"". If you enjoy the look of wearing thick foundation, I guess this product would be good. It created an extra layer which creased as the day wore on, making it look like I had wrinkles where I normally don't. Also, this makeup has a shiny look to it.As an alternative, I recommend one of the ""tinted moisturizer"" type products, which are just a light touch. If you have nice looking skin, but just want an added touch of radiance, this product won't be right for you. It's better suited to the type of women who wear way too much makeup."
1,It lasts for an hour or so and will rub off. It also stains your lips in a bad way. Beautiful color though.
1,As always OPI delivers an absolutely gorgeous color. I've had several people ask me what I'm wearing. One of my all time faves.
1,"I use mostly the orange and brown.  The color lasts and lasts.  There are many lip-stains out on the market that I've tried.  NONE last as long as these.  They are also moisturizing.  For the price they are amazing.  I've used them for years.  If you are someone who likes, or wears, cool tones in make-up, there are many colors for you.  I am a warm skin-toned person, so the only colors I like that look good on me are the brown (which is a brownish red) and the orange (which is a really pretty coral).  I wish Fran Wilson would come out with more warmer-toned colors."
1,"I LOVE this. I have been using it for years to spritz on my face throughout the day when my skin feels dry or oily and I don't have time to wash it, and it's very refreshing. I also use it after I apply my makeup to set my powder foundation. It smells lovely. I can't handle &#34;real&#34; perfumes (not that this product is really trying to be a perfume at all) because I am sensitive to strong, lingering scents, and they usually give me headaches. So I use this instead for a natural little spritz of scent that is refreshing, lifts my spirits, and isn't too strong. Makes me happy. And no chemicals or yucky stuff that I try to avoid."
1,"This is a great polish, it is warm toned, cream polish, & it works for my skin tone even though I have fair and cool toned skin, so I think it'd work for lots of different skin tones. It's a great color for summer, I've had it on my toes a lot. It's not too bright or dull."
1,why? because im dumbi wish i would have know that the effects of alcohol in skincare dries my skin and all this time i believed i had severely dry skin ( winter is an exception ) even in the summer thats crazy. i stopped using a toner since then i just grew out of it during my teenage years i used toners for acne skin of course. Now that im 20 my skin has changed I'm pretty normal to sometimes combination skin but my pores and blackhead were always there especially since i wear makeup i also had these weird bumps on the bridge of my nose they were not whiteheads though just bumps. anyways upon testing this out i use my clarisonic and nubian heritage soap in the shower it gives me a nice deep pore cleanse but these bumps were still there after that i dry my face and i used this toner its specifically without any alcohol. I noticed it really added moisture back into my face usually im alittle dry when i come out of the shower but this gives me a nice moist supple look and immediately these bumps cleared away.the point of a toner for is to restore natural balance to the skin when your skin is unbalanced you can see different parts of skin having different issues where as using a toner has made my skin one i feel normal also using this under foundation i do not feel as shiney and it hold up on my face longerif you have any questions comment below
1,"From my experience with hair products, I must say, Fekkai is never disappointing, even the worst of Fekkai's products, it is still better than 90 percent of the other hair care products on the market. It is always reliable."
1,"THIS IS JUST AN ""OK"" PRODUCT IT CAN TAKE THE PLACE OF THOSE STRIPS, WHICH SOMETIMES SHOW OR MAKE THE GARMENT LOOK STIFF.  IT IS NOT EFFECTIVE ON ANY HEAVY FABRICS."
1,"I wore a different fragrance for 30 years until they discontinued the body lotion.  I like to layer my cologne with my body lotion.  I wanted something that is fresh and not sickeningly sweet that would give me a headache.  I love this cologne.  It has a fresh, clean fragrance.  I absolutely love it."
1,Nice for sinuses and your skin! My family uses this for both! Nice for sinuses and your skin! My family uses this for both!
1,So glad to find a pump bottle of this for the shower. Very convenient and of course it works great in the dry winter air.
1,I always purchase this. It's great because I live in a sunny climate and have sensitive skin. This cream make my skin feel soft And hydrated.
1,"I have thick, waist length, wavy hair. I bought the 1 1/2 inch for my bangs and I bought the 3 1/2 inch for the rest of my hair. I returned the 3 1/2 inch sold by ""HairProducts"" because it was a counterfeit. See the image I uploaded so you can be sure that you received a genuine Cricket round brush. I read a lot of reviews before buying something, and I'm glad, because another reviewer tipped me off on what to look for:""After a few months of using this product, I noticed my hair felt fried. I went to my stylist and he noted the same thing. At first he told me to check the lint on my hair dryer and to turn down my flat iron. My hair was still frying. I took a closer look at my brush and realized it was a counterfeit! I have a salon bought 390 brush and it reads Anti-Microbial on the handle. This one reads Antibacterial. Not only that it says Centrix on the handle, NOT CRICKET. The font was also different. That said, buyer beware. I threw away the brush and my hair is already looking and feeling better."" (This reviewer bought the 2 inch brush, so I have a feeling knock offs are fairly common).So I received one genuine cricket brush that said ""antimicrobial"" on the handle, and one knockoff brush that said ""CENTRIX"" and ""ANTIBACTERIAL"" on the handle. Realize that anti-bacterial and anti-microbial are two completely different things. Imagine putting hand sanitizer on your hair then heating it up every day for months... think of how damaging that can be to your hair. I didn't bother re-ordering the 3 1/2 inch brush.Overall: The genuine cricket brush I received is a decent round brush - it gets the job done. I have maybe five different size round brushes (all different brands), and I thought that this would be my favorite considering all the glowing reviews, but I can't say it's the best. :( It feels sort of cheap to me (the way it was packaged left some of the bristles bent). The bristles are pretty sharp. I have to be careful not to scratch my neck when using this brush."
1,"I bought these to use for when I color my hair at home. Often, it calls to cover in plastic and they give you this annoying bag to put on your head and then roll. This was SO much better and so much easier. So glad I found these on amazon!"
1,"Last time I saw my doctor complaining of night sweats, insomnia, brain fog, course chin hairs, baggy eyes, saggy face,head hair loss and a few extra pounds I couldn't lose for love or money, the lab tests showed ""post menopause"". DEPPRESSING. I'm 51. He offered me Zoloft and a fluid pill for the symptoms!  HAH! great! I tried thyroid vitamin suppliments with kelp and they did help some but still didn't supplement what my body was missing: progesterone. I bought this and applied as directed. Not only did it help the night sweats but I sleep better. I lost the 5 lbs I'd gained just by watching my diet and exercising 20 min/day. I think it was mostly water retention due to the estrogen dominance. Anyway, my stomach is flat again and my hips and thighs aren't cottage cheesy anymore! As a bonus, my hair is getting long and thick. Instead of looking older, I'm looking younger! Only one side effect I've noticed; it does give me a headache if I apply too much so I just use 1/4th tsp. Per day on a 21 day cycle. I do recommend it however, individual response may vary."
1,"The soap is very nice, and doesn't dry out my boys skin.  I like that it's free of everything, and has a very light gentle scent.  The only problem is that it burns my boys eyes.  It's not as bad as the Baby Bee soap, which stings like crazy, but it definitely burns their eyes."
0,"Well first let me say,i don't have wrinkles or hard lines(im in my 20s) i use anti-wrinkles washes and creams to hopefully help prevent them in the future,so i can't comment from an anti-wrinkle view point however i have very oily,sensitive skin that can easily get a small break out. I started using this among other products and started to notice i would get small breakouts, i figured it must be the other new product cleansers and toners i was using cause eucerin has never given me breakouts,so i stopped using the other products,and tested this product on certain areas on my face only,and sure enough those exact spots had the new abrasions. I have super oily skin,i believe this product causes clogged pores which leads to the breakouts,i suggest you avoid if you have oily skin,i will continue to use this product of my neck and chest to get rid of it."

1,"I purchased the rose water during my transition from relaxed hair to natural hair. It smells good, but I didn't find it to make a difference if I used it or not."
1,"I wear lipstick from the minute I get up until I go to bed.  I've tried many other kinds, but I always go back to this.  It's simply the best.  It's very long wearing and unless you eat something greasy, it stays on most the day.  The darker colors have more staying power.  The conditioner on one end has a glossy shine, but if you don't like that, let it wear off.  You will need it at first or your lips will feel dry.  After the gloss wears off, you probably won't notice it.  I don't.  I really like that it has no fragrance. The only thing I don't like, is I can't carry it in my pocket without it coming unscrewed."
1,"while let my hair grow longer,but dont the hair hanging around my face and ears.wish you had more colors.work great stated using with a new do."
1,It is not that it is not good lipstick. It is that the black lipstick turned a bright purple on me. While I love purple lipstick I do not like that my lips are the first thing someone sees when I walk into a room. And that is the thing about buying this type of lipstick online. There is no way you can test out the product. There is no way to tell what the product will look like with your chemical makeup. If I were younger and more adventurous I might like the bright purple lipstick. If you are a bit crazy with your makeup and you like to shock people just a bit you might want to try this product.
1,"This is my first experience with OPI nail lacquer. I usually buy 99cent bottles from the drug store, but I have tried a quite a few different brands of nail polish. I decided to try OPI because of reviews I've read on the products and also the fact that all the nail salons I've ever been to carry the products. I wish I had remembered the difference in color between bottle and nail when ordering this color..It is not as vivid of bright as i pictured it being looking at it in the bottle. In fact, it is the exact same color as a wet n wild nail polish that I bought last summer(and they look nothing alike when the bottles are put together). So the color itself gets 1 star, pretty misleading. The polish seems a little thicker than other brands I've tried, I would assume that's why my nails havent chipped yet after 5 days, this makes it tricky to get used to painting it on evenly if your not used to thick polish. Im used to 2-3 thin layers to perfection(at least on the left hand). With OPI, you really only have one, maybe two coats(if you have a light hand) to get it right, more than that it looks clumpy. I had to remove and start over on four nails my first try."
0,"I have very dry skin and tried this after all the great reviews.  I am sad to report that this is not as emollient or humectant as my skin needs to find comfort.  The oil feels nice and it spreads well.  It takes a while for it to absorb even though it is lightweight, but that didn't bother me.  I thought an oil would be extremely moisturizing, but my skin didn't feel or look very hydrated at all.  In fact, it felt equally as dry (as if I had applied a dry oil) with a bit of a sheen.  With a cream or lotion, the skin smoothes and plumps up with moisture.  I tried this bc I was looking for something like that but even more effective, but this doesn't work.  I may try this under a thicker lotion or cream to see if it adds anything as un under-layer.  On it's own, it is not effective.UPDATE ON PREVIOUS REVIEW: I have found that using it in the shower helps it absorb into the skin without leaving a dry oil residue behind.  However, even when I tried it with the matching lotion on top, it still did not fully hydrate my dry skin.  I'll try it again in the summer."
1,"I tried everything. For years, I kept having to switch from one deodorant to another about once every six months, because my body either became resistant or irritated by each product. Roll-ons were nasty, wet or sticky. Deodorant sticks left a white residue on my clothing. And if that wasn't embarrassing enough, often the products failed, and the resulting body odor was overpowering.Then I discovered Almay. It doesn't make my underarms break out. It goes on clear, leaving no powdery residue under my arms or on my clothes. The gel stays put, but doesn't feel wet or sticky--usually drying by the time I get my shirt on. If I didn't put deodorant on after my shower the night before, and there's a bit of odor when I get dressed late in the morning, it's no problem. Almay seems to kill the bacteria and neutralize the odor without me having to wash. I generally reapply the product when I change clothes, just to be on the safe side.I have used this product for years, and, other than the container (recently updated again with a new look and a different applicator), Almay hasn't changed. Thank heaven! Usually, when a company &#34;new and improves&#34; a product, it ends up not working as well as the formula they had before.Whether you are a guy or a gal, this is a great anti-antiperspirant. Most Wal-Marts and Walgreens stores carry it, or you can get it online. Wherever you get it, it's worth the investment to keep you perspiration- and odor-free!"
1,I've used this cleanser for several years now and can't imagine using anything else.  Good price on Amazon :)The product arrived quickly and as described.
1,"This is the best eyelash adhesive ever! It is really strong, you just need a little bit and one tube lasts you a really long time. I use false lashes every single day with this adhesive and it's been about 2 months and I still have lots of it left in the tube. It dries up clear so that is why I love it. Favorite Eyelash Adhesive."
0,I read the reviews and researched this item along with the 5% one. Decided to go with the ore potent one expecting it to have quicker results. nNothng has changed in the condition of my skin...the allergic food reaction that has resulted in cystic acne just below my collar bone are still there. I am dissapointed in this product and will not buy again.
1,I would like for the product to put out more steam. It has to be refilled frequently. It does the job but the steam when I open my dishwasher dies a better job if I could find a way to get the steam to come out and steam my face consistently.
1,"This is really awesome. I wasnt expecting too much from an eight dollar fragrance, but damn, this is like on eof the best perfumes Ive ever had, and Im a vet at fragrances, Im a perfume junkie!!Especially oils, and Ive used the best! From Kuumba Made to Madinni and Possets, I Love perfume oils and this is the best one!Its not fake smelling, or synthetic smelling at all, and its very subtle and awesome, almost like an invisible perfume, and it lasts all day. You dont need alot, and I catch these whiffs of it thruout the day and its fabulous, Love it!! I was amazed at all the good reviews all over the internet, and decided I cant go wrong, and they are right, it is awesome!"
0,"I generally like Philosophy products, but this stuff is not worth it. It does feel great going on, and provides great moisturization under makeup or at night before bed. However, it smells so awful that I finally threw it away and went back to good old Cera Ve PM. Given how expensive this stuff is, one should not have to make such compromises. My husband wondered why I smelled weird. Yeah, its that bad."
1,"Rose Milk is something I've always loved.  I love Rose anything.  The smell of roses, and the creamy lotion, is absolutely heavenly.  Even though it does remind me of my childhood days, I still love it now, and will never stop loving it.To me, there is just something heavenly about the scent of roses.  And this soothing lotion full of rose scent is a really exceptionally heavenly product!"
1,"I was using a super gentle, eco friendly brand for a long time. It was ok, though I think the 'eco friendly' part of it caused it to be barely effective. Neutrogena is also gentle on skin, but it really works. Even water proof mascara comes off with just gentle pressure. I primary just wear eye makeup, so I wanted something I could use quickly with just a cotton pad.  You only need to use a small amount for both eyes. It has no smell that I can recall, and does leave a slight filmy and slippery feeling on the skin, but that doesn't really bother me. I think that this is my new go to makeup remover."
1,My face is oily but it can gets really dry during the winter. This cleanser is perfect for both situations. I would like this even more if it comes with fragrance but Cetaphil products normally don't come with fragrance.
1,"Love love love this mask. Cool feeling upon putting it on, doesn't take long to dry, works great. Plus it's inexpensive, bonus! :)"
1,"The price of this product has continued to climb and they often don't last long.  However, they have the corner on the market - I guess no one else is allowed to produce them.  I wouldn't want to be without my steamer!"
1,"It is a magic colour, i have been looking for this Russian Navy for a while and i know what to expect! Pretty much what i wanted!"
0,"NOTE: After checking this out again at the store, the soap reviewed below is actually the BLUEBERRY soap by ""Clearly Natural.""I wouldn't normally review a bar of soap--after all--what's there to review, but this bar is an exception. Perhaps the doors of perception will differ for others, but the jasmine soap has a peculiar odor.While usually a fan of Clearly Natural products, something went wrong here.  I think, frankly, that it smells like poop.  Seriously.  And that's not exactly the ""scent"" I want when taking a shower.  Another person in the family likens it to bathroom cleanser.  To each his or her own, but I recommend another soap ""flavor."""
1,"I bought this product for only a few bucks, the coverage is okay but it doesnt last all day. But for the price that it was it was"
1,I received this today and spritzed it on but.... it does smell kinda grandma-ish.  I can't describe the scent.... I want to like it because I just ordered and received Glow and Live which are great!  This is not my kinda scent.  I keep smelling my wrist hoping that somehow the scent will change but ugh.  SORRY!  I should just spray the air and walk into it instead of direct spraying it.
1,"Love experimenting with my hair.  Thank G-d I've been blessed with great hair after all I've done to it.  Before this color, Lightest Auburn, I had platinum blonde.  Darkened it and gradually began going into the reds, professionally.  Really chicken at the thought of having pink hair at 60 :) After a couple of times at the salon, it was time to give it a go.  Began with RA (think that's the number), found it too dark for me then next time mixed that one and 7LA.  Pretty good results, just wanted lighter.Second time doing this one by itself and very happy.  Would prefer a little more red in it.  My hair comes out lighter than the box but all in all, hair is in great shape, very healthy, natural looking color.  I would go for 4 1/2 stars review, just not available.  Again only because I would like a little deeper shade than what I get."
1,This goes on easily and feels good. Can be applied beneath makeup and doesn't make you look greasy. Have put on automatic shipments.
1,This is really great. This is immediate relief for when my lips are super chapped.The best part is that even if I apply it in the morning it stays on for a really long time... it even stays on throughout my coffee sipping morning!
1,I will let everyone know how it works along side my aqua glycolic skin care system. I am using this on my arms and legs.
1,This is my new favorite blush.  Outlaw is a perfect shade for me as I have a light/medium complexion.  I think this shade works well if you are darker and/or have a nice tan.  Nars has the best blush.  I'm very happy. Definitely would purchase this again.
1,"I have extremely dry skin even in the summer and have found this to be an extremely effective moisturizer. However, it's a bit on the pricey side so I'll probably not replace until the winter when I am really desperate for relief."
1,"I love this masque because it's so cheap you wouldn't expect it to be great, but it is.  I love Queen Helene's masques - I've tried several and they all work well, but this one is my favorite.  I've tried other brands of masques, too, but they aren't as good.This masque is probably not good for anyone with sensitive skin because it tingles.  I have sensitive skin under my nose, so I don't put it there because the first time I did, it burned so bad.  But anyway, if you wash your face with a good cleanser first and then put this on for about 20-30 minutes, let it dry and then wash off - your face will be so refreshed. I could see my angry red pimples get smaller and less angry, and I could also tell that my forehead was less oily but my cheeks were not too dry (I have combination skin).  I could feel the reduced inflammation, too - sore pimples are less sore.  The next morning, the size diminished a lot more too - but you have to keep up with your washing.  I wouldn't recommend using this more than 1-2 times per week just because of its strength - when I need to use a masque more often, I use a milder masque (specifically Queen Helene's grape seed extract peel-off masque) 2 times and then the Mint Julep masque just once."
1,"I've been using this brand for several yrs., and have been very satisfied w/it.  Just the fact that there is NO alcohol in it is a plus and it has the nicest rose scent to it."
1,Use this and get rid of your little hangnails and also moisturize your nails. This keeps them from breaking. The smell is divine.
1,"I started using this cleanser last year, and I can honestly tell you that my skin has never looked better. When you rub in this cleanser it creates a cool, tingly sensation -- you can literally feel it working into your pores, and the creamy consistency makes it easy to apply just the right amount. It does a wonderful job of helping to prevent acne and blackheads without drying out your skin.My forehead and cheeks are prone to dermatitis and used to get dry and flaky with the cleanser I'd been using, which was actually also a Neutrogena product: the Deep Clean Facial Cleanser for Normal to Oily Skin. It worked for me for a while, but eventually it started to dry me out (which caused more breakouts). I decided to try to cream cleanser based on its superior reviews, and I'm glad I did: something about the composition of the cream cleanser must make it milder than the other product, because I haven't had a problem with dryness or secondary breakouts since I made the switch.As with any face wash I'd suggest using a toner after washing to get rid of any residue, but really, this is one of the best facial cleansers I've ever used (I use it in conjunction withNeutrogena Oil-Free Deep Clean Gentle Scrub, 4.2 Ounce, and it's the best skin-care combo I've ever tried). I hope it works just as well for you as it has for me!"
1,"Mrs. Meyers Geranium Dish soap has a very nice fragrance. Anything that makes cleaning more enjoyable is worth a lot to me. I have not found another product for dishes that does such a good job. I like that a little of it goes a long way and that it's a environmentally friendly product. Ordering from Amazon, by the case of 6 is convenient, a good deal and I don't have to worry about buying dish soap for a long time. This soap seems to last a lot longer than other brands.I've also used the Geranium kitchen cleanser by Mrs. Meyers which smells great and is good for getting rid of ants. I just sprinkle it around my window sills and the ants won't cross the line. It must be the fragrance."
1,I have really dry skin around my nose and I don't like to use regular body lotion for my face cuz it breaks my face out. That's why I like this product cuz its a moisturizer and a acne product. Works pretty good for the price.
0,"This product burns my skin, I don't know if it was tampered with. It's supposed to be alcohol free but something is not right with the formula. I used the cucumber version and it does not burn and feels great. I am going to contact Thayer to see if I got a fake product, if so there will be big problems with the seller."
1,"I was using Neutrogena face wash before I decided to try something new - which was necessary, because even though I have oily skin, Neutrogena still managed to dry my face out, which resulted in my face producing even *more* oil than usual, which just wasn't acceptable for me. Too gross, and sometimes resulted in breakouts.That said, I love the scent of this product. It's not nearly as harsh or chemical-smelling at Neutrogena. It absolutely washes my face, but it doesn't dry it out and make it feel stiff like Neutrogena did, either. My face (seriously, people, *very* oily naturally), has been producing less since I've been using this. It also makes my face feel baby-skin smooth, which I adore. I plan on using this product for the rest of my life, because I think it's that great. It may not work so well with other types of skin, I don't know. If you have anything other than oily skin, I would recommend finding someone who has your same skin type before deciding whether or not to purchase this product."
1,"IMPORTANT TIP:  Most curling irons have a tip at the end that one can hold onto.  THIS DOESN'T!!  There are gloves one can buy to use with these Marcel types of curling irons so one doesn't burn the tips of the fingers. I'm still getting used to it, because I don't use it every day, but so far, I love the ease and size of this curling iron.  I thing a glove or at least 2 finger cots should be in the package for what it costs, but other than that, no complaints so far."
1,"I have tired everything out there and Nizoral is the only product that's ever worked for me. It's a bit expensive and it's only a 4 oz bottle, but I just add it to my shampoo, and it works great."
1,"I bought this several months ago, it could even be a year by now. The product does what it said but for me it made my nails brittle. I didn't try anything with it cause I didn't know what I should use besides that (carrier oil?) I'm sure it will work for some of you but not my nails. I still have it and I might try using it again, if I do, I'll update the review."
1,"I have tried other foaming cleansers and they usually are foam in my hand but when I put them on my face they just dissolve! I really like how this one lathers up! It makes my skin feel very soft! I use my Befine Exfoliating Cleanser with Brown Sugar, Sweet Almond and Oats and then I use this afterwards because I have combination to oily skin and acne prone skin around that time of the month for us ladies! The combination of using those two together makes my skin look and feel great! I would highly recommend it!"
1,"Not greasy at all! No scent. Thank God. Goes on easily and absorbs just as easily. Last long, too. good night cream. Or day. But I used at night."
1,"I've been using this product for a few years now... at first I was completely confused on how to use it because the directions are very minimum. Here's what I do:1.) Wash face2.) Exfoliate3.) Apply a thin layer all over face & wait for it to dry4.) Wash off and apply toner5.) Lightly moisturizeA big problem I had was not knowing that I should physically exfoliate before applying the mask. I realized just how much of a difference it made... now that I exfoliate, I notice way more oil being extracted into the mask.However, my pores do not shrink nor do they magically disappear. They do appear to be smaller since a lot of dirt had been lifted but by the end of the day, the dirt is back into my pores and I have to start this process all over again. (I wear makeup almost everyday)I'll still keep using this product even though there isn't permanent changes. And I also believe that using this is better than not using a facial mask at all.About my skin:As far as the stinging, that only happened to me the first few times and now I don't feel anything but a cooling sensation. The mask use to gag me because it smells like a muddy mint smell but I've grown use to it. I typically do not have sensitive skin. I have oily to combo skin (oily on my T-zone, combo everywhere else) and I have a occasional break-outs. I do not think this product alone helps with acne.Overall I think it's a good quality mask to treat your face to. I'm also trying to do what I can to prevent wrinkles and hopefully using this can slow the process.I also agree with some of the reviews about the bottle. This mask is very thick and can be a hassle to get out (especially after the bottle is half empty) so if you can, look for it in a jar."
1,"This is a must have comb.  Used to have them in all of the drug stores.  Now - for some reason I cannot find them.  For fine or thinning hair - this comb works wonders for a little backcombing.  Glad I could find it on Amazon after visiting the big 3 drug stores, Target and a few beauty stores."
1,I was looking for a new brand of shampoo since my current brand left my hair brittle and greasy at the same time (if that is even possible!). My hope was that I could find a brand that doesn't have excessively crappy and poisonous ingredients. This Biotin Shampoo is made without lauryl sulfate and is also paraben free. A little goes a long way and it smells terrific. I understand that biotin prevents candida and also hair loss. Though I am not really at the age where I might be losing hair it doesn't hurt! What's more this shampoo smells pleasantly of botanicals. I would gladly use this again. Great price for the quality of shampoo you are getting.
1,"I have very blonde hair and consider my eyebrows/lashes ""transparent"" so I have been getting them dyed @ my hair salon for years. The product in the salons do not last very long (I use a Clarisonic and this seems to speed up the fading) but this Roux product is VERY different!First, be very careful to only get the product on your hair and try to completely avoid your skin. Vaseline is a good preventive measure. If you do get it on your skin, the only thing that will take it off is the ""remover"" that comes with the kit...or time.That said, the results are incredible! The dye (which is really liquid silver - it's clear when it is in the bottle) adheres to the hair on contact. So if you are very blonde, you'll want to get it off your lashes/eyebrows almost as soon as you apply it. It lasts for ages - I only have to re-do it when the brows grow out.The results have been so dramatic that I'm now rarely wearing makeup. Any blondes out there that have felt like your face ""disappears"" without eyebrows & lashes? Here is the solution to your dilemma!"
1,"I decided to try a more natural product to help with my dry skin . I apply this product after getting out of the shower after drying myself . The oil is light and absorbs into my skin and helps with my itching problem . I like the fact can mix with other oils .I will order more again. Gee, nice to not itch any more , yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!Thank You,Native Rose"
0,This was recommended to me by Sephora and I totally hated it. Purity did not cleanse my face thoroughly even with a facial brush. It does not leave my skin feeling fresh and clean. A total waste of money and a total lie!
1,"I really like bareMinerals blush with my bareMinerals foundation.  The two really compliment each other.  The blush goes on easily with the Bare Escentuals angled blush brush, and really has a creamy look on the skin.  Like the foundation, the blush can be easily layered for either a lighter or a more dramatic, darker look.  Unlike the cream blush that I previously used though, this blush does not look very good by itself.I have pretty fair skin and dark hair, and the woman at the makeup counter recommended a pretty dark blush for me because it can be worn so lightly on the skin.  Be aware when you order, if you buy a light color you will have to wear A LOT for it to show up on your skin."
1,"This creme is soft and creamy. I use it every night, it's not greasy. When I wake up in the morning my skin feels smooth. My skin type is normal to dry, and this is perfect for that."
1,"This product does indeed have a firm hold for everyday use, not just windy day.  I would highly recommend for any hair types."
1,This has to be one of the most beautiful colors I ever purchased. Its almost a nude tan looking color. Very classy yet sexy. My boyfriend loved it!  I love it!!!
1,"I bought a bottle of this and I haven't bothered to try out anything else.  It says oil-free, but it does leave behind a residue.  It's not anything horrible - it's moisturizing and helps ensure my eyes don't get dry and itchy afterwards.It takes very little work to get make-up on.  If you have a lot of make up it may take a couple applications,  but it's still very little work.The price is very reasonable for what you get, and is comparable to the fancy boutique removers.  I recommend!"
1,"Let me first say that I love glycolic acid products. This stuff cleared my pores out in no time and after the pores were clear they started to shrink. It also helps to clear up and dry up acne pimples(the ones on my forehead are gone, gone, gone after only a week). My laugh lines are virtually none existent now too. I used it before bedtime and couldn't wait to get up and look in the mirror every morning.The only reason I give this a four stars is that it makes my skin so greasy and I already have oily skin. I have learned my lesson to read the ingredients though before I buy and I see that this has added oils in it. I have found that I can get oil free glycolic acid (Yay!!), so that is my goal.I do recommend this product for women who have normal to dry skin though. I didn't find that it burned a lot, but I had already been using a glycolic acid product. It just tingled a little even when I washed my face before I used it there was virtually no burn. If it weren't for the oil in it (or if I didn't have oily skin) I'd say this is a girl's best friend."
1,This is fantastic. I love it. It works great. You must take your time and do it correctly but it works really good. I live out in the country and we get pretty dirty out here and this is a great way to get those pores cleaned out. Your skin feels great afterword and you can see the difference it makes.
1,I like the feel and texture of this product and did not experience any reaction and it made my skin feel soft and supple
0,This is not my favorite product from Olay. I love all of the others I have tried. It is toooo sticky. I do not recommend.
1,This is a gentle cleanser that does not scratch or scrub. This is great for sensitive skin types like mine!
1,Great product to use on natural hair. I use it on my hair after shampooing it to detangle my hair. Works wonders on burns as well.
1,"Great product, the glue turns black once is dry,it doesn't hurt when you peel them out at all. My own lashes don't  suffer when I use this. This is a really great affordable glue."
1,"Well, this product works, but the ingredients are questionable. If anyone else is looking for another product, Jergens makes a face cream with the same basic ingredients without some of the chemicals."
1,This powder is fantastic when you need coverage. I actually wouldn't recommend this for someone that doesn't need to cover anything though. It stays on very well and has never seemed to add to any of my skin issues. It has become a must in my makeup collection.
1,"I'm nearly 25 and still get moderate breakouts. The worst part are the red marks that hang around for weeks even after the blemish is gone. This product is not only keeping my skin clearer, thus avoiding more red marks, it's also fading the red marks that were already there. My face hasn't been this clear in a long, long time. I use it once in the morning and once at night. It goes on nice and light under makeup - I can't even tell it's there. I ordered one for my sister after having such great success with it myself."
1,"Works very well! Lasts for a long time,"
1,"I use this scrub in the shower on the backs of my upper arms and it works well when I follow it with Salex, a prescription lotion.  There is a foaming ingredient in it that helps it stay in place while you massage the skin.  A lot of scrubs don't have anything like that and end up in ""plops"" on the shower floor.  Price is reasonable and it lasts a long time for me."
1,"I bought this product to eliminate some post acne marks that I had and it worked very well. The only thing is that you cannot use it every night because since it is not oil free, it will cause some acne to come out - how ironic right? It helps with marks, but it also causes what you are trying to avoid. Wish this came as an oil free product."
1,"Love, love, love this! I take it to nail salon and use as base & top coat. My pedicures last a long time with no chipping and stays shiny!"
1,It didn't cleanse my skin that I still need to use number 2 to totally clean my face and so it makes my skin dry. So it didn't get rid of my blackheads and whiteheads.
1,"I have very thick wavy hair, and this has been the best hair drier ever. I bought two in fact so that I do not have to carry with me when I visit with my friends."
0,This did not work at all
1,"Several years ago I had some eyelashes actually break off because of a mascara that was too stiff.  This one is extremely soft, yet noticeable and natural.  I've used it for years - since that break-off incident."
1,"I use this along with Jan Marini Sacylic face wash, tree tea oil, and jojoba oil. I use this product as a toner after washing my face, then apply the tree tea oil mixed with jojoba oil, with a cotton ball. I love it! It makes my face feel so clean, without over drying it. I used to use Mario Badescu cucumber toner, but it really was too drying. This product is cheap, but not cheaply made. My face looks and feels smooth."
0,"For me, the color nail polish coat adheres to this fine (why wouldn't it?), but within a few days the base coat separates from the nail. I'm not sure what the advantage is versus using no base coat at all.Update June 2014: It might not be the product's fault. I learned that some people have naturally oily nails, just like hair and skin can be oily, and this would inhibit good adhesion. I'm supposed to de-grease my nails with alcohol first, and then base coats should adhere better. When I get around to trying that I'll post another update with my results."
1,"I just got this today, and this shade is beautiful :) It's that perfect baby pink shade for the eyes. LOVE IT!! I love bare minerals eyeshadows, and this one is no exception."
1,"Worked wonders for me! Since recently having a baby I've had small, puffy bags under my eyes and I just look tired all the time even when I'm well rested. I got this in the mail the other day and tried it...woke up this morning and I'm very impressed with the results! Just one use and I look well rested, refreshed and my skin looked visibly brighter! The bags are gone and my eyes look amazing! I'm so happy with this product that I ended up buying one for my mom as a gift! FYI...the reason I bought this is I saw a segment on the Dr. OZ show and he featured anti-aging products with DMEA in them spoke very highly of them. Hence this amazon purchase! Way to go Dr. OZ!"
1,"This Olay Regenerist Regenerating Serum Moisturizer 1.7 Fl Oz  is a cheap good moisturizer, so you can use it every day."
1,"This is the best mascara I've ever tried.  And I've tried a lot.  I love the brush, this mascara goes on smooth every time and I never never never have clumps.  Not even at the end of the tube.  Lashes feel soft and look so natural!  LOVE this mascara!!!  Would highly recommend to anyone looking for something new."
1,"This stuff works pretty good. Good price also, will buy it again. Also use it on my 10 year old daughter who has been breaking out as of lately and it's not to strong for her sensitive skin"
1,I love this multi tasking product. I ordered this in Orgasm is light peachy/pink color. I can use it in my checks and lips and it had a beautiful sheen. It does not settle into lines and look glittery. It is a great product.  I also use the Orgasm blush over this once in a while. They pair nicely.
1,love the scent and it works
1,Gifted this to my aunt. She likes it and says that this is a great temporary solution to touch up the roots (and cover up the grey) between color appointments.
1,"I have two other foundations that I mainly use but this comes a close second to them.  Great coverage.  Stays put.  Easy to use.  What more could you ask for?  Maybe make it easier to find.  I've been so surprised at how many stores have dropped this product. I really love Max Factor and hope it doesn't get discontinued.  That would be a real shame for such a good brand.  Their mascara, 2000 Calories, is one of the best I've used too.  Went looking for it the other day in the store but no luck.  Thank goodness we can still get it here. :)"
1,I am in love with this color because not only is it a soft lilac it has undertones of blue so the color stands out! beautiful
0,"I don't hate or like this product, but it hasn't benefit meAnd I wouldn't purchase it in the future."
1,"I did not really see much of a difference on my lashes.  It did make them look a little darker, but it smudged a little bit too.  After a while of not using it, it drys up."
1,"""Ah, sweet mystery of life, at last I've fouuuund youuuuuu..."" Very moisturizing but not a bit greasy; truly odorless (not unscented but chemical-ish). Fast absorbing. This is it! Ahhh, sweet relief."
1,"This face wash is an excellent gentle wash.  I tried it because even Cetaphil and Purpose were drying out my skin and I have had no problems with this one.  My skin is usually pretty oily and since using this wash I've noticed an improvement.  It has a neutral smell, foams nicely, leaves your skin feeling clean but not taut, and you can't beat the price."
1,I purchased this microfiber towel for my boyfriend; he has waist length (African American 4b) locks and needed some help in the drying department!! This towel is too small to wrap is hair and makes no significant difference in the dying time - we were attempting to avoid the heat from the blow dryer but this isn't the solution...
1,"Let me tell you, I'm a veteran at moisturizer and i've been thru it all , divorced break up to make upwith all these products.. lol... this is my dovoted one.. what it says it delivers wit seriously magnificent results.you dont need much, just have a good cleanser.. and use a lil bit rub it gently around your face.. drink plenty of wateruse this day and night.... give it about one month, and watch this baby go to work.. im not Lying I spent hundereds of dollarsand waisted them all... what i realize for best skin products come from not expensive over hyped adds.. but the names thathave great establishment and history like Olay..  and this perticular one complete all day for sensitve skin is the best for sensetive skin so dont deviate from it if u have sensitive skin this is your best chance to control your oil and have even skin tone.."
1,I just had to buy a new one after over a decade. The brush is better than most I've tried. It makes my hair feel good and the product is of high quality.
1,These individual lashes were really cute and looked pretty natural if you put them on with the proper glue. I used the lashtite in black and I never looked back. Five star for sure.
1,I used this product twice and I am very satisfied with it. The color stays on my hair (originally brown with warm copper undertones) for ~1-2 mnth. I was my hair everyday so it washes off rather quickly.
1,"""Strivectin-SD is much less expensive than surgery, but it's not cheap. Finally, for maxium efficacy, StriVectin-SD must be applied three times a day, every day for 4-6 weeks....StriVectin-SD works, but you have to use it. So unless you're committed to getting rid of stretch marks, don't waste your time, your energy, or your money.""After months of thinking about an incredibly large skin care purchase, I splurged and purchased the StriVectin-SD cream. If you have ever gained and lost weight or have been pregnant, then you know that you can get stretch marks and they never seem to go away. How do you heal your skin so they literally disappear? Well, to start with, you need a cream that will produce dramatic results in a short amount of time. Especially as Summer is approaching.I gave this cream a one-month trial. You need very little because this cream is very concentrated. It seems to increase the skin's thickness and firmness, therefore making the depths of indented surfaces much less apparent.Results you should see in 4-6 weeks:Decrease in the actual length of the stretch markDecrease in the depth of the indented surfacesIncrease in skin smoothness, thickness and firmnessWhat is actually occurring?The cream stimulates glycosaminoglycan and collagen synthesis. It will also correct irregularities in skin coloration. The Peptide solution helps to thicken the skin.How often did I apply this?Just one to two times a day. At first I tried to apply the cream three times a day, but found it was easier to remember to put this cream on after a shower and/or before bed. It seems to work very well with only two applications a day.You may also find yourself using this on your face or on areas where you want to see a decrease in wrinkles.Not for use by pregnant or nursing women. Consult with your dermatologist before using this product. Do ask your doctor if this product is right for you and start using it as soon as possible after pregnancy/nursing. You will be amazed at the results after 1 month. My main reason for using this product was due to weight gain and monthly weight gain. It seems to have been very effective and I will continue using the product over the long term for maintenance.The ingredient list is long (a proprietary combination of skin firming agents, elasticizers and hydrators) but some of the main ingredients include: Sesame oil, sweet almond oil, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3, Algae Extract, Coneflower Extract, Licorice, Cocoa Butter, Shea Butter, Mango Butter, Peppermint Oil and retinyl Palmitate.You may also enjoy the Derma E beauty products, especiallythe Peptide creams.~The Rebecca Review"
1,I bought this for my mom and she loves it. Says she can see a difference in her skin. She likes that it makes her skin smooth and it doesn't have an overpowering smell.
1,"I've been using this product for six years and I just can't say enough good things about it.  I love the stuff!Purchased originally to help my daughter with cracks and redness on her knuckles from damage caused by frequent hand washing with anti-bacterial soaps at school, I have found Miracle of Aloe Miracle Hand Repair Cream works for other issues too.My mother's dog developed a yeast infection on his skin, which led him to bite at himself.  His belly was particularly raw, but when we started using this product on it (in conjunction with a blow up collar so he couldn't bite at it... and a gluten free diet), it healed beautifully in a very short time.If I use it after I wash my face at night as a replacement to my regular night time moisturizing cream, my face is soft and hydrated in the morning.  No stickiness or greasiness, just softer and younger feeling.  I use only about a dime size amount for my face and neck, and work it in slowly, starting around my eyes and moving outward and then down my neck.  Amazing stuff!My husband uses this cream on the tips of his fingers to ease cracking that seems to be constant.  When he uses this product twice a day, every day, the cracking disappears.The cream is heavy, but it takes very little to cover a good sized area.  Wherever you use it you will notice improved hydration retention in the skin, as well as softer, smoother texture.  There is a slight odor to the cream, but it's pleasant and not perfume-y.With 60% Aloe, it heals naturally.  I don't always go for natural products, but this one truly works extremely well, and is fairly priced considering you need very little of this rich cream to get the job done.I highly recommend this cream to heal and/or improve the quality of their skin.  Those having issues with dry, rough, chapped, cracked skin on any part of their body will most appreciate the quick relief offered by this product.NOTE:  I have also tried theMiracle of Aloe Miracle Foot Repair Cream 8 Oz As Seen On TV Guarantees to Repair Dry, Cracked Feet & Heels! Helps Stop Itching & Unpleasant Odors Quick, Fast, Easy and Completely Painless! Contains 60% Ultra Aloe, All Natural Formula. Penetrates Deep T...which works very well too.  Just a tad thicker than this one, but it seems to be essentially the same formulation."
1,"hey, im 13 and i love neeutrogena. this product is amazing. it smells sort of like bleech, but still its a clean fresh smell, i like it at least. :) i got this at walmart so i can't really say anything about the seller but i love this cleanser. awesome freshness!"
0,"I found another way to curl my hair, so I really didn't need these at all. Rather an old idea and improved upon since. I just needed something when I ordered them and they work ok, but there are better ways."
1,"Years ago, I bought a similar towel from the Body Shop (I'm talking fifteen years ago) and was terribly upset when it reached its final days.  I searched but couldn't find a similar one on the market.  When I saw this as a suggestion for me (thanks Amazon) I read the reviews and purchased it. Now I haven't had it long enough to notice any kind of smell, but I immediately noticed the difference versus a regular towel.  I have fine hair that doesn't take too long to dry, but I like to get it as dry as possible before I expose it to the heat of a blow dryer.  Not only am I going to order a couple more for me, I plan on ordering them this Christmas as presents for the girls in my life.  Don't hesitate!"
1,"I got this a while back and have used it several times.  For the most part, I like it.  The first few times i used it, it worked beautifully.  The water dries up pretty quickly, so I had to re-wet it several times to finish lining my eyes, but I'm relatively ok with that.  However, the times I've used it since then, it dried kinda chalky...as in, it looked more grey than black.  I think this problem may have been user error on my part because the first couple of times (when it turned out great) I used it with filtered water and the other times I just used water out of the faucet.  I'll have to try it with the filtered water again and see if i get the results I was getting when I first started using it."
1,"I have been using this cleanser since my late teens. It is one of the best OTC acne medicines available, and slightly cheaper than other drugstore cleansers like Neutrogena. When used twice a day, the Clean and Clear greatly reduces the number of pimples I get. Also, it contains menthol, so it feels pleasantly tingly on skin (but do not get it into your eyes; it burns like the flames of he11!). There are only two drawbacks to this product: 1) It will dry out your skin, so wear a lotion and 2) The active ingredient, benzoyl peroxide, is a bleaching agent, so it will bleach fabric. I recommend using old wash cloths to wash your face and be very careful not to get it on your clothes."
1,"After reading the positive reviews, I decide to try this.  When it first arrived, I unscrewed the lid and smelled it.  It was awful!  Smelled like mostly alcohol.  However, when you spray it on yourself, it transforms into a wonderful, cotton candy fragrance!  It's a light scent and doesn't last long, but I feel happy, light and fresh whenever I wear it.  I ordered two more bottles."
0,"I bought this set to replace a set of jumbo rollers by BabyBliss.  The case looks identical and the rollers are exactly the same.  However, these rollers take about 10 minutes to fully heat and never really get hot enough.  The plastic clips don't hold my hair very well and are too bulky to pack in a suitcase.  If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't purcahse these rollers."
1,Delivered on time. Recieved item as described. The color is lovely. I purchased this color after seeing in on a nail blog. Have  not worn the color yet but it looks to be a great formula and the color is beautiful. The color is a mix of green and blue.
1,I am not quite sure what this does but I think it strengthens your hair.  I have been using it for a few weeks and feel it is helping my split ends to heal along with a protein treatment that I do once a month.  it's light weight and does not weigh the hair down.  Don't spray to much you only needs a light misting.
1,"This is the first time I've used this hand cream, and after reading the reviews I decided to try it.  My skin is very dry and this cream is very good for moisturizing my hands.  At first I was afraid it would be too greasy, but it isn't.  It is absorbed fairly quickly and doesn't leave any signs of itself on paper or anything else.  I'm using it on my arms and also massaging it into my nails and cuticles.  The fragrance is nice, but very light.  This is a much thicker cream than many I've used, and can be used on legs and knees as well.  I'm very pleased with this product, and I think I need another tube for upstairs, too.  This one is in the kitchen.  I wish I'd discovered it sooner."
1,It my first time to buy a green polish. It is amazing!I wear it to the beach. It makes me shining!
1,I bought this for my Aunt who loves the Philosophy line and she really likes this moisturizer.  She uses it on her hands and a little on her face and is really happy with the product.
1,"I have very visible acne scars and this the only thing that covers them completely. It is a very heavy make-up, but if applied correctly (to a clean face, after your primer) it holds up well. I wish they were still available in the US. Thank goodness for Amazon."
1,"Hair Background: I have fine, thin light brown hair and in late November, Early December 2011 I got a deeper brown with red undertones color and highlights at my regular salon. I loved it but by January my roots were growing in, the highlights looked dull and I couldn't afford to go back to the Salon to get everything redone, so I picked up a box of what looked like a darker brown to cover everything and match my natural color. Of course, this was a gigantic mistake and my hair came out looking black. I couldn't go back to the Salon to get it fixed since it was basically black so I looked at Amazon for a solution and found Colorfix. I did not order from Amazon but I went to my local Sally's Beauty Supply.I poured over reviews here, Googled Colorfix and watched Youtube videos. I am one of those girls who is really dumb about hair and makeup (boyfriend helped dye my hair) and I wanted to make sure I didn't come out bald or something. I followed the directions, worked quickly, waited 20 minutes, rinsed and decided I would see how my hair looked before using the third step, the Processing Lotion (many reviews and videos said to skip this step as it brings back the original color you were trying to get rid of) I towel dried my hair enough to judge if I wanted to use the third step or not, and I found that my hair was a coppery-red and I definitely needed to use the Processing Lotion. (I blame the coppery-red outcome on the Salon dye, not Colorfix)I used the Processing Lotion and was pleased that it took out the harsh red and returned my hair to a more normal looking color. My roots definitely have a red hue to them but nowhere near what it looked like prior to using the Processing Lotion and the rest of my hair looks closer to my natural color mixed in with a little red from the Salon and my highlights are much more subtle, you can barely see them. I'm very satisfied with using this product, it took out the terrible black box color and returned me to a more normal color, enough so that I can go back to my Salon and get the original color redone. If I had not used Colorfix, I'd be waiting 6 or more months to gradually go back to my original color using box dyes. I doubt I'll use an at-home dye kit again.Here are a couple notes:-When I purchased Colorfix I also purchased a mixing bowl, dye brush, gloves and shower cap. The shower cap is a must. Colorfix doesn't provide anything other than the solutions and directions.-The smell did not bother me. It had sickly sweet smell upon mixing and the perm-ish smell came out after applying it to my hair. I used a shower cap with a tight elastic band, perhaps it kept the smell in the cap. Also, my hair doesn't smell gross, it smells like chemicals which I expect to go away by my next washing.-People say to skip the Processing Lotion step since it brings back the color you were trying to get rid of, but according to the box it brings it back to tell you how much color is left in your hair that needs removed. If you removed all the black color like I did, then the Processing Lotion may tone down any crazy hues you get as a result as it did my hair.-The Processing Lotion is liquid like water and was very difficult to use so I ended up dumping it in my hands and applying it that way.-My hair is pretty dry after using.I would definitely recommend this product to someone looking to get rid of a terrible dye job."
1,"I bought this a couple months ago from Fred Meyers as a night cream (Olay Sensitive Skin SPF30 during the day, and I try to stay out of the sun for extended periods of time), and I really like it. It doesn't irritate my skin, it doesn't have a weird consistency (it's a bit like butter in colour and consistency, but it doesn't leave a tint and it absorbs in the skin as you massage it in), and it doesn't give me acne. My mother thought it a little weird that I'm using it because I'm only 20, but I believe that it's important to start taking care of skin and body at a young age with a proper beauty/wellness regime, clean diet, and regular exercise. I would recommend trying this for a month or two to people with sensitive skin like myself because overall, it's a great product."
1,"I am a fan of the entire L'oreal Preferece line, having tried most of the competig products over the past 20 years, including Clairol, Garnier, and even other L'oreal lines (excellence and Feria).  The Prefernce line is minimally stinky, not runny, and gives consistent color results every time I uses it. The 5g is one of my go-to colors: a true medium brown with no brass."
1,It cleanse even the most stubborn make up on my face though it does sting my eyes. I would recommend neutrogena eye makeup remover for those of us looking for a gentle yet effective way to remove water proof mascara.
0,"I don't have especially sensitive skin, but it is dry. This product did not feel very moisturizing, but it made me break out. I thought it might be something else, but I quit using it for a few days, and my skin cleared up. Then when I tried it again, I immediately had another breakout. If you have sensitive skin, skip this cream!"
1,"This is a cheap, slightly flimsy product.Note there is a voltage selector (for 250 vs. 120 volts). In the 120 mode, you will not be able to use HIGH mode, but HIGH appears to work fine if you do not toggle the switch."
1,"I have tried many products in the lip balm category, and most of them have let me down. As a male, I don't care for the usually disgusting fruity varieties. All I want is something that moisturizes, protects, and relieves my lips without being distracting. The Neutrogena Norwegian Forumula Lip Moisturizer does all of the above. It feels very smooth and thin and you forget that you have it on. The SPF 15 is essential for anti-aging too. I recommend buying this lip moisturizer if you want great results without the distractions of the other brands."
1,"This stuff is wonderful! My skin has been reeeeeeally negatively impacted (chronic peeling) from a mask I purchased from a Marketplace buyer on Amazon. I tried this toner and could not believe the difference.  I'm really particular about toners and have always opted for a salicylic acid toner as my skin responds well to it, but when I tried this I was more than pleasantly surprised.  I used another treatment that acts as a toner a couple of nights and saw that, sadly, the peeling came back/was still there.  Resuming use of this toner once again helped, but I obviously need a doctor's treatment.  I would recommend people try this toner as it really does have a healing impact; I'll continue to buy it."
1,"I've been using this product for years and I always find myself coming back to it. Sometimes I go looking for something new but end up disappointed and upset that I ever thought to leave it (it's as close to a husband as I ever want to get).What I like about it:1. SPF is there. It's not a lot but it's there. With my other SPF makeup, I feel adequately protected.2. It absorbs quickly without taking everything with it. My skin stays soft and supple all day.3. It doesn't smell bad at all.4. IT DOESN'T BREAK ME OUT.5. My skin is extremely sensitive and with regular microdermabrasion, I am sometimes left with red, flaky skin that needs to be treated with love and care. This product doesn't exacerbate what my skin goes through and even also layers well with other moisturizers when I need backup.6. On days when I've gone without foundation and wearing only this, I've gotten complimented on how ""luminous"" my skin looks.Overall, it's an awesome product and I recommend it. As someone who also uses mostly ""high end"" products, I am amazed with how rarely Neutrogena lets me down. I thank them for saving me some serious green!"
1,I have scars from a surgical procedure. This product covers the scar completely. It has an amazing professional finish. Great product.
0,"When I couldn't find my favorite 'pink tape', I tried these, but there are features of the product that made me put it aside.  First of all, I was surprised to find the paper is very stiff, like old-fashioned butcher's paper.  Because the patches are rather large, I had to tear them to get pieces that were sized appropriately.  Cutting the patches to a smaller size left stiff edges and points that could still irritate.  I also didn't like having to wet the 'glue' on the patches to stick them to my face and ended up with the occasional breakout as a result of using them.  They did minimize the lines, but the resulting irritation just shifted the problem.  I ended up discontinuing use.Luckily, I was able to find the pink tape on Amazon even though I couldn't find it any longer in stores and switched back to using it. It's much easier to use and more comfortable.  Although it's officially hair setting tape, it is effective for removing lines by smoothing the skin overnight while you sleep and it never causes breakouts.3m Scotch Professional Hair Set Tape With Dispenser * Created Especially For Hair Styling."
1,"I ordered this makeup after another reviewer recommended it to another reviewer of a different product.  I'm so glad I took the chance because this is my favorite makeup by far.  I've used facial makeup for over 20 years and have tried most brands, both expensive and inexpensive.  Most makeups sit on my skin and I become oily. This makeup however seems to sink into my skin and there's no oily feeling throughout the day.It gives good coverage on it's own but due to my sun damage I top it with the same brand powder to set it and provide even further coverage.Buying cruelty free is important to me and I'm so happy that I don't have to sacrifice anything with this product and instead get rewarded for doing the right thing."
0,"this was my first time using a henna product of any kind so I won't give the product a 1 star because its always possible i didnt do something right (even though its just add water)  the product smells like cooked spinach which isnt pleasant at all but its natural so i went with it hoping that when it dried the smell would go away, no such luck.  also the product didnt rinse out - after rinsing and repeating until my hair felt stripped i just twisted and air dried, the next day i still have what looks like coffee grinds in my hair - gross!!and the biggest disappointment of all is my hair is not red - i wore a heat cap for 60 mins and there is no red in my hair - i started with a medium shade of brown and i feel like it looks darker than when i started which is okay because i ordered the dark drown too, but i think i will try a different company before i give the spinach head a go again."
1,"I have combination normal/oily skin and use an astringent every morning.  In the past, the astringents I used were drying, and they would sometimes leave a burning sensation on my skin.  I decided to try Thayer's witch hazel, hoping I could  get the same anti-breakout results without the drying.  This product is very different from most commercial astringents.First of all, it actually moisturizes the skin.  It's great for dry skin, but if you have oily skin (like mine), you may not want to use it in the morning, or you'll likely have oily skin the rest of the day.  I use it as a toner every evening, after I have removed my makeup and used a cleanser.  It's very soothing, and it makes my skin feel very soft and smooth.  Just use a small amount, or it will leave a filmy feeling on your skin.In addition to using it as a toner, it's also my go-to product to soothe sunburns and insect bites.  I've also used it on minor cuts and burns with good results.  Is it a miracle product?  Probably not, but it is a very good, all-purpose cleanser and moisturizer to have on-hand."
1,Great cleanser.  Once you use it you won't use anything else.  It's my cleanser of choice.  Great product.  I'll buy it again and again.
1,"If you are looking for an acne treatment, definitely try this. It's reasonably priced and has been very effective in our house."
0,I'm in my twenties and just getting started on my anti aging regimen. I used this for a month or so and didn't really see or feel any results. I don't think it went well with my skin either. I switched to St. Ives moisturizer with collagen and I like it a lot better.
1,I love this oil. Its like crack. I use it in the tub when I take baths and when I get out. I have very dry skin and this keeps me moisterized
0,"Please avoid this product. The conditional is so thick that it does not flow out when you want to use it. As for quality, it is horrible. It makes your hair sticky as if you haven't rinsed your hair for days. I don't see any good using it. I finally use Dove that I bought at Costco. It is cheaper and make your hair soft and weightless as well."
0,Many of my friends recommended this for me. sadly it doesn't work .. It made me break out -tiny pimples- like crazy. I came to the point that any product with sunscreen on it will have the same problem on my skin!
1,"I still gave this 4 stars because on most days, this is pretty good.I like that it moisturizes and it doesn't cause any new pimples to form.I have pretty oily skin so I don't need much moisturizers, but I've been washing with the PCA Blemish bar, which really dries out my chin and mouth area, and this does not moisturize enough. If you have drier skin, you'll need to add a serum and an additional lotion on top of this."
1,This is a great smelling perfume oil.  I cannot describe the scent other than to say it stays close to the skin and is very sexy.  This particular line of products are all wonderful.
0,I bought this because it was reduced.  It was an even lower price in the grocery store.  My son questioned the smell.  This is like no ocean smell I ever smelled.  Now I am stuck with 4 of them.
1,This is a great moisturizing conditioner.. If you are looking for a conditioner that will leave your hair soft and full of moisture you should definately give this product a try. The price you can not beat!
1,"I'm really not sure what to say about this, I mean, I like the red color -its a nice sexy red (it looks blood red)that will look good on anyone- but at the same time I'm not wowed by it either. Why? Because you can find similar reds just like this. It looked pretty and different in the bottle but on my nails, just like a red you can find anywhere."
1,After much experimenting I have found a way to make it work for me. To prevent getting stringy hair I have to put a sealer under and gel over it. I was surprised how curl enhancing it is. More potent than ag recoil for me. Great moisturizer.
1,"I've recently switched SPF moisturizers and am so very pleasantly pleased with this purchase.  It fits all my requirements, does the job quite well, and is within budget."
1,"I recently purchased a rose water toner from Sephora for $ 38, it smelled nice and I liked how it felt on my skin. I however felt like it was totaly overpriced, I am glad I found this product on amazon. as the smell compared to the almost 4 x more price is amazing. It really smells like so many other reviewers stated amazing like you walk past a rose bush. It feels great on my skin and I definitly recommend this to anyone looking for a wonderful smelling toner for a great price.Only con was that it did not come with a spray nozzle, it was a bit confusion as some reviews stated they spritzed it on , so I expected it to come with a spray nozzle, but I went to a local beauty store and refilled it and voilait works amazing."
1,"Read a highly regarded review which gave this product a best in class award, well to me, this is nothing special and I can't find a single reason as to why anyone would think so.  My skin is just as oily after I apply this as it was before."
1,"I can't wear mascara because it leaves dark circles under my eyes (no matter what brand I try...), so I decided to try these fake lashes for a friend's wedding.  I love them!  They look very natural, not too long, not to think or dense, they just give your eyes that extra ""omph"".  I like that they're made from real hair as well.Applying them can be tricky at first.  You'll probably have to trim them a little.  Then I apply a generous amount of glue at my lash line, then on the strip of the fake lashes.  I wait about 30 seconds to let the glue get tacky, then I slide them on and tap them into place.  I cover any gaps between my real lashes and the fake ones with eyeliner (you could also apply the liner first).  It takes a little practice, but once you have it down, it's second nature.Definetely recommend!"
1,"Used the whole container, but couldn't discern any visible change. Cream goes on easily, feels nice, and smells good...but I wouldn't buy it again."
1,"I have been using this stuff for about 2 years now, and it's great! I like the way it feels on my skin when I apply it (silky), and it has a nice scent."
1,"It's a great product. I have had two before and my last one, of three years, died finally so I went to buy a replacement but could not find one anywhere. This Hot Air curling iron is a great price and it works great for my hair, which is on the thicker side and wavy. I can do anything from baby-doll curls with this thing to soft shiny waves or use it to shine my hair and give it some shape after straightening. It's a good multipurpose tool.The shipment on this thing was crazy fast. I ordered it and the third day it came to me. I did a test just now to see if it works and it does. Nothing was wrong with the packaging or the product. When I need one again I will defiantly buy from this person/business again."
1,This is the best gel for natural kinky curly hair! It's all natural has no alcohol and it leaves your hair soft shiny and wavy. I have 4a hair so it really helps defines my waves. It's good for slicking back your hair too. Doesn't leave your hair all sticky or hard. Nice smell also.
1,"i like it an all but i jus didnt realize how small the bottle actually was when it arrived in the mail. came in early, so that was good, and it definitely keeps your hair soft all day. but seriously, for the price, its not bad."
1,"Was looking for a brush to use that doesn't melt(other's bristles did) while using with a hair dryer. This one does not only withstand the high temperatures but also tends to smoothen and soften your hair during drying and reduces static greatly, even more if you use an ionic hair dryer. Once you're done, it shines...err your hair does....and all in all so does this product ;)"
1,"A friend turned me onto this product and overall, I like it. Only four stars because my face feels dry after application, and the price is high. The Amazon subscribe and save helps you save more. It's worth the money if you want a sunblock/skin concealer/foundation in one.  It comes with a darker pigment, so you can match up your coloring. It's the only product of it's type, which is why it's a bit pricey."
0,"I bought this product. I thought that it was a good deal. I had to throw it out this morning. It made my skin burn, whenever I use it. The dermablend powder from the mall had a different consistency and never made me burn. I threw it out , because I am not sure if it is really dermablend and I was concerned for my skin health. I have been using the real dermablend for years. I guess, I wanted a deal. Burning skin is not worth it."
1,"I have combination skin, my chin and cheeks are quite dry, but my forehead can be rather oily (especially with bangs!) This product works so great. It really helps take away the shine from my forehead and temples. I will definitely purchase again - great price!"
0,This did nothing for my hair. I didn't feel moisture or dryness...just did absolutely nothing. I'd rather have Suave professionals Conditioner in Rosemary Mint...amazing especially on Afro textured hair.
1,weird smell and hate the smell.. almost took breath away. they should warn you about the horrible weird smell so i dont use it as often cause of sme;ll
1,"I thought this would smell similar to Amazing Grace but it does not.  However it does have its own unique scent, I like it."
0,"I used the cool medium brown color and it's awful! I have medium brown hair and always use a medium ash brown color on it. That usually takes it 1-2 shades darker than my natural color. I thought Feria looked interesting because of the highlights. Well, it's trashed my hair. My roots are oddly lighter than the rest of my hair (lighter than my natural color)and the grey hairs didn't take the color AT ALL! So, now I have this weird looking hair color AND still have greys. I'll never use this hair color again."
1,This comb is a great detangler.  I. Would buy it. Again.  I also snt my siser one.  She lves it.
1,"My wife and I recently stayed in a hotel that had a wall mounted mirror in the bathroom. We quickly realized how nice it would be to have one at home in our bathroom. I found this mirror, read the reviews, and made the purchase. We could not be any happier! I use it to shave and my wife loves it for doing her makeup.+ Simple to Install+ Easily Folds Out+ Retains Any Position+ Very Clear Image+ Two Sides+ Easily Rotates+ Flush Against Wall Saving Space+ Price_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this wall mounted bathroom mirror. I have had it for several weeks and love it. Previously I used a hand mirror with a stand...not anymore! This is a simple upgrade to the bathroom that is really nice to have. I recommend holding it up to the wall where you plan to put it first. I had to move it down because I put it up too high. Great product. Easy 5 stars."
1,"This is my first Essie nail polish and I love it. It went on non streaky and opaque within two coats, and five days later I only have two chips. Wicked is a deep berry wine color and is absolutely stunning for fall. Against darker skin its quite complimentary."
1,I get what I wanted. Sandalwood scent. It fits perfectly for my use which is to layer it with other perfumes. I'm not sure why other people cannot smell anything. My bottle is great.
1,"I adore this product because, for starters, witch hazel bark is the origin of this amazing tincture - infused with alcohol. Witch hazel is excellent for facial redness, drying out pimples/zits and also making you feel all fresh and new. I use it as part of my daily facial routine, along with my cleanser and rose water. I can't recommend it enough. Also, at a price like that listed here, it is a steal. A little goes a long way, too. Just dab some on a cotton ball."
1,"I worked in cosmetic ingredient sales for several years meaning I sold the ingredients directly to large manufacturers and worked with the scientists.I learned much and try to share it.It's rare to find so many natural and beneficial ingrdients in a soap or face wash. This is a cleanser for oily skin according to the bottle front but it actually is surprisingly mild and non-drying. But the big bonus for me is the tea tree. This is a natural antiseptic and blemish cure yet having to dilute a bottle of it and then apply that mixture to skin isn't all that convenient. This does it for you so you not only have cleaner hands, but better skin on your face as well.How can it clean the skin with an antiseptic without drying it? It also contains olive oil, another great skin helper. So between the two you are cleaning, removing bacteria, as well as moisturizing.I have very sensitive skin and have had great results with this cleanser."
1,This is okay. I will not use it in the summer because of the increased photo sensitivity. I wore SPF 40 during the day while using this at night for 3 weeks and it caused parts of my chin to burn. I now have three distinct discolored marks that I am trying to fade with pure aloe. People with sensitive skin should use with extreme caution. The seller is great. No complaints on the seller and how quickly I received the product. The cream just did not suit me.
1,Am pretty sure she will love gift. She has been asking for it since November. Pretty sure she will be excited. To be honest I don't know how it smells but she tells me it is pretty wonderful.
1,This is a great perfume. I've always loved Jenifer Lopez's perfumes because they are really good quality perfumes. This one is no exception.
1,"This perfume smells really good, a slightly sweet floral scent.  The scent is strong enough, but not overwhelming.  I like to mix it with the Sandalwood oil to take some of the sweetness down.  The roller ball applicator works well."
1,"I love Aveeno products. I have very sensitive skin and every new thing i try I am always breaking out in hives, its really hard for me to find a product that works well with my skin, but I've never had an issue with Aveeno, please never change!"
1,Bought this for our dog. It works really great. It makes our dogs coat much whiter and shinier. Plus it smells great. A little goes a long way. Our dogs skin doesn't get irritated. Great product.
1,"Love this red!  Great lipstick!  Applies smoothly and long lasting. Very happy. Also purchased other colors. I think you will like it, especially if you are a Lady in Red!"
0,"The bottle to small to mix products together,my hair was falling apart after just 30 min,did not lighten my roots as described ,product is not on my future list,try at your own risk."
1,"This is marvelous for oily skin with juicy acne pimples. Be sure to use this ONLY at night for the first few days until you figure out how much it dries out your skin. I found using a facial complexion brush encourages one to really massage and cleanse the skin and pores for the recommended 2 minutes. OK I admit I used to be a splish-splash kind of face washer until a friend reminded me how long doctors take washing their hands to get rid of germs/bacteria OR how long you're supposed to brush your teeth. IF it doesn't dry you out too much you can use it twice a day. IF too drying then use it every other day. My athletic teenager's back-ne has responded better to this than liquid Benzoyl Peroxide washes, gels, ointments. Be sure to use sunscreen while using this product to protect your new, sensitive skin.My family has used PanOxyl Acne Cleansing Bar off and on for years on Pharmacist's recommendation BEFORE Benzoyl Peroxide was deemed the acne cure-all in nearly ALL acne preparations. We have used both the 5% and 10% BOTH are now very difficult to find, I stocked up when 5-6 bucks a bar. I can remember paying less than 2 bucks a bar at local drug stores when it still was in the red, white and blue box. When I called Stieffel about the scarcity they mentioned difficulties with their factory in Mexico where it's made."
1,"Compares the same with my $8.00 Neutrogena facial cream.  I thought this product had more to offer, but it doesn't."
1,I ordered this Olay product for the first time. The bottle seemed smaller than what is seen on the website. It didn't last me as long as I would've liked. I didn't see any difference as far as its anti-aging goes. Sometimes you have to use a product at least 90 days to see some results. I guess I can continue to use it a while longer and hopefully see some anti-aging results in the near future.
1,"I hadn't bough one of these in a while. It works but I would never call it powerful, sorta loud, very cheesy. I maybe use it weekly or less, I don't think it would stand up to everyday use."
1,"This Lush Bomb is on my top favorites list. When I drop it in the tub, and it fizzles its little bubbles, it turns your bathtub into a deep blue Ocean!  It smells salty, blue, fresh and crisp with pure Atlantic Sea Salt Crystals, Arame Seaweed, Lemon Oil, Lavender Oil, Seaweed Absolute with that gorgeous blue color this is an amazing treat.This remindes me of the times I did bathe in the Ocean, and for a few bucks it makes that feeling a repetitive experience. I aboslutely love it."
1,"Anyway, I just cannot help myself from scribing another shampoo review. I accomplish these on my Smart Phone at night after a shower. So I mentioned this product in a different review but I want girls to know they can use it too! It's like a day at the spa. You can really smell the peppermint. The lather is amazing. Skin is clean and soft too. Like the rosemary mint, which I don't like as much as this after a few times using it, it's a gel consistency, clear, spreads easily and sinks into the hair and scalp. Yes, it is clarifying and might steal color, but it's worth it for the cleanest hair possible. Girls, if you want an inexpensive cleanser, do not be intimidated by the dark bottle with the word MEN. This is a superior product, and I'm not that into all things Suave. But I love this one!"
1,"First, you absolutely must know your range of tones for your skin. Do not colour your hair prior to that discovery or you will end up with the wrong colour.Next, if you are attempting to go from blond to black, you MUST use a filler. With that said, hair colouring does require prior knowledge. Also, often times, it takes multiple applications for colour to grab well. That means you may need to colour repeatedly to get the deepest and darkest colour result. As well, a MULTI-FACETED colour product means that it will NOT deposit colour evenly. That is the entire point of the MULTI-FACETED colour product, it grabs here & there.**To prevent colour from fast-fade do this; After you colour, gently rinse hair, add a conditioner treatment, and DO NOT WASH with shampoo for 2-3 days. This helps to set the color better and prevent quick fading issues.Also if you use a lot of styling products, do not attempt to colour over hair that is coated with styling product, it will not work-out properly.Lastly, do not experiment without prior knowledge of hair colour. Seek a professional for a first time colouring, and then, you can attempt to maintain that same colour, after the fact, on your own. And stay within your range of tones such as cool versus warm.Example: If you have fair skin (veins appear bluish under skin) and blue eyes then you have cool tones. If you have hazel eyes and pale-peached, golden toned skin (veins appear greenish under skin) you are a warm tone. Hope this helps people in regards to making mistakes with hair colour."
1,"I know it's not cheap - but it does exactly what it says it's going to do.  It doesn't smell great, but who cares.  I wouldn't waste my time using any other product."
0,"Williams Lectirc Shave is a great product that has served men's electric shaving needs for several decades!  BUT DON'T buy it here!  WHY?  I didn't pay close enough attention to the prices vs weight and when it arrived I was really angry!  This is the 3 ounce travel bottle that you can sometimes find in you local drug store for about $2.50, NOT $5.62!!!  For $5.48 - $5.85 you can buy the 7 ounce bottle at every drugstore in your town or on line at CVS.com or Drugstore.com or any other online national drug store chain.  DON'T GET RIPPED OFF BY THIS SELLER!!  YOU ARE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR WHAT YOU GET! THE PRICE SHOULD BE FOR THE 7 OUNCE BOTTLE AND NOT THE 3 OUNCE BOTTLE.  RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,"I purchased this product at my local health foods store.  I have light brown hair and I was attempting to lighten it a little bit, about 2 shades--nothing major. On the box there is a photo showing a medium brown shade going up to a golden blonde, about a 4 shade difference.Well, I used this product as directed and there was absolutely no change in color.  Not only that, but it left my hair feeling brittle and dry.BTW, this product is labeled as organic.  According to the most recent issue of Consumer Reports magazine, there is no such thing as ""organic"" when it comes to beauty products.  Meaning, there are no federal standards whatsoever, and any company can label its beauty product as organic, when, in fact, no organic ingredients are in the product whatsoever."
1,"I have been trying to replace all of my household and personal products with more eco/health friendly products and it's been hard to find a hand soap that has as nice a smell as the one's I'm used to (Bath and Body Works brand). This soap is fantastic! The smell is lovely, the texture is great and now that I have found one that I love, I am terrified that it is going to be discontinued!"
1,"This stuff is awesome if you have dry, coarse, or damaged hair.  This is lush, creamy and lathers up well. This is a wonderful luxury shampoo. You will feel like a queen/star when you wash your hair with this. The smells is fresh and yummy. I love using this stuff except I cannot use this every day as it will weigh my hair down. My hair is fine and straight and has some natural wave in the back. I highly recommend this product and will buy it again."
1,Love this mascara....perfect for casual wear. Unfortunately they must not be making it any more! Glad I was able to find this on Amazon. It was shipped quickly.
0,"I bought this because of all the great reviews in magazines and on t.v., naming this as the best mascara on the market.  I have never been allergic to a cosmetic but this product burned my eyes every time I used it and accidentally got a little bit inside the lid.  The brush is small (some may like that, some may not) and it is not the slightest bit clumpy (excellent) but the reaction I had to it outweighed the positives and I returned it and got my money back."
1,My first tube of retinol was purchased on Amazon and it was made by another company. I was not really experienced with using retinol but that product didn't really impress me. I decided due to financial reasons to change my skin care routine to something more affordable and I chose the Alpha Hydrox line. I'm happy with their line of products and the ResQ is so much better than what I was previously using. I do recommend this product as I have noticed a positive difference in my skin. Its smoother and softer now and I will continue to purchase and use the ResQ creme.
1,This seems to work fine. The rose smell turned me off though because it doesn't seem to smell right with the witch hazel. Witch hazel has it's own distinctive smell so so this combo wasn't the most appealing.
1,"I wanted to be blown away by this concealer, but sadly I wasn't; don't get me wrong this concealer is good, I gave it 3 stars because first and foremost it's real sticky creamy consistency, after I applied it, it kept this wet sticky texture, I like the ones that don't stay wet like and sticky, plus it made me have a few pimples,  if your looking for a concealer that stays kinda damp then you will love this one, because all of us girls like different things, and one thing may work perfect for one of us may not work at all for someone else, ya know!"
1,"It's a little more translucent than I would have hoped, but it is still very pretty. Great for an every day color."
0,I've used the water proof mascara in the pink and green tube 4 ever. this doesn't cover well nor does it stay on.  you can barely see I have anything on.  the only plus is no raccoon eyes and it's gone by bedtime.
1,I like the larger size due to having long hair. The towel does a great job of absorbing the excess water.
1,"it looks like oil on the bottle, but i after you take the makeup off, it absorbs fast in to the skin.  Not oily after 3 minutes"
1,The product came quickly enough so everything was fine in that respect but I just feel it doesn't blend very well. Especially if it mixes with any other product. And the colors are light enough (or probably dark enough) for some people. It's just very mediocre. Not awful and I wouldn't recommend it but somewhere in between.
1,"i like that it doesn't have any fragrance and all those harmful chemicals. though it's those chemicals that make a shampoo super-sudsy, this one suds up enough, unlike other more natural shampoos. it's gentle enough for daily use. though i don't know about other folks' hair habits, i don't even use a conditioner - just shampoo and rinse."
1,"I had a cheapo toiletry bag that had the zipper rip because my wife kept putting her stuff in it, and I was constantly running out of room. So I went looking for a new one. I had it down between this and another one. The other one looked a bit preferable, but it was also 1/3 more expensive. So I went with this one and figured I'd check it out, and if I didn't like it, I could return it and get the other one. It far exceeded my expectations.It's very roomy, has a lined interior and a soft leatherette (I don't think it's real, but it sure feels like it) exterior. The bottom zip compartment is particularly cool. The whole bottom part zips open for its own self-contained area, specifically designed for items that could drip or burst (i.e., those that come in bottles). It has elastic straps that hold tubes (toothpaste, etc.) and comes with its own set of 3 plastic containers that perfectly fit the three main elastic loops. They are just under the allowed airline size, so perfect for travel without worrying about having them confiscated. Tops screw off for shampoo, conditioner, etc, and have the easy-press tabs in the top. Excellent!The top has a stiff, formed lining along the zipper/opening that helps the bag maintain its shape and doesn't smoosh down the contents if stuffed in a bag...very cool. Construction is top notch, materials are excellent. Soft and comfortable but seem very durable. Time will tell, of course, but overall I couldn't be happier with this bag. Seems like a silly thing to write a glowing review about, but it's one of those things that I didn't know I would appreciate so much until I got it.Highly recommended!"
1,it is shimmery and for me i have acne so i feel it makes the acne show more for a high brand i thought it would be nicer
1,"This towel has been amazing. My curly hair looks so great scrunching with this towel. I had another microfiber towel that I tried, but it was a camping microfiber towel, and I guess not the same. I hesitated to try this towel, but the reviews were mostly good, so I ordered. SO glad I did. At first, I tried the ""plopping"" technique described on some curly hair websites, and had terrible results. I tried four times, and my hair just turned out frizzy and flat. On the advice of a posting I saw on a curly hair forum, I tried scrunching with this towel instead, and was so pleased with the results. I have bra strap length long, low porosity, fine to medium high density hair, and as a result, my hair takes forever to dry to the point it can start to smell ""musty"" like old towels, but the fine parts easily frizz if over dried! I used to have to go to work with sopping wet hair that would literally take 6-8 hours to dry. I wanted something to get my hair dryer faster without the friz. This towel delivered. It soaks up so much water, leaving my hair drier without the frizz or flatness. If I throw my hair over my head and scrunch, that it, instead of ""plopping"". My hair still takes a few hours to dry, but it takes 4-5 instead of 8, and no more musty smell. I read some other posts complaining of lost absorpancy after washing. I used to work in a towel store, and can tell you, ANY sort of fabric softener at all, whether liquid in the wash or sheets in the dryer coat the towel and drastically cut down on absorpancy. Once this happens I know of no way to clean it off and restore the absorpancy. Another thing that ruins absorpancy in my experience is oils. I have found olive oil (especially), jojoba and shea butter to all effect the absorpancy of my towels. If washed in really hot water with lots of soap two or three times, I was able to get the jojoba and shea butter out (although the towels were never as absorpant as they had been before), but I was never able to get the olive oil out. So, be careful to rinse thuroughly if using straight oils on your hair."
1,This is an excellent product. I am glad that I found it online. I would recommend Loreal to anyone who cannot find their haircolor in the store.
1,Bought this for Fall and winter very pretty color the name suits it well reminds me of a fresh bright red Apple so pretty on and hasn't chipped with a top coat!
1,"As the designated dishwasher in my household (I suppose that this is because no one has the mental or physical capacity to pour soap on a sponge and rub the dish and rinse it...I guess you can say I'm a bit hostile about that.) my hands go through a lot.  I've used several different lotions, creams, special soaps etc. to help keep my hands from drying out, but they either don't work or the products are too greasy feeling.  Not Udderly Smooth.  Udderly Smooth is perfect for my hands.  The scent is not over powering and a little goes a long way.  Also, it soaks in quickly and does not leave your hands with that gross, greasy feeling.  An extra perk, the price.  The quality of Udderly Smooth is amazing compared to other lotions I've paid $15 for...you just can't beat it! If you have dishpan hands, this is for you!"
1,"Very value priced shampoo, great for thick frizzy hair, good value for the money, would definitely buy again.  Recommended product!"
1,"I love this product.  Just enough color and great moisture.  Doesn't clog pores and at the end of the day still looks good.  I don't have to apply it again into the evening.  Love Aveeno products and especially this one.  Good service, arrived quickly almost as fast as if I went to a brick and mortor store and no waiting in line."
1,My Dermatologist suggested I use this and I really like it. A few days a week I add a pinch of baking soda and use it as a scrub. It makes my skin really smooth and doesn't irritate it at all.
1,"I guess it was my fault, so I gave it four stars. I didnt read correctly and thought this was the blow dryer version. I am not sure if it worked or not cause i never used it, I just returned it."
1,"This perfume is soo atractive. I always get compliments on it!!! It came fast and was packaged perfectly! It's the original scent, wasn't tampered with. This seller is trustworthy, I will buy again!"
0,"This is basically just a thick clear polish. It doesnt strenghten my nails, if anything it made it worse. It just puts a top layer over my peeling nails. Then when the nail polish starts to come off my nails peel with it. If you are looking for a good clear polish this is for you, but if you are strictly trying to fix your cracking/peeling nails, this isnt the best."
1,"I have actually never purchased the Clean and Clear product itself, but I have tried both the Wal-Mart brand and the Target brand of this moisturizer. The Target generic brand is AMAZING, I honestly would give it a 5/5! I have combination skin, so my face is oily in spots and dry in others. I use the product everyday at night, after I wash my face, before bed. I would like to think that the acne medication has the best time to absorb into my skin while I'm sleeping as opposed to wearing it outside in the sunlight, where it would make my face even dryer than normal. In the morning, I use a daytime moisturizer, but that is another review.I ended up buying the Wal-Mart brand because I left my original bottle at my mom's house. The Wal-Mart brand costs less than both the actual product and the Target brand, but is definitely of a lower quality. It's a lot more watered down than the Target version and takes several more applications to finally work. I still use it at night, however.I'm sure the real version of this product works AMAZINGLY WELL since I love the Target version so much. But don't buy the Wal-Mart version of this product."
1,"I love lavendar, rosemary but not a big fan of eucalyptus. Still, the fragrance is soothing and calming. My hubby likes the smell  when I wear it just before going to bed. I guess it puts us to sleep :-).It feels a bit oily when applying. But absorbs super quick and it isn't greasy at all."
1,"I like this serum, it feels good and a little goes a long way. I also love the fact that I can buy it on the subscribe and save option. However, I do not have any idea if it has physically made a difference to my skin!"
1,"I wasn't sure about this polish at 1st. But once I applied it on, with 3 coats you get a solid green.  Looks good."
0,"I've used this product for several years now, but it isn't working very well lately.  The main problem is that there's very few bubbles and I found I was having to use more and more product to get my dishes and pans clean.  The consistency appears to be the same, but it just doesn't clean.  In fact, this is my main complaint with most all of the Mrs. Meyers products I've used.  They smell nice but don't do much beyond that.  I feel like I'm using a product that was devised for a reniassance home - lots of perfume to cover the bad smells, but no cleaning power.  What a let down.Update: Thanks Christopher Davis for the confirmation that the formula was changed by the manufacturer.  It was pretty good prior to the change.  Not so much so now.  I still stand by my review!"
1,"I've been using Aubrey products for about a year now & just recently was able to try the Rosemary/Peppermint GPB conditioner.  This conditioner leaves my hair silky soft & shiny.  The original GPB is a little heavier in my hair, yet this one is very light & does a wonderful job.I've had less breakage, my color stays true much longer & this conditioner is weightless.  My hair has not been this healthy before, not until using Aubrey products & getting all the harsh chemicals out"
1,"Suave Detangler Spray works well on my 5 year old daughter, whose hair is fine, slightly wavy and mats easily.  I normally bathe her at night because it's easier to get going in the morning, but then her head is a mess.  So, I spray this on and use my Remington Detangler (an electric comb especially made for detangling hair) and her hair detangles much more quickly and easily.  It doesn't leave a film on my daughter's hair, so if I fail to wash it the next day, her hair still looks clean.  Build-up can be a problem with some detanglers, but not for Suave.Suave Detangler Spray has a refreshing green apple scent that my daughter loves.  When I spray her hair, it gets on her arm and she makes me smell how good her arm is.  The scent stays in her hair even after it's dry.  I have to admit, I like the scent of her hair when we cuddle."
1,"- Tommy Hilfiger name brand. Some reviewers seem to think certain colognes have been not authentic, but anytime I buy from Amazon directly, shipped from and sold by Amazon, I have always gotten a retail packaged item.- Smells great, fresh, clean, and not overpowering.- Price is a little high for what I like to spend, but this is a good size supply that should last long enough to justify the price.- Overall I'm pleased with the product. Will I buy it again? Maybe. I like to try different colognes and also look at which happen to have  a lower price at the time I need to order, but if the price is right I'll likely try this cologne at least once more.- Amazon delivered quickly w Prime."
1,"I first used a non-Fake Bake exfoliator, and the results were good.  However, I used this the second time around and was much more pleased.  My body felt a lot cleaner, and I think it's a great prep exfoliator for the Fake Bake.  I think the aloe vera is the key ingredient in this. It also smells amazing!  I think it's a great value as well - what I bought before this was about the same price and I personally felt that it was less effective.  I would definitely recommend this if you're about to use Fake Bake."
1,It is quite necessary to have a bottle of thinner if you are a nail polish lover like myself. This works great just add a couple of drops to a polish that has gotten a bit thick or gloopy and its perfect.
1,I'mall about multi-tasking in the shower & this preoduct helps get rid of the dry flaky skin on my legs in the winter...it's a keeper!
1,"This little blue bottle is full of magic.  My first manicure using 'stickey' lasted 8 days before I noticed two tiny chips.  Joanie Rivers was my favorite base coat before I discovered stickey. The gal that gave specific direction for the application of stickey was correct, those direction were true to a tee.  Try to apply your nail polish while stickey is still drying, it adheres to the nail polish more effectively.  Good luck all."
1,"Although I am fast approaching fifty, my skin seems to behave like an unruly teenager's. When I am under stress and/or experience a lack of sleep, my adult acne flares up and is a misery to me. I had my Strivectin SD confiscated at the airport a few weeks ago (Note to self: Put some in a smaller container next time, doofus) and went without it for awhile. When I was finally able to buy a replacement tube this past week, I immediately applied it 3X/day. The acne cleared up within 24 hours and the eye lines disappeared. It seemed to help with my dark circles as well. I am very satisfied with this product and will definitely use it on a continuous basis."
0,"This mascara may work well for others but it did absolutely nothing for my eyelashes. Didn't add any length or volume, just weighed my lashes down."
1,Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Night Firming Treatment is ok. Not quite the moisturizer I needed - it felt good going on but didn't stay.
1,"I dont care who you are, waking up with an unsightly blemish can ruin your day. There are so many products on the market that are supposed to help get rid of zits that zapzyt was just another one on the list for me to tackle and wait for results. without needing to go into nitty gritty details Ill break down the pros and cons of this particular treatment:pros:1) If you use this product on a daily basis you will notice a decrease in oil in areas that you have problems with. When Im feeling particularly hormonal I will place a small amount in my daily lotion and rub all over my face to help control the oil and bacteria that my skin is coming in contact with,2) It is very inexpensive. for someone like myself that does not suffer from acne all the time and just has an occasional pimple here or there the size and price are just right3)many acne medications are too harsh, using acid bases to dry up your blemish, which in turn ALWAYS drys out my face. this product is basically an aspirin substance and I dont wake up with dry patches.4) there are no miracle creams that make your pimples fall off, and preventative steps are always the most helpful in controlling breakouts. I tested this on a pimple that was fairly deep and painful on my jawline and it reduced the swelling and redness and the next day it was basically gone.cons:1) I noticed that after I had rubbed some in, and I was in public, that I had a white outline where it had dried. luckily this was not that noticeable but non the less embarassing when i realized I had gone half my day with weird white chalky stuff on my face nicely highlighting my pimple.2) This is not available everywhere and I have only seen it sold on Amazon.this is a solid 4 out of 5 star product!"
1,Love this color its so beautiful!!! Great summer color def recommend it!!!! Love love love!!!!'deff should try it. You won't be disappointed!!
1,"Recently, while traveling, I ran out of my usual high-end facial moisturizer. I didn't panic, (LOL)! I had heard from friends that Olay's Regenerist Collection includes excellent products for face and body. One friend in particular mentioned that she was using Olay Total Effects 7-in-One Anti-Aging Daily Moisturizer. So, I went into a nearby drugstore and bought a bottle. I have used it for a few weeks now as I wanted to finish the pump bottle lotion/cream before returning to my usual moisturizer. Then I realized that because I really like the effects Olay is having on my skin, why spend a small fortune on face care when the much less expensive Olay line works so well? I am in my 60's and this is a perfect lotion/cream for aging skin...or at least for my aging skin.This is not a heavy moisturizer but sinks into my skin right away, leaving a smooth soft feel. Olay Total Effects 7-in-One Anti-Aging Daily Moisturizer. minimizes the appearance of pores and provides a free radical defense which helps prevent damage to the skin's surface. It is dermatologically tested, non-comedogenic (won't clog pores), and is oil-freeThe pump packaging is a real plus as it helps keep the product sanitary and reduces exposure to the air which can deteriorate some ingredients rendering them less effective.Ingredients include: Nicinamide (Vitamin B3), Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E),  (Vitamin E), Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract and Zinc Oxide. This formula includes some excellent anti-oxidants.If you are curious, (as I was), about this skin care product, or the others in the  Regenerist Collection, try this or another, like Olay&#8217;s Pro-X Deep Wrinkle Treatment...also excellent."
1,"I just started using this product a few weeks ago. I am a big QH product lover and have been experimenting alot with new makeup, skincare etc in the past month.I wanted something that would 'dissolve' crap in my pores(if that makes sense).This mask is goopy, and it smells pretty strong, but you can feel it working. It almost is like a enzyme cleaner. I feel like its soaking deep and getting the job done.It minimizes pores and makes your skin ultra smooth after using it."
1,"I have no complaints about the service or quality. I've had it about 2 weeks, and used it twice. I love these."
1,"When the weather is cold, or you don't have time, this shampoo will quickly get your hair clean. Perhaps not as clean as the standard hair wash, but clean enough to wear to work or head to the store while still looking good.Recommend."
1,This cleanser does a great job and leaves my skin clean and feeling smooth. I have very sensitive skin and have not used a cleanser that is more gentle. It is also a great value!
1,"Applying this product to my face was quite easy and I could tell immediately that my face was finely toned. Considering the price and product quality, I would definately buy again!"
1,"I have used several Crabtree and Evelyn hand creams and this is probably my least favorite because of the scent. As a moisturizer it works great, especially around the nails and fingertips where my hands get dry and crack. The hand therapy goes on very smooth and non greasy but the scent is very strong and spicy, it reminds me of a man's cologne or aftershave."
1,"I installed this thing about a week ago. Overall, very positive. I have a variety of liquids in it, and two are actually very thick. I had no problem priming the thing and getting it going, so even the thick stuff pumps out smoothly, without any issues. As far as mounting goes, the silicon they provided was hardened and fairly useless, only got a little bit out. Luckily, I had a tube of rubber adhesive (similar to the silicon, but a bit thinner), which worked fine to attach the plastic base of the unit to the uneven ceramic tile of my shower wall. It is on there solid, and not going anywhere. I have used the silicon type adhesive with another product (aDeluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall. 20% Larger Than Our #1 Selling Original Mirror.I ordered here on amazon) and it works equally well. Of course they have not been time-tested, but this method is a heck of a lot better then suction cups. In terms of getting the things off when/if the time comes, I can't help ya there, but others in these reviews have mentioned product that can clean off the adhesive residue from tile. If I have to take these down at some point, it will probably be just to replace them. I am not renting, so I don't have to worry about that.I was pleasantly surprised to find the claims about saving soap/shampoo to be very true. I use a lot less with this dispenser then when squirting directly from the bottle. A few pumps get you going, then an occasional pump to keep the lather going. It's much easier to control, because less comes out with each pump of the dispenser, but I want to emphasize, it is in NO WAY inconvenient or difficult to get enough soap out with quickly with a few pumps-- faster then messing with the bottles themselves or with bar soap for that matter.I got the white plastic, which I am sure will discolor over time, as does almost all white plastic-- but that is just a guess, and I don't really care.I give it 4 our of 5 because of the silicon issue (and if I didn't have any lying around the house, and had to order some more and wait on it, I might have been irritated enough to bump another star-- but that would be unfortunate, because it really is a great product, even if you need to order your own adhesive).Conclusion: highly recommend, no reservations!"
1,"My favorite cosmetics for colors are Nars, Mac and Chanel and I'm a cosmetics junkie who's always playing around with new colors.  Not so blush.  I stumbled onto Nars Orgasm several years ago and, lo and behold, it's perfect for this peaches and cream natural redhead.  I like to buy it in the dual compact with the highlighter as well.  Super Orgasm is a little too glittery for my taste though.  The only drawback?  It's delicate and tends to crumble towards the end (you can use a brush and some alcohol to put it back together)."
1,"I have sensitive skin and combination at that. I used to spend much more money on the kinerase moisturizer. But I decided to try other brands so save some money. After several attempts on different brands. I found this gem! Diamond in the rough! It lasts me a long time and I have no reaction to it. I only hope they don't discontinue it any time soon because I really don't want to find another one and chances are, it will be much more expensive. At this price you should definitely try this."
1,This is a nice brush for the price and helps me get a &#34;bit of curl&#34; into the ends of my hopelessly straight ends.  Doesn't tangle in my long hair.
1,I have been using this product for almost a year now and as with all Eucerin products it is the best. There are products on the market that are selling for 5 times what this cost and this is every bit as good. I'm 70 years old and look 10 to 20 years younger. This product makes my facial skin soft and moist looking. The first few times I applied it I could feel my skin tightening particularly around the eyes. I use about a jar a month as I apply it morning and evening.
0,Color is okay. It made my hair a medium brown shade and it did seem to have highlights as advertised. It really dried my hair out and damaged it. It has a strong chemical scent and my hair was shedding out twice as much as it usually does after I used this dye.
1,"My lips have needed some extra care lately and I'm not a fan of waxy lip balms, so I gave the Yu-Be Moisturizing Skin Cream a chance to work some magic on my dry lips.I put a little bit of the magic yellow cream on my lips at night and wake up to lips that stay soft all day.The cream goes on with a pretty strong camphor smell.  At first I didn't like it much, but I've become used to it.  I wouldn't say that it dissipates quickly...it takes 5-10 minutes.Unfortunately for me, my daughter has also discovered Yu-Be and she often steals my tube for her own use.  Her lips get very dry (to the point of cracking), so if she's stealing my Yu-Be Skin Cream it must be really good!I guess I'll just have to buy another tube..."
1,i bought this polish because i was looking for a green polish and this one is wonderful and exactly what i was looking for. this is a very beautiful color and one i don't regret buying. this polish is between a jade and an emerald green and is a great color for Christmas and winter. would recommend if you like green. this is also a great quality brand. it seems to stay on better than other brands.
1,"This is an excellent astringent, I had my doubts with products touting  ""oil eliminating"", ""oil free"" as they never seemed to work. This product does exactly what it's supposed to. The smell is similar to theNeutrogena Clear Pore Scruband it does not burn like some astringents do. I follow this with theNeutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer, SPF 30in the morning. I consider this product my ""holy grail"" in my skin care regimen. I kills the bacteria without killing my skin cells. It's an excellent product."
1,This product really does work. I use it in conjunction with the Frownies Rose Hydrator. I noticed that the frown lines between my eyes are not as deep in the morning.
1,"I have been dyeing my hair since I was 21 (didn't want to see even one gray hair)so I consider myself a well-seasoned consumer of hair dyes.  I have also had my hair done in NY and LA at top salons for a lot of money, so I consider this product among all those experiences and it comes out near the top.There are three products like this that I have used, Naturcolor, Herbaceuticals and this one, NaturTint.  All of them are available at other sources and the local organic market but not at this attractive price.  So, from an economics point of view, this is a bargain.But also from a hair care perspective, NaturTint excels.  It smells pleasant and that is paramount to me.  I cannot use any Clairol or Feria or Garnier products because they are so acrid and I have a sensitive olfactory.  I like the fact that this product is natural and free of the typical carcinogens and immune compromising chemicals that are found in many of the cheaper, more commercial products of this type.The colorways are great and can be mixed and matched.  I use 3N and top it with a dark blonde so I have a few highlights where my hair is gray.Like most of these products, it is slightly thick and can drip. Like other reviewers, I place a large old towel on the rug in my bathroom, to protect it and I wear a black cotton shirt while working with the product.  I use a colorist's bowl and tools that I picked up cheaply at the local beauty supply shop.  I use a foam 'brush' and a wide tooth comb and dab the mixture onto my hair in thick rows, then comb it through as needed.  I only comb to the ends as I finish, so the most potent chemical action will spare them.  I leave it on 30 minutes.When I wash it out, I only use the cream rinse that comes with the package - not the shampoo.  I make sure there is a thorough rinsing under a brisk stream of cool water and that is all I need.  I then gently comb through my hair while it is very damp and put on an anti-frizz that I like from John Frieda.  Since I am a pharmaceuticals writer, I learned long ago that hair is most fragile when wet - so I handle it very gently until it is mostly dry, then I invert my head (I have shoulder-length hair) and blow it dry quickly.  I style it later, just before I leave the house.The result is shiny, manageable, natural-looking and healthy hair, considering it is treated.  I do this every 6 to 8 weeks and that works well for me, as I no longer wash my hair every day (as we age, our hair becomes dryer, thinner and more brittle, reducing shampoos will slow that process and keep hair strong enough to reduce breakage, in my experience).  I use boar bristle round brushes and a non-laurel sulfate shampoo for colored hair.I honestly think, if I had continued using even my old favorite L'Oreal Natural Match my hair would eventually have aged more quickly than it does with this product.  I started using NaturTint in the '90's and am happy it is still around.  I also think the quality of the natural colors leaves me with a softer, more natural looking brunette."
0,"I have to rate the product according to my experience. I ended up being allergic to the main ingredient in this product. It was way too strong for my skin and I quickly began to start scratching for no apparent reason to me and having weird burning sensations, etc. on my face. I would recommend that you make sure your skin can handle this ingredient before purchasing this product."
1,"Love love love this! Oil whipped up into a super lightweight and instantly absorbed souffle! Softens, moisturizes, leaves no greasy or waxy feel - melts into the skin like buttah LOL. Pleasant subtle fragrance. Friendly to sensitve skin."
1,I love the brand and this product in particular. The smell is very pleasant and not overwhelming like some other brands. It works very well on the sensitive skin - leaves it nice and fresh.
1,"I have used Coty for years.  Love the texture, coverage and smell.  It goes on evenly and helps keep my make up fresh looking all day long."
1,I literally received this lipstick a few hours ago and I'm absolutely in love with it because it looks so natural and cute!! I makes my lips look softer and bigger and I love it. Can't. Stop. Putting. It. On!
1,Great color to have and OPI  brand speaks for it's self! If your looking to add a little pink in your life then this color is for you. It was worth every penny and came sooner than expected.
0,I don't think this brush gets as hot as it should with all the different settings it had. I cranked it up and it does not get hot enough to style my naturally wavy hair. I will be donating to someone with hair that requires less heat to style.
0,I honestly don't know how this thing even got on the market. Unless you have super short/thin hair I don't see how this will do anything to your hair. It has almost no power and awkward to use. There use to be one a long time ago that rotated by itself. THat would work better. This one is no bueno.
1,"This oil is simple to use, but very much effective.  It really does wonders with the likes of mucsles and joints. Plus it goes well with the likes ofHeritage Store Castor Oil, 32 Ouncewhich I found to be a surprise. I think this is a great item to have, or at least try out. It really is a fantastic oil."
1,"I am really loving this night-time treatment. I've been using it for about a month. My skin is softer, smoother and at night it's being hydrated and rejunanated! I like it because it doesn't feel greasy, hasn't caused a single break out and I'm noticing an overall difference in my skin tone. More even, smaller pores, and helps with dryness. I'll continue using it and more than likely buy it again!"
1,"This oil has made such a difference in my ability to wear my hearing aids. It does really make the itching go away. I know some folks think it's overpriced, but you only need a very small amount. I don't even have to use it every day, so at this rate, it should last a year or two. Certainly my comfort is worth that."
1,"Highly recommended per research organizations.  I like that it's a light feel, and knowing that it has SPF of 50 keeps my fair skin from burning."
1,"I like tea tree for its many benefits.  I just don't want to be overwhelmed by it.  This is some really strongly scented lotion.  It feels nice and seems to work well, but I find the very strong scent a bit off-putting.  I will look for another variety from Nature's Gate."
1,They have several colors and cost less than other brands. It doesn't dry out and cake and the brush is a perfect size and draws a thin or thick line. I love Prestige products.
1,This has been my go-to color for many years now. You can wear it during any season and it looks great! Product goes on smoothly and dries quickly.
0,THIS ITEM DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR MY HAIR.  I WISH I HAD NEVER BOUGHT IT.  I WILL CONTINUE MY SEARCH FOR A BETTER ONE.
1,"I recently started breaking out on my cheeks and jawline which was never a problem area when I was in my teens. This works if you use it just like the directions say: on clean skin, once a day initially then increase to several times daily. On day two I use it like every 2 hours.It makes the pimple or, in my case, underground monster, less visible and less irritating. It gets rid of any pain or soreness that makes me want to pick and pop. After day two it completely disappears.Honestly, the best thing about this product is that it makes me keep my hands OFF my face which is likely why I break out in the first place. Oh, and I started changing my pillow case every night."
1,This brush worked well when I got it but after not too long the little balls at the end of the bristles started coming off leaving sharp bristles that hurt your scalp.  Definitely not made to last.
1,Tried it for the first time.  My skin feels so soft after. I used to use aveeno which is also good but the bar melts too fast.  I also use emu oil after the face wash.Soap suds up nicely but a creamy foam appears.It last long too.  I use it nitely and still the bar has plenty left.You will love it!
1,"OK, I heard this is good for dry skin, I have tried it on certain places on my face that is very dry due to treatment for sun damage. It does soften the skin but it kind of hard to blend it in without pulling the skin more than I like to. Mixing it with an almond oil helps liquify it. It's OK"
1,I purchase this product to make my face and body lotions with. Melds great with other ingredients! Wonderful product! Definitely will purchase again - and again!
1,Love that is not completely white... you still get the white finish but this one is more soft finish. sometimes i use 2 layers of this one and sometimes i use a layer of this one and one of OPI don't touch my tutu and looks cute too!
1,"Like all women have, I've tried the expensive name brand age-defying creams, cleansers, lotions, etc., but NONE of them have produce any results except the Olay Regenerist line.  I wear this Enhancing Lotion with UV protection every day under my makeup, and alone when I don't wear makeup.  It's great for any kind of skin, and especially sensitive or for people with allergies like myself.  The wrinkles are less noticeable, and that's something that I could NOT say about the Estee Lauder and Clinique lines that I used for so long; I got tired of paying so much money for NO results!Ladies, once you start using this line of Olay's, you will never go back to the department stores."
1,This is great wheat germ oil. I have put it in my hair and wow...this is a really rich oil. I primarily bought it as a supplement. It has a really pungent taste so mixing it greek yoghurt makes it taste much better to me.
1,All of the Miracle of Aloe products that I have tried are beyond amazing. This hand cream is lovely & very moisturizing. I use it every night before bed and that is  all I need to keep my hands soft & supple. I am a frequent hand washer during the day and this cream keeps them soft still and only using it once nightly.
1,I ordered this brush b/c of it's claim to reduce static.  Unfortunately I still have the same amount of static with this brush as before.  It is well made and doesn't seem to snag my hair as much.  A great product for the price.
1,"This product is an excellent source of texture refinement, sunscreen and moisture.  I actually prefer a stronger SPF, so I use the regular Regenerist Regenerating Serum and add a stronger sunscreen."
1,It's hard to find a reasonably priced makeup remover that is not oily and does a good job.  This one does it all and is gently on the eyes.  I use it everyday and like the fact that it doesn't leave that oily residue on my eyelids.
1,"Essie has been my favorite brand for a few months now because the polishes last so long without chipping and make your nails very durable while they're painted. Until recently I had only used more unique colors (blues, greens, purples) but I really wanted to get a neutral that is more versatile, so I picked up Sugar Daddy.It was much softer than I expected, and 2 coats wasn't very opaque. The color is definitely there and it covers evenly, it was just that I could still see where my nail separated from my finger which I don't personally like. I ended up using it as the base for a French manicure and it's stunning - the perfect color.If you're looking for a soft opaque pink then you may want to try another - because even after 4 coats you can still see through to where the nail lifts from the finger."
1,love this stuff.  read this is the minimum % that should be used for beginning.  have used.  stings a little.  use about 3 times a week.  love it.  prepping skin for my first 35% glycolic peel.  will purchase from seller again.
1,"The cleanser makes my face feel really clean after I use it and helps get rid of the oil and dirt in my pores.  I haven't been using it long enough to see if it really reduces the size of my pores, but I trust Neutrogena products, so I'm hoping this particular Neutrogena product will live up to its name."
1,"I've been using Obagi for almost 3 years now.  My skin feels refreshed after cleansing and the product balances the ph levels back to normal range. It doesn't not irritate my sensitive skin at all.  It's very gentle and soothing.  I have oily skin, thick skin with monthly blemish breakouts as an adult.  This product is great for sensitive skin.  This is a ""splurge"" must have item for me.Update Feb. 13, 2013:I stopped using the Obagi line simply because it didn't work for me after years of using it.  Our skin's needs changes with time, stress level, hormonal changes, etc. and I needed to find a different product that would control my oily adult acne skin.  A woman from Ulta stores recommended the Exuviance oily-acne skincare line that I just began using 4 days ago.  Only time will tell how this new product will affect my skin.  So far, so good.  Great mild scent and gentle on the skin."
0,"Contains denatured alcohol and made my hair lose moisture, there fore the 4c hair wouldn't clump to full potential. Also flaky. After switching to kccc i have no problem getting root to tip definition in my max hydrated  4c hair for the first time. See pictures at bottom of page link.forum(dot)blackhairmedia(dot)com/the-max-hydration-methodfrom-my-other-post_topic368937_page8(dot)html"
1,"I recently bought two gorgeous colors of Revlon lipstick: Fabulous Fig and Highbeam Tan. I was pleased to discover that the Fabulous Fig rates surprisingly safe on the EWG Skindeep site, but the Highbeam Tan has a poor score and is full of parabens and other junk. It's too bad, because Highbeam Tan is such a fantastic color. I wish companies like Revlon would clean up the ingredients in their products. It isn't that hard, or that expensive, to make lipstick that contains safer ingredients. The Fabulous Fig vs. the Highbeam Tan is a perfect example of this."
1,"I tried these because I have the start of a wrinkle around the corner of my mouth, I have used them for several months and have not noticed any improvement, the wrinkle is not getting in worse though, that may be something due to the patches.  But I don't think I will be purchasing any more of these."
1,I love these products. I have tried many different product lines and this is the best is you want an even skin tone. I recommend this line for people with problem skin.
1,"This is one of those products that I just can't do without! It smells so heavenly that I don't mind doing dishes.  It smells of roses and geraniums. I am extremely sensitive to scents as I have allergies but although this scent is 'obvious' (I dont want to say anything too strong to deter someone from trying it) I have absolutely no problems with it - as does the rest of my family.  My 5yr old also has allergies and when I clean the counters with this scent, he'll 'sniff' the table :-) and sigh.As an added bonus, it cuts grease wonderfully but the BIGGEST benefit in my opinion is that it MUST have that special vegetable ingredient like in her Counter Top Spray that cuts odors (try cooking something stinky in your microwave or spilling tuna water from the can on your counter...use her Geranium Counter spray, wipe it down and sniff it out...nothing but heavenly geraniums to please your sniffer.)  I SWEAR, I have an extremely sensitive sniffer and can't keep 'smelly' items in my garbage can in the kitchen even for a little bit, I have to take them to the outside trash (tuna cans, overly ripe veggies, etc).  With one teeny drop in a tuna can, swirled around with some water - no scrubbing on my part, it cuts the odor so well that I can toss it in the trash and not think of it again. I can wash a cookie sheet of fish sticks with no odor and so many others.  Did I say that I can't be without this product?? :-)I just wish that Amazon sold a package of her various products or in single bottles...I can't very well keep 30 bottles of several of her items in my home...that would be insane."
1,Great curling brush iron - the best quality one I've ever used. I have tried several brands over the years because I really  like these as a styling tool. This is by far the best quality one around. I have several sizes for different parts of my hair and to use for different looks.
1,"I started using Alpha Hydrox lotion I estimate at more than 20 years ago. I first purchased it at a Longs drug store, because I could see light brown spots coming on one side of my neck, I was in my mid 40's and the little brown area was on the right side of my neck, I do not get in the sun  much so I assumed it came through the car window while I rode in the passenger side.  I knew from research that AHA's that had at least 10% Glycolic acid in them were supposed to even out your skin. I have always had great skin, never before had a dark spot or blemish. So I purchased this and used it after washing my face and appying Witch Hazel, (which I believe is the best thing you can put on your skin). I put a small amount of this AHA lotion all over my face and neck. I could not believe it, after only a few weeks using morning and night  the light brown spots were gone!  Since then I have never been without it, and although I am now  many years from that first bottle. I still have great skin, no spots and the only wrinkle I have is a line between my eyes, most people get two of them I have one!  But I attribute my great skin to good care and good genes but most of all to this Alpha Hydrox lotion.  It sometimes stings a bit after I have exfoliated my skin, but I have never had a bad reaction to it.  I get many compliments on my skin and I do not wear any makeup. I do use Ponds cold cream too. The old tried and true stuff is sometimes better than the newer things on the market. You can't go wrong with this stuff. I only use a two pea sized drops, so it lasts a long time.  I have recommended it to all the people who compliment me on my beautiful skin. I recommend it to all who read reviews too."
1,My only complaint with this face powder is that the powder puff thing that comes with it ALWAYS starts falling apart long before the powder is running out.  I've purchased this close to a dozen times and the cheap powder applicator never fails to fall apart on me...  Love this powder though - it's great for a matte finish over foundation and not too heavy.
1,"Easy to use and care for product that gently exfoliates. Use as a 'hand' brush or add the handle for a quick reach for your back. Mature, sensitive skin can be a concern when looking for skin care products and this brush offers stimulation without irritation. A great choice for me!"
1,"this thing is really effective. not the usual nizoral (look and smell) that i was using in my country (philippines) but it actually works so fast. since it's meant to address dandruff, it doesn't do anything with dry hair so make sure to have a nice conditioner after using this haha."
1,Goes on smoothly and makes my face feel like silk.  No strong odor.  Not sticky like some.  I will definitely re-order this product.
1,"I am unable to use harsh cleansers with a lot of chemicals, since they make me break out. These bars are basic cleansers that do the job and I don't break out with them. I don't think I will buy them again though because they are a little too drying."
1,I order this product for my husband. Before we got married he wouldn't bother to put anything on his face! Once he started seeing me use all my lotions and potions he asked for my recommendation. He has combination skin and since neutrogena is very hypoallegenic and I got this cream for him. He's been using it regularly for about a year now and loves  it!
0,"i purchased this foundation is maceys a while ago and was amazing thought i was saving money but same color /nc35 does match at all like the store one I bought also is light physically if that matters ,,?"
1,Really unique color teal that I get loads of compliments on. Really love O.P.I. nail colors. Delivered on time andnaan all year round color.
1,"Bought this for my mother while Amazon was offering coupons on different Olay products, and I'm glad I did. I was looking for a good daily moisturizer with some SPF protection for her mature skin, and this was the right balance of price and quality. I will repurchase when she runs out."
1,"this lotion is great, smells great too, um its not too oily and its almost as if it were a cream type lotion. i like the smell plus the fact that the ingredients are stellar"
0,"As an RN, I wash my hands constantly, to the point of extreme dryness.  In fact, by the end of the shift, our computer often can no longer read my fingerprints, when I try to access controlled items, because my hands are so dry.  And, while on duty, we are NOT permitted to use hand lotion, because it interferes with proper hand washing. So, my hands are screaming for care by the time I get home; definitely presenting a special challenge. So, keep in mind, this product may work splendidly for those who have not abused their hands to such an extreme.I have been a long-term fan of Kiehl's Ultimate Strength Hand Salve. It has been the only thing to keep my hand's hydrated, with a healthy appearance.  However, my curiosity was piqued when I saw the great reviews for the Miracle Hand Repair Cream.  Kiehl's is terribly expensive, while the MHRC provides a lot of product, for a reasonable price.The verdict: back to the Kiehl's for me. I found the hydrating properties of the Miracle Cream to be average, at best, although it does absorb well and is not greasy.  Oddly, after a few days of use, though, my hands actually felt a little dryer. I also could not tolerate the smell of the cream.  It has a strong 'baby-powderish' scent, that smells so institutional---think hospital, or convalescent center, or that nasty powder odor inside the hospital latex gloves (if you happen to be familiar), that you can't even wash off. It just makes me think 'hospital' when I'm not there, which isn't a good thing, for me.  This again, may not bother others without such an association. I definitely won't be using this on my hands again.  I'll probably just delegate the product to my feet, if at all."
1,I just finished my second month. I think I feel a difference so far. Possibly a little more thicker. I sit it on my bathroom sink so it reminds me to put it on. So far ive done good and havent missed a day (twice a day applications)I give it 3 stars because I did notice that it makes me break out around the hairline. I normally dont break out at all so this was unusual for me. Im going to continue using it twice daily for the rest of the 3 months. I will update once the 3 months are up.
1,I've used this product for many years. A friend who had combination skin told about it and I've used it ever since. I have combination/oily skin and this product doesn't make me breakout. I only have to use it in the morning before I apply my pressed powder. This 4 oz bottle lasts me for months and I love the price. I've used very expensive moisturizers in the past and never had the success as I've had with this one.
1,"This cream definitely has a funky smell despite the added vanilla (think like cumin or curry), but after the product soaks in and dries, the smell goes away, so don't let it deter you!Great moisturizing, feels wonderful, and is a great face moisturizer. It did NOT make me break out and even helped clear up my hormonal blemishes IMMEDIATELY. I just hope it continues to work as well the longer I use it.I found this product at a health food store, and was kind of pricey, but a little goes a long way. Much better price than department store products and most importantly, it's all-natural. No weird ingredients you can't pronounce."
1,"This has got to be my most favorite moisturizer, hands down.  It's light weight and doesn't feel greasy at all.  My boyfriend will even use it.  Just the right amount of SPF as well."
1,basics is a great product I loved because I have found is that from now on I will have more beautiful skin than I had and I have a few days using it and the change is remarkable zero fat and pimples
0,"1. I have been using this color (74 deep copper) for a while. I still like it but the shade is different everytime. Sometimes more towards strawberry blonde, sometimes more copper, sometimes more red hues...2. It  fades away very fast. Faster than other red tones I've used.Even if I am lucky enough to get the color advertised on the packaging, it lasts only for a day or two. After about 10 days the hair looses all the luster."
1,"I bought an Inis addle brush that I absolutely adore, I hae one in my purse and in my house.  The Inis brush is strictly boar bristle and made in France.  I needed a round brush though and they don't make one.  I tried several varieties and recently went to the beauty college and they suggested I give this brush a try.  I have hair just past my shoulders, it is medium fine, with waves.  My hair breaks easily and I try to take the best possible care of it that I can.  This brush is awesome for smoothing it out or even if I want to add a little flip to the end.  Very satisfied.  Highly recommend.  Hair is smooth and shiny and lovely."
0,"Smells delightful, but this made my skin break out terribly. It has wheat derived ingredients, which causes skin irritation for a lot of people. I returned the product for a refund.. Oh well! Done with you, Burt."
1,"I live in the high and dry southwest area and have dry skin.  I couldn't survive here without Vanicream.  I've tried many types of moisturizers and creams and came across Vanicream by chance here on Amazon.  After reading some very good reviews on this cream, I decided to give it a try and the Vanicream Cleansing bar as well.  At first use, it felt heavy; however, after about an hour I noticed that it didn't feel as heavy and that my skin felt really good.Now, I liked creams that smelled good and tried hard to convince myself the results were imaginary since the Vanicream products have absolutely no fragrance. After I began using the skin cleanser and the cream as part of my regular routine on both my face and body, I noticed that my normally dry facial skin had improved.  Usually, I'd get little bumps from face cream products most likely from clogged pores.  My face was free of any little bumps and felt really smooth and soft. I kept using the cream and skin cleanser, and after a couple of weeks, my skin felt wonderful!I'm very impressed with these Vanicream products and have made them a permanent item on my shopping lists.  I also love the fact that I only need one skin cream for my body and face!  I definitely recommend the products to family and friends.Vanicream Moisturizing Skin Cream with Pump Dispenser, 16 Ounces"
1,"I ordered these for my kids- bye bye baby shampoo & start usng big boy shampoo. And I went with coconut because I've heard that helps keep lice off hair..not sure, but why not try that scent, because it goes away after the shower."
1,"under the same brand name. or at least sell it.  I remember that one REALLY took off all dead skin.  This one is not as powerful, even though I wish it was!!!  It still works, just not as well as it did 20 years ago...that being said, what does??"
0,Its the same thing as getting a cleanser in a drugstore. Only cheaper. This bottle is expensive and just like any other cleanser.
1,"I have been using the Buf-Puf facial sponge since the 1980's. The teardrop shape is ideal for lightly exfoliating around the eyelids/nose area. The narrow end is much easier to manipulate than theBuf-Puf Double-Sided Body Sponge, which, of course, is a great BODY SPONGE!SEE MY PHOTOS IN CUSTOMER IMAGESOf course I am paying more for these sponges, but they do not soften as quickly as the bargain brands."
0,I can't remember but I think this mirror broke the second week I had it. The plastic around the mirror is weak and cheap. Look somewhere else.
1,"So I love this product, but I have one complaint. Everything falls off the top rack onto my head. We used a level, and we know this is even, but this still happens. Love the mirror, and now I can't live without the shower mirror. I loved using this to clean up the shower."
1,"I havent used this product for long but I know rose water is good for skin.This product has rose water and aloe which makes it perfect.I gives a fresh feel for skin after cleansing, removes dirt too.It is alcohol free and so best for skin."
1,This is my favorite color EVER! It's the perfect mix of pink and red and it's become my go to color that I use all of the time. I definitely recommend this nail polish color to everyone.
1,"I've been using this product for a little over a week now and I've got to say, I am extremely impressed. I'm in the midst of starting a new skincare regimen (let's just say that Gunthy Renther's ""X-Out"" did far more harm than good), and so I was looking for something to soothe my skin and help clear up a nasty breakout. This product has done that and so much more. When I first started using this mask, I had 4 huge pimples and inflamed skin due to a bad reaction to the aforementioned X-Out. After the first use, this mask got rid of the inflammation and within the next two days all my pimples had dried out!I've just been using regular bar soap and this product until I can figure out a new cleanser to try, and my skin is once again clear and soft. This is a fantastic product, and a total aside from its effectiveness: it's a lot of fun to use, it just peels right off after it dries. Way fun!Th label says use once or twice a week for optimal results - but I've taken to using it as a spot treatment in addition to that."
0,Someone please tell me this product is alcohol free? It smells like alcohol and I'm not sure I should put it on my face. I do not see positive results yet either.
1,"This product has a visible effect on my hair, making it softer and giving it more volume. My hair is curly, so sometimes it actually makes it too light and fluffy the first day I use it, but I feel like its a great thing to use once a week, because it settles down after the first day.There aren't many products (other than finishing products) that have this noticeable of an effect on my hair, so I'd say it's pretty amazing stuff!"
1,"This is a great glue, I like that it is clear so you don't necessarily have to wear liner. What can I say everyone uses this glue and it is highly recommended by a lot of make up artists."
1,I keep reordering this soap every time I run low on it!  I love it!  It clean very well and smells out of this world! A+
1,This is a gorgeous pink! It's like a barbie doll pink. It isn't as pale as the picture depicts. It's a lot pinker than that. I usually apply two coats and it stays on for like a week and this is without a base or a top coat. This color gives a beautiful shine once dry...  This color just makes me feel very girly and high maintenance! I love it!
1,"I tend to be a skeptical person and was very doubtful these would work. I'm in  my early 40's and am starting to develop some small vertical lines between my eyebrows, and then I have a horizontal wrinkle on the upper part of one side of my forehead, about an inch long.I've been using the Frownies now for a couple of weeks and they have really worked. The horizontal wrinkle has smoothed out quite a bit and the area between my eyebrows is very smooth now. I am very pleased with the results. I have worn them every night.I am allergic to botox, so I couldn't even get any more of it if I wanted to.This is an inexpensive way to decrease current wrinkles, and more importantly, prevent future wrinkles from forming.I will be a repeat customer for sure."
1,"I've been using this product for a week and it is awesome.  Using just enough to coat my face and neck, I started noticing a difference in my skin after day three and it just seems to keep getting better and better.  I had problems with fine lines, dull and bumpy skin to the touch.  However now my skin is mosturized, glowing and smooth.  I'm a real 34 year old woman who's tried many products for slightly problemed skin.  This product is a keeper!"
1,Olay Regenerist deep hydration regenerating cream facial moisturizer really works great on my skin. I would recommend it. Thank you.
1,I will admit I didn't realize I was buying a &#34;skinny&#34; mascara... But once I started using it I was pretty happy. I find it easier to use than the standard size handle. Only downside is that I think this is going to run soon out due to the small size of the packaging.
0,"This has a sweaty, heavy feeling on the skin and felt like I was smearing vaseline on it. Don't even think about using it on your face. My face was sticky, shiny and almost felt like it couldn't breathe. If you enjoy smearing vaseline on your hands then you may enjoy this lotion."
1,"The facts are:With Badger Balm, product ingredients vary, even though most of their products are created with the intention of offering skin moisture,healing and protection.Depending on what Badger Balm item you choose- you may find it to meet CRUELTY FREE standards- and then, maybe not.While  this Healing Balm is wonderful( as are many of their products), if you are concerned about the use of beeswax(which many people actually do have a concern over)- you may want to pass on certain products made by them or the company itself.This is an individual decision. Review the ingredients.I feel confident, that if the company excluded beeswax from their list of ingredients- the performance of their products would not suffer from the  lack of it.Since I have not purchased and tested all their merchandise I can't offer you as much info as I would like."
1,My skin is oily and this didn't seem to work for me. I found the cleanser to be a  bit too thick for me. Could have done with some more granules in it.
1,"I use these gloves to protect my hands from the sun during driving.  I am 53 years old and my hands and arms are just starting to get brown age spots from the sun.  In an effort to try not to look so old, I wear these little gloves while driving.  So far they protect my  hands well."
1,"I am super sensitive, especially in the winter and my doctor recommended this. It has worked wonders for my skin. I wish it smelled a little better but the smell is not a deal breaker."
1,"Although I don't use mascara much anymore, I know that this works best for me when I do use it.  It always has been a well-known and reliable product."
1,"I have fibromyalgia so I am very sensitive to all these kinds of products.My mother recommended this to me and I have been using it for over a year.It is very lightly scented and has micro beads to exfoliate. I use itwith my Clarisonic and LOVE it!! Thanks Aveeno, you are the only company I havenever had problems with! Yay!!"
1,"I have been using this mascara for a few months, and I like it. I don't want &#34;monster&#34; lashes - just lashes that look a bit thicker and darker that look natural. This mascara works for me. Toward the end of the uses, it may get a clump or two on the brush, but I just wipe them off on a tissue. This mascara looks natural without looking like you are wearing false eyelashes."
1,"For the price, it's a good product. The non-waterproof version smears like crazy on me, I can't even wear it, but this waterproof stuff held up even through major sweating, so I'll give credit where credit's due.  It doesn't thicken like crazy, it doesn't lengthen like crazy, but it just gives you a nice, solid lash line.  For a regular makeup-wearer, this is a nice casual, weekend, no-makeup look mascara.  For my day-to-day mascara, I prefer something with a little more oomph, but for casual weekend wear, and for the price, this is a good value."
1,I love these and no longer use wash cloths in the shower.  These are really stretchy and they have lasted me quite some time.  Mine came in a pale yellow.  It lathers better than wash cloths and is a great exfoliater.  I pop these in the washer to keep it free of bacteria and mold.  They dry really quickly too so its probably pretty low risk of mold and bacteria anyway.  I can even use this on my face as its not too harsh but definitly better than &#34;exfoliation beads&#34; which never worked for me anyway.
1,"I liked the brush but it only lasted about a year. The little balls on the top of the bristles were falling off, so it became hard on my scalp."
1,"If your scalp is itchy T/Gel is worth a try for as long as you are willing to keep using it for a few months. It worked for me but there were no 'instant' improvements. In my case the itchiness went away VERY slowly but, 3 months later, it's 99% gone.I'm not sure what the exact problem my scalp had the itchiness refused to go away. It was so bad, I couldn't stop myself from scratching which, of course, ensured that my scalp stayed itchy and irritated. Discussing the problem with our good family doctor did not help much. He had nothing to prescribe but suggested that I massage my scalp with cortisone cream - messy because I have a full head of hair and I am not planning to shave it - and predicting that the itchiness will get worse in the winter. (Thank you doc!)To make the story short, I stumbled upon a bottle of T/Gel left over from the time I used it (effectively) to address a dandruff problem and decided to give it a try. The box claims that this is 'effective from the first use'. It's not. My scalp was still itchy one month later but not as much. And... as weeks went by I  noticed that I wasn't scratching or massaging my head as much and the itch was largely gone now.I can't say that the T/Gel cured me and it's quite possible that the itchiness would come back if I stopped using it. Maybe I will experiment with that in a couple of months but, at this time, I am content and happy to have it at least under control with one weekly T/Gel use. Yes, it smells a little funny but if you use it before going to bed the smell should be gone by morning.The product deserves my 5 stars because it worked for me. It's possible that it doesn't work for everyone but I can't see how trying it would hurt.____________________________________NOTE: about the smell.The active ingredient that addresses itching and flaking is 'coal tar' which is smelly. Neutrogena has patented something they call NEUTAR which is a more refined version of coal tar that doesn't smell as bad as the traditional ingredient. This version of T/Gel contains 2% NEUTAR."
1,"This is more thin than I thought it would be. I guess I was expecting Pond's thickness, but I didn't want to buy Ponds which is a little greasy for me. Hydra Renewal smells so nice and feels good going on. It doesn't go on oily and soaks into my skin well. I have no problems using it on my face, around my eyes and neck area. I have had no problems applying sunscreen directly after and didn't end up with a greasy mess on my face.  I like the price, too, which is affordable. This product is available at Walmart, as well."
1,I buy this over and over and over again. I want to subscribe to it! It is ABSOLUTELY essential and totally works!
1,"As one who enjoys the smell of Lavender, and its essential oil I am especially pleased with Avalon Organics' version in this lotion. Not only does it have a great lavender scent, it includes a warm cinnamon type fragrance with it. I can immediately smell the scents when I disperse the lotion for use. It absorbs quickly into the skin and does not leave an overly waxy feeling afterwards. I really like it. And the price for 2 large pump bottles was irresistible."
1,"The color is nice. However, it is a dupe for zoya petra. I was a little disappointed when I noticed that. The color is very nice though!"
1,Nice color and nice opi formula. However as I have not tried this out before purchasing from amazon in turned to be more pink than I expected (in the picture it looks darker than it really is).
1,"This  hair vitamin has the key ingredients that are absolutely great for promoting a healthy head of hair, and scalp. I did not see any extraordinary hair growth, but a good vitamin nevertheless."
1,"Hi my name is Sara-I just got my Topless & Barefoot, form the Essie spring Collection. all i got to say is ((((LOVE IT!))) only needed like two coats looks great on me with my pale olive Skin. can't wait to see it on me when I get my tan going on.As long as Essie keeps making this topless & barefoot nail polish I will keep ordering it. :) Amazons packing is really good with it. I got my nail polish faster then what they had guessed it would be"
1,"I have to be very careful what I put on my skin as I have rosacea, which is an inflammatory condition, and any type of exfoliator or even mild astringent can cause a long-lasting outbreak.  Avalon Organics' Vitamin C cleansing gel has a light, citrusy scent which wakes up my skin in the morning while providing gentle cleansing that leaves my skin soft and refreshed.  One pump of the cleanser will lather into a rich, delicate foam that balances out the tone of my skin: it deeply yet gently cleans the oily portion (T-zone) of my skin while softening and moisturizing the dryer portions, and is mild enough not to affect my rosacea.  It's soothing and relaxing just before bed, too, and thoroughly removes makeup and oil build-up acquired during the day.  Now I just have to figure out how to keep my husband out of it - he loves it too!  Highly recommend for those seeking a gentle cleanser."
0,"If by positively radiant, Aveeno means shininess, then this is the product for you. I love Aveeno products, but this one isn't it. I have some light acne scars and I heard this was a good way to cover it up (BB creams, tinted moisturizers, etc.).When I first applied the product, it really burned and felt like a sunburn for a good 30 minutes. Then, I waited for it to dry and not look as shiny but it pretty much glimmered on my skin for the rest of the night. The color was marked fair to light, yet it was rather orange. Overall, I'm disappointed in the results. I'll stick to my Maybelline concealer for now."
1,"Very gentle, but tough enough to remove waterproof make-up.  It is the only facial cleanser I will use and the bottle is pretty enough to look nice on your bathroom counter."
1,It is easy to apply to lashes. Not too sticky but enough to hold for the evening. It does not irritate my eyes.
0,"It won't give you the colour that shows on, or at the back of the box. not even close! I have medium ash brown hair and the only reason I dye my hair is because of my grey hairs. I just used an &#34;ash&#34; shade of this hair colour to dye my roots and now my roots has an awful copper/red shine, and it doesn't look &#34;ash&#34; brown at all! It has orange undertone:(I am so upset, and recommend you not to use this product at all! Don't even try it or you would regret like me."
1,"This is a very useful product that puts an end to perpetually slipping lingerie straps or falling socks, and has many other uses.  I wear trouser or knee socks a lot and even the best seem to lose elasticity, while others never stayed up well.  The resulting wad at my ankles is not attractive.  When a beloved pair, with a color I can no longer find, thus can't replace, begins to fall, I just use this roll on substance to hold the things up, which it does very effectively.  I've also salvaged split or ill-fitting tights for further use by cutting off the legs and holding up the remaining knee-highs with this product.  It works really well.You are completely unaware of the product once applied and it easily washes off from both skin and garment.  The roll on applicator is very easy to use and it lasts a long time.  Highly recommended."
1,"Swimming in the sea with seaweed all around you seems normal, but looking into your tub and seeing so much seaweed swimming around made me a little nervous (normally I'm more brave) and I did consider looking for a strainer. However I said to myself: ""Self, you get in that tub and stop being so silly."" And so I did and the experience was rather pleasant. I'm used to rose petals floating about, but this was actually even better as the seaweed doesn't tickle.So, what happens when you add this bath bomb to the tub? Well, it is one of the prettiest Lush baths which foams around the bath, first creating an island that looks also like a volcano bubbling up from the tub. Then the colors appear about as the bath bomb swirls beneath the foamy island, creating a seashore and waves. It is actually very interesting.Finally, you have a deep blue bath with Atlantic Sea Salt. The lavender oil and lemon oil seem to deep cleanse the skin and the lemon oil is rather refreshing. The Seaweed seems to float about, but then it just keeps to itself until you stir it back up into the water by moving around.So, if you are looking for a deep cleansing spa-like experience and you don't mind swimming about like a mermaid in seaweed, then this might be for you. If you don't like the seaweed, you might be able to put this in some cheesecloth, tie it up with a string and still get all the benefits, without all the seaweed floating about. It would be cute if they packaged this in some netting with a string.Big Blue is perhaps the most adventurous Lush bath product I've tried. If you prefer rose petals, try the Romance in a Stone bath ballistic (has a romantic poem inside). I'm also looking forward to trying ""Still Life"" with sunflower petals, lemon and wild sweet orange. Life would be less fun without Lush. The therapy massage bar is lovely after this bath and you might enjoy the Sea Vegetable Soap - it also seems to have the same seaweed in it.~The Rebecca Review"
1,"At the end of each yoga class, my teacher would put one of these over my eyes.  I was concerned that others had used the pillow and didn't know what germs I might get (no I'm really not a germaphobe, but I'm careful with my eyes).  Anyway, now I have my own and can wash the cover whenever I wish.  I really like this pillow.  Just the right size and weight with a wonderful, subtle fragrance."
1,"I received Burt's Bees Therapeutic Bath Crystals - 1 lb as part of a Burt's Bee's grab bag assortment directly from Burt's Bees and loved it! This was a surprising find as it really did seem to have therapeutic properties and left me feeling refreshed after a hot soak. I have fibromyalgia so I'm always on the look out for products that ease some of the symptoms I deal with on a daily basis. This product is one I will add to my arsenal and encourage others to do the same. (*NOTE: I did get a bit of a burning sensation on my legs after using this product, but it went away in approximately two hours. Not painful, but slightly unpleasant and unexpected. My guess would be it may have been part of the 'therapeutic' action working in my muscles.)"
1,"I love this stuff. I have made my own rosewater from garden roses but it does not even compare to this stuff. The smell is full and delicate. It leaves my eyes clear and bright after a long, puff inducing sleep and soothes the red out. I keep it in a little spray bottle and douse my face and neck morning and night after I wash it. It's an incredible toner that tightens the skin without drying it. I also useWatts Beauty 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Solution, Paraben & Alcohol Free / Multi-use - 60mlwhich keeps the skin super hydrated due to its ability to attract and store moisture. If I ever feel my skin getting a little dry during the day I simply give my face a few sprays of rosewater to remoisturize the hyaluronic acid and bring my skin back to the dewy glow that I love. This stuff is the real deal, the best quality I've ever found and it has so many uses and benefits. I love it."
1,"I really like this concealer. It covers better than any other I've ever tried and stays on until I wash it off. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it does tend to get a bit cakey. I primarily got it for dark under eye circles. Be careful to put it on in light, thin layers around the eye area. I have a small scar on my cheek and this covers it completely. A little bit goes a long way, too."
1,I've purchased Essie from multiple sources now including big box stores and if there is one complaint I have it is that their paints are not very thick. You need at least two coats to get the proper color saturation and ain't nobody got time for waiting three and four coats of paint to dry. I got this gorgeous red at a good price and once I had slathered on enough that the whites of my nails weren't bleeding through I was satisfied with the color. But I'm not sold on Essie as a brand for for my money will probaly keep using China glaze or OPI both have more saturated colors that go on thicker.
0,"I have used this clay mask several times and it never helped me. It didn't do anything for my face or my acne. I have oily, sensitive acne prone skin and all it did was burn the hell out of my face and turn it red. It may work for some, but didn't work for me."
1,"Game-changer. These are just as simple to use as tampons, and a thousand times more comfortable. You can use them all day or all night easily, and I only change them at 12 hour intervals because the instructions say to, not because it's really necessary. As others have said, you can definitely clean them off and use them again, so I tend to use one for all day, clean it, and then use it for all night, or vice versa. It's quite easy to clean the current one during your daily shower, and then move on with your life!I've occasionally noticed that if it slips a little out of position, it can put a bit of pressure on my bladder, but overall, these are super comfortable to wear, and I've never had a problem with leaks. I've used these through 3 rounds of periods now.I'm petite, and I've never had kids, but these fit just fine.Seriously, GIVE THESE A TRY. It is so worth the day or two learning curve."
1,"I love this cleanser. I use it daily. I completely eliminated any other make-up remover, since this works so well removing make up AND cleaning my skin at the same time. It feels great and is very refreshing."
1,"...evokes fond memories of being a young boy sitting cross-legged on the bathroom counter and intently watching my grandfather's every move as he methodically went through the machinations of his daily early morning wet-shave ritual.Every time when he was done carefully shaving and then cleaning the straight razor, along with the lathering cup and brush, he would look at himself in the mirror while stroking his cheeks to check for any missed spots while reaching for the clear glass bottle of Ed Pinaud's CLUBMAN VIRGIN ISLAND BAY RUM Aftershave Splash and proceed to douse his face, neck and chest with a couple of healthy handfuls of the stuff.With his hands still dripping of this beautifully spicy and exotic, bay tree filled far-away-tropical-paradise smelling after shave, he would then rub my cheeks, the top of my ears and head with the excess and I would smell just like grandpa's aftershave all day long...and I absolutely loved it. I reveled in it then and deeply cherish the memory today.So imagine my shear delight when I recently came across this classic product...I purchased the larger 12oz size bottle, which looks almost exactly like the bottle from almost 50 years ago except it's now a shatter-proof plastic instead of the thicker glass bottle it used to be packaged in. Ok, I can live with that, being more safety-conscious in today's world.But the real test was what was inside that bottle...did it look the same with that light brown yet rich looking brown color?YES...the color and overall look is exactly the same as I remember it from almost 50 years ago. So far, so good.Did it feel the same with its silky smooth texture along with its unique soothing, cooling and refreshing tingle?ALMOST...it seems to be lighter-bodied now with hardly any cooling sensation, though it is still quite soothing and refreshing.And most importantly, did it smell the same with it's heady exotically spicy base along with its subtle yet very punchy combination essences of bay trees, clove and a hint of cinnamon oil?Sadly, NO...it did NOT. It is now a shadow of its former self sidelined by a complete lack of balanced pungency...its now WAY too clove-heavy with very little essence of bay tree and virtually zero cinnamon oil emanating from today's formulation.It's a perfectly acceptable and wearable ""old school"" type of scent that's perfect for running weekend errands or a casual mid-afternoon lunch with a lover, but do NOT expect to get the same product formulation as 50 years ago...it's now a MUCH different, almost unrecognizable after shave to that of the original."
1,"* I liked the conditioner, but still think the shampoo is drying or not so moisturizing.* A great find for the price."
0,"I applied this for the first time after my morning shower today.  OH MY GOD!  It was seriously the worst, most horrible smell!  After rubbing it all over my clean face, I had to get back into the shower just to get the odor off of me as soon as humanly possible.  I can't even attest to how it works because I could never stand the rancid smell.  After a nice, refreshing shower, who on Earth would want to apply something that smells like wet dog and animal urine?  Not me.  It was the most disgusting experience.  I do like lots of other Philosophy products.  But I was shocked that someone could even bear using this. Other reviewers said they didn't like the smell, but kept applying it until they didn't notice it much anymore.  I wonder if those people wonder why other humans want to stand 12 feet away from them when they're nearby.  UGH."
1,this is great for my oily skin and i'm able to use it and see fast results.  different things have leftme with mixed results  but this one truly works  and i feel it is the best product for direct cleaning and scrubbing.
1,What is there not to LOVE about this powder???  Five big stars! Excellent quality and it doesn't break my skin out at all.  I would highly recommend it.  Will continue to buy.
1,One of the sensitive skin products that I can use on my face without irritation.  A decent product from a well-known company.
1,I use this before bed on the dark spots on my hands and on my face..  i like it so far.. My skin seems more smooth and soft.
1,I love Aveeno. Had to return because it leaked all over in the shipment box but 5 stars for Aveeno!
1,"This product fits the description. I use it for my edges instead of my entire hair because I am looking for more curls. It makes my hair shiny. Also, there are no residue."
1,I like this because it looks very natural.  I have fine lashes and this helps.  I also really like Revlon 3D photoready mascara.
1,"I am quite sad to report that this moisturizer has caused me to break out. This is very upsetting for me since I have just gotten my skin to a good place usingDudu Osun Black Soap, 6-Count. (check that out is you want amazing skin cleansing) I was looking for a cheaper oil-free moisturizer than the clinique gel that also has the added effect of SPF. I was reccomended to this by a friend with great skin, but it's not for me...For this to be oil-free, it is quite heavy. I can feel it sitting on my skin after I put it on as though none of it was absorbed. My skin didn't look oily and it did moisturize my combination skin, but I don't like the feel of it on my face. It also added a very small amount of ""radiance"" to my skin, which I could take or leave, but it's supposed to have a light-diffusing quality to make skin imperfections less noticeable. And for it to be non-comedogenic, it sure did raise heck on my poor, unsuspecting skin. I think I will return back to the clinique. If it ain't broke, don't fix it right? I will keep looking for a cheaper alternative though.I gave this 3 stars instead of 2 because my powder foundation looked great over it, but it's not worth the break-out!"
1,"I used this product for the first time this morning and I was skeptical of the outcome, because when I massaged it in my hair and scalp it felt very oily and heavy on my head, and I was sure that my hair would be left greasy, but I was more than pleasantly surprised because after styling my hair was lighter and softer and not limp as usual.  Also my scalp feels very clean, I would definitly use again and again."
1,"I actually bring this to the nail salon i go to, because I love this so much. Very professional looking. It looks best with short nails, and I usually put two coats on. It does not complement silver jewelry or white gold, but if you're wearing yellow gold jewelry or none at all, this is a definite must try. Was shipped fast too."
1,I was fairly happy with this brush until I went on vacation and forgot my ceramic round brush I use for drying my hair.  After two times of drying my hair for 10 minutes the bristles bent so much it rendered the brush useless.
1,"I started using Hope in a Jar after Oprah televised it as one of her favorite things.  I wish I could put into words how wonderful this moisturizer is.  I have combination skin and often has trouble with my skin feeling terribly greasy after I have moisturized.  I never have this problem now.  It absorbs into my skin immediately, holds my make up in place, and give my skin a dewy, not oily look.  It is definitely worth a try.  I now buy the big jar.*The smell is a little different, but it is so easy to get used to and does not stay with you all day."
1,"Vanicream is excellent if you have very dry skin. It helped me get through the brutal winter as my skin starts cracking when it gets dry. It is a little heavy for the summer, but could still be used. Overall a great lotion and it lasts a long time as well."
1,"This is to be used for serious sun exposure where protecting yourself is more important than a slight white layer on your skin.  I kayak every week and I am under the sun for 3 to 5 hours.  I know this works because I forgot to apply this on my hands and they were the only part of my body that tanned and burned.  Yes, there is a light white shade. Big deal.  Also, this isn't meant to go on your face as well, not matter what anyone says.  They have another product that is meant for sensitive skin that doesn't have a noticeable white shade.I just got back from a whole day of Kayaking under very intense sun here in Newport Beach, CA.  I didn't even have a noticeable tan.  Since I was paddling the whole time, I didn't have a chance to reapply it. Since there is a slight white shade, I could still see it on my skin even with water splashing on me.I still recommend using a hat and long sleeve rash guard with SPF if you intend to stay under the sun for a long time, but if you cannot, this is the next best choice."
1,"I received a sample of this bronzer in the Laguna shade. I never would have selected it for myself and wasn't really expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. Next to MAC, this is the best bronzer I've ever used. It gives me subtle color without a lot of sparkle. The Laguna color is light enough that it's perfect for my fair skin, and doesn't make my face look orange. I can apply just a dusting for a very natural look, and build up the color if needed. I love this product and definitely recommend it to everyone."
1,I love all of the NOW essential oils.  My husband is really fond of citrus so I got the lemon in a large size.
1,"This is one of my favorite NARS colors. I can wear it alone or with other products. It is perfect for summer.It is similar to the gold that comes in the NARS Hanamichi palette, but it is more gold and creamy (even though it comes in a powder), since I feel the Hanamichi is a bit flakey and not as brilliant."
1,"I love Essie nail polish! This review is specifically for ""Aruba Blue.""  ""Mademoiselle"" review is below.This is a dark blue, not navy, but a deep Royal blue. There is shine but no sparkle, and the coverage is amazing. The polish consistency is thin but even, and goes on in thin coats. (If yours doesn't, you might want to get a thinner). Two coats is more than enough for deep color, and since it goes on thin you can either use Seche Vite topcoat for bulk or CND Air Dry for thin coverage. Color lasts well, does NOT chip, and there is no streaking past the first coat. This, like all other dark-pigmented polish, will wear off the tips and may mark paper that you are writing on or books you are reading. Applying a second top coat a day or so after polish will help keep the color on your nails and not on your paper.I have noticed that this color will get in between the nail and the flesh on the side of your nail. It stains pretty well so color removal can take a few more cotton balls than is expected. When removing polish the pigment will travel along the remover and can stain under the nail with a dusky blue color. This can and will stain cuticle debris left on nails. A slight buffing after polish removal and scrubbing with soap and a nail brush resolves this problem.Mademoiselle by Essie is perfect for French Manicures. It is rather sheer, no matter what it looks like in the bottle, and WILL streak if you are not careful. As a solid color three coats looks pretty good, but you can still see the tips of your nails if they are long. Over a snow-white french tip this looks beautiful. When someone wants a pale pink, I always recommend this. Remember though, it is NOT opaque, and never will be. (When will Essie or OPI make an opaque pink like Orly's ""Kiss the Bride?"")"
0,"I expected that an exfoliating glove would be rough.  These exfoliating gloves are way too rough.  I didn't bother returning them, but I do regret purchasing them."
1,Bought this for my mom. She uses Maybelline Great Lash religiously. Works great. Makes lashes look beautiful. The brownish black formula gives you defined lashes without the drama of a rich black mascara. Great for every day use.
1,"This is such a beautiful color, it's the perfect baby pink, it full coverage in 2 coats, goes on very nice and shiny. I love Essie and china glaze!! My 2 favorite nail polish brands."
0,"The spray color borwn/blonde is WHITE.  Unless a person likes WHITE hair, forget this color.  I have used brown and that is fine, and I like the product.  However, DO NOT BUY this color.  You will be sorry."
1,"The ingredients are non-toxic, non-drying and very helpful. It didn't work on my sensitive, picky, facial skin, but I do use it as a hair gel. It also worked great on a hemorrhoid that came and went quickly because I used this gel mixed with a little bit of Tropical Traditions Coconut Oil and it really helped soothe, shrink and heal it. It is good to apply to mosquito bites in the summer and on little cooking burns! I also recommend Aloe Life's personal lubricant gel for women; it really works and won't irritate your flora or stain the sheets."
1,its a great brush I use mine for the bare minerals warmth or bronzeing powder deffinitly one of my favorite brushes.
1,I ordered these gloves because I had used a similar pair before and really liked them but.......OMG! I waited for them to arrive for the longest time. Had I known the shipping was at a snail's pace I could have just gone to the store to get them. I had lost all interest by the time I eventually got them. It was also quite noticeable that the quality wasn't the same as the one's I had ordered before so that was disappointing.
1,"I bought this due to the other women with AA hair that swear by the caruso product.Since I texturize my hair, and its not straight, I had to make some modifications.Yes, my hair does frizz.I've used my bonnet dryer with the curlers in.I've used the bonnet dryer after I've taken the curlers out.The best strategy is to use the bonnet dry after you take the curlers out, on lower heat.  If the curls aren't dry, your hair will frizz.It is a good thing for us to put moisture on our naturally dry (tendency to be really damaged) hair!The key is to make sure the hair is more dry afterwards, using another quick heat appliance. I use the regular dryer for 3-10 minutes in the morning.If my hair gets a little frizzy at work, it doesn't really matter.Everyone ALWAYS comments how nice my hair looks, frizz or no frizz.It is a nice curl pattern that lasts pretty well.A good tool to have and EXPERIMENT with.I bought a second one for my mother who has short hair, and we split the rollers (cheaper than buying the extra rollers).  It looked really nice on her hair. She left her rollers in over night,  I think.Hot rollers never worked on my hair.  These do -- with some modifications.By the way did I say these are good for damaged hair?  (not great- due to the foam)..."
1,Such a perfect red that anyone would love. Glides on so easily with just a few swipes. the color is bright without being to much. I used it for a Christmas nail design and it was just the right shade to get noticed but be so elegant at the same time. OPI has yet to fail me in quality.
1,"I am not the sort of girl who likes to do clean up.  I love to cook but I hate doing the dishes after.  I love to use makeup and glam myself up, but I don't really like to do alot of folderol after I've washed off all the glitz, and because I know this about myself, I wanted to find a skin care regimen that works for my kind of personality.Oil of Olay's Regenerist line offers me everything that I want without denting my budget or becoming a chore to maintain my regimen.I use several different products in conjunction with my Oil of Olay Regenerist items because I have found them to be the most effective for my regimen.Having said that, this product, the UV Defense Regenerating Lotion with SPF 15 is my daily go to moisturizer.  I use it with the Regenerating Serum, which I put around my eyes, mouth and lips as well as between my brows, those areas that get alot of use on a daily basis, especially those laugh lines that can cause most of us to shed more than a few tears when we spot them.After using the serum, I apply the UV defense sparingly all over my face and neck because a little goes a long way, which not only makes this cost effective to use, it also provides visible results, not only in the mirror but also in the touch test.It absorbs quickly without leaving any sort of oily or tacky residue that will cause make up to go on unevenly or to smear off later on.  It has a very light citrusy scent that is like aroma therapy reminding me that I am doing something good for my skin without having to put alot of time into it.The texture and evenness of my skin has changed for the better in very little time and so I find it easy to maintain my moisturizing regimen because I see the results without having to invest a lot of time to do it and I enjoy that near-instant gratification.Every woman knows that smooth, healthy skin is the perfect canvas to create a great look with makeup, whether for work, a night on the town or special occasion when you really glitz up.This product is such a great and easy way to do something good for your skin and your budget.  The first time you use it you'll feel the results and that's what it's all about."
1,"This stuff makes your hair feel thicker after using it and overall is a good product. I have been using it for about 6 months and have not seen any hair-loss prevention or any hair growth what so ever. It is very reasonably priced and does leave my hair feeling thicker and better looking than other shampoos i've tried. I do think it promotes your hair to produce more oils though, it is pretty potent. After about 12-14 hours my forehead and scalp seem more oily than in the past since using this product, but nothing terrible or alarming.The smell could be better. It doesn't necessarily smell bad, but it kinda smells like lemony dish soap or like dial hand soap--like some commercial bathroom product--But you gotta hand it to them, it smells pretty damn good for a product having Saw Palmetto berries in it--in case you were unaware, saw palmetto extract and berries smell like pure vomit and death...lol! Don't worry you can't smell the saw palmetto at all. It is not strong scented, you'll just have a light fragrance of some industrial lemon-like handsoap while washing your hair.For the price, it's definitely worth it to at least try."
1,"I have fair skin (with a cool undertone) and red hair, and it has always been difficult for me to find a good nude lipcolor. Although the lipstick looks really dark in the packaging, it is actually a shade darker than a true nude- but can be layered to go darker and darker. You could in fact make it as dark as the color it appears to be if you wanted. It's a very versatile shade, and, I think, would look good on just about anyone. Also, NARS makes some of the best lipsticks around. Nourishing and lasts longer than average."
1,"This is an old, tried and true natural care product that works. Ugly spider veins definitely recede on my legs."
1,"this shampoo worked great on the stubborn itch i had. i was literally itching my scalp until it bled. sadly though, this shampoo did not get rid of the dandruff that caused the itching.it also had a very strong smell to it...i had to keep my hair in a pony tail during the shower and made sure the product didn't have prolonged contact on my skin. i thought it would make my sensitive skin break out, but it actually made me have an eczema flare up.just remember to lather, rinse and REPEAT. it only works that way! each lather should be on your head for several minutes. you'll notice a considerable difference within one shower. i used this shampoo five days a week (the bottle says to use at LEAST twice a week) and followed up with a moisturizing conditioner. the weekends i would do moisture treatments.the smell will linger on your hair, no matter you do...so don't fight it. just be grateful that the itch is gone!i'm going to try a difference anti-dandruff shampoo. i know that not every active ingredient will work for someones problems, so i still do recommend that someone tries this shampoo because it seems to have worked for lots of people."
0,"I was very excited about receiving this product, after reading the reviews, but I've got to say that it is yet another dissapointment. I've used it for a little over a month and I haven't seen any results at all.  Unfortunately, I had placed a second order, the ever hopeful I am, so now I'll have to use it, since it is not exactly cheap."
1,I like the color and quality of the nail polish but it had more blue tinge and wasn't as bright as expected.
1,"During the winter months I take a lot of baths, which can leave my skin dry. I already useAveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotionbecause they work well on my skin and I decided that it would be worth it to try their bath products. I orderedAveenos Active Naturals Stress Relief Foaming Bathsimply because of the name; who doesn't need some stress relief?The scent is nice without being overpowering and it made lots and lots of bubbles which is a must for me. It left my skin feeling soft afterwards and overall I liked it.  The only downfall is the price and only because I tend to use more than is probably recommended so the bottle doesn't last as long as I would like."
1,"Two coats of this and it's completely solid, no streaks, no sheer spots.At first glance Smokin' Hot looks like a dark blue-brown, which doesn't sound pretty. But on my pale skin, it's really flattering with my short nails. It's a little cooler than China Glaze Foie Gras, where the Foie Gras is more warm and brown, Smokin' Hot is more cool purple; but both have a depth that is almost a black/brown. So it's easy to dress up or down with accent glitter, etc.If you like darker polish, the chances are you'll like this color."
1,"This blush is FABULOUS. I am in love with the NARS lip pencils and have been searching for a great red blush for a while. I was hesitant to try this but sooooo glad I went for it. I apply this on top of a thin layer of bronzer (although looks equally amazing with just foundation) and it looks gorgeous. I use a stippling duo fiber brush and literally just tap the brush on the palette and that's all you need! It is so pigmented I feel as if this pan will last for ages! And the color is amazing. Not to red, but a great pretty flush. Blends easily. Not too pink. JUST RIGHT. I am light to medium skin toned and it looks great. I have gotten several compliments since purchasing and now I wear this almost every day. :) THANK YOU NARS."
1,"With below the shoulder hair, I found this to dry it quickly and without burning.  I have fine, thick hair so usually it takes 10 minutes or more to dry ... and other dryers run so hot that they burn if focused in one spot for more than a moment (to set a wave, for instance).  This gets just hot enough to be safe and pleasant to use.The finger-attachment might be useful if someone else is styling your hair, but my arms (I'm 5'9"") aren't long enough to make its use practicable.Two speeds, two heat settings (plus cold-shot button) actually give a very usable range for drying efficiently.  Took me less time than with my previous dryer."
1,"I really need a product like this for itchy, dry ears, but I am afraid I might be allergic to some of the ingredients in it.  Since I have been using it, my ears are feeling clogged and achy, and my sinuses are being adversely affected.  It is too bad.  I wish there were a product for itchy ears out there that did not have allergenic ingredients in it."
1,"Love the moisturizing properties of the lotion, but the smell is a bit overwhelming. I prefer the rose lotion or some of the other scents. They are just as softening, and I don't have to worry about disintegrating my retinas if I get it in my eyes, accidentally!"
1,"Yes, it smells like a perm--but it works, it really works!  I was able to do  great 30s hairdo perm with this despite having issues with aging hair and chemicals residues.  Took like magic!"
1,"This brush is excellent in terms of not tangling or tearing hair.  The bristles are not too sharp.  It's comfortable to hold and it's sturdy.  But it does not work well with my hair.  I have shoulder-length, fine, thick, slightly wavy hair.  Each strand of hair is small in diameter, but I have a lot of it.  It needs to be blow-dried if I don't want it to be a combination of flat and frizzy. The bristles on this brush glide right through my hair as a comb does.  They do not grip my hair firmly enough to create the tension necessary for styling, or to hold my hair firmly enough to remove frizz.  There might be too few bristles for my hair, or perhaps the bristles are too short.  A standard drugstore boar-bristle round brush is much more effective for my hair.In many ways it's a nice brush, and on my budget, I'm disappointed when I buy a product that doesn't work for me. But after several months of trying to use this, I had to throw it out.  It was that unhelpful.  For coarser hair than mine (which would be most hair) or for hair that is naturally straight, it might be perfect."
1,"I love to scent our home , unfortunately my Husband gets horrible headaches when I use Bed an B_ _ H oils and it's because they are not real  scents from the plant (flower, fruit etc.) When I use this (and NOW lavender oil) he walks in the house and says &#34;Wow, it smells wonderful in here &#34;  Try adding a drop of Patchouli oil to the mix, wonderful!"
1,"I'm 17 and love this stuff. Spas are kinda expensive so I say why not give myself a facial mask at home. So I went searching on here and found a whole lot of masks to try, but this interested me the most because of the natural cucumber and what it claimed to do. So I ordered it and when it finally came, I just had to use it that night. And let me tell you! I've been using this mask twice a week for a few months now, and my face looks and feels great. It also helped to reduce some of the puffiness under my eyes. They're invisible now! It makes me feel like I've been to a spa. The only reason I gave it one less of a star is because when the mask is left on overtime, it's hard to peel off. But if you leave it on for the right amount of time, it peels off easily. Other than that, I'm really happy with this product."
1,This mirror is perfect for my hairdressing business as it is large enough for the customers to see the back of their heads and the price is very good too. I have dropped these before from about 5 ft and they were durable so added bonus.
1,"I bought this product when I was pregnant to take the place of my benzoyl peroxide products (I was told glycolic was ok during pregnancy).  My skin, which has always been acne prone and oily, was breaking out horribly.  I was of course hoping that this product would solve the problem, but all I can say is I guess it kept it from getting worse.  If I didn't use it for a couple of days I noticed even more break outs, so I know it was doing something.  I had used glycolic products in the past, so I didn't find the 10% too extreme; I would definitely not start with 10% though.  And on the parts of my face that weren't broken out, I did notice smoother skin after using the product."
1,"Perfect. Clips on with ease, even to the new energy efficient bulbs. Helps distribute light more evenly so it makes the room brighter than with just a bare bulb!"
1,I didn't notice any great results from Olay Regenerist.  The price wasn't bad but I like other products better.  It's not greasy though.
1,"These Frownies are not exactly sexy. But they DO work. I had a deep line from knitting my brows together and it is now gone. Yes, it does take some time for the results depending on your skin, how deep the wrinkle is, and also being very consistent with using the patches.Frownies also made me aware that I was frowning and I retrained myself to be more aware of it. No more line - thanks Frownies!Very pleased with this product and highly recommended!"
1,"This stuff works.I have been searching for a good body wash that wouldn't tear my shoulders up, and I've finally found it!I could tell from the first couple washes that it was a keeper!I've been using this product for about 3 weeks, and I'm currently sporting acne-free shoulders (save scars) for the first time in YEARS.And as the bottle says, you don't have to sacrifice an enjoyable shower with this!  It lathers very well & smells good.I suggest you try it!"
1,This is a very good hair and makeup near. I use it every day. It works just for when I wanted to be. I love the magnification.
1,I have this brush in the larger size as well it works well with my long thin fine hair. Much easier to use than a curling iron.
1,"PLEASANT SMELLING AND EASY ON THE FACE, THIS CLEANSER DOES IT ALL AT A GREAT PRICE! I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ANY AGE. LEAVES FACE FEELING SMOOTH  AND CLEAN. FOLLOW WITH YOUR FAVORITE MOISTURIZER."
1,"The addition of SPF is always appreciated - in this day and time it's a necessity.  In the case of this product it is SPF 15 - higher would have been better.Nonetheless, this is a nice hypo-allergenic formula that provides hydration for face and neck.  It absorbs quickly so one doesn't have to wait to apply makeup."
1,"I have very long (butt length) hair, and needed a HUGE brush to blow dry it for a wedding, it worked as needed.My hair is only slightly wavy, thick and heavy.  I did let my hair dry out some before starting to blow dry it, I generally leave my hair to dry on its own - blow drying it is a tedious task!"
1,"I have long wavy hair and I bought this because it came with a diffuser attachment. It clicks in no problem (as well as the concentrator but I've only used it once) and you can easily take it off. The cord is longer so if you have a larger bathroom, it helps. It also has a hook on the base of the handle, you can kind of see it in the picture, which helps with storage if you choose to hang it up. I use it on the hot heat, low setting and I don't see a lot of frizz even without product. It dries my hair quickly without it being noisy. But if you use it on the high setting, it gets noisy. Overall, I love this dryer. So far. I'll post another review if anything bad happens to the dryer."
1,Great grey/silver color. Only takes 2 coats and dries fast. I didn't have any greys in my collection so this is well loved. Opi is great for polishes as always. So far opi has never let me down (:
1,"This product is good, but washes out too soon.  My gray shows up with a week or so.  Guess I'll go back to permanent coloring."
1,Perfect for my needs.
0,The lavendar witch hazel is so much better.  The rose smell made me sick after the second use and I didn't see the results I had when using the Thayer witch hazel-lavendar.
1,My wife cannot go out in public without the use of these products.  She can buy them at half the price we'd pay locally and the business ships super fast.
1,"They work well in my thick hair and are very convenient to use. They seem a little big, but they still work."
1,-Always clear up my acne-I usually use them twice per day but sometimes I'll just use one if my skin starts to feel dry-Very good price
1,i've used this mascara several and i happen to like it. great lash is an american icon when it comes to mascaras.
1,"First of all let me say that I have dry skin so I need something that is really going to help me with that and this just didn't do that for me. It didn't break me out or cause irritation but it didn't help with my problem areas either! I have large pores around my nose, chin and forhead, This didn't help tighten those. I have dry cheeks and oily in T-Zone and it didn't help with the dryness AT ALL. If you have perfect skin and you just need a face cream then this is for you. But as an Anti-Ager and all the other stuff it's supposed to do not so much. It didn't brighten my complexion or help even out my skin. So I went back to my Boots No 7 Regimen (See My Review) and I couldn't be happier."
1,"I like this perfume. I first discovered it when it was an insert in a magazine i was reading and i fell in love with it. i purchased it on amazon and received it shortly afterward. I really like this soft, flirty smell, but i didnt get nearly as many comments/ compliments on it as i do with my regular perfumes... kind of a bummer... but i still like the fragrance...."
1,"i'm on my second tube, and i definitely notice a difference in my skin. my acne scars are clearing, my tone is more even, and i rarely ever break out any more. i'm young, so i don't have much in the way of fine lines, but i have noticed that the crease lines in my foreheard are looking a little smoother-nothing dramatic though.when i first began using this product, i applied it ever 2 days instead of every night because i was getting a small amount of peeling. but now i use it every night. i have very sensitive skin and, other than the initial peeling, i've had no issues with the product. you will absolutely want to use sunscreen during the day, though; retinol can make you more sensitive to the sun so be careful!"
1,"I love Philosophy products.  Amazing Grace is my favorite scent hands down. Love Love Love.  It is floral but not overpoweringly so.  There are also nice notes of citrus (grapefruit) and musk earthiness. This is a bigger size and takes me about 8 months to get through.  If you just want to test out the scent, you should go for a smaller bottle.  If you are an Amazing Grace addict like myself, this is the way to go!  If Amazon could give you the ability to grant a single 6 star review for every 100 reviews you write, I'd use that bullet here.Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision."
1,I won't purchase this again it causes my skin to have irritation and breakouts. But it's a wonderful hand cream;-)
1,"Love the company.  They consistently have the freshest and highest quality.  I will seek their products out and spend an extra dollar for the peace of mind that I will not get some old sketchy rancid product from a company I don't know, and have to hassle with the return, shipping and handling, all that nonsense.  Now foods are excellent.I bought this to use in lip balms, lotions, salves, creams and whatever other uses I can incorporate it into.  I look foreward to mixing this lovely oil with scents, it's also an amazing massage oil, but I will but a larger bottle next time, now that I know I can trust the product."
1,It's so inexpensive but one of the best masks available for shrinking pores and drying up blemishes. Nice clean feeling!
0,"I attempted this 4 times on my hair and scalp. It does make your hair soft but it isn't necessary. It does not grow your hair. People that are saying it does, there's no scientific proof. You have to be careful with it. It's thick. I didn't like it because it made my scalp very itchy. I'm probably allergic to it."
1,"I would say that this powder is average in every single way. Its not the worst quality, but not the best either. Can be a bit chalky if you apply too much, but it doesnt gravitate into fine lines or wrinkles. I would say that there are better powders out there to look for."
1,"I stop buying makeup remover thanks to this product. I originally bought it as a regular face cleanser, but it works better than any make-up remover I ever bought."
1,"The fragrance of this toner is beautiful and refreshing. What I like most about it is how soothing it is to the skin. It makes my skin feel dewy fresh and comfortable. You really can't go wrong with this toner. It's got natural ingredients, so you don't have to worry about what some paraben or crazy methysulphate type ingredient will do to your health. I can't imagine a better toner than this, and I've used the high-priced department store toners. I will buy again!"
1,"my kids love these brushes, they both use al the time, my 10yr old does like the fact that she puts conditioner on and it detangles and cleanses her scalp too."
1,"Dry skin from high altitude, winter heating, or natural course of ageing, this cream is soothing and filled with nutrients to give your skin a glowing appeal."
1,the package came broken so returning this for a new one but it smells really good and the lotion seems rich too..
1,"As long as this eyeliner is applied correctly there should be no peeling, fading or flaking.  The only time I get some flaking or peeling is if I apply it too thickly. I put this on early in the morning (7am or so) and don't take it off until 11 or 12 pm.  And in all that time it stayed where I put it and the color stayed true.I have horrible allergies and I also have tear producing issues...combine these problems and there is really nothing I could wear to line my eyes-until I found  Maybelline Lineworks.  My eyes can and will at times ooze tears all day.Sometimes it looks as if I'm having a crying jag. BUT even through all this, my liner never goes anywhere! I use Ponds to take it off at night.  Easy peasy!The only thing I'm upset with is that Maybelline seems to be  dis-continuing many of the colors and while I can understand it, I don't LIKE it."
1,Smells great!!!Cleanses pores and removes excess oil.Does not dry out.Person who said will do 6-7 applications is crazy.  You don't need to cake it on. It should do way more applications than that if you understand how to apply a mask properly.I love it.  Will use from now on!  Probably about once or twice a week.
1,this comb i use in my shower to detangle my hair and it just goes right through my hair without any trouble.
1,"Leather is good quality. It was purchased as a gift and the recipient was pleased. One suggestion would be more inner pockets, This is a very traditionally styled product."
1,"I originally sought this cleanser because I read that products with acidic pH levels were better for women's ""nether regions,"" whereas normal soap is alkaline and upsets the natural balance of things.  So, rather than just use it ""down there,"" I used it all over and was very pleased with it.  One day I read the enclosed literature and saw that you can wash your hair with it, so I tried.  Now, I'm very fussy about what products I use on my hair.  Salon quality only for me!  Even so, I'd had problems with my scalp for the past couple of years, and nothing seemed to help much.  Until this.  Now my scalp doesn't itch incessantly and my hair loss has gone back to normal amounts.  I'm happy with this product, and I find the smell to be pleasant, a lot more so than most commercial soaps out there."
1,"I expected some drying/peeling to occur based on everyone elses reviews but even with regular application (evening use only for 6+ weeks) I didn't really see much of a change except a little dryness around my mouth (I have the 3x).  I did not use this in combination with any other product in the evening - just on a freshly washed and fully dry face.  It's not that I have tough withstandall skin either as I do experience contact dermatitis with several brands that are supposed to be more hypo-allergenic (like Clinique products).  I can't dismiss that obviously this product is doing something for all of the positive reviews it has received - but it hasn't done anything for me.  Although I was hoping to find a cheaper alternative to my rx, I think I will stick with my rx cream for the time being, which does seem to do a great job with my skin.  For reference, I'm 29 years old and I use my rx to help even my skin tone (I have some old acne marks that it helps with too) and help maintain healthy/younger looking skin."
1,"I bought this for my girl and she seems to love it, so I assume it is good. Sorry I can not be more helpful."
1,"The classic unisex fragrance! It smells casually flirty on me, yet musky and seductive on my man - you'd never know it's the same thing. Has that special CK something!"
1,"It cleans your face, but doesn't pull out hard to reach black heads. Not impressed, but its OK.Can't honestly recommend."
1,"I like the almond scent.  I don't know what else you can say, it is a good product.  I buy this regularly."
1,"For years I've had this dry crepey patch of skin on my shin that I've tried all sorts of oils and lotions to get rid of. After two uses of this lotion in winter, the patch looks much better and is not flaking as it did before. I do not smell the urine smell that other people have experienced as this lotion is unscented, light and can be worn alone or under your regular lotion. I love it and will continue to buy it."
1,"I've used a number of facial moisturizers over the years, expensive and drug store brands.  This is my favorite.  I am in my early 50's and have always had very dry skin, so it's tricky to find a moisturizer that works for me to the point where I only use night creams.  But this one is great!  It goes on silky smooth and doesn't feel heavy or greasy.  It absorbs quickly allowing for easy application of mineral foundation.  It also lasts all day for me without my skin ending up feeling tight and dry by the end of the day.  And within a week or so of starting to use it, my skin felt so much softer and smoother.  I highly recommend for anyone with very dry skin at any age.  LOVE IT!!"
1,BUT NOT ANYMORE!!! This product is awesome. I put just a wee bit in my bathwater and voila!! Gets to places I was too lazy to reach. I'm not itchy from this terribly dry winter we're having and my skin doesn't feel tight. I love to also use this oil as a massage oil. There's no fragrance which I like because it allows me to put on perfume without feeling too scented.Pros:Not greasy in the bathtubHydratingSoothing for itchy dry skinSpreads easilyAbsorbs quicklyCons:Can get a little priceyMust...have....more.....
1,"Winner! I love this shampoo and it lathers so nicely!!!! Awesome shampoo and my hair feels amazing after I wash it. Soft, easy to brush and extremely shiney! I use the whenever conditioner too!"
1,"Highly recommend this Serum.  I love how it feels on my skin, especially after the Microdermabrasion & Peel system.  I think you will too."
1,"This is as awesome as raved about. Smells beautiful, lasts all day, and is never over powering."
1,"I'm one of those people that is never satisfied with a scent.  I buy and hate it shortly after.  Well, I just love this Egyptian Goddess scent!  My husband won't stop hugging me and nuzzling my neck!  Back in the 70's I wore Ambergris Oil by Jovan.  After it was discontinued I've been searching and searching...never satisfied until now.  I'm going to get the big bottle and also the soap.  I'm just so happy I have a scent again that is ME.  Thank you Auric and also Amazon.:)"
1,I get so many compliments when wearing Clinique Happy that I've stopped wearing anything else. It's fresh and light and slightly flowery. This order came from PerfumeWorldWide and was completely satisfactory. Beware of sellers who may be unloading old stock that has lost its original fragrance.
0,"This is a really nice curling brush, except that it doesn't get nearly hot enough to actually curl hair.  There are two settings:  High and Low.  The &#34;high&#34; setting does not even produce a curl immediately after taking the brush out of your hair.  I am not one to use rushes and irons so hot that they cannot be touched and where your hair is damaged, so I wasn't expecting anything blazing hot.  However, it has to be warm enough to actually curl hair.  In all my years, I have never had an iron or brush that didn't get hot enough.Really a disappointment, because it is otherwise a very nice brush.  But what good is a curling brush if it doesn't curl??"
1,"I've always had fine, straight hair. In the 80s, I used perms to help, but I didn't want to fry my hair the rest of my life, so I looked for alternatives.I went through all kinds of styling tools fromRevlon RV261 20-Roller Ionic Professional HairsettertoConair CD103JCS Satin Finish 1-1/2-Inch Ceramic Curling Iron, and then some...even hair products like Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray Extreme 7 oz..I finally stumbled across this triple-barrel iron. While it takes much longer to style my hair, it doesn't fall flat after only a few hours...in fact, I've had my waves last overnight.I would not recommend it to someone who is in a hurry, or anyone with shoulder-length or shorter hair...if you don't have long hair, using this iron will make you look ridiculous."
1,"I have used this product for many years and have always liked it.  My mom also loved it, before she passed away.  This was a great deal; I saved money by ordering the bundle"
1,"Having obtained one of the Aquis towels from a brick and mortar store over 2 years ago, I decided to get another for gym and travel purposes. The previous Aquis towel has stood in good stead, maintaining its smooth feel and quickly drying after use. Even if you have short or medium length hair, using this towel as a turban and then using it to absorb some of the water left in your hair can shorten your time with a wet head or your time under the blow drier. Or if you choose, drape it over your pillow and you won't end up with a ""terry cloth"" face the next morning after slumber.If you're traveling to someplace where towels are stingy or none existent, this would be a good general use item to take along without too much weight or bulk. You won't dry your body with it but it would make a good supplement."
1,This is the best moisturiser for mom-age ever. But a little bit too heavy for me. Serve as good concealer.
1,"I will put my review here, although the product I've been using is their Grapefruit scented lotion.  This lotion is rich, creamy, and long lasting.  I can apply it in the morning after my shower, and it lasts all day.  The smell is quite neutral (very mild) - which is helpful because I like to wear perfumes & essential oils.  It leaves the slightest oily residue, but it really isn't noticeable - I even apply the lotion to my face.  If you find it to be oily, just add a little bit of water when rubbing into the skin and you will feel quite tender & juicy - a naturally supple feel to the skin.  A little bit goes a long way.  My 8 oz bottle lasted me 1 year, and sadly my store stopped carrying it - so I have recently tried numerous other natural lotions, only to be disappointed.  I will stick to Ecco Bella lotions from now on.  Nothing else compares.  No Parabens, SLS, etc either!"
1,"I use this when washing my cloth diapers (if you know what I'm talking about - that first rinse cycle smells SO bad, the lemon completely masks it) and sometimes diffuse it when the aroma in our house needs a little boost. ;) I hadn't quite realized how much 4fl oz is - this has lasted me quite some time!Only downside is that it doesn't have an inner cap - so you'll have to find your own or use a dropper. Would not recommend free-pouring!"
1,"Check out this link:[...]I haven't tried this yet, but I'm currently looking at various facial devices for at home use.  This one is way cheaper at QVC.  Seems to be the same thing!"
1,"Years ago, I used this product regularly, and was very happy with it, as it covered my grays well and seemed gentle on my hair. A week ago, I used this new version for the first time and was surprised that it didn't cover my grays well (especially around my temples). It's quite unfortunate, since I imagine that most people dye their hair in order to cover grays. I will give this product 3 stars, though, for being gentle on my hair and not drying it out. I was also happy with the color (Tweed) -- a nice, soft brown with not too much orange or red tones in it. I only hope the color fades to a tone I like as well."
1,I was looking to a good natural alternative to shampoo and this is way better than I could have expected. My hair is thicker than its ever been and I don't need a conditioner to make it soft. I will use this stuff forever!
1,"I have relaxed color treated hair, I have used many deep conditioners and this one is the best.  I started my healthy hair journey in March of 2011 and began using it then.  It leaves my hair soft, manageable and it smells great.  I mix it with my oils (Jamaican Black Castor Oil and Coconut Oil) and deep condition for one hour.  It works great and I am very pleased with this product.  I just wish it came in an economy size since it is costly to use it weekly."
1,"i would have loved it if it was my color. it makes my face kind of white so i just added it to my Aveeno daily moisturizer, which made it come out ok."
1,"I originally purchased this product when traveling. Later, I purchased an additional package upon returning home. These cleansing wipes remove makeup remarkably well, including eyeliner, mascara and eyeshadow."
1,"I used Bare Minerals for years and am very happy with the coverage. But the other day I wondered if it was time for a change, if there was something better out there...So I went shopping at Sephora for foundations for 2 HOURS. A dozen foundations later I always came back to the bare minerals which still had the coverage and look that I liked best. Sometimes the grass isn't always greener.I highly suggest giving Bare Minerals a Try, especially since it is all natural. This one however doesn't have the ease that the new formula in the compact does. It's so much easier to use than the loose, so that is one change I'm happy that I made."
1,"UPDATE: 3/28/2012 Recently purchased the FIVE BUCK WEN Shower Comb  with free shipping. Like it better for evenly distributing my brand X conditioner through my hair. The Tortoise Detangler is more like finger-combing your hair. I've gone through many Revlon Shower combs and these two combs do better for me---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Wen System no-pooing trend has encouraged me to change my shampoo routine. No need to shampoo each day OR scrub all the natural oil from your hair. The amount of hair products used and rinsed down the drain made me take notice exactly what the products did OR didn't do beneficially and to alter my hair care routines accordingly.I learned a few things in the process:o Doing as much conditioning in the shower with the steam helps activate hair product (and skin care ones too).o Hair tools like this comb are essential to detangle AND distribute conditioner from roots to ends evenly without too much wear and tear on hair.o It's essential to WET your hair thoroughly to remove the debris BEFORE shampoo, no-poo, or applying conditionero Add moisture/conditioner regularly through (co-washing).o Good tools and hair products makes lengthening my hair from shoulder length to wherever a more likely probability with good hair care.Just be careful to rinse your hair and soap up your body AFTER conditioning your hair OR be prepared for BACK_ACNE... guess how I know :(NOTE: I'm NOT endorsing the Wen System products just the logic of the process. YOUTUBE has loads of ideas for good haircare and skincare :)"
1,"This is a great powder foundation.  I love MAC products.  They are reasonably priced, and they last all day long on my face.  This is a great color and I know what NC30 looks like, that is why I purchased it online.  I recommend it, but you want to be sure of the color if you are going to order it or any other makeup product."
1,"This is the dishwashing soap I used most of the time, because the company gets good marks on the Good Guide website for health and environment.  There have apparently been some social controversies around the corporate governance and marketing practices, but the company is still in the top 15% of all companies surveyed.  The lavender scent smells good, and the product gets my dishes clean without killing my hands.  There are a couple of concerning ingredients that can cause contact allergies, but I didn't have issues with them.  There's also a small amount of 1,2-BENZISOTHIAZOLIN-3-ONE, but it's below the threshold believed to cause problems."
0,"The barrel is too large and cumbersome for those with fine long hair :( Had to return it for this reason. The unit itself looks and feels cheap as well. However, I bought the 3/4 inch one as I thought the size worked better for my long and fine hair."
1,"I've been searching for an alcohol-free toner with 2% salicylic acid. If you're just like me,this is it. It stops the breakouts but doesn't dry out your skin. I use it twice or thrice a day. Wouldn't use anything else."
1,"Nothing else I know goes so well with spring & summer as Anais Anais. It's a fragrance I've loved for the past 25 yrs & still continue to wear it today (not every day, but it's always in my perfume collection). Fresh, floral, bright, vibrant, feminine, clean, invigorating. It never fails to lift my mood when I want a pick me up. On fabrics it lingers for days, which I love. Dries down beautifully & softly. Always a winner.I tried the eau de parfum also but I much prefer the eau de toilette which I find is lighter & fresher. The parfum is heavier in floral scent with more sillage. The price for the large 3.4oz EDT here on Amazon is amazing compared to the 1.7oz price."
1,"- Works very well- Becomes super hot - which my thick hair needs to help hold a style- Pivoting cord at the end is genius, never gets tangled- Easy to use"
1,A great color for you wedding day! Would look great on any skin tone I believe and a is a beautiful sheer. would look great with a french mani.
0,"I was looking for a daily moisturizer that would actually moisturize my face, so when I saw Hope in a Jar on QVC, I had to buy it. I have tried the product for two weeks now, and, all I have gotten is the same result. I have only put a pea-sized drop of this stuff on each and every night, and, when I wake up, I wake up to a cluster of blackheads and zits, usually on either my nose or my forehead. I am also very allergic to a lot of chemicals in beauty products, but this was the worst! I actually have to be put on steroids for 30 days because it is making my asthma and high IGE levels of allergies act up badly. Also, if you have oily skin, BEWARE. I don't have oily skin, and this made me break out in tons of zits, so, imagine what it would do to people that have really oily or oily skin! I am not saying that Hope in a Jar isn't good for everyone. All I know is, it's not good for me! It's Refund Time!!"
0,"Reminds me of a room fragrance plug-in, like the Kitchen or Caramel or Sugar Cookie scents from Bath & Body Work or Yankee Candle, but more layered & sophisticated. I would love this as a home fragrance spray, especially in late Fall and through to the holidays. But for me personally, I can't stand it as a perfume.That said, I love two other Hanae Mori scents - Couture and Mystical Moon."
1,I am obsessed with makeup and I absolutely love this powder! It matches my skin tone perfectly and it blends in well with my bb cream and helps me stay oil free all day with little or no reapplication. I would not be able to wear a bb cream or foundation without it because my skin gets oily.
0,Ok but am not using it.  Doesn't seem to cover the scar on my face like I thought it would.  Possibly my skin is to fair for it.  Just not satisfied.
1,"This toner is amazing! I can't say enough good things about it. I love the light, barely perceptible scent, the fact that it helps to ""set"" my freshly-cleansed face, keeping it clean for the rest of the day.  I recommend it, without reservation."
1,I have 6 year old twins who has sucked their thumbs since infancy.  I struggled to get them to stop. No matter how many deals we made to get them a new toy or throw them a party they couldn't kick the habit.  I got this product and waited until they were sleeping and put it on their fingernails.  They woke up the next morning complaining of a yucky taste in their mouths and from then on one of them stopped completely.  The other won't if she knows I put it on her nails but still struggles only because I am not consistantly putting it on.  It does what it says it works!
0,"I don't get the hype. I have sensitive and dry skin, maybe it's not good for my skin type. This thing burns and then I see no results. I've used this mask about 4 or 5 times. Boooo!"
1,"Nice and moisturizing but too greasy for my face, so I use it on my neck only. and the and"
1,It dries out skin quickly especially if you're living in an area where there is low humidity.  Works on face as well.
1,I have used witch hazel for years as a toner and to make sure all the makeup was removed.  This toner/ refresher has it beat!  Cooling and refreshing and removes ant left over makeup after cleansing!  I am hooked!
1,I use this for lots of things skin and face and I use it to put on  my lashes for 4 hours a day for 3 months I never had bottom lashes now I have long ones and the top lashes look like there fake.. Love love love it. great price big bottle and no shipping after $ 25.00 can't beat it..
1,I am 45 and this stuff works.  I have used a lot of different products since my teens.  I have NEVER been disappointed with Alpha products.  Simply they work.  Alpha product lines tend to fly low in an already over stimulated market of commercials and new product wonders that appear in constantly in an ever changing money making industry devoted to our own vanity (present company included).  But these products work!  I can testify to that.  The best thing is they are high in concentrate and low in price that is an A+++ in my book.
1,"I didn't expect my pores to magically disappear, but I notice they truly do lessen immediately after using this product. What's better is that my skin has cleared since I started using this: I used to get occasional breakouts, but now, that rarely happens. I'd recommend using this before a nice occasion with a pore tightening moisturizer, and your pores will be out of sight for a few hours at least."
1,"I ordered and used the ""clear"" Total Block last summer and while it worked fine, it did lend a somewhat pale affect to the face.  I had read all the rave reviews on Amazon about this product, and I must say it lives up to the hype.  I do set it with powder, there are no claims to water-resistance or long-wearing; it feels silky smooth and the color is virtually perfect for me, right out of the bottle!  The color as-is seems to be a light honey after shaking well; there are two bottles of pigment to lighten or darken to your preference, and instructions are included.  I haven't added any of the color yet; could see myself adding a drop of darkening as the summer progresses.  It offers full-coverage, but somehow does not draw attention to my over-40 lines, and I don't usually need to wear concealer, the coverage is that good.  I tan easily all over, but get the ugliest dark blotches on my jawline and upper lip if I don't keep heavy duty SPF on all the time.  Even the texture is leathery, whereas my unaffected skin is smooth.  So, I use PCA Phaze 13 which works wonders to reduce the discoloration and texture of the affected skin, then I put this product on, and don't have to put make up on top of it!  In Texas, where it is 100+ degrees already, I need as few layers as possible."
1,Has to big a hole in the end and a lot comes out and gets all over eyelashes.  They need a smaller hole so it's not such a mess.  If works but you have to be really careful with it.
1,"I'm ashamed to admit I have a very bad habit of nibbling my fingernails when I drive sometimes, so got these to put on when I drive so that can't do it.  They work great, and think I may have overcome my bad habit....we'll see."
1,"I have tried everything and beside Olay for face, this is the very best. I use it on my body and face, along with the Olay, and the results are wonderful. My skin is soft, not greasy, dewy, plump and zitless. This lotion might be a little heavier than some but my skin likes it. If u have dry or allergy-prone skin, this is for you. I tried a cheaper lotion a few weeks ago and ran back to this. Cetaphil makes several varations, so any skin need can be met. Excellent for ppl like me who hate fragrances! So great."
1,"I had to use around 4 to get my lash to even look different from how it is.  After that, it stays and seem to be waterproof.  Was disappointed as it is suppose to make lash look 7 times fuller."
1,"I saw this color on pinterest, looked it up on Amazon, and immediately bought it!! I cannot wait until it gets warmer so I can paint my toes!! The color is true to the picture and shipping was fast. Thank You!"
1,It is a good enough cleanser for light makeup but not for removing mascara or eyeliner.
1,"I love Spornette brushes and this one is just perfect for me.I love the fact that it is the perfect size and the bristles do not hurt and it actually feels good on your scalp.Way to go Spornett - another #1 brush,Thanks!"
1,I bought this flat iron because it came with the crimp and curling option. My 12 year old wanted to learn how to style her hair different ways so for the price I figured this would be a great start. It takes a while to heat up but it does the job. This is not a profesional type iron so definitley have patience when using it. So far my daughter loves it because its easy to handle and since it has a bit of border around the metal plates she does not burn herself.
1,"The liquid soap at the office is so drying, so I started bringing my own.  While my moisturizing soap keeps my hands from being as dry, they are still in need of lasting moisture.  Now, instead of being so dry they hurt, they're just uncomfortable dry.  I have been spending tons of money for hand creams that are supposed to be lasting, thick and creamy but so far they have all fallen short.  Lately, even the SebaMed which for me moisturizes much better than everything I have tried prior, isn't emoillent enough so I have to keep reapplying between hand washings.  It does make my hands super soft though being 5.5 PH.So far, I like this Aveeno creamy moisturizing oil a little better than the aforementioned product.  I use it exclusively as a hand lotion.  It has a soft, neutral scent and moisturizes without feeling greasy.  I still have to apply it between hand washings but a little less often.  Lately I've been using them together (I start with Aveeno and end with SebaMed).  So far, this has been my best and longest lasting solution.  Maybe I'll experiment by adding quick absorbing, natural oil into it to see if that helps.I bought my Aveeno Creamy Moisturizing Oil at the local drugstore for too much.  Amazon lists it for about 40% less so I'm ordering one for the house through Amazon.  I'm going to fill some travel sized bottles I have on hand so that I can keep some in my purse."
1,this is a super product for people who dont get a lot of acne and just need a spot clear up... This is super get rid of the acne without over drying.
1,"This was the first Astrigent that I have purchased from Thayer and I must say its my fave, I really really like it and the peachy smell is light and settle but u can still smell and enjoy it. Lovin it."
0,"I read the reviews before ordering and have been using it for a few weeks. It does pull out sebum somehow, but it mostly collects on the edges of the suction device and it seems like the suction does help in a way, but I have not seen it actually suck out a plug and collect it on the inside screen. Would I pack it when traveling as a must? I don't think I would. I'd probably bring some Biore strips along with me instead and one of those metal extractor thingies and just try my best with that and a mirror.A few weeks later, I have only used this a few times since I first reviewed because I bought the Clarisonic Mia and that has been awesome! My pores are smaller and I don't have plugs nearly as big as before. I have tried to use the Panasonic pore cleanser after the clarisonic Mia here but it hardly does a thing - I have found that if I just take a hot shower and use an extracting tool by gently dragging along pores, I can extract a lot more sebum than this thing can. It really barely is picking up anything anymore. Maybe my whiteheads are too small or not formed enough. But anyways, it just hasn't been working out enough. For example, if this device is extracting the equivalent of an eighth (more like a sixteenth) of a grain of rice of sebum, after a few weeks of using the Clarisonic Mia, hot shower, and basic metal extractor (or the thing that has the loop on the end) along face, I am getting out 2 grains of rice of sebum. Sorry if TMI! I'm going to see if I can return it."
1,"I love the smell of this shampoo and I think it calms my dog, who hates baths. I like that this product is free from added chemicals, etc. and is relatively natural. Best of all, it makes my dog's fur really soft and I love snuggling with her when she's nice and clean from it!"
1,"This lip plumper was the first and still remains the best on the market.  I've tried numerous other brands (Two Faced, Buxom, Nars and more) and this is the only one that lives up to its promise."
1,I wondered if the added expense was worth it and it is. Makes a strong long lasting nail protection for my weak nails that shred at every opportunity.
1,"I have always liked this face wash, it makes me clean my face and feel fresh without breaking out. I have been using it for 5 years now, and everytime I try a new product, its not as good as this."
1,I was looking for an inexpensive skin brush to start dry brushing. I have noticed a huge difference in my skin! It looks so much healthier and I couldn't be happier!
1,"Sometimes, it's not whether this brand is so great but how every other brand kinda disappoints. Q-Tips are the number 1 brand for Q-tips :)! I have used every other brand, found in countless hotel rooms and even resorts. I love the softness and fullness of the cotton swabs, and this was a pretty good value on Amazon. It is wonderful not to have to go to Target or somewhere else with Amazon offering these types of products online. Thank you!"
1,"This perfume arrived SUPER quickly and in perfect condition: in a brand new, unopened box. I was nervous because I had read some reviews from people saying that they had gotten a knock-off or a perfume that didn't smell like anything. This perfume smells nice; warm and sweet and lasts all day. I sprayed it this morning at 7am and now at 9:30pm, I still smell it just as strongly as I did 10+ hours ago. The bottle itself is a decent size (especially for the price) and looks very pretty on the vanity."
1,"I have been coloring my hair for years, and this is one of the best colors I have ever tried, I have medium Brown hair and I had previously done highlights, this is my second time to use this Color and every time it comes out great, it does have a red shimmer to it, PERFECT for spring time. It makes my highlights pop even more. My hair is soft and shiny and there is no harsh chemical smell to it. I would definitely recommend it for others."
0,"I bought this product based on the rave reviews about using it as a treatment for acne. I currently have a strict regimen I stick to every morning and every night that is the only thing that works for me. I added the Alpha in and have seen no significant difference. It's on par with using 2% salicylic acid, which doesn't do much. I won't be repurchasing this as I don't feel it's worth the money.My products:Morning- 15% Benzoyl Peroxide face wash, 1% clindamycin lotion (prescription)Afternoon - 1% Clindamycin lotionNight - 10% Benzoyl peroxide creamI tried using this in the morning before applying my clindamycin lotion and then again in the afternoon after washing my make up off. It's better than using nothing but barely."
1,One of my favorite hand lotions. The lavender scent is wonderful.
1,"I love the mint julep face mask from this brand, and I love how cheap these are. However, if you are looking for a mask that purifies and tightens skin, I find it ironic that the mint julep does a better job in these two categories that this one is especially for.When you put the mask on it is super flaky and the dry pieces get everywhere. Make sure to leave it on 5-10 minutes longer than it suggests. My skin felt softer and more moisturized, and I think this would be the better of the two for sensitive skin, but don't buy it to tighten."
1,"I first tried this when I received a sample in an order; I LOVE IT.  I could not believe how it helped to smooth my wrinkles under my makeup.  No, it doesn't hide all but makes the deep ones ALOT less noticeable."
0,"YUCK!!!Too bad there's no option for zero star reviews, 'cause this soap deserves one.After three uses, I have broken out in one of the nastiest cases of contact dermatitis that I've had in years.  If you're even slightly sensitive, I've avoid this one like the Plague.Two Weeks Later:  I still have remnants of the rash on my extremities.  I fully expect another week to pass before it all goes away.I contacted Kiss My Face customer service.  Here's their response:Thank for taking the time to write and for your feedback.  Sorry that you are less than pleased with this KISS product. I'll definitely pass your feedback on to our product development team. We love hearing from our customers even when it is less than stellar, and we absolutely do take your input into consideration when developing new products or when tweaking our current line of products. Please feel free to contact me if I can be of further help."
1,"I purchased THAYER rose when I was in China, and I love the smell. And then, this year I came to the USA, and the first product I purchased for facial daily care is THAYER. My skin is sensetive and Oil in T-zone. This product is just fit with my skin type."
1,I couldn't believe I found this for such a good price. I was a little skeptical about buying cologne online but this made me a believer. My hubbie has had it for about 6 months now and it still smells great on him. It's not watered down at all and is a quality product at a reasonable price. I will be ordering more soon.
1,Its not horrible but its not amazing. Just your standard run of the mill lotion. Nothing too moisturizing about it. An overall average product.
0,"I tried this. It didn't work for me but it might work for others based on all the good reviews it has on amazon. It's probably only for certain hair types (maybe shorter and less oily hair). My hair gets oily quickly and when I use this the day after a shower, It doesn't feel clean. It leaves a sticky feeling in my hair and it still looks oily. It also weighs my hair down. The only plus is it smells nice. Powder dry shampoo may be another option, but I haven't tried that one yet."
0,"I sent this back immediately.  There is absolutely NOTHING even remotely ""silver"" or ""red"" about this lip shade.  It is pink with orange which means it's CORAL, not red.  Very disappointing!"
1,"The Neutrogena Eye Make-up Remover works perfectly after two swipes with your removal cloth.  As directed, you need to keep your eyes shut tightly or there is a little sting of the product in your eyes.  The product also recommends rinsing with warm water whereas other products of this type do not."
1,"Cons:1. The covers/rollers will slip off the hair if you're unable to get the cover all the way to the scalp.  In my case, my ear was in the way and I was using the jumbo/large roller.  I didn't want to use a smaller roller because I wanted a bumped look more than an actual curl.  After re-rolling my hair and clipping it again, it still kept slipping off.  Oh well.  The curl that was produced while the roller was on my hair (maybe 1 minute), was sufficient for the look I was going for (I pull that part of my hair behind my ears anyway).  Also getting the clip centered well enough on the roller for it to actually clip right, took a little more effort than I expected.  I may buy some Conair roller clips as other reviewers have done.2. The roller sizes are not what the box says.  I purchased this set from Sally Beauty Supply for $40.  I was supposed to get 6 jumbo, 12 large, 6 medium, and 6 small.  I received 18 jumbo/large (plus the 6 Med and 6 small).  So I was definitely confused trying to figure out which ones were ""jumbo"" and which ones were ""large"", when I realized that the roller itself reads JUMBO (slash) LARGE...meaning, there is no distinction between the two sizes...so at least in the set I received, Jumbo = Large and there were 18 of them.  I'm glad to have so many because this is the size I need for most of my hair, but just a heads up in case that's not what you're hoping for.Pros:1. The curls themselves are gorgeous.  Your hair will look and feel amazing...smooth and healthy.  I only wanted to play with these rollers to see how my hair might turn out...I only left them in my head for a couple minutes.  Just long enough to roll my whole head.  Then, I removed the rollers in the order I put them in, and my hair just looks awesome.  I don't know how long the curls will last yet, but for what I wanted (just a little umph to test it out), I give this two thumbs up!2. The price.  At $40, you can easily leave your flat irons behind and perhaps save yourself some money by not visiting the salon as often.  This is an excellent purchase.3. I love the little booklet that comes with the set to show different ways to roller set your hair depending on your length and hair type.  I am a visual learner primarily, and I LOVED the illustrations.  I really appreciate that there were little arrows pointing to which direction the roller should be rolled to get a certain look.  Very helpful.I have AA, relaxed hair, and I have been thinking of getting these rollers since I was a teenager. I can appreciate them so much more now.  I have transitioned from relaxed to natural twice in the past, and I've decided to stay relaxed and work on using rollers and pin curls to give my hair some bounce instead of flat irons.  I think this steam roller set will align perfectly with my hair goals.  I would definitely recommend purchasing this product.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because of the roller/clip/quantity issues."
1,I'm using this product for almost an year and my hair looks amazing.I'm a natural blond and now my hair is even blonder and shinner.
0,The instructions were simple and it was promptly delivered but the quality of the henna was very poor and gritty. I had trouble getting it out of my hair. The results were minimalI my dark brown hair had slightly copper tones. Later I tried it again with some body art quality henna mixed with lemon juice instead of hot water and liked it much better. It was cheaper as well but I wouldn't put it down for someone cautious for their first time.
1,"An itchy scalp drives you crazy.  Scalpicin works but costs a fortune as you have to spread it all around from a very small, expensive bottle.  Head and Shoulders Itchy Scalp products actually made my itching problem worse.The first time I tried this, I found relief.  After a couple of weeks, my scalp is completely healed. Give it a try!"
1,i've heard that it's very useful so i bought it .I love tee tree oilso i love this lotion
1,The color is great for the fall/winter season. Product was exactly as advertised and arrived in the timeframe promised. Very happy with this nail polish
1,"Neutrogena Light Night Cream IS in fact light, it goes on easy, you only need a little bit at a time, and guess what?  I wear it during the DAY!  It's the only thing I can ever find that isn't greasy, that goes on so smoothly and that doesn't have sunscreen in it.  I've had Melanoma before so I'm very careful about not only wearing sunscreen when I need to, but also not overdoing it and not having it on my face CONTINUALLY.  It's not good for your skin when you have chemicals all over it all the time.  So... the &#34;night&#34; cream is what I use on my face to moisturize in the morning, then if I WANT to put on sunscreen, I do.  There are weeks at a time in the winter when I don't need sunscreen because the UV index is virtually zero when it's cloudy and/or raining, so I like to have a choice about whether to have it on my face or not.  Again, too many chemicals are not good for your skin, so while sunscreen is a great invention and allows us to go outdoors without being burned from damaging ultraviolet rays, it should still be used sparingly."
1,"great for removing makeup from the face! works easily and quickly, deep cleans -- really feels cooling and clean. not irritating my sensitive skin at all. all the makeup really does come off, when I use my toner no more makeup comes off so it really is cleaning my skin very well and it makes my skin feel refreshed afterward. will repurchase."
1,"This is one of those low-key, under-the-radar products in a ho-hum package sold mostly thru doctor's offices. It reminds me of my Asian BB creams or Kevyn Aucoin's Sensual Skin Enhancer -- a thick, dense, full-bodied texture but just a thin layer is needed b/c it's LOADED with pigment--- It comes in a beigey neutral shade that is very similar to BB creams, and then two mini tubes of adjustable color to make it lighter or darker (custom matching to your skintone).The greatest thing is that you don't need to layer on foundation afterwards, building up layers of cakey product. I just put on my antioxidant serums, then Fallene. That's it. I wore it in extreme heat, exposed to the blazing sun for 5+hours, and it protected me all day.My HG is normally Elta UV Physical, which i still love, but it's too sheer for the heat of summer, and I had to add my BE or other foundation for more coverage == cakey layers. So in the warm months, just my serums + Fallene--nothing else. It's soooo covering, makes my skin look flawless and porcelain, and i feel so protected that i just had to rave.How'd I hear of this cult product? I met two prominent NYC socialites at an event here in manhattan and their equally prominent derms/plastic surgeons told them to use Fallene Total Block 60 Tint to wear instead of foundation. These women can afford anything and do whatever they can to maintain appearances. So when they told me that Fallene is all the rage in their ""circle"", i had to check it out.Unfortunately the box doesn't list ingredients in proper order (like Elta, *sigh*) but the website gives all the info on the combo of physical + chemical blockers and Z-Cote, patented boosters.If you're looking for a doctor-recommended high level SS with physical and chemical blockers AND something that acts as foundation/concealer (seriously covers blemishes and everything) -- this is it."
1,"I have stick straight, black Asian hair and was skeptical whether or not this would work or be too harsh, but it worked and looks great!PROS- I left it in my hair for 25 min and rinsed it out.  It is VERY subtle, I recommend leaving it in more for a bolder look.- Hair does not appear damaged, but then again I did not leave it in very long- Other people have complimented me on the new highlights and said it looks good- The end color is really beautiful and goldenCONS- You have to put A LOT of it in your hair (especially if you have long hair).  My problem is that I thought I had enough in, but I didn't.- It's a little challenging to apply evenly and get the back hairs in.  In my case, only the front portions changed colorI would recommend this and buy it again!"
1,"I have natural tightly coiled African hair and have tried other hot oils included pure olive oil but wasn't satisfied with the result. I heard about using VO5 from natural hair forums and thought I'd give it a try. While using it in the shower I wasn't particularly impressed, but once my hair dried, I must say I was happy with the result. My very very tight coils were actually loosened quite a bit and hung down to my shoulder....with a lot of bounce. I will defiantly be using this product again."
1,"I tried this product, wondering about all the hype around the 'Philosophy' brand.  I initially tried a small sample from Ulta and loved it so much that I went with this 16-oz full-size version!This takes off all my waterproof makeup, and does so very very gently.  I have combination-dry skin that is temperamental in colder weather.  This cleanser doesn't ever bother or dry out my skin, and it's a lot easier than using makeup remover AND cleanser.  Sometimes it leaves some eyeliner left in my inner rim, which makes sense because I am not using soap directly on that area.  I get the remnants of liner off with a q-tip - this resulted in the 4-star rating, even though its not a big deal at all.  I highly recommend this product!"
1,Use every day.  Mix with essential oils as a carrier oil and use as moisturizer for my hair.  Love it.
1,My teenage found this on his own and swears by it.  This must be a secret at his high school!
1,"I bought this based on positive reviews and personally find it ""ok.""  I can not believe that other ppl claim the curls last for a couple days! unimaginable! I will say if you leave it in for any more than 15 minutes, you will come out with a head ball of curls (and not very stylish!).  No worries, as the curls die out in a couple hours and relaxes to a very soft wave.  I like this alternative to heated rollers bc it seems less damaging to your hair and at least for me, the results are basically the same (curls only hold for 3-4 hrs), so I chose to keep this set over traditional heated rollers."
1,So many things that are labeled &#34;gentle&#34; irritate my skin but not this - I've bought this over and over again.  Nothing comes close to replacing for me at least.
1,All of philosophy's shower gel/bubble bath/shampoo lather wonderfully. I was looking for a new scent to try and opted for Senorita Margarita. Needless to say the quality is great but the scent is just off. I was expecting a delicious citrus scent but this smells like pure salt and lime in a unflattering way. I wouldn't repurchase or recommend.
1,"*Shrugs*  Seems like most other brushes to me.  I gave it 4 stars because it is a nice brush, but not 5 because I don't see any difference in it from any other cheap brush you'd get at the store."
1,"These clear, silcone toe spacers were the right size between my third toe and pinky toe, however I had a very hard time keeping it there."
1,"This is my favorite leave in conditioner because the smell is great, and I use it when I braid my hair to capture fly aways.  Its really fun."
1,"I have very sensitive dry skin, and this GENTLE face cleanser works great on my skin. It makes my skin feel soft and refreshed. I would recommend this item!"
1,"It works ok, but it's  hard to determine your shade when  you haven't actually seen it.  I use a lot of other products described as rose beige so I thought it would be the same, but it was a lot lighter.  And it is rather expensive."
1,"If you just don't have time for color touch ups as often as you should, this little stick is a big help. It is inexpensive and lasts a long time. It does leave hair a bit dull."
0,I threw this brush away pretty quickly after receiving it.  I thought it would be a cheaper version of the #25 Spornette Porcupine brush but just as good.  I was wrong.  The synthetic bristles were awful. Garbage Garbage Garbage
1,"I've used most of the Jason Body Washes, and this has such a nice,light rose scent, plus it is very gentle on my sensitive skin.  I'd recommend this to anyone."
1,"The moisture part is great, but the anti aging part doesnt really show. The face wash for this line of products does a lot more for me. However, it smells very nice and glides on very smoothly and isn't greasy. I'm going to get it again just because it's a great moisturizer."
1,"I picked ip a tube of this when I couldn't find my usual, more expensive Benzoyl Peroxide foam at the drug store. This treatment gel worked just as well for my mild acne. It took me a while to figure out, but I would highly recommend Benzoyl Peroxide over Salicylic Acid, which usually just made my skin worse."
1,"I enjoy the smell of this cleanser and how effectively it works to remove all traces of dirt on my skin. One small problem is that it's a very liquidy soap, so it can go all over the place when I pump some for use. Another issue is that I have normal, mostly clear skin that can get dry sometimes and this cleanser exacerbated the dryness and stressed out my skin so my forehead broke out a little. I was going through a stressful time at school, so that may have been part of it, but I think I would recommend this only for summer cleansing or for those with oilier, more problematic skin."
1,"I've used MANY nail treatments and these far outweigh all the others. These make my nails much stronger, no exceptions. Sometimes I'll use olive oil with garlic and lavender first and let that dry before putting it on which adds extra strength BUT I am often lazy and do not and the product still works very well on its own and even better that way. Either way, my favorite product and I haven't found one better."
1,i like the tiny heads.  allowed me to get in in tight spaces - even handles of my fridge.  Originally bought this for makeup/polish removal but found other uses.  Rate it 4 because the handle is a bit too soft.  Would like to see it in sturdier handle so it does not bend too easily.  Maybe and additional product in the future so we can have one with softer handle for makeup and sturdier handle for housed/office use?
1,Small amount for alot of packaging. Light coverage that is not well sustained over the day- needs to be reapplied often.
1,"I'm not sure if my review will be read as there are so many 5 star ratings. Tutti Fruiti Tonga is a good choice for a neutral pink. It's a gorgeous color that looks great against fair to medium skin tones. With a tan or darker skin tone, this color will look very light . There's a shine to this color, but not a high shimmer. It takes about three coats to get the full effect. It seems less opaque than other OPI pinks I have. But I just adore this color and think it's a must have in your collection. It's definitely a ""go to"" color if you can't decide. Perfect for all seasons, but mostly spring and summer."
1,"This moisturizes well and does not seem to evaporate or absorb into the skin so much that it feels dry afterwards like a lot of skin creams.  It also does not seem to sit on top of the skin like a coating.  I would probably love it if it didn't have a bit of a bothersome scent (at least to me and I am fragrance sensitive) and I am not sure if it is causing an allergic reaction.  Have been breaking out in some strange bumps since using it, but am still experimenting to make this is what is causing it."
1,"I used this product for years before switching to the Neutrogena Healthy Skin formulation, which contains glycolic acid. I loved this moisturizer. I did not find it too oily or greasy - one of the reasons that I switched to it was becuase I found it to be much lighter than the Clinique Daily Moisturizing Lotion that I had been using. I could even use this product during the summer, when it is very hot and humid where I live. Neutrogena makes great products. Highly recommended."
1,Good solid product for my husband. Since he has yet to use it a follow up review with come after this.  Thus far very happy with the delivery service and quality of the brush.
1,"As far as base coats go, I have tried them all, and China Glaze Strong Adhesion is, by far, the best. My polish stays on like crazy, even at the tips where it always rubs off first. I will never buy another brand of base coat. I can't believe more people don't use it. Try it once and you'll see for yourself, it's awesome!"
1,"I purchased this at the suggestion of a blogger who posted a tutorial on using this moisturizer mixed in with your usual foundation and it has really made a difference in how the foundation is applied. When used alone, it's non-irrating and highly moisturizing and works just as well as the very expensive creams. I will make this my primary moisturizer."
1,"I had bought this shampoo because my skin would easily become flaky after cleansing both hair and scalp.  All I had to do was wet my sectioned hair and scalp and apply a dime-size amount of the shampoo and lather. Leave the shampoo on for at least 3 minutes. I leave it on until I have applied to every section part of hair and after rubbing gently my scalp to remove the scalp flakes.  Then I will reapply, and sometimes, I will add an essential oil that can assist the shampoo.  I like this shampoo because it works well for my scalp and it cleanses both my hair and scalp. It helps also with detangling my hair, so that is a great help. The shampoos scent is light, nearly nonexistent.  I think if the shampoo doesn't work well at first, then combine it with essential oils like tea tree oil, cedarwood oil, neem oil, karanja oil, peppermint oil, and other oils that fight fungus and balances sebum of the scalp like ylang ylang essential oil. I hope this review helps you."
1,Its just like putting lipstick on your grays. Waxy and the same tube shape. It works Im not unhappy. I bought another brand I like better that feels like a thick pen marker.
1,"I like the ombre look. So i decided to try this after all of the tutorials Ive watched.Long story short, I think this look is okay.....Its definitely looks better with your hair curled, like a light wavy....But thats just my opinion....Its a very nice product, everything you need is right there in the box.You can achieve any look with this.i will say my first time, my hair did turn brassy copper color.But i bought a second box by accident and re did my color, and its a nice honey blonde....."
1,"I absolutely love this soap-- cleans well, does not seem to leave residue on hands, yet light scent remains.  The honeysuckle scent is lovely and natural-smelling.  Highly recommend.  I've found some of the other Mrs. Meyers scents (geranium, bluebell, rhubarb) a bit overpowering/others have been disliked by at least someone in the family.  This is just a lovely scent (we also use the honeysuckle dish soap and counter spray).  Highly recommended."
0,"I have oily, acne-prone skin that is also sensitive and prone to redness when trying new products. Since Neutrogena's whole advertising campaign from pretty much day one has been all about how gentle their products are, I decided to try this stuff. Well... my face didn't like it. I used it nightly for 3 days, and on day 4 noticed red, dry patches on my face. By day 5 the patches began to flake, and I stopped using it.Since I didn't use this toner long enough to see whether it made a difference in my pore size, I can't speak as to its effectiveness. But if you're like me and have tried many acne products on your face, and have developed sensitive skin as a result, this is not the product for you."
1,"The first experience that I've had with mineral makeup was with Ulta's mineral makeup. I was subjected to ugly makeup lines and was severely unimpressed. After visiting Sephora, the salesperson convinced me to allow her to demo Bare Minerals on my face. First she (what I call) pounded the foundation in, for use as a concealer. Next, she used a buffer brush and made circles all over my face with the product. The end result was nothing short of spectacular. I could not fathom the difference in quality between BM and Ulta. We ended up buying the foundation and lip gloss from the company. I have never gone back to any other foundation and have found that my skin is actually improved with this product. I would not recommend sleeping in it, as the company says is encouraged.. But if you are too tired to remove your makeup (which people often are) don't fret about having it on still. Your skin should be fine.Bare Minerals recommends that you buy their ""special brushes"". That's a sales tactic. Any foundation and concealer brush of good quality will suffice. In fact, I bought some very good quality brushes at Kroger by a company called ELF for a whole dollar. The same sort of brushes Bare Minerals are selling for much more.Now the iffy parts about Bare Minerals. From a distance the product makes my face look flawless. I use Avon's multi colored bronzer (browns and pinks combined) or my Ulta Bronzer on top for a glow. Otherwise, I look very ""powdery"". At the nose and chin, where my pores and more noticeable the product creates nasty powder pore areas; which is not pretty at the least.This product is not quite perfect, but its pretty well near it. Always use a moisturizer before hand or a foundation primer."
1,"I purchased this steam facial machine for my wife. Although I use it too. It does produce a lot of steam in a short period of time. I have to add a pinch of salt to the water, since our tap water in Georgia is very soft.It does double duty as a room humidifier.  By removing the face cone it will produce steam into the room.  A nice addition for wintertime.  It's not going to replace a stand alone humidifier but works in a pinch.Good value for the $$."
1,"Smells great! Skin is soft and smooth with matte finish. I also use Exfoderm and my skin is slowly transforming into younger, fresher skin. Using for 2 weeks from today's date."
1,"Doesn't perform on my skin quite as expected.  Has a different odor, not unpleasant, just different.  I'll finish the jar, but not sure it's done much.."
1,"Saw this polish on Alison Sweeney (Days of Our Lives and The Biggest Loser) and it looked so good I had to have it. Apparently a lot of other people thought the same thing because she identified what it was on her website. It is a great look, a dark grey that has a blue or green undertone as the light hits it from different angles. Has a lovely metallic sheen to it too. I like it almost as much as Opi's Over the Taupe, my favorite."
1,"I have so many of these MAC singles and some have a wonderful texture, and some do not. This one does not. The whole middle is quite hard and my brush doesn't pick up color there, but around the edges it's great. Nice and smooth, blends well, good shimmer (not glittery)... the color is a little yellow on my super pale skin though. Not the gold I was hoping for. If you're a pale redhead, maybe find a warmer gold tone."
1,The richness of this Mac Studio Fix Powder Plus foundation formula is astounding.  I totally enjoy using this product daily.
0,"I bought a bottle of this, and they sent me two, by accident I imagine.  I have psoriasis, with a few spots on my scalp.  Hoped this would help out, but I didn't see a difference, I used both bottles, and let it soak in my hair for plenty of time when showering.  Didn't see any results.  Decent shampoo though, hair feels clean."
1,"Awesome sparkly polish! OPi does jelly really well! This color isn't as HOT pink as I'd hoped, but it's so glossy, sparkly and so saturated in jolly rancher goodness!I have all the sorbets except Texy. It's impossible to have a favorite. Fantastic formulas all around; apply like a dream."
1,"I love it. I just found the color I want to use forever. I'm sick of using permanents since they are more damaging. I like to dye frequently to keep it a vibrant red. I'm also sick of how permanents lighten hair, and how difficult it is to manage root growth and to keep an even color. (My ends get too dark from porosity). My hair is getting fried and I need a healthier, long term solution that doesn't involve henna.With Cinaberry my hair didn't turn out like the box depicts, but it's probably because I only left it on for roughly 6 minutes, from beginning to finish, and my hair is pre-lightened from previous permanent treatments. I'm also a natural redhead, so it's easy for me to pick up a decent looking red, since I naturally have the right undertones for it - it's just that my hair has turned real muddy brown since I hit 30 and I need help to give it back to that knockout red.I didn't want to leave it on any longer than 6 min total because, judging from the box, this carries purples tones and I did not want to grab too much of that. On my light auburn hair it came out a perfect red, far better than what I was expecting...kinda like Christina Hendricks' red, but maybe not as blondish...just a hint of purple tone as to not make it look so orangey. It's a true red red, a perfect balance of orange red and purple red, which I have NOT been able to successfully find in a semi-permanent until now. It's as bright of a red as I can get and still keep it looking somewhat natural. (I'm not looking to get a manic panic red going on).It all depends on your current color, your natural color, and how long you leave it on. Your variable is how long you leave it on, so I would experiment with different times using test strands. The box says to leave it on from 10 minutes, but depending on what you are looking for you may want to change that around a bit.I'll prolly have to dye it again in 2 -3 weeks if I want to keep it looking like this, since it is a semi-permanent, but to me, it's worth it."
1,"This is a superb quality rose water, wonderful for body, and room freshening. I love rose waters and this is the best for quality and price for the best scent. The bottle is not fancy enough to enhance your vanity but looks are deceiving with this little bottle. Pour this rose water into a beautiful container and anyone who didn't know would think you paid much more than this for such a potent rose water. Other rose waters which cost ten times the price and come in fancy glass atomizers are disappointing to me in terms of the rose scent quality. This one is top quality. We love this scent and the high quality, pure rose essential oil they put into this product to create this water. The best part is it is certified by laboratory testing to be free of pesticides is not tested on animals. A heavenly scent!"
1,"I love this leave-in cream conditioner! It makes my hair tangle free and smooth. I have used this for a long time. My hair is dry, with the natural curl. Love this stuff! I just hope they keep it affordable...."
1,"For the past few years I have begun to develop a VERY oily skin type, especially in my tzone. It's frustrating to keep the shine off your face and makeup on. I've often felt it makes me look dirty/sweaty in pictures and in person when, in fact, I take great care of my skin. In addition to how oily my hair gets, my forehead sometimes get broken out from all the oil.Normally, I use Avon cleansers, Proactiv, and Korean skin care products in random rotation. After I discovered this facewash though, I find it's a must to use every morning before I put on my makeup. It doesn't solve the problem completely, but makes my life so much either. My makeup isn't sliding off my face by the middle of the day. Highly recommended in combination use with an oil-free moisturizer."
1,"I got this in the mail today and walked back home so fast I was so excited! I wanted to smell it! Well it smells exactly like the real presume that costs 2 arms and a body and two legs. My BF smokes and first he said, I can't smell anything, and I said Well, if you don't like it its your smoked up nose. He took a shower and I chased him down like a little girl, I said try again, smell it. He said Oh yeah, I like it! Winner,,yippie! I just love it, I am going to buy one for my twin. She Loves this sent as I so do~ Its so exciting I am still so excited!! I do Love it. I am in Bed and put some on! Its Heaven in this bottle! I would say to any women, if your wallet is like mine and you can't afford the real stuff, then Buy this!"
1,I got this to replace my nearly out red nail polish. This polish is red hot and I love it! Gives you that glam look.
1,"I purchase this at my local Walgreens for $7.99.  Are you kidding me with this price????  It's good but it isn't that good, sorry."
1,It is really safe for hair and takes like 30 minutes (for my thick hair) to make nice curls! Too bad I can't attache picture)
1,"This is what I always use - in fact, I combine it with another color for the outcome I prefer. It is economical to buy it this way."
1,The shape and spikes on these headbands were irritating to my head.  A super-slim plain band served me better. The combs that fit behind the ears are also quite large and hard to place unless you have really thick hair.
1,"I use this after I wash my face and before I put on makeup.  I use it morning & night in the winter, and at night in the summer, on my face and neck.  It does not take much at all to cover a lot of area. One container lasts me forever!  My brother even uses this in the winter when his skin gets so dry.This doesn't clog my acne-prone pores at all! And works wonders very quickly! (I like to think it also helps me avoid wrinkles!- I haven't gotten any yet!) This moisturizes without that greasy feeling some products can leave you with.  I highly recommend this!1smileycat :-)"
1,Duo Brush-On Lash Adhesive is so much easier to use than the glue from the tube. It goes on white and dries clear. Lashes stay on your eye lids all day and night.
1,"I got this product from Walgreens and it serves all of my needs, it is fragrance free which is great because I don't even realize I have it on during the day (unlike other spf facial products!). It has a great consistency, not too thin and not too thick, so it keeps my skin moist. It is the perfect lotion - it is not greasy and doesn't make your skin look shiny. It doesn't emit fumes into my eyes even when I use it in my eye area. It does make your face a teeny bit whiter than it is because of the ingredients but it's not that noticeable if you spread it well and not leave smudges of it, so I'd definitely suggest checking the mirror after you applied it. Though other people said the pump isn't great and clogs, I never had that problem, the lotion comes out smoothly and easily, and I can put the right amount of pressure to get the right amount I want. I'm very satisfied with this lotion!!"
1,Comes in handy for after surgery when you can't shower but still don't want to smell like a garbage dump.
1,Tended to break me out on my chin and along side my nose. I suggest getting the enhanced cream instead.
1,"This stuff rivals Maybelline Great Lash as a contender for the best cheap mascara brand on the market. Almay's One Coat Nourishing Mascara goes on smoothly and clump-free. It's easily biddable, and while it's not quite as lengthening as I would like, it's a perfect mascara for work. I've never had any issues with flaking. I recommend it and will repurchase it myself."
1,"I recently bought the pantene pro v heat protection spray for curly hair, thinking it would be healthy for my hair because I have used the relaxed and natural in the past, and it would make my hair really soft.  However, after I used it with my flat iron, it made my hair feel dry and my flat iron actually burned my hair WITH the heat protection spray on it, so that was a waste of money.  I started using this before I flat iron my hair, and it actually protects my hair, it hasnt been burned in quite some time since using this.  I also put this on my hair at night before I wrap it and it feels really soft in the morning.  I recommend this as a heat protection spray and also as a leave in conditioner, though I still use my.  Its just if my hair feels dry, Ill reach for this before my leave in conditioner most of the time.  My only gripe is that it doesnt smell too good, but thats ok because I put a bunch of stuff in my hair that does :-)"
1,These caps are excellent.. Value for money.. Good quality.. Cover the whole head.. Comfortable elastic plastic.. I like it and would buy again
1,"Prior to knowing better, I subjected my poor baby to conventional baby toothpastes.  She hated them and she'd gag when I brushed her teeth.  Not only that, I can't believe some of the ingredients that the popular companies use in their toothpastes.  I actually hadn't heard of this brand until I was researching safe products on the EWG Skin Deep website.  This toothpaste was rated as the safest of children's toothpastes.Not only am I very happy with the ingredients and tooth-cleaning ability of this product, I'm also happy that my toddler LOVES this stuff.  Seriously - I almost dread brushing her teeth at night because she throws a tantrum every time we're finished.  She loves brushing her teeth more than those Cyndi Lauper sound-alike Sesame Street Muppets did back in the '80s."
1,"Love the lemon smell and the thick cream that instantly enhances my cuticle condition.I was ripped off by this seller but think I paid for the lesson to goole the price before placing on line order.All in all, I'll keep on buying this."
1,I love the Bare Escentuals and the Bare Minerals makeup it is lighter. On your skin I already have eyeshadow from the bare Minerals line anyway. And the colors are just right nothing to dark or to light. just the right color and there is a little glitter in them and that gives your eyes a little sparkle. it was a personal chose to use the Bare Minerals make and I have liked ever since I started to use the make.
1,This color is SO gorgeous.  I am in love with it for spring/summer and will wear it often.  It's bright but not overpowering and has good wear time.  Highly recommend!
1,"This brush does an effective job of stimulating the scalp and brushing the hair, without breaking the hair.  I've never used it when blow-drying my hair -- my hair's long and I like to use a brush with a large diameter, to keep the hair straighter -- but my guess is that it would work very well with shorter hair."
1,"I am in love with this scent, it smells clean and fresh. If you layer it with the lotion and perfume, it will last all day. Makes a great bubble bath too!!"
1,"If you read other reviewer's comments you'll find the actual ingredients are chocked full of chemicals; ""Naturals"" seems to be a misnomer. I must admit I like this product anyway. It is an economical multi-purpose item. It smells great and is:+ an excellent shaving lotion, cheaper than most shaving gels.+ a good light conditioner+ a curl reviving mist when mixed with water in a spritzer: 1 part conditioner to 2 parts water and scrunching works for me+ a deep conditioner when mixed with your preferred oil (jojoba, almond, olive, coconut...), apply and wrap hair in warm towel TWICE or about 15 minutes+ a leave-in conditioner for ends only!+ a decent valueDownside of the product:- it's prone to build up and requires periodic use of clarifying shampoo.- needs to be alternated with another conditioner, I use Mane & Tail as well as Aussie 3 Minute Miracle.It's only 4 STARS because it's slight residue doesn't do well for me on hot humid Texas days; mixed with my scalp perspiration  it gives me the ""cooties"". Does better for me in the cooler weather.FYI: When co-washing a la the Wen System way make sure you wet your hair and scalp for about TWO minutes BEFORE you apply the conditioner. The water dissolves/removes other products and allows this to both work and rinse better."
1,"My Mother wears this Polish only. It is beautiful to wear alone or over a color of your choice. It stays on, no chipping.The flecks are very very tiny and they are multi. It looks silver only but it isn't. I will be buying more of the Carnival.Great delivery and price."
1,"As Essie colors appear lighter in the bottle than when they've dried on your nails, I wasn't sure if Cocktail Bling would be gray or purple. I purchased it, tried it, and was quite pleased at first, as it appeared light purple. But this is one of those *funny* colors that seems to change a lot depending on the lighting. Sometimes it looks light purple, sometimes it looks more blue, other times it seems to be an odd pale bluish gray. I really wanted to like this but I much rather a polish with a more reliable and discernable color.Bobbing for Baubles, on the other hand, is a very nice shade of navy blue. I was worried that it would dry too dark, but am pleased to report it didn't. I really like it but think it looks better on shorter nails. Of the 2 colors I liked enough to buy from the winter 2011 collection this was the definite winner. Unlike Mezmerised [sic] which looks better on light skin tones, Bobbing for Baubles looks just as beautiful on darker shades of brown. I'll definitely file my nails down a bit just to pull this color off."
1,"This really works, but is very strong. Only place on blemish. It will dry up the blemish in 1 day, but if put on healthy skin, it will dry and irritate. Wish it did not have the tint, but would still recommend this product as a quick fix."
1,I bought dermablend cover creme to cover my acne scars & dark under eye circles. This product is hard to use but can do a great job once you figure out how to apply it. You have to make sure that your skin is fully hydrated & you need to warm it up so that it goes on smoothly. I am using a Mary Kay primer before I apply this makeup & it seems to help. I purchased the colorless setting powder but I wish I would have bought one with some color to it instead. Matching your color is very difficult when using the website so I would advise everyone to go to a nearby Macy's or Ulta to find the proper match. Good luck!
1,"the front of the bottle says oil free, but if you read the ingredients, the first one, and several after, are oils! it does the job well, but leaves residue"
1,"so glad I found this mascara, was spending tons on designer mascara only to achieve the same effect. wish I could get this in stores."
1,"First, I thought I was getting a hot air brush.  This product doesn't work real well in my hair.  It could be that I haven't mastered using it yet. It takes about 7-10 minutes to warm up.  I always end up using a flat iron after using this product because I don't like the end result."
1,"I've been using Neutrogena body oil for years now and I absolutely love it.  I'm known as the cream queen and I use this after my shower while I'm still wet.  After I pat myself dry, my skin is definitely softer and protected, especially from winter dryness."
1,"Here's why this is my favorite deep conditioner to leave in: I had been using the GPB conditioner pretty steadily for awhile and then I switched to another Aubrey Organics conditioner that someone had praised on a discussion board. So I tried that one for 2-3 weeks but what I noticed was that my hair looked nice but was less strong and showed some signs of breakage during detangling - minimal breakage. I immediately switched back to the GPB and I saw an immediate difference. Also the one curly haired 3C person I know with waist length hair has used GPB for over 10 years - that's proof enough for me.Pro'sVery rich, moisturizingGreat Leave-inProtein acts as hair strengthenerCan also be bought at Lakshmi's Cupboard Online Store"
1,"I bought this product with much hesitation, thinking it was another &#34;too good to be true&#34; item.  However, it ACTUALLY WORKS!!!!  Put this stuff on a blemish, and it shrinks/eliminates it overnight!  I love this stuff, and it is a &#34;must have&#34; for people who get break-outs!"
0,"The brush worked very well; however, the tips are so sharp that they created cuts on my scalp.  This is totally unacceptable.  Replaced with Cricket brand which has nice round tips."
1,"I love the rose scent in this product.  Very subtle and soothing.  No burning because it is alcohol free and does not leave a sticky feeling residue behind, only smooth skin.  My face loves it, therefore I do too!!!"
1,It doesn't bother my eyes like other products and it feels good when applying. Good buy. Would recommend to others.
0,Almay make-up remover towelette like  wipes are much better than these Almay pads.  These pads irritated my eyes because they are scratchy and they have soooooo much oil on them.  One word: Horrible!  I have to use a paper towel to soak up the oil first before I put these on my eyes and it's still that bad.  I only got them because I love Almay make-up towellete like wipes.  Boy was that a big mistake.  Stay-away from these pads.
1,So the color came out similar to what I expected BUT it made my ends SO much darker AND now I have to dye again already because the gold base has been turned orange by the sun so buyer beware
1,"I have naturally curly hair, so I don't often brush my hair during the day, but after a small mist I can re-comb through my hair with this brush and not have everything start flying up.  As a note, even with a small mist of water or even anti-static hair spray other brushes would still cause static and flyaways."
1,Great top coat.....Healthy Hoof Lacquer .5 Oz....I bought several and gave them as gifts and stocking stuffers!~ Very very inexpensive.  I would recommend this product!~
1,I'm a fan of this toner & find that with my oily skin it doesn't make it worse (or really better). But the smell is nice.
1,I receive more compliments  when I wear this than with my $75+ Eau De Parfums!- It's smells sweet and fresh- Decent longevity- Inexpensive- Anyone youthful minded/spirited can wear this
1,"Orgasm blush now been around a while and is a classic must have in your makeup bag, it gives the skin a nice color with a shimmer.  This is a must have, I also like LoveJoy.  Nalo Jones professional makeup artist based in Los Angeles, [...]"
0,"I have never dyed my hair before so I had the requisite virgin hair. It is a soft black and I really wanted the color lifted rather than bleached to a brown color.  I wanted to stay away from bleach because I did not want my hair to turn orange.Prior to dyeing, I didn't wash my hair for a day. I followed the instructions.  I wanted a subtle ombre effect so I only applied the dye from chin length to the ends. I left it on for 30 minutes. The effect was so subtle, I could barely tell anything had been done to my hair!Having gotten over my fear of dye, the next day I went on a dye rampage (not advisable given the fact that no professional has ever colored my hair - I just watched a lot of Youtube videos).I wanted to stay with the ash/cooler dyes to avoid the orange effect so I chose the L'oreal sun-kissed caramels UL61 hi-lift ash brown. I washed my hair first with a clarifying shampoo, blowdried then followed the directions. The color lifted at least two shades of brown, which was good.But I didn't stop there. I then washed my hair again with a clarifying shampoo, blowdried, then applied Garnier Olia 6.3 light golden brown (which, by the way smells amazing. The L'Oreal has ammonia and made my nose run and my eyes burn). It made it darker. Not good.So I washed my hair again with a clarifying shampoo, blowdried, then applied another layer of the L'oreal sun-kissed caramels UL61 hi-lift ash brown. My hair was the right shade of subtle dark brown. I love the effect of my soft black hair's subtle gradation to the brown from roots to tips.If you're fearing for the damage to my hair, you're not alone. I figure 20+ years of no chemical processes and then 4 box dyes in 24 hours should balance each other out.  Anyway, I applied the Pantene overnight miracle to my hair and now my hair feels even softer than before.The next day my hair lightened even more so it is now a rich chocolate brown.Final verdict: If I had to do it all over again - I would have skipped this one and just used the L'Oreal sun-kissed caramels UL61 hi-lift ash brown the first time around."
1,"If I am to understand every source I've seen, this oil should be protected from light. I dislike that it's packaged in a clear bottle for that reason. I also dislike the fact that it lacks any sort of dropper top. The oil itself seems very pure, works as expected (and yes, it has a strong odor that some people find unpleasant, but that's the nature of the product)."
1,"While this curling iron is pretty standard I LOVE the heat resistant cover and auto off features. With teens using it, all the extra safety features are really nice to have."
1,"My husband has been using this product for over 6 years now! I initially bought it for my stretch marks from my first baby, however, since I bought the product, I have had 2 pregnancies thereafter therefore, I could never use it. Then I told my husband because it was expensive, and I see that it had other benefits aside from the stretch marks, for him to use it.So ... for this review, I cannot say what and if Strivectin DOES help with stretch marks however, as for age spots, uneven skin tone, wrinkles, crows feet .... IT WORKS! My husband is NOT old, however, he is 40 this year and EVERYONE I meet always says my husband looks like he is in his mid to late 20's!!!!! I started to notice my husband's uneven skin tone, discoloration when he was about 33 ... then the wrinkles around his eyes and forhead even when he was not squinting. Now, please keep in mind although Strivectin does claim you will see results within 28-30 days if you use it religiously and sparingly 2 times a day, GIVE IT MORE TIME. I started to notice my husband's AMAZING results after about 3 months ... then when it got to be 6 months ... SERIOUSLY .... NO WRINKLES at ALL, even when he'd smile!!!! His discoloration went away at least 85%, my husband's skin is totally firmer, tighter, more youthful!We cannot live without this product! Using it sparingly, a bottle like this could easily last you a year to a year and a half! WOW! What a great investment! Seriously! What you pay is soooo little compared to the AMAZING results you will see with this product. I am now 28, approaching 30 and I now see discoloration and age spots on me, I am probably going to have to start using this too!!!! Otherwise, for my husband ... he would NEVER use anything else! The smell ... the color of the product ... who cares? It works! The stinky smell is VERY little a complaint compared to the AWESOME RESULTS and benefits you see with this product! I wish everyone knew about Strivectin and that everyone would try it.When people ask, I tell everyone my husband just takes very good care of himself ... but the truth is, it is ALL Strivectin! Don't go without it! This is the best purchase you will ever make and invest! Do not spend your money on expensive procedures at the hospital (unless you have the money), otherwise, other than spending every morning 2 minutes or so and every night, 2 minutes or so to do this to achieve AMAZING results for VERY little money, then this is WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR and MORE! Love LovE Love it!"
1,"I love these but feel a bit profligate ordering something I could probably concoct at home. There appears to be some mild soap, witch hazel and aloe applied to compressed fiber pads which are disposable....Not very green. I use them more than once because they lather so richly and after two uses, I clean my sink and vanity with them. They don't strip my skin of all of its oils and leave my face feeling fresh without any irritation. The only improvement would be to have the lotion and use my own wash cloths...."
1,"I bought this for a friend who has two daughters with long hair.  Once she puts the conditioner in their hair, she can detangle very quickly using this comb.  They all love it.  (Even the kids got on the phone and thanked me!)"
1,Gorgeous curls!!!!! These curls are effortless and bouncy. I'm in love!!! I feel like a diva after I finish.  Highly recommended
1,I spray this on everything! I even mix it with my vitamin C. Love it. I go through several bottles a month. Worth every penny.
1,"All these beauty treatments work ok but honestly they won't tell you that Vasoline works as well as almost all of them and better than many of them and is almost free.  Just put a little on your face before bed, especially around your eyes, cheeks, forehead, lips and you will be surprised how much it erases crows feet, wrinkes, dry patches by morning.  Your lips will feel smooth and soft all the time too.  You'll expect to break out more, but I have been breaking out much less with almost no acne.  The vasoline is all absorbed by morning, after a couple weeks it almost looks like you had a mini face lift.  The effect only seems to last about a day so you need to do it every night.  I don't goop it on like a prize fighter, but it looks a little shiny when I am done.  And a whole jar costs $1.00.  You don't even need the name brand stuff.  I wouldn't do it during the day, you'll look greasy.  Just each night before you go to bed.  It is amazing."
1,"I been searching for years for a good product and like most women have spent an amount I wont even write about! This product makes my very complicated,  honey brown, freckled, dry, oily, mature and acne prone skin look fabulous. I use this at night with the Ole Henrikson Vitamin C Booster serum and  &#34;Hope in a Jar with SPF (25)&#34; in the morning.  I am fighting the slowly coming parenthesis around my mouth. This has stemmed the tide!My face feels amazing and I know longer have flaky skin. My acne has calmed down considerably and I follow my beauty routine now because it works for me.This is the least expensive price I have found for the same exact product. Get it!"
1,"I have a standard poodle, so I need to be very careful about what kind of shampoo I use on her coat.  If I use the wrong one, her coat ends of matted and all kinked up.  This shampoo worked fine on her coat, leaving her fur soft and making her smell very nice.I would have given this shampoo five stars if it had slightly more conditioning power to help detangle her coat as much as possible to make it easier to run a brush through her fur."
1,Love the curved brush my reliable stand by brand is great product works well and is easy to apply.
1,I love this product and quite frankly I'm kinda mad it took me this long to discover it.  I have extremely oily skin and constantly struggle with acne. With this product I am able to get a deeper clean for my skin and improve my complexion. It is very relaxing as well. I play some soothing music in the background and I feel like I'm at the spa! Excellent way to end a busy day.
1,"I have been using dermablend for years. I have Discoid Lupus, and I was left with very dark marks on my body after the rashes healed. I have been so self-conscience about the unsightly marks. When I found dermablend I was excited that I was finally able to wear my cute short sleeve tops and short skirts again. I mix two colors: caramel and medium. The key is to moisturize your skin before applying. Make sure the lotion is dry,then apply. I dust a little powder on first to get rid of the wetness of the lotion, then I apply the makeup evenly using a little and adding more as needed; a little goes a long way, and dont forget to blend the edges. I let it set for about 5 min, then I dust it with powder. I can swim with it and even shower and it doesn't come off until I use soap. The one con is that it does rub off on your clothes a little. I don't have any problems getting it off in the washer, but if you are trying to do a spot treatment it is hard to rub off."
1,"This is my favorite hand, feet, cuticle ointment of all times. It is thick and it smells of lavender and herbs. It keeps my hads well moisturized and my cuticles soft."
1,"IT Stays works.  I used it with my thigh high compression stockings until I upgraded to full length stockings that stop just at by bottom.  Those stockings don't slide, so I still have my IT Stays to use when I go back to the thigh highs."
1,Product is very nice.  It cleans my pores and makes my skin feel smooth and look much healthier.  Its a must have.
1,"I was looking for a toner for my face and wanted to make sure that I picked the correct one since i suffer from Cystic acne. I read the reviews and I must say, all that was written was TRUE !!"
0,"I should have gathered this from the name, but this is a green with tiny bits of gold but not the color I expected. I don't find it flattering and use it on my niece cause she is easily pleased."
0,"I purchased a set of brushes as a backup for when I clean the first set I got (handi buki, flawless face and full coverage face). These brushes were not the same as the ones I purchased from the Bare Escentuals section at Ulta the week before. The handi buki is smaller, hard and the bristles do shed like made. The other two brushes are also harder and shed a lot in comparison to the brushed purchased in store. None of them apply the product as well as the good ones. It did not apply the foundation nearly as well as the original. It is horrible. I will go to Ulta and purchase a new proper set so I wasted my money here.The name printed on the side of these brushes is id Bare Escentuals. The GOOD brushes bought in store do not have the ""id"" on them. This makes me wonder if these brushes are not genuine?FYI the real BE brushes available at Ulta are fantastic."
1,"I'm inching my way towards 30 and decided to get on the wrinkle care; better to prevent than treat, right? I was intending for this to be a day cream but it is WAY too thick. It absorbs beautiful at first but within a few hours of apply this my highly acne prone skin turns into an oil slick! (It does with 90% of products) You only need to apply a tiny pea sized amount to the ENTIRE face. I still love this product despite all that! I have since started using it at night and it works WONDERS. My pillow cases absorb all the excess oil that my face might put off and this cream leaves my face feeling hydrated and silky in the morning with NO break outs! I use persecution strength acne medication (Epiduo) that some days leaves my skin dry, scaly, and flaky beyond belief. This is the ONLY thing that will get rid of the dryness in a single night and at the same time not encourage acne to pop up. (I used this product prior to being on Epidou as well) During the day I have been known to apply this VERY LIGHTLY to any troublesome flaky spots but it always requires that I dab off extra oil at a certain point. (So make up will come off if you apply over this)."
1,"The product is wonderful. I have combination skin and this moisturizer is wonderful, it doesn't over-moisturize. The price on Amazon is great and you pay no taxes...great buy will likely continue to buy through Amazon."
1,"At this point I'm about to place a second order for this product.  I really like it so far but mainly at this point for how it feels to use.  I like the thickness and richness and really like the container...you squeeze it and the cream pops up.  very user friendly.  I have dry skin and I do love the way my skin feels all day with this lotion.  so far, I can't say much else after a month of use...i just love the way it feels."
0,"I absolutely love this color, I just feel ripped off. Original Essie varnishes are .5oz(15ml) this bottle contains 0.46oz(13.5ml) and the information on the label is incorrect."
1,"First off, a bit about my face.I have combination skin; oily in the summer, dry in the winter.  NY weather.For those with dry skin:* I only use this cream in the winter.  NY summers are high in humidity therefor no additional moist is needed for my face.* Make sure to stir with clean tool, or finger, as there's oil in it, which separates when just setting.* Make sure to use an SPF on top of this cream as it is NOT one.* Allow for skin to absorb the cream before adding the sunblock (I used an organic; Fleurs de Soleil SPF 30)* Depending on how dry your skin gets, amount usage will vary.* Excellent for after shaving cream.* It does not make skin greasy nor oily.* While it has a natural fragrance it does not overpower cologne/perfume.  Fades quickly.I had no reactions to it.  I totally recommend it.  I like to try different organic products so that my skin can react favorably to them."
1,My wife has eczema and this worked flawlessly on her armpits. Smells good and works good. Try it for yourself and you will not be disappointed.If this review helped you please let me know. Thanks and happy shopping.
0,"Overall, it sits on my skin and I wouldn't be able to put makeup over it because it doesn't absorb into my face.  My face ends up looking sweaty even though I haven't broken a sweat!  The product also has a strong chemical smell like a very cheap sunscreen.  It is also drying, which is weird for a moisture lotion.  If you sweat while wearing this, you will get white streaks on your clothing and face.I've kept this bottle for only one reason and that is to use it if I run out of the good stuff and that isn't often.  I guess you get what you pay for.  This is cheap as in price and in quality.  I highly recommendAveeno Smart Essentials Daily Nourishing Moisturizer, 2.5 oz.over this one."
1,"I love this color!! It goes with everything and is so classy. I accidentally ordered two and am happy I did because now I have extra! The price was just right as well, cheaper than getting it at drug stores."
1,"I am 34 years old, fair skin, dark blonde hair, blue eyes. Due to the price I am only giving this 4 stars. I never thought I'd be one to spend this much on makeup. But after buying this once, and then trying other blushes afterwards, I really find this is the perfect shade for me. Not too dark, not too bright, not to light, not too orange. Just the right perfect ""glow"".  Hard to get past the price, but I am forking it over since I have a wedding coming up."
0,"First of all, this is tricky to use.  Especially if you have short layers.  Second of all, the curls I achieved from it, I don't really think are any different than a regular 3/4"" barrell curling iron.  The curls weren't all that defined in some spots, and some had a crimping spot from the little clamp.  I'd skip it and get a normal curling iron which does the same thing and is easier to use."
1,"A light moisture and does the job, the fragrance is pleasant. a good moisturizer under makeup.  The price is a lot cheaper than the same product in the store."
1,An all time favorite of mine. Just a little goes a long way.  I never get tired of the scent and it works for all occasions.
1,"I've used this product for about 40 years and it is still excellent.  Ever so often I have been enticed away by other creams, but I always come back to this cream.  The lotion is great too."
1,"nice clean rose scent, dries smooth does not take alot to cover body good or after shower or bath just as expected"
0,"I used to use the Neutrogena moisturizer for sensitive skin, but decided to try this since my skin does tend to be oily. The lotion itself is very thin. Instead of my normal one application, with this lotion I need to apply twice, otherwise my face is dry and flaky--once after getting out of the shower, and another time before putting on my make up. The 2 stars is for the fact that my skin does look and feel good using this lotion, but there are plenty others that do just as good a job with just half the amount."
1,My favorite facial cleanser ever! My husband and I both use it and it works great. It gets all my makeup off without having to rub too much.
1,"I have been using BE for many years and I still love it. I have tried others and they just don't stand up to BE. It has terrific coverage and is so light (not heavy) on the skin. Natural and Comfy! This blush stands up to BE's reputation, which is outstanding. This is a perfect Spring color. Though it looks dark on the site, it's a nice pink-rose shade. I know I'm going to enjoy it as much as all other BE products. Thanks BE and Amazon.com!"
1,"Ole Olay!  Olay is the only moisturizer I use these days.  I admit I have tried others, I always go back to Olay.  Well done, Olay, well done."
0,Smells terrible! I cannot believe Olay would sell a product that smelled so strong.Very disappointed!Good moisturizer! Smells very strong.
1,WONDERFUL ADDITION TO MY VANITY AREA ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE ROOM.  CAN USE IT FOR MAKE UP AND FIXING MY HAIR.  GREAT BUY!! VERY STURDY.
1,"I use these for when i deep condition my hair.  They are convenient, easy, and durable.  I highly recommend this item to anyone who dyes, deep conditions, or treats their hair."
1,"This bar worked great for my hubby's tinea versicolor, but it is pricey.  He used it everyday so it does not last very long but there were visible improvements in the texture of his skin in roughly two weeks"
0,"I used this twice and had to give up. After using it, I got horribly painful cystic pimples. Not sure if it's supposed to work like that, but it's not worth it to me. Wish the seller would refund me, but no luck.I just started using a 40% glycolic peel and it's already worked 200% better than this. If you can handle an at home peel, I suggest it!"
1,If you share your shower with a spouse and of course do not use the same products there isn't a cleaner looking way to unclutter the look.
0,"I order the black toiletry bag, but received a brown one.  The zipper did not glide smoothly and the leather was stiff."
1,"I know there are some very long reviews about these. Here are my suggestions:1) watch the Youtube video and read other blogs/reviews on how to put them in. I had success my first time using and I think the extra research helped.2) I do feel pressure; it isn't true for me that you don't feel anything. I don't seem to have any extra cramping or discomfort other then feeling pressure in my lower, lower abdominal area though.3) I suggest taking these out in the shower if you can or follow the directions about using a medical glove so you have something to put it in to throw it away.I bought these mainly to use for intimacy during that time of the month and for that purpose these have worked great. I don't use these exclusively and still use tampons/pads as well. My partner has been thrilled with the results."
1,Love this conditioner! It's thick and creamy consistency. It made my hair very soft and easy for detangling. The smell is blissful.Not only is it good for co-washes for also as a leave-in.
1,"I've been wanting to purchase a body oil ever since I received one as a sample. I went to Target one day & unexpectedly found this with the rest of the Palmer's stuff. I didn't even know they had a body oil! I saw the price & quickly put it in my basket. This stuff works so well! Ever since using this after every shower my boyfriend now says all the time how soft my skin is ( he doesn't even know I use body oil!). 4 reasons you should purchase this: Palmer's doesn't test on animals, low price, smells so good, & it works!"
1,"I have extremely sensitive and acne prone skin, so I was hesitant to try this, however this cream has exceeded my expectations!!  When I opened the jar I could tell this cream was extremely high quality. It doesn't have the appearance or consistency of &#34;commercial&#34; creams and when you apply it, it absorbs into my skin so smoothly.  It is the middle of a Minnesota winter and my face and hands feel very soft and moisturized.  The calendula is soothing and the oils are blended for the smoothest application.  It is more of a heavy overnight cream and I would be hesitant to put it on under my makeup during the day, but it is perfect for overnight.  It seems too heavy to put around my eyes, but it works well on the rest of my face, neck, and hands.  I'm sure it would work well on any area, though.  This is a product I will order again and again!"
0,"I bought this from a beauty supply store.  It was very muddy/grainy and hard.  It was also hard to apply and didn't stick to my hair.  I left it in for HOURS, like about 6.  When I washed it out, which didn't take as long as others said but was still a dirty job, my hair was not covered.  It looked a little darker but the gray came back within DAYS.  Usually when I wash my hair, the grays disappear and then when it dries, there they are - once the leave-in conditioner is gone.  The SAME thing happened with this ""henna"".  I don't know much about henna, but this didn't seem to be a good quality product.  Anyway, that was 6 or 7 hours of my life that I will NEVER get back.  WASTE of TIME.  Save your money."
1,It says you can use it to remove eye makeup but I haven't been able to do so without it bothering my eyes. I thought I could use this to replace eye makeup remover. It's okay for my face but I probably won't purchase this again.
1,"This applicator is slightly on the small side, and can make it difficult for a liquid eyeliner beginner with an unsteady hand to apply. That being said I have used liquid eyeliner for quite some time. This is my perfect little gem. It does not cost much. I have repurchased it. Small applicator leads for smooth accurate application. I have sensitive skin- it did not irritate me. It came out very black. Perfect!"
1,"This is a pretty good lip balm, but I wished it smelled like Neutrogena's Lip Remedy. For being Neutrogena and being more expensive then regular Chapstick, I expected more. But overall, its a good lip balm."
1,I like this serum because it makes my face feel so soft and smooth for hours after applying it to my face.
0,"I bought this sometime ago, the one star says I hate it. I don't, it just did not work out for me."
1,"If you are not a flashy person and would like a pale pink innocent look for your toes - well, this is it! Diva Bride color is perfect. I first tried it at a salon, and now I own a bottle! I love the color, the right consistency - not too thick, not too thin. Dries out very quickly.Lasted a whole month on my toes (undercoat, 2 coats of China glaze, top coat) and would have lasted longer, but my nails grow very fast.It lasted 3 days on my hands - no under or top coats. Just two coats of Diva Bride. I wash baby bottles and dishes by hand every day, so it took a lot of abuse, but still had a very nice shiny look to them and didn't chip. I must say - I am impressed. Other polishes don't last a day."
1,When I was told to try this; but when I did; I loved it...Yes; it does what it says...I love it!!!
1,I got this to help with my acne.  It does seem to clear up my skin a bit.  I really like the price and I tried the Alpha Hydrox lotion but didn't like it as much as the foaming face wash.
1,I like the smell of this oil and it does seal in the moisture for my hair nicely. I still have lots left over and I had this for about a year.
1,"Perhaps nothing else influences the perception of age and health as much as the appearance of our skin. Glycolic acid, one of the mildest forms of alpha hydroxy acid, and a naturally occurring compound in sugar cane, aids in exfoliation and promotes healthy cell growth to replace the outermost layer.  As a precaution, I purchased Reviva 5% Glycolic Acid Cream first to acclimate my skin to it's effects.  I used it at night after gently cleansing the skin to allow it to penetrate more easily. To err on the side of caution, I left that milder cream on only 20 minutes at night before rinsing it off, making sure there was no excessive reaction or burning, and gradually increased the time until it was left on all night. I noticed results even after a single week of use with my skin feeling softer. When I felt my skin had acclimated, I ordered this higher 10% concentration and followed the same gradual exposure schedule. My main concern was darkened sun spots on my forehead that I hoped to lighten or even eliminate. After about a month of combined and gradual use, I am astounded at how effective this cream has been. The spots are at least 50% lighter and I feel certain that they will, in perhaps just weeks more, be gone completely.  In addition, the overall tone of the skin is more even and uniform as well as being more supple. No over the counter product will miraculously make fine lines and wrinkles vanish, no matter what promises are made.  But what it has already accomplished has made me wildly enthusiastic and I can easily recommend it. I bumped into a friend at an airport this week that I hadn't seen in a few years and she seemed baffled, asking what my secret was to looking younger than before. So that was a much appreciated testament that I attribute to the exfoliation effects of this cream. Everyone's skin and sensitivity is different so I would encourage the same gradual exposure as I patiently built on. At least one reviewer here expressed upset at actually being burned with this stronger concentration after being happy with the 5 % solution, emphasizing the need for caution and not being in too much of a hurry but appreciating that this is still acid and respecting it's potential. I might add that I now apply it liberally and apply over it some oil, presently preferring Moringa Oil, and keep it on while I sleep. One perhaps obvious footnote, is that I make certain to wash my hands thoroughly after applying it to avoid touching or rubbing my eye in my sleep and the pain and irritation that would be certain to cause. I give it a very hearty recommendation, especially considering it's comparatively modest price compared with some exorbitant designer creams or treatments at an esthetician."
1,"this is now my favorite falsies glue! it is soo easy to use, I love it! it works well, holds well, the tube is full, and I recommend this to anybody, and I would prefer this glue to the tube glue for strip lashes, just because of the ease of use!"
1,"I am using this in tandem (switching nights) with other products that provide chemical exfoliation for my horrible skin, so it is hard for me to speak about its effectiveness specifically. That said, I do know that I have had no problems with this product. I was concerned that it would irritate my skin, as I am certainly prone to irritation and redness,  but I have had no such issues at all. It seems to be the gentlest of the products that I use. My skin is looking (relatively) fantastic lately, and this probably has something to do with it!"
1,"This isn't what I expected nor wanted. Even then, It's not ""wow"".  Will keep on looking for something better to replace my faithful old brush :("
1,"I got this as part of theClean & Clear Advantage Acne Control Kitand this was by far my favorite part of the kit - quickly addressed any breakouts I had. I did not care much for the  moisturizer so stop using it, the face wash ran up quickly, but the mark treatment has lasted for a long time. I don't put it all over my face but only on my problem spots - I would not suggest using it on  areas that don't  need it or they will dry out. It is 2% salicylic acid so it does burn a little when you put it on, but dries out the pimple quickly.When I get a zit/pimple I want it gone quickly so I attack it with a vengeance. I put this on it AT LEAST three times a day until it is gone - which takes no time at all with this  product.Now that you can get it cheaper as an add-on item and/or get a subscription to it (thus making it cheaper) I cannot imagine why anyone fighting acne would pass up on  this!!!"
1,"I love this color 56 Auburn Brown, get complements on it all the time.  It does tend to fade faster than the John Frieda foam in medium red brown but at this price (7ish) it's a bargain."
0,"The fast shipping is the only good thing about this. Even though the bottle says it's ""mademoiselle"" but it is clearly not the right color. It's suppose to be a ""classic grown-up pink"" according to Essie's website. What I got is a beige color and will no way be noticeable on my nails. I bought this hoping to save a bit of money and a trip to the drug store, but don't waste your time with this. I can't even return it now because Amazon says it's considered hazardous waste. So now I'm stuck with a color that I didn't even want and is completely useless."
1,"Since my now 4-year-old son was three months old, he's sucked his thumb.It's rare that we can find a photo of him without his thumb being in the vicinity of his mouth; not always in but definitely nearby at the ready!My husband and I have tried everything to get him to stop this horrible habit: promises of rewards, pepper, Tabasco sauce....you name it, we tried it.Taking into consideration that my now 13-year-old sucked his two middle fingers until he was three (stopping on his own), we even tried waiting it out.However, after doing plenty of research, I learned it is an absolute must that children stop sucking their thumb by time their permanent front teeth are coming in; which is typically around the age of 5.Not to mention that I really didn't want to send a kid off to kindergarten still sucking his thumb.After all of our other efforts appeared to be fruitless, I decided to give some ""reminder fluid"" a try.Searching all of the information out there on ""reminder fluids"" and reading personal reviews on each product, I opted for the Mavala Stop for Nail Biting and Thumb Sucking.Wow! Is this stuff amazing! Hindsight makes me wish I'd saved all the trial and error and started at this point.Just minutes after applying the first coat, I saw a streak of little person running to the refrigerator to grab some water. It tasted that horrible!Since the first time I applied the stuff to his thumb, he's never sucked it again. Just to ensure the breaking of this orally unhealthy habit, I applied it a few more times but it really wasn't necessary.Mavala Stop is easy to use: paint on thumb as you would nail polish, dries clear within seconds. Although the smell and taste is horrendous, it is non-toxic and safe for consumption."
1,"Good for detangling but still confused about the shape of those teeth, other-than that it helps to detangle 80% of the tangled hair especially after the shower"
1,"This bowl has been a perfect gift for my husband.  I bought it along with the soap and he absolutely loves it.  It's beautiful, stays clean, and keeps the soap really nice.  For all of you who love nice shaving items I would definitely recommend this."
0,"If you already have access to Retin-A or Renova, skip this product.It's definitely a wanna-be.I got the set of cleanser/retinol/moisturizer, and took it all back. This was the ONLY item in the box that didn't have a nauseating smell.Try Anew Wrinkle Corrector instead, if you don't have access to prescription topicals. You'll get results and it costs less than this product."
0,"This does not seem like face soap to me.  For starters, it is iridescent in appearance.  It also has a very noticeable fragrance - one that I would expect more from a body wash instead of a face wash.  And it doesn't lather - I need two full pumps to rub over my face because it won't lather.  I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Clinique and didn't find it here."
1,This is a great organic soap however it doesn't last very long for the price...it will leave you squeaky clean..but it dried out my skin...I need something a little more moisturizing.
1,"These headbands are awesome. I prefer them over anything else. Not saying much, since I'm a dude. I just need my hair out of my face when I wash my face or lounge around doing man things. My sister is trying to steal them from me though, so there's a woman's endorsement.These do tend to stretch out so if you have thick hair or a huge head (guilty on both for me), they might stretch a bit."
1,"I didn't find this hair turban to be any more beneficial than a regular towel.  Other than it being lighter weight.  The absorbancy wasn't better, and my hair wasn't dryer."
0,"I dont know if they changed the formula, this felt different from previous 2 bottles that I used.It burnt my skin!!! Also the smell was little bit different from previous ones."
1,"IO purchased this for my girl friend because she always bought the cheap stuff.  I figured if I wanted her to use the better, more expensive stuff I'd buy it myself.  Her hair looks much better now.  I bought her two boxes just to demonstrate what she could look like.  No it is up to her to decide if her appearance warrants the &#34;good stuff&#34;.I recommend it.Gunner, January, 2014"
1,"Based on the reviews, I expected this to be a good concealer- I purchased the yellow corrector one for under eye circles. The yellow doesn't blend very well and it is sort of dry so it doesn't glide on easily. Compared to Cover Girl concealer sticks, this is an inferior product. The Cover Girl stick is much smoother and creamier."
1,"I'm new to this and this was great for me. As noted, the mediums seem to be the most universal best fit for people. As a newbie, these were super to easy to use when accompanied with the Duo dark adhesive."
1,"Love, love, LOVE this stuff - but do not, EVER use it in your hair! It will dry the living daylights out of it! It smells amazing, and it lingers all day! Philosophy stuff is the best!"
0,"This powerful smelling cologne generally turns people off when I wear it.  My co-worker who happens to be a smoker told me the smell is so strong that he can even smell it when he smokes outside the building. From deduction, it must be a colonge for smokers only."
0,"I like most of you tried Bare Minerals after seeing glowing infomercials. I'm only in my late twenties and don't have many lines, but I feel like the foundation aged me twenty years. My skin was dry and taut and it actually made my pores look larger. I felt like it sapped all the moisture out of my skin. This product might be good for women with oily skin who live in humid climates, but if you live in a dry climate like me, do not buy this product! I've found better products at the drugstore, Neutrogena Healthy Skin Tint is excellent for the price and it will leave your skin looking a whole lot better."
1,"Very nice fresh rose scent. I think it would work well as a room spray, skin spritzer, or linen water."
1,"I use this on my face as a toner. It smells wonderful, and leaves my skin looking radiant. I will be buying more of this product!"
1,"After I saw that an unbiased testing lab had given Regenerist highest ratings and noted it was one of the few products that produced visible results, besting products costing multiple times as much, I decided to give it a try.  Now I don't leave the house without it.  Nothing gives miraculous results regardless of advertising claims.  But for my skin it goes on very easily without oiliness or a greasy feel and seems to be absorbed instead of just sitting on top of my skin unnaturally, giving it a health hydrated look and feel.  In the past it had an SPF of 30 and now is only 15 I noticed. Perhaps to achieve 30 causes too much of a &#34;white&#34; effect some consumers didn't like, just speculating. So If I plan on being out in direct sunlight , I switch to another Olay product that I also like very much, Complete Daily Defense All Day Moisturizer, which has SPF 30 but does have a more pronounced whitening tint on the skin. Very happy with the results as well as the reasonable price, so I can recommend it highly."
1,"I spray this product on my torso before working out to prevent breakouts. My aunt puts it on face towels, which she then refridgerates, and uses to freshen her face after working out."
0,"I picked up 183 Pine Tar Soaps (4.25 Ounces) at a going out of business sale. I thought I was getting a good deal.Turns out the Soap smells horrendous and caused me to gag and itch all over when I used it on my [blank]. I had to toss all of them out.If you are prone to skin allergies or aroma allergies, don't get this one."
1,"The perfect bright red color. Exactly the shade I was looking for. As someone who used both OPI and Essie in similar colors, I can say that this is definitely the better brand to use."
1,"This is definitely a superior product that has changed my skin cleansing routine for the better. I am a complete fanatic when it comes to my 48-year old skin. I bought these wipes because I needed something to use when I travel overseas, and I don't like carrying soap. This has turned out to be a breakthrough product for me. First of all, I have very sensitive skin, prone to break outs with any oil based products. I use these wipes now instead of Obagi cleansers, as I think they are just as effective, soft and non-irritating, and my skin is perfect now. I get tons of compliments from women and men alike. It is so much easier and involves less mess than soaps. On occasion, if my skin gets dry, I use Aquanil cleanser and these wipes to take off the cleanser, then moisturize with Aquanil. I use this cleansing regimen and alternate retin A, Obagi C Rx serum with hydroquinone, and Obagi C Rx exfoliant and my skin looks like I'm 30 years old tops. Also, my son now uses these wipes--he is a teen and has acne, but these are great and convenient and oil free. He is now more likely to clean his face often with these because of the convenience. I've tried two other wipes similar to these--clean and clear, and Aveena."
1,This cleaner is always awesome and I have ordered it many times over and always come back to it.  It isn't drying and cleans makeup well and works very well with my clairsonic.
1,"I bought the Spornette Super Looper Hair Brush to comb out my wigs. It was an Amazon Add-On item, but I am so glad I elected to add this item to my order. It was money well spent as the brush easily removed the tangles without breaking the wig fibers. Wigs aren't cheap, so I was so happy to have smooth looking wigs without breaking the fiber.I highly recommend this brush.MR"
1,"Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Concentrated Amino-Peptide Complex, Fragrance Free - 1.7 fl ozis, in my opinion, Olay's finest product to date.First, it's fragrance-free.  Men can use it too.It contains ingredients that help maintain the integrity of the epidermis in a silicone base.  It can be used under sunscreen or alone at night.  It can be used under makeup.  In fact, because of the silicones used, it's a bit like a primer.This serum is suitable for all skin types, though if you have dry skin,  you may want to apply moisturizer over it.  It's non-irritating and non-sensitizing.It contains antioxidants, peptides, and niacinamide.  Olay touts niacinamide as being a sort of miracle ingredient.  The advertising for skin care products drives me a bit crazy, because they can only deliver so much.  Olay's claims aside, I am 100% crazy about this product.  My skin really does look better - and no one is paying me to say that.I do not buy the Regenerist Eye.  I use this for my eye area.  Regenerist Eye has a slightly different texture, but otherwise it's the same product at a higher price.The fragrance-free version of this product is definitely worth trying, regardless of your age or skin type."
1,I RAVE about this stuff. I have never had a cr&egrave;me soften and heal my very dry skin like this one.
1,It is a quality brand which lasts far longer than others I have used. The colors are always fun and amazing; they stay true once applied - that I really appreciate!I recommend OPI to anyone who  wants a good nail polish which will last and look great!
1,"I mix this with aloe vera juice, a bottle of rosewater with glycerin, spring water and this bottle of rosewater. Works great to moisturize my hair daily and then I seal with jojoba and caster oil and my shea butter. Smells great but the scent does not last long. I have been using for about 2 months and my hair loves this much better than just plain water. My daughter took my first batch so I had to purchase another one for myself. Great for if your hair is in braids too."
1,I bought this specifically to carry in my small sling purse. It works wonderfully with my thick heavy hair. Very very pleased with this purchase.
1,Ok so I wanted a buffer I could use with my face cleanser that was suuper gentle so I could use it every night with my face wash. It is gentle but if you press at all it is not so gentle. So just don't over do it with the srcubbing. easy to hold and use to scrub face. TIP: You should only be exfoliating with this at night because exfoliating makes your skin a bit red. So make this your night time routine.
1,"I am always on the lookout for astonishing nail color.  I do not have pretty hands.  I have a lot of red in my skin and dark, bright polishes seem to emphasize this.  I have tried Essie Ballet Slippers and Essie Mademoiselle, but found them to be just a bit lighter than what I wanted and it also took at least four coats to produce the desired result. Who has time for that?  Two coats of Delicacy covers well; three is better followed by Essie topcoat.  My nails look neat, finished and not bare but they don't scream ""I've been polished"" either. The polish has just enough pink to give definition with a very slight pearl appearance. It's a perfect shade for me."
0,"I got this to 'set' my liquid makeup, but this just doesn't work. It cakes up quickly and it doesn't set my face at all"
1,"This review is for Essie's Borrowed and Blue, a very pale blue (not baby blue, but Easter/Spring/Summer gorgeous blue that makes your tan pop!)This polish is gorgeous. It's not too gray, not too white, not too blue. The pigment is well-mixed, does not go on streaky, had no trouble with bubbles. This is an OPAQUE color by Essie. Two coats is more than enough for coverage. Add a self-leveling top coat such as Seche Vite and your nails will look great for a relatively long time. No chipping and came off very easily with acetone--I think I was able to get away with using only one cotton ball to remove! It does not stain your nails (there isn't really enough pigment for that) and it's appropriate for work, beach, interview, you name it. If you have a tan, this polish will really pop!Highly recommended."
1,"It's very refreshing and you can see the difference  when applied.  My face is refreshed , bright  and feels very clean and soft .  Thanks I love it."
1,"Every time I pick it up from the glass shelf where I store it, a few more bristles have fallen out. It does a nice job but I can't say it's well made."
1,"I've been using a dish sponge, yes, you read that right, a dish sponge to wash my body in the shower.  Granted it's a nice spong, the kind that has a mesh lining on it and costs about $3 at my local grocery store...but I thought it was time to commit, to an actual body sponge.  I'd read on here, after researching, that the Buf-Puf Double sided body sponge was pretty awesome, so I went ahead and ordered it.  I've used it 2x only and I have to say, I get excited (don't look into this too much please) about scrubbing down in the shower now ;-) I also hate mushy soap and use most soaps that come out of a container but a friend gave me a beautiful bar of soap and this scrubber grabs the soap so it's left fairly dry (the soap) and doesn't just sit there (like I'd let it) and build up into a soapy mush.  The sponge is definitely a strong scrub on one side, good for elbows, legs and maybe your hard to reach places on your back.  The other side is soft enough to use on your face, neck, inner arms etc.  Overall, I love this little sponge!"
1,"I cannot tell you how much I love this! I am 26...almost 27 and I have fine lines, large pores, occasional acne and uneven skin tone and texture. I have heard that retinol is the miracle cure for all of the above but those I had tried dried my skin and made it red and flaky. This is perfection! I add a pea sized amount to my night cream regimen and I wake up with better skin! If I have an early morning gym session I don't even need to wash my face or use tinted moisturizer! My skin looks its best right as I wake up which I'm sure my husband loves.  I have experienced no dryness or redness or side effects. I LOVE this product! I also love that it was MUCH cheaper on Amazon than at Sephora!"
1,I ordered these because my face has been looking haggard lately and needed something to tone my skin.  These work great after just two uses!  I noticed a difference in my face already.  The only con to these is the very strong smell! It got near my eyes and they were a bit sensitive to them (my eyes are sensitive to begin with).  It might not bother the average person but I did feel the scent was a bit strong (Although I do like the scent).
1,"I have been using this soap for the past two years on my picky combination skin.  When I first started using it, I only used my hands and this soap to wash my face, then I started using the soap with a washcloth, and I've recently started using it with a Buf-Puf.  This soap does a great job at removing face makeup (primer, foundation, finishing spray) but since it stings a little, I wouldn't recommend trying to get eye makeup off with this.  To remove waterproof eyeliner and mascara, use an eye makeup remover prior to washing your face with this soap.It can be a little drying if you use it in conjunction with other oil/acne control products (benozyl peroxide especially), so make sure you have a heavy-duty night moisturizer.  For night moisturizers, I have used Burt Bee's Radiance Night Cream, plain shea butter, and the Nubian Heritage Shea Butter w/ Black Soap Extract and Aloe. The shea butter worked great to maintain balance in my face."
1,this product really work for me had no rash on my skin or bump..i notice about week using this product really skin change different..the seller ship it real good and fast too had no prob ...
1,"I tried this mascara for several years ,its best, wont harm eyes, its wash away easily, when i apply it, my lashes look longer and more"
1,"I've used this 4x already and it works well; it is very relaxing.  It was just the cheap little steamer unit I was looking for.  I steam my face then cleanse it while my pores are open ... or steam my face with my favorite mask on (Eminence Clear Skin Probiotic Masque Skin Care, 2 Ounce) to help it penetrate more deeply.  I'll update this review if the unit ever fails so folks can see how long it lasted.  :)"
1,"I love this cleanser. It is gentle but removes all my eye makeup easy.  I dont need touse an eye makeup remover.  This is just the perfect cleanse, and it is a great value"
1,Based on the ingredients this is a good aloe product but the smell is off putting.  Enough that I warned my family when they asked to use it they might not be pleased with the scent.  It looks about as good as it smells in the bottle but disappears on the skin.  I don't need a perfumy smell but one that didn't make me go Ugh! would be good.  I drink aloe vera so I know what it smells like and this is a bit too medicinal for me.
1,I have used this product for years first recommended to me by my dermatologist. It is the only thing that dries and clears up my forehead acne!
1,Usually this is the only thing that I have to put on my face at night after washing. I have very dry skin If I do not use this. I have used it every morning and night for about two months now & I have noticed that my skin is smoother and healthier looking. I also use it on a cotton ball as a makeup remover because it is good for sensitive skin yet effective. Will definitely be repurchasing when I run out!
0,"I've been very discouraged lately at the changes in hair color.  It used to last much longer, and the color was better.  This time I tried Medium Auburn, and it said to leave it in for 20 minutes.  I left it in for  45 minutes just to be sure, and there's barely any color.  My hair is soft and shiny, I'll give it one star for that. But I could get these same results using a deep conditioner, and it is FAR too expensive for that.  I guess I'm going to have to get brave and graduate to henna."
1,"I have finally found my perfect Toner- and this is coming from a self-described, product junkie. I love this toner. It's alcohol free so it doesn't dry my skin, but it contains witch hazel which helps with breakouts and tightening pores. And then there's a lovely rose scent, that makes me happy every time I use it. Plus it's paraben-free- which is something very important to me. One of these bottles lasts me at least 2-3 months, so the price is actually pretty reasonable. I definitely plan on purchasing this toner again and again. :)"
1,My knuckles get extremely dry and cracked during winter months. I have tried numerous types of lotions (OTC and medical samples). This stuff is cheap and excellent! I use it nightly and it gets the job done.
1,I've ordered this several times now.  I use it in almost all of my homemade cleaning products.  Smells great and works wonderfully.
0,"I'm not sure if I got a faulty product, but the ""hot"" air was not hot. It was lukewarm at best. As such, it did nothing at all to my hair except make it extremely frizzy. No curls or waves.You might have more luck than I with this product. And because Amazon allows you to return this after you've opened it (I've already spoken to a rep and created a return tag), no harm in trying. It's just not for me."
1,By far the best Castor Oil product Ive bought in a long time! Quality vs price is great! Thank you for such a great product!
0,"I've used Bare Escentuals products for years - foundation, warmth, glee, mineral veil and blush. It worked well and looked fabulous until I hit 60. Now it sinks into lines and wrinkles and makes me look older. Hard to switch at this age and I'm no makeup artist but tried several high definition liquid foundations - Chanel, Smashbox - and I looked considerably younger. Don't know how true but they say powders make mature skin look older and I believe it. After 20 years hated to give it up but vanity won out and I now use liquid high definition foundation. It's been a good run, Bare Escentuals/Minerals!"
1,This is a good every day facial scrub that doesn't seem to cause any negative reactions to my skin.  Leaves my skin feeling really soft.
0,"I would give this no stars if I could. This made my skin so greasy. It also burned. It left my face so red and it felt like it was on fire even after I washed it off. It made the skin on my face peel like I had been sun burnt, I had to take this stuff back!"
0,"I am not happy with these products. The steamer doesn't create enough steam for a facial, even with holding a towel over my head. I can hear & see the water bubbling and can't help but wonder if it's going to bubble boiling water onto my face. The facial scrubber it comes with is a peice of crap as well. Looks like it was made in the 1980's, and made cheaply as well. Very disappointed. Will return."
1,"I you love bathing in oil like I do, you'll love this one. This one leaves you with a very luxurious, silky feel. I massage it onto my scalp, my hair... unlike Castor Oil, coconut oil, olive oil or almond oil or any other one I've used, this one's lighter. You can easily remove it with shampoo.I massage it all throughout my face (never clogged pores), my body (unlike coconut oil, I hope this one doesn't grow hair. Yes, if you like your hair on your scalp or anywhere else to thicken or to grow, use coconut oil)This acts as a wonderful conditioner for the hair. It's natural, it's organic, it's inexpensive, I love this oil."
1,"I have used this a couple of times so far, and I love it. Never used this brand before. It files quickly and without requiring too much pressure. I hope it lasts!"
1,I prefer very exfoliating sponges and scrubs and these were not so. I guess they may be ok for everyday use.
1,"I used to love this toothpaste for my toddler. It was rated a 0 on EWG's skindeep database, which is the best rating a product can recieve. Then Weleda changed the formula and it now has a not so great rating. We have switched to Jack and Jill Naturals toothpaste, which is rated a 0, offers TONS of nice flavors, and is a pretty good price too!"
1,"These things work wonders! I can't believe it!  of course its temporary and you would have to use them ALL the time but they work.  At least on the frowning crevices between my eyes they leave them flat by next morning.  Downside, its paper, you look ridiculous with these on so no looking sexy for hubby at night! lol  you would have to use them every day and every other day once you achieve desired affect.  Pros: They work, not too pricey easy to use .  I love them, until I am able to get Botox I will use these."
1,I've been using this as shower gel for 8 years.  It's great.  It's very economical as it only takes a few drops on a loufa and suds like crazy.
0,"I've been using Rogaine since it came on the market, but recently noticed that it inflames my scalp and that I'm losing hair rather than growing more, as well as experiencing dizzy spells after use.  In truth, I think Rogaine works in a way similar to a root lifter in that it makes you appear to have more hair when you use it, but when you stop your hair appears much as it did before.  The best hair growth was on my face.  I'm blonde and developed peach-fuzz on my cheeks, and single dark hairs on my forehead and cheeks as well as my chin.  I'm post-menopausal and realize that hair growth happens, but since stopping Rogaine I no longer have a facial hair problem, other than an occasional dark hair on my chin.  I'm content to use Pantene Anti-breakage shampoo/conditioner and a styling gel.  My hair looks better and is certainly less brittle and dry.  It also is a better color than during the years of Rogaine use.  Those who are blonde may notice that the roots always look darker when using Rogaine, and hair greys more readily.  There are several articles on long-term Rogaine use online, and I think I've reached the point of diminishing returns with this product."
1,"I bought four products from this line--the Regenerating Lotion with UV, Daily Regenerating Serum, Night Recovery Moisturizing, and the Eye Serum. After two weeks of use, I'm pretty pleased. I'm skeptical by nature, and I wonder if anyone notices the change produced by skin products like these other than the user. But, I think this stuff does make the skin around my eyes look smoother and lighter, and it certainly moisturizes without being greasy. I have pretty sensitive skin, and I haven't had any redness or irritation, and certainly no pimples. I also don't notice any scent. I find eye creams especially irritating (Clinique was AWFUL for me!) but the eye serum is very soothing. I'm pleased with the results and certainly the price!"
1,"This works good. Burns very little (i hardly notice the sting from it, and it only lasts 3 seconds). I haven't noticed a skin improvement, but I have only used it a few weeks. It is a good face moisturizer and I plan on continuing to use it."
1,"this product works miracles. it help repair your hair as well as protects it from heat, but be careful because it is a protein treatment to much will break your hair off"
1,I've been using Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser and Peter Thomas Roth Anti-Aging Cleansing Gel with good success for the last year.  I decided to try Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash based on good reviews (see beautypedia dot com) and a sale price.The first time I washed I used way too much and took awhile to wash it all off.  After that I switched to pea-sized squirts and it foams up and cleans great.  My skin is dry to normal and I haven't had any of the problems reported by the low reviews.I'll continue to alternate the three products.
0,"i purchased because of its good reviews hoping that it would calm my eczema, unfortunately, i found cetaphil to be more useful ;/"
1,"I was sceptical, but it works. It really unclogged my pores, made them smaller and made blemishes disappear over a few nights. I like consistency-lightweight and absorbs quick, with no residue on the skin. It's gentle yet effective. A little goes long way, and this tube is going to last me forever. No odd smells. As far as working on lines I don't know yet, but retinol is known for that job and probably I'll see it overtime. If you hesitate ask for a sample at the store, I did it before purchase, and I was amazed."
1,"I was looking for an ""ionic"" brush and decided to pick this up because of 1) the price, and 2) free shipping.  I am African-American and have been using the Maxius vent brush to detangle my long, unruly hair. Due to an injury last year, I've been on a lot of medications and have lost about 1/3 of my hair's thickness. Almost everytime I use that vent brush I lose more hair.  And, at some point (since I'm not on the meds anymore), you have to ask yourself... is it the medications, the products I use in my hair, OR the brush??  Still... finding a brush that gets down to the root and gives a nice massage on the scalp instead of a scratching is a rarity. So, I just kept using it.I was really impressed with the sturdiness of this brush, the bristles are just stiff enough to hold up all the way to the scalp. Also, there was no tearing or snapping of hair strands which is always a plus. I used it when I blow dryed my hair and I was a little concerned because it's not vented, but it held up well and did not overheat in my hand.  Afterwards, I used it on my dry hair to brush it back into a ponytail.  Whereas with my Maxius I would need to pull out a nylon bristle brush to get my ponytail neat, this brush easily transitioned as there are just enough bristles to function as a ""regular"" brush as well.  There was very little hair in the brush when I was done AND after I straightened my hair there was no hair in it at all!It is nice to find a brush that is inexpensive (some on this site are $40!), that works well, doesn't snag, and gives me that ""all the way to the scalp"" rub I so love.  I jumped online to pick up a spare... just in case I lose this one.NOTE: I didn't read any of the reviews before I purchased this brush. So, I was pleasantly surprised to see that so many found the same qualities in this brush that I did.  This is a great buy."
1,"I apologize that this is not an 'Amazon Verified Purchase' as I usually look for that when reading reviews to make sure they're legit.  Even though I have not bought it through Amazon yet, I wanted to review this product because it's a staple in my hygiene regimen and my first and best defense against acne.  In other words, when my face wash and special moisturizer routine is not enough and a pimple or two pop up, I swear by this product to keep my skin clear and healthy!Background: My skin is normal to dry, and I break out mostly in the T zone (forehead, either side of my nose/cheeks, and chin).  Since I am in my 20s now my skin is a lot better than it used to be, but I still get a few annoying pimples of varying sizes at least once a month.For some reason, my skin loves Salicylic Acid, and this product packs the perfect amount to obliterate my acne every time no matter if it's on my face or a rogue one on my body.  The tube is easy to squeeze and the gel is actually clear on the skin, but comes out thick and translucent whitish grey in color.  It does not have a smell that I can recall (certainly nothing unpleasant).  Absorbs into my skin within 30 seconds of application and leaves no residue.  Can apply under makeup, sunscreen, multiple times a day.  Most of the time I apply it to prevent any acne from surfacing.Every time I feel or see that I am about to breakout in any area on my face, or have found a pimple on my body, I apply a little bit of this and make sure to rub it in.  If it's just one pimple, I apply a generous amount to it, sometimes breaking the skin slightly to let out any pus before applying it, and it barely stings at all (I find that it works faster that way, but it's not necessary).  There's hardly any scabbing after applying this product: the acne simply shrinks, redness decreases, skin goes back to normal.  It also works for me on larger patches when I smooth it on in a thin layer.I would describe it as the perfect acne product, and recommend it to acne sufferers all of the time.  I have never ever suffered from dryness in the areas I've applied it to, even if I apply it multiple times a day.  It never fails to demolish the blemishes completely, without any type of skin damage, within a day or two (I can see improvement as early as a few hours or overnight).  It leaves my skin feeling amazing and I get compliments on my face.  This is to give credit where credit is due: to my favorite acne zapper, Clean & Clear Advantage acne spot treatment."
0,"I bought this for the toiletries basket at my wedding.  I don't think anyone used it.  When I went to use it later, I realized it expired shortly after I'd purchased it - I think total lifespan was something like less than six months."
0,"I bought this shampoo because I've been having so many problems with my hair, I know that many of those problems comes with aging, the hair aged as we do. When I purchase this product was based on the reviews, my hair is thick and naturally curly, I bought coconut oil Vatika, Raw argan oil and Ojon hair repairing mask, and my hair feels so good after these products penetrate into hair but right after shampooing my hair with  TheraNeem Gentle Therape Shampoo my hair becomes like wire, hard and stiff, it feels awful!!! it looses completely the moisture despite I'd used those products hours prior to wash my hair, and using a very good conditioner, that's not enough to return my hair's natural moisture, this is one of the worse shampoos I had ever used. My hair still falling out like crazy, now is even more frizzy, the worse part is that I bought two of them, one for me and the other as a gift, but now I am thinking what to do!!! my friend is even older than me with hair problems and she doesn't like to use conditioner because her hair is thinning and the conditioner flats her hair down. Probably I'd give that to her because just because if it isn't good for me that doesn't mean it isn't good for her, I don't know???. I Won't buy it again."
1,"Maybe I got the old bottle, kinda thick to apply so it leaves streaks.Not so impressed with color either.I bought this color after watching youtube, I was expecting bright neutral nude, instead this is dull beige in person.I'll use it as a base color for nail art in some occasions."
0,"I never usually pay over $2 for a bottle of nail polish since I generally just use it on my young daughter who likes to change her nail color often. I purchased this at a store for about $6 and am sorry that I did. It may be a $6 bottle of nail polish, but I have $2 bottles of nail polish that's better than this. You have to apply multiple coats to get the full color of this silver polish ... And even after you've done that, it chips very easily. I only gave it 1 star because I had to ... Its a waste of money, IMO."
0,"This does not work like this other serum I purchased. Noticed no difference or improvement in my face skin. but instead of tossing in the trash, I found out it work good on hands."
1,"I was extremely hesitant when buying this product, thinking it was probably a waste of money, I am 29 and have dealt with acne since I was 12 or 13. Blackheads have always been a problem for me, no matter what scrub, soap, blah blah I use it hasn't cleared up the blackheads. This product is amazing!! Best to use either in the shower or right when you get out so your pores are nice and open, and after you are done don't forget to use a toner or ice cube to close your pores back. I have also learned to go over the area a few times and then leave it alone for a day or two, and then try again. If you use it too much for too long your face gets irritated, which is to be expected, however, just a hint"
1,"This is an elegant body and or facial moisturizer.  I have only used it on my body.  It makes my legs feel soft and hydrated and absorbs very quickly.  I had used Cetaphil on my legs recently after a shower at night.  Well, my legs kept sticking to the sheets and kept me awake most of the night.  Needless to say I even had to wash the sheets the next day.Very nice product.  I like the DML lotion much better."
1,"When I used to use this for my face, it never really helped much with my acne, maybe just a bit. I now use it for my bacne and I think it has helped a bit, better than nothing! I like the pump better for facial use."
1,"I have always loved this oil.  I haven't used it in a while, so I was thrilled to get it for such a good price.  I use it on my wet skin right after a shower or bath.....it's WONDERFUL!!!  It's light and not greasy at all.  The smell is divine, but not overpowering; you can still wear your favorite perfume or body spray and it won't clash.  It's also great as a cuticle oil."
1,"The last time I wore straight up white nails was almost 20 years ago in the early 90's in my late tweens/early teens. Everyone said how 60's it was then too lol. I decided to not go with my usual black and instead go for white this time around. OPI Alpine Snow happened to be an option at my salon and I LOVE IT. Full on white, not streaky, very bright and all around kick ass."
1,"This product worked great but I have thick shoulder length hair and ran out of product.  Thankfully, I only needed to colorzap the top layer of my hair but would definitely need 2 bottles for an entire head."
1,"This is pretty good is your cuticles aren't too bad off . On my hands where the dryness isn't half as bad this product is great. On my toes where I have worse cuticles and dried up areas around the toe nail, this product doesn't work half as good. I have to use something much stronger such as Kerasal even on the nails and cuticles, it works much better."
1,"My skin is way too dry for this.  Love the texture, its light.  The smell is great, a little light on the coconut.  However my skin sucks it up and cannot get enough"
1,"Nice shade! Was toying between Zoyas Evvie and this shade, and this one seemed less gray, more green. Pretty, and the formula is nice."
1,"saw this in a beauty salon and she wanted one,, so we got on Amazon and she loves it... bought another for mother in law , she likes it too"
1,"I love this soap because it smells very good and it's a little bit of luxury in your kitchen. However, I do find that you have to use a lot of soap to be able to wash more than 5 things. The 16oz bottle is big and will last a long time. I just wish I didn't have to use as much soap as I do to wash my dishes."
1,"I have very dry brittle hair, and some shampoos only make the situation worse. But this shampoo is amazing! It cleans my hair, but does not strip everything out of it. It also helps to improve the quality of my hair. Since I've started using it my hair has been less dry and brittle throughout the day. Also it has added thickness and length to my hair since I've started using it. I will continue to use this shampoo forever."
1,"I'm a bit sad because I thought this nail polish would be a bit more opaque than it was. It took 3 coats for it to be fully opaque. It is pretty on, but not what I thought it would be. It also is really easy to make this polish look bad. If you mess it up at all, get it on your cuticles, chip it, it looks just horrible. I probably would not repurchase this."
1,"I'm surprised I forgot to review this beauty.  I bought this Cleansing Massage Brush a few years ago at my local Sephora store after reading tons of positive reviews for it (I think on Makeupalley).  It is all that and a bag of chips.  Use it in place of a washcloth for your face.  The little pink rubber massage nubbys are oh so soft and gentle - even the bristles are specially tapered/rounded and feel heavenly on your face (no scratching).  I think this could easily last many many years since I had mine for nearly 2 and it still looked as brand new as the day I bought it.  Alas, I lost mine at my gym's locker room one day and it was never to be seen again.  I've since moved on to a non-foaming facial cleanser by MyChelle and haven't had a need for this brush 'but' I would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for one.  Forget the gimmicky clarisonic brush and toss the washcloths - this is far better for your skin and all makeup and cleanser residue rinses away from the bristles easily making it ultra-hygenic too :)."
1,"I am truly impressed with this product. I have struggled with both dry and acne-prone skin since I was a teenager (I'm 24 now). I've tried all sorts of acne treatments and toners that tend to dry out my skin, while not really seeming to alleviate the acne. I continued to have regular breakouts 2-3 times a week.I tried this product after hearing about it on youtube, and I couldn't be happier with the results. Not only has this controlled my breakouts, but I can also tell that my skin is smoother and brighter looking! Since the product is alcohol free, it doesn't have the drying effect of most toners, but it's also effective at removing my makeup and keeping my acne at bay. I now only use this and Cetaphil cleanser, which really seems to contribute to the improvement in my complexion. I will admit that I'm not a fan of the rose/ ""granny perfume"" scent, but I'm eager to try more of the formulations that Thayer's offers (aloe and lavender).I highly recommend this for anyone suffering from acne and/or uneven skin tone."
1,"I bought this to make a homemade shampoo or conditioner (I cannot remember which) from a recipe I found online.  Unfortunately I did not like the smell and got rid of it due to that.  It's not overpowering, I just did not like my hair smelling like that."
1,This is the second curling iron of this type that I have purchased.  After purchasing 3 other brands this is the only one that holds my hair.  All of the others my hair slid right out of the iron.  The price is very reasonable and gets hot very quickly.
1,"I'm giving it 3/5 stars because it takes quite a bit to get one nail clean, and it doesn't strengthen nails as advertised."
1,I love Olay skin care but I have sensitive skin and need fragrance free products.  I was having trouble finding this in the stores but leave it to Amazon to come to the rescue.  Great price and great moisturizer!!  Thanks Amazon!!
1,"I am on the move to find products that give me the effects I so desire, for my skin, in addition to preventing premature aging, at all costs. I live in Seattle - a town that is rich in natural moisture (we are a very rainy city) and low humidity (excluding our mid-summer bursts of heat). Since I turned thirty, I have noticed the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and want to soften them, the natural way. Low and behold, I discovered NOW Solutions Apricot Oil, which treats those very symptoms of mature skin. I have begun using this product, for the last week. I already have noticed a huge difference. Lines have softened and skin looks increasingly more youthful. It is a great base, to use under a light foundation. It smells light and fruity, and is not excessively greasy. Note - you do not require more than just a few drops for the desired effect. Pour into hands, rub palms together and massage in upward strokes on entire surface of face and neck."
1,this conditioner is moisturizing but the bottle is small and i used it up in a month.lol. i would purchase again but i found something better.
1,I use this product every morning and night under my moisturizer or makeup.  I love the way it makes my skin feel.  I am 60 years old and I feel like this product compares to more expensive department store products.
1,"This cream is fantastic. It is light, non-greasy & lovely to apply. Unscented, so it does not interfere with perfumes, etc.One jar seems to last a long time. First got this at Trader Joe's, but they do not carry it any longer, unfortunately.I am delighted to find this on Amazon. It is a wonderful product. It is amazing that very dry hands are almost instantly repaired with this cream. My hands were dreadfully cracked and painful. After one application, I noticed an immediate improvement!I also like the price. It works far better than other creams! And I pretty much know most of 'em. (Jergens, Lubriderm, Eucerin, Cetaphil, Clinique, etc.,etc., etc....) This cream works splendidly with moisturizing gloves & does not soil anything.And Alaska is a challenge-it can be quite dry here in the winter-time.So, if this cream works well here, it'll probably do nicely elsewhere in the country. I've been using it for years. Just love it!A word on ordering:  Even though I sent it to the lower 48, the S&H; cost was about the same as the cost for the cream, effectively doubling the price.  however, I am so delighted with this product that the vendor did not succeed in ruining  it for me. Exercise caution on distributor-not from Amazon itself.Best hand cream at the best price!"
1,"I have dry, sensitive skin. I've tried a number of cleansers like this one (Cetaphil, Ponds cold cream, Boots cleansing lotion, etc.) and this one seems to work the best. It takes make up off well and doesn't leave behind a 'filmy' feeling if you just wipe off.  If you do rinse with water, it doesn't leave you with a tight, squeeky-clean feeling. It really does leave your skin feeling moisturized and yet cleanses enough to get rid of the dirt and make-up!  I'm very happy with this cleanser and will purchase again."
0,"I didn't know that it had to be a light weight blow dryer.  tried to get this to hold my blow dryer & apparently my blow dryer is too heavy & it won't hold it, keeps tipping over.  NOT a good purchase!!"
1,"I love NARS blushes!But this one, not good for me. Not in any way.If you already have some kind of 'orange' vibe going on, you probably want to steer away from this one. I am pasty pale with auburn/copper red hair, this just made me look like the Wendy's sign. It was not good with my base coloring.I gave it 3 because no matter that the color looks bad on me, the product quality is still there. This would look incredible on someone with pigment in their skin, I'm almost envious of anyone who could wear this, just because it's so pretty in the pan. If you are darker than 'fresh death', this color will probably work on you. Just like any other NARS blush, a light hand will go a lot farther than digging in. You can always add to, but woe be to you if you put on too much of this stuff right off the bat."
1,"I am a 29 year old dude.  While women wear cologne for other women (same with their hair, clothes, etc.) I can safely say I wear this for women.  One woman, specifically, who happens to be my wife.  She likes this because it's light and airy.  I like it because she likes it, it's not overpowering, and this massive bottle lasts for a long, long time.Frequently, I find colognes for men are very strong and obnoxious.  This has a feminine lightness but still retains a masculine fragrance.  Honestly, it seems a bit too masculine for most women (in my opinion), but it is a very light fragrance so perhaps it would be okay."
1,My favorite low cost under make up moisturizer. I have used the lotion for about 4 years and I use Olay Regenerst for my eyes. I would recommend this product.
1,"I LOVE this soap!!! The smell reminds me of Christmas, year 'round. The warm aroma calms me and makes me feel peaceful. The lather is rich and creamy. My sensitive skin gets pampered by this soap, and the scent stays on my skin long after the shower. Definitely a 5-star soap, but I had to give it 4 stars because it melts away so quickly that the thrill doesn't last. It's not practical for me to pay $5 bucks for one bar of soap that doesn't last, but it's a lovely occasional treat."
1,"I bought one of these from my local WalMart and it didn't seem to work well.So I ordered this one, and it works MUCH better. Although, I find my hair it tough to pull through sometimes when I twirl the brush too much.I use it to round brush blow-dry my hair after I fully blow dry it alone (I can't do it when it's damp, it's too hard and my hair is too thick).I returned the brush I got from WalMart because I love this one!It works much smoothly through my hair, and its perfect for long hair!"
1,"I love this product very much. I believe that it has helped with my acne and acne scars. I don't break out as much anymore and I've heard that rose petal and witch hazel is good for acne and acne scars.How I apply this is that first I use Noxzema's original deep cleansing cream (Noxzema Original Cleansing Cream Ounce- I use this every morning and every night.Then after patting my face with a clean wash cloth, I apply this toner with a cotton pad by dabbing it on my face, all over. I then let it dry and apply Aveeno's SPF 70 sunscreen (Aveeno Sunscreen Protect Hydrate Spectrumor Neutrogena's SPF 70 sunscreen if you don't want you skin to look to oily (Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch Sunscreenbut it may still be dry so you might have to apply moisturizer afterwards, unless if this toner moisturizes your skin enough.I use Noxzema and apply this toner every morning and night, I only apply sunscreen in the morning =]Hope this helped!"
1,"I always check out the Nars displays when I'm at Nordstrom or Sephora.  They're pretty much my go-to for new makeup (except occasional YSL eyeshadow palettes).  And so I knew that Underworld was silvery/grey on the left and shimmery deep denim blue on the right.  Amazon's pic makes it look like pale ""Maybelline blue"" on the left and deep purple on the right.  So beware.  Check the colors on the Nars site before you order, is my suggestion.  This is excellent stuff - wears well all day long with no primer or top coat like Finish Line.  Highly recommended.  This duo, Underworld, coordinates very well with Demon Lover if you want to use more than 2 colors."
1,"Great combination for healthier skin! Moisturizes very well. Refrigerate so when you apply, there's a refreshing & cool sensation! :)"
1,I love this cream. My skin gets dryer in cool weather and this bit greasy cream is what i need! No stretching feeling at all! Drys very fast!
1,Great after a day in the sun or everyday use.
1,"All women, young and old, have tried many make up products in their lives, whether it was an inexpensive brand or a high- priced brand. They have most likely tried products that irritated their skin, felt too heavy and spent money on products that didn't give them any coverage at all. MAC studio fix powder is the solution to all those problems. It is a product that women of any age and any color can use; this product is a good price for the economic problems, ladies might have and covers all the imperfections that women are afraid to show. I can relate to this product because I use it on a daily basis.MAC studio fix powder is a powder and a foundation combined in one and is very easy to apply, rather than going through the hassle of applying liquid foundation and then later applying a matte powder, the studio fix powder is a one-step application. This is good for women of any age, whether you're eighteen or fifty this would be a great to use. For teenagers the powder does an amazing job covering any acne that may occur, as well as dark circles and uneven skin tones. For women, age fifty and up, all the wrinkles and dark spots are erased within a blink of an eye. MAC studio fix powder is made in thirty- two different shades so any one is able to use it.If you've been spending too much money on products that don't work, you'll love how the studio fix powder is within a reasonable budget and how much coverage you can get from applying it once a day. This product feels very light on the skin and looks very natural too. Many powders can make your face look cakey and oily, the studio fix powder is very different; it makes your skin look flawless just like a celebrity's make up would. Many celebrities use MAC's merchandise because they love how it feels on their skin and after a long day it still looks nice. We all know who Kim Kardashian is, she is one of the many celebrities that uses this product on a daily basis and she uses it for a lot of her photo shoots. Not only is this great for everyday use, it looks beautiful when wearing it to parties.Some may argue that this powder makes your face oily and it feels heavy on the skin, but many women love this product and they use it all the time. Some also say that it can't be applied every day, only on special occasions, but depending on how much you apply is the result you'll get. From what reviews say online, this product is very good at covering all imperfections and it doesn't feel as heavy as other products may feel on the skin.After searching for a long time for a good product, many women say that the MAC studio fix powder, is by far the best ""two- in- one"" product out there. Almost every women can relate to make up because they all use it, so why not use something that you will love from the start. This powder is very good at giving a women full coverage and doesn't clog any of your pores like other powders may do. Lastly when you purchase this, you'll feel great knowing that you can have a portable powder and foundation in your purse at all times."
1,"The color of Belle de Jour is closer to a matte, light coffee than to the tangerine in the picture. I uploaded my own photo but you can do a Google search and see others.At first the lipstick was somewhat dry and difficult to apply and it didn't last long.  Over time it softened and now goes on more easily and lasts longer.Because it's the most golden of my lipsticks, I tend to use it twice a week and shine it up a bit with Nars Orgasm gloss."
1,"This stuff is my all time favorite nail polish ever!  It dries quickly,  it looks nice and it is an all in one! I have not been able to find it in any stores and this stuff really is the best!"
0,"I recently got a Yorkie Terrier and this is the first brand shampoo and conditionar I have tried on my dog because of all the great reviews. I used this every week for 6 months and I am not happy with the results. The smell is great but it leave my dog's hair rough compared to what it supposed to be. Yorkies naturally have silky hair and this shampoo made his hair the opposite. It didn't leave it dry but I knew for a fact it could have been much better. I thought giving it time would eventually solve the problem and thats why i stuck to it. Finally after reading some reviews i have tried thisEveryday Isle of Dogs Silky Coating Dog Shampoo for Yorkies,Beagles and Spaniels (16.9 oz/Jasmine and Vanilla)and their conditionar. Now my dog's hair is very silky and smells great as well. I would not reccomend this product, at least not for yorkie terriers."
1,My Maybelline Coverstick Corrector/Concealer arrived early and in good condition.  It is a product I have used before and I am very satisfied with it.
1,I have been using Nailtiques for about 15 years. I love the product! I have people asking me all the time how I get the tips of my nails so white & I tell them I don't do anything other than use this product! It is fabulous! You will NOT be disappointed if you buy Nailtiques!!
0,"I did not have a good experience with this product.  It smells good but I used it (sparingly) in the bath and experienced sensitivity/irritation from it (feminine region).  I can't use drugstore brands like Olay, Softsoap, etc...I normally use Body Shop, Neutrogena, and Bath & Body Works and never have problems.  I incorrectly assumed Alba products would be more along those lines.  Beware if you have sensitivity issues with bath & shower gel and body wash."
1,"This product is just a smidge softer than regular cocoa butter. But, it's still pretty hard. It does have that wonderful cocoa butter fragrance though, and it melts in your hands a little easier than plain cocoa butter."
1,"This cleanser is actually quite pretty with a dreamy innocent creamy pink color that reminds me of calamine lotion. The bar itself is solid, but you break off a piece to use a little each time and it only takes a ""tiny"" piece to effectively clean your entire face. This may also be useful to soothe skin all over your body and I intend to try it out that way in my next shower.I like using this at night, putting a little bit on a washcloth. It is also fun to use to give your partner a facial before bed because of the calming ingredients. I noticed my husband really relaxed and took a deep breath of the delicious ingredients which include Lavender oil, Chamomile oil, rose and Elderflower.This also contains calamine powder - very soothing and the tea tree oil doesn't sting. I was a little tentative about trying the solid cleansers but they are just as fun to use as all the other products and I can't wait to try more.~The Rebecca Review"
1,Lavendar and mint smells Great. My dog doesnt seem to be bothered by the smell either. Lasts fairly long and I squirt  the buddy wash spray in between washes. The conditioner is awesome as well!
1,"This has been the only JLO scent i have ever owned, and im in love with it! its kinda hard to describe, but it does not smell old-ladyish. it smells wonderful, the best in her collection by FAR!!!"
1,"I love this soap.  It is rich, has no scent, and cleans easily and well.  The price is a bit higher than regular soap, but the quality is much better even than Dove.  My face feels better ( and it is horribly sensitive) doesn't turn red and swell up, and my face doesn't seem to feel as dry even before moisturizer (Vanicream).Buying in 3's makes you feel better about cost."
1,I like the consistency of the product and the nice relief it gives to my mom's dry yet sensitive skin.
1,"This was hard to rate. If I were rating the scent alone, I'd give it a 5. It's multi-dimensional & lives up to the hype.However, I have severe arthritis and Fibromyalgia so it makes this stuff nearly impossible to deal with. I bought the 32oz. size because it's the Only size that comes with a pump.* It is so thick that it takes 30 seconds to get one full pump out of it and it takes a lot of strength to do that.* With the 16oz size, you have to pick up the entire bottle to get product out - something that's almost impossible for someone in pain because it's heavy and too big around.* Squeezing the bottle is very hard to do.* I was going to give this as a gift, but the person has rheumatoid arthritis and I'm so glad I tested this out on myself first - there is no way she could use this.* This product is first & foremost a bubble bath, so it takes a LOT of water and time to rinse it off.* I found this to be the most drying body wash I've ever used.I know that 3 Star Reviews usually get lost in the mix, but I hope this helps someone save money and avoid pain & frustration."
1,"smells great and easy on the face...cleans off all makeup and face feels clean, and smooth. plus its all natural!"
1,"Another winning product from Roc that delivers what it promises.  I have been using Roc Retinol Correxion Wrinkle Night Cream for 2 years now and my skin never looked better.  I love this product and have gotten no allergic reaction, burning sensation or redness to it.  I apply it every night before going to bed and the next morning my skin is smooth supple and wrinkle free.  So far so good... I will keep using it forever."
0,"Been using this for awhile now because I refuse to waste it. My skin type: combination dry/oily areas/fair/sensitive/acne-prone. This face wash drys my skin out terribly. I hate that tight dry feeling I get after using it. Sure I feel like it is taking the makeup off, but at the loss of all my skins natural oils and moisture which it really really needs! Lately my skin has been so dry and flaky so along with the colder weather and dry indoor heat this stuff is wrecking my skin! I hate it. Definitely does nothing to clear my acne, if anything it makes it worse. I will not be repurchasing this product."
1,"I fell in love with this color online. I was looking for a beautiful dark forest/emerald green, and this seemed like it would be. But it's wayyyyy darker in person. When I got the bottle, I thought they had mistakenly sent black nail polish. It's really more of a black polish with a hint of green, and even then, under bright sunlight, you can barely see any green. It did seem to lighten after a few days, but still not really green. That said, the quality of OPI nail polish is still excellent. It goes on smooth, dries reasonably fast, rarely chips, and doesn't have that harsh chemical smell other polishes do. There is a very subtle shimmer to this polish that always applies evenly, never streaky. So the color was slightly off, but it was such good quality polish I'm going to keep wearing it anyway!"
1,"Fabulous!!  Works for even the driest, troublesome skin conditions.  A little goes a long way.  Highly recommended."
1,I use this instead of regular hair gel.  It keeps my hair in place but it is soft instead of hard like regular gel.  Its a great moisturizer for hair and does not flake like regular hair gel.  It keeps the flyaways down when you wear ponytails without adding a stiffness to your hair
1,"I use the Freeman Cucumber Facial Mask religiously, once a week, followed by Queen Helene's Mint Julep mud mask. After exfoliating I apply this mask for fifteen minutes - it's kind of fun marching around the house looking like a burn victim (the mask goes on clear and shiny, and dries clear and shiny) - before peeling it off and applying the mud mask for fifteen minutes. The mud mask is excellent for standing in clear view by your front window as the neighbor mows his lawn or answering the door for the FedEx guy so you can sign for a package. It's such a conversation starter.Anyhow, after moisturizing my skin is good to go for the week, and it's consistently clear and fresh thanks to this mask."
1,"I absolutely love this! I'm even buying another one for my aunt! If you have ever gotten a true facial before you would know that they don't just drown your face with the steam it's light and moved around different areas, and that is what this sauna does! Just loved it! Probably would like it to be somehow I didn't have to bend over for it, but if you stack it up right it's much easier!"
1,"I order this cream along with their soap. It actually worked for me but after I finished the tube, I ordered different brand just to get quicker results (BAD IDEA). I am definitely ordering 3 more tubes so that my underarm pigment gets treated completely."
0,"I bought this a few years back when it was Kiss Me  by Blinc. Now it is just Blinc.  I used to just love this mascara. Now  it is way more flakey and not as easy to remove.  Long tubes that looked like actual lashes used to slide off when i used warm water to remove the mascara. Now  it is way harder to get it off and I just get little bits off at a time ,,, ie flakes!  I also get flakes on my face just wearing it during the day/night.  they must have changed the formula :(  I won't be buying this product again"
1,"This is a unique, feminine scent with notes of powder, flowers, vanilla, and something else...maybe almonds? Whatever it is, the effect is great. It's a subtle fragrance that's very different from most mainstream perfumes. Sadly, the staying power isn't that great, though."
1,"We've been trimming expenses and re-adjusting our family budget so I've been trying lower cost products. I purchased a bottle of Suave Naturals Tropical Coconut shampoo at a local low-cost department store to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised about how well the Suave shampoo cleaned my hair and left it shiny. Also, the shampoo was thick and I only needed a small amount to wash my hair.I'd recommend this shampoo as it is a good value for the money."
1,"I really liked the smell of this at first.  It didn't take long, however, to be overwhelmed by the scent.  Calling it Basil is a stretch.  It just smells sweetly perfumed to me - to the point that you can smell it when someone has washed their hands with it and they walk by you.  I won't buy it again."
1,"It saddens me to write this review because I've been using Buf Puf since I was about 12. I always attributed my youthful appearance to daily exfoliation with the Buf Puf, but now I think my cystic acne in my 30's and 40's was certainly exacerbated if not caused by the Buf Puf. I discontinued use of this product and switched to a skin care line called Glytone (buy at Dermstore.com) and haven't had a breakout in over 2 months. Unfortunately I'm convinced the harsh exfoliation causes skin to rebel and break out. I won't use again."
1,"You can believe all of the praise for this &#34;soap&#34; as it's true. Super gentle, crazy creamy and no fragrance or extra junk that's in most soaps and liquid cleansers. I use it on my face and bod and look forward to it everyday. Great feeling, clean rinsing. Recommended by my dermatologist. I figured that if it can be used for infants with eczema and be that gentle and effective, it can do nothing but good for the rest of us. Amazing product. I also use the lite lotion for a super fine veil of moisture wherever I need it."
1,"I was using a Murad salicylic acid cleanser before this for a while, which was okay but it didn't do much to clear the minor breakouts I had. I decided to give this a try since it was a lot cheaper than Murad. It didn't take long to notice good results, and my face was finally starting to clear up. After about a month of using it, my face is pretty much free of blemishes. I'll still get a few occasionally ranging from minor to large and painful ones, however it's usually if I skip washing my face at night. I've gotten a lot of compliments about my clear complexion.However, the only downside is that it can be fairly irritating to my face, specially if I use a little too much. My skin will be somewhat red and have a slight burning sensation after I wash my face. Which I wasn't too shocked to experience, I do have pretty sensitive skin. I'm thinking about alternating using this cleanser with a more gentle cleanser. Bottom line, if you have mild-moderate acne and your skin isn't too sensitive, this product will most likely work for you. Definitely can't beat the price"
1,love the color was amazingly easy to apply and lasted a good amount of time even without a base and top coat! the color is beatiful and exactly what I wanted!
1,I decided to write a review because I use this fade cream. I started noticing results within the first week or less for me.  I have to admit reading 3 months to see results bothered me a great deal but I don't have to wait more then 1-2 weeks to get the results for an even skin tone. I'm happy I purchased this product and sorry to the ones who had no luck with this cream.
1,I decided to try this cleanser because it was foaming.  I was pleasantly surprised on how it worked.  Did not dry out my skin or leave it oily.  Clean and clear's products seem to be just as good as the name brands (which i have tried).
1,I use L'Oreal Paris products on a daily basis.  I find that they are consistently good quality products without the department store prices.
0,"This hair spray does not spray - it squirts, leaving hair clammy and dry. It may be a natural product but it damages my hair the same way other chemical sprays do. Will not buy again."
1,"My hair is thick, not pin-straight, but close. I'm caucasian & 38. When using hot curling iron, it takes me about 8 minutes to create some waves that last a couple hours. These Caruso curlers might also take me about 8 min to put all in (I'm new with it too) then I can finish getting kids ready, etc & come back. The cold shot with dryer makes a difference, and the curls (even with Jumbo) are amazingly bouncy & shiny. It absolutely relaxes to a nice body look which I spray, and its better than curling iron gives. That holds for several hours, but by end of day its all but a memory. Forget the ""days"" claim. Even when I put gel in first that didn't happen. Now after using them about 5 times, the clips seem to slip off easier, causing great frustration. It does require distilled water, which the csr told me - the website & box do not. Mine came WITHOUT instructions or styling guide, which 2 weeks later I'm still waiting for its arrival from the company. Disappointed with these issues, but I do like the change from hot iron, and the curls are beautiful, so I still gave 3 stars. My hair dresser thought they had a good reputation."
1,"This product has a very strong, slightly medicinal, non-cloying, therapeutic scent. With notes of eucalyptus, Rosemary, & lemon it is perfect for cold & flu aches, exercise aches, & everday muscle aches.The scent additionally helps open up your nasal & chest passages if you're congested. If you're not a fruit & flower kind of person, you'll love the scent.  Be sure to keep the can outside of the bathroom. Even the slightest exposure to moisture causes it to rust. The lids can be inconvenient to open, unless you keep something nearby to pry the it open. My solution is never closing the lid all the way... Sometimes the larger crystals don't break down all the way & can be kind of uncomfortable to sit on in the bath tub, as they tend to be rather sharp.Bottom line: Buy it! I love it for my annual cold that I undoubtedly get this time every year. It makes being sick slightly less miserable. I soak in the tub with this 1-2 times a day."
1,I use this as a toner on my face and absolutely love this!  The rose smell is wonderful and this leaves my skin feeling very soft.  I have also put some in a spray bottle with water and freshen my skin periodically throughout the day.  Don't hesitate to purchase.  I love the fact that this is alcohol free!!!
1,"I bought these for my daughter, who really likes them. They're nice to use at night with vaseline or a thick lotion, to make your hands super soft. I have some too and I use them often. The quality of these is nice. My only regret is that I didn't look at TJ Maxx before ordering these, because they had them there several dollars cheaper."
1,"I've always used q-tips to touch up my nails, but these make life SO much easier. I've bought them twice and will continue to restock."
1,"Then use this right after you cleanse with Purity made Simple face wash, or just a little dab later in the day.  WOW!!  This stuff is truly amazing.  My skin feels super soft and so clean.  This face cream goes on so light and the small amount of fragrance is does have, just plainly smells clean.  After you become an addict, like I am, you will associate the smell with all the great benefits this product has to offer.  I am A HUGE FAN of Philosophy"
1,"Wonderful product for correcting makeup smudges and smears, just a little dab in eye makeup remover to remove any mistakes while applying all of your makeup. FYI.....the tip end of the swab is great for removing any material that has accumulated in the corners of the eye. Lipstick mistakes, dip in concealer or foundation and lightly apply to edges of lips, blend in. I carry some in my makeup bag in my purse just for that. Great stocking stuffers for the ladies! These makeup applicators, to me, are made for correcting flaws, haven't used them to apply makeup but I'm sure they can be used for that. Couldn't do makeup without them.Have recommended to all my friends."
1,"This is a very good moisturizer but it does take a while to sink in and stays kinda greasy so you have to blot. I have been using bp which is drying and this does help but it has no spf and is a little too thick for daytime so I am switching to something formulated for just that. Good moisturizer for nighttime. I def recommend just not for me at the moment. Good luck!EDIT- i now use this around my eyes in the morning because my morning moisturizer has sunscreen in it (the kind you cant apply in that area) and also at night on my upper eye area, i use vitamin e oil as my nighttime under eye serum lol. It keeps it moist and supple! And when my back is dry from using bp. Anyone could use this even for something as simple as hand lotion its good"
1,"This product works really well, because you don't have to hold a brush and hair dryer at the same time. For myself, I am happy with it."
1,"I use the mint mask once per week to clean out my pores and give my face a deep clean ""at the spa"" feeling. Super affordable price and one tube lasts months! Love the minty smell too"
1,"At first you think it will feel heavy, but it doesn't.  I wear this over BB cream every day and it works wonders.  It is not full coverage, but not bad for a drug store product.  I get mine at stop and shop."
1,"My mom started using this product and has been ""addicted"" to it ever since. She uses it when her hands are dry any time of the year. I was a little skeptical of this ""miracle cure"" (as said by my mom), but when I tried it out I must say that I was pretty impressed. My dry skin went from being rough and ,well, dry to smooth and moist (but not too moist . .just enough to feel nice). The only problem I had with this hand cream was that it was very thick and it made my hands very sticky/slippery for quite some time . .a longer time than most lotions/hand creams. . .But, after it dried out some, everything was cool . .."
1,It smells great and cleans great - Honeysuckle is wonderful and I will buy it again and again and again.
1,"I have used this product for years. I have a dermatological condition called keratosis pilaris which consists of small raised bumps that appear on one side of my forehead and on my arms. This rich cream is actually more effective in minimizing these bumps than the prescription lotion that I have used. I was extremely distressed to read that this company has been purchased by health food giant Hains and that other product formulas have been changed and are no longer effective for whatever they were supposed to do. When I purchased this bottle there was only one left and it is not a new product nor is it manufactured by Hains so I guess I was lucky. If this information is correct then I assume Amazon will be restocking another facial cream that is ineffective. Apart from my particular condition, this cream is a wonderful eye cream. It softens and smooths this area just as you should expect. Can't really recommend it if the formula is being manufactured by another company."
1,"I am a big fan of Mrs. Meyers hand soap; however, I prefer food-based smells to floral scents. This soap is perfect for our kitchen, providing a faint aroma of rhubarb that is delightful, earning kudos from several visitors and family members."
0,"I haven't used witch hazel as a facial toner before, but based on the reviews I thought I'd give it a try. After a couple of weeks, I can say I don't really see that it has helped to soften my skin. And if I had known how awful witch hazel smelled, I definitely would've tried one of the many scented witch hazel products out there instead! I'm going back to using the Avalon lavender facial toner and this will go in the cabinet to try on bug bites in the future."
1,"I discovered CND when I was given a free sample of their polish. I was hooked. Next, I decided to try the Stickey base coat. I love it! I *never* used to do my nails because they would end up chipping after 3 days. It just wasn't worth the time and hassle. Now that I have discovered Stickey and CND, I do my nails about once every 10 days or so. The base coat helps to hold the polish and prevents chipping. After about 4-5 days, I may have a tiny, tiny chip on the end of a nail but it's so easy to just touch up. Here's how I use Stickey:1) Buff my nails to remove ridges.2) Apply one coat of Stickey to clean nails.3) This is important--while the Stickey is still slightly tacky, apply nail color (this helps it grab the polish)4) After color has mostly dried, I apply one coat of CND Air Dry topcoat. I start with my thumb and by the time I reach my pinky, the thumb is dry.That's it and my nails look great! Love, love, love CND products. I now use this brand over OPI."
1,This makes you glow.  Evens skin tone and just gives your skin a beautiful look.  Used for years.  I hope they never change it or discontinue it.
0,"This wash was incredibly drying. I was using it once a day, before using it every other day and it was leaving my oily skin far too irritated. The product was too drying to use on it's own, but using a toner or moisturizer with it left my face irritated."
1,the toner is gentle and has a nice scent which is not strong at all or like some of those alcohol toners.  i like the obagi sytsem it leaves my skin smoother and brighter
1,"What a gorgeous color! Would be great for the holidays, too! I love that opi lasts so long, too. Wow!"
1,I am trying to be more mindful of what I am using on my body.  I purchased this as an alternative to antibiotic ointment when I pierced my ears.  It seems to work well on my sensative skin.
1,I don't know why they call this &#34;Plus Touch of Sun&#34; as I took that to mean it had self-tanner or bronzer in it - but it does nothing really for color. It's not a bad moisturizer at all- I just haven't found the 'touch of sun' in it. This may be because I tan easily and there isn't enough of a &#34;touch of Sun&#34;. In other words I find this no better than other moisturizers which don't promise as much as this one does but I still like it
1,"I LOVE this stuff. Too bad I just discovered this last week & it has been DISCONTINUED! I'm so upset!I used it this morning & then said to my husband ""How does my face look?"" He replied ""like you have on make-up""  I don't wear ANY makeup so my complexion is important to me. This does the trick! Makes my face so clear and radiant. I've used it for a week on my combination skin at it's the best cleanser I have ever used.I will have to buy this where ever I spot it because I can't stand the thought of being without it forever. I just found another bottle today so maybe when I'm all out I'll giveAveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant Cleanser, 6.7 Ouncea try."
1,I am an African-American woman with 4a hair. I gave this shampoo a perfect score because it thoroughly cleaned my hair and scalp with drying it out or stripping it. My hair has low porosity so it can easily collect build up. It is important for the health of my hair to keep it as clean as possible. I use it about once a month. I also love the price. I bought it at Walgreens for only 75 cents. I was surprised that such a cheap product could work so well. I recommend this product to anyone with any hair type. I'm sure this product will work just as well with naturally straight hair. I am definitely going to use more products from this brand in the future.
0,"I don't see what all the fuss is about.  This oil smells okay, but it does not last at all.  I would NOT buy this again"
1,I just needed to cover some root grays and this did a good job but wow it hurt my eyes! I normally use L'oreal Excellence Cream #1 Black Hair Color which I love so I am going back to that.
1,I can see a remarkable difference in the tone and feel of my face. It looks fresh and young again. I have been using this nightly for about a month now and I am really please. Expect you experience a minor exfoliation of the skin ( nothing drastic) . So this has become my nightly moisturizer. I will keep using it.
1,"I was looking for a mirror that I could use to see the back of my head when I do my hair (I have very long hair) and this was the perfect solution. It's just big enough and fits nicely in my hand, but can be tucked sideways in a bin under my bathroom vanity. Great price, great product, highly recommend."
1,"Very gentle on my skin and surprisingly cleared up my acne. Before I had always used things like proactive, clearasil and other medicated washes to clear it up, but they were very damaging to my skin and it wasn't clearing it up. Now my skin is almost completely clear, no longer oily and nice and smooth. Very gentle and removes all of my makeup as well."
1,"Lotion. If you're using anything else on your skin you're doing it wrong. THis is amazing, never gives me a rash, I throw some scented oil on the tip, mix it around with my finger, and I have the best, most luxuriant body lotion in the world."
0,"I found it drying and a little irritating. It did nothing but upset my acne.Its also very thin and liquid, it takes quite a lot of effort to get it into a good lather. It smells odd, too, kind of like alfalfa hay.Needless to say I wasn't impressed and likely won't keep using it."
1,It does just what it says...detangles hair. My daughter has very thick hair and this comb goes thru her hair so easy and it doesn't tear her hair out.
1,"Jason's natural products are exceptional. I love the body wash and this product tends to be more expensive in stores so that's why I purchase on amazon. If you like the smell of  lavender, this product  will tickle your fancy.  Very nice during shower time.  The soap feels great on your skin and nourishes because it contians Vitamin E, Pro-Vitamin B5 and aloe vera. Jason's body washes are known for no or low sulfides which is good for sensitive skins and the main reason I purchase.  I think what I love the most about this product is the bottle dispenser.  It's so easy to use in the shower and never had a problem with clogging.  It despenses down to the bottom of the bottle.This is a prime product which is a plus too.  Multiple purchase customer and I'll be back again."
1,"I don't know why I wait until the hyperpigmentation comes back to order this. I have been ordering about one bottle per year, and it lasts a little less than that, because I generally don't need to use it for a few months. This stuff works. Hyperpigmentation, melasma, these things will lighten gradually, but noticably with days. When if first receive it, I use it 3-4 times per day, rather than the manufacturer's recommended twice per day, and within four days, my face is peeling slightly, and very dry (I am normally quite oily). This discomfort is manageable with a moisturizer, and worth the visible lightening within one to two weeks. This contains 2% hydroquinone + kojic acid and azeliac acid. HQ + kojic acid have been clinically shown to work better together than either one separately (always look for peer-reviewed research by medical doctors). You MUST wear a UVA/UVB sunscreen with this product (just as you must after the fraxil laser treatments) or your hyper-pigmentation will return within days. My melasma looked like I put on a mask of too-dark foundation, from my upper lip to my jaw line, and the texture was almost leathery. With my last bottle, after using this product for about ten days, even my critical teen noticed that the contrast was considerably lessened and the leathery texture is gone (this is also a symptom of melasma). I do initially get a pinkish quality to my skin, but I don't mind since I am a bit olive-skinned. Once my skin gets used to it, it won't feel irritated and dry, and I will reduce my use to twice, and then once, per day.*** 4th bottle (10/15/2010) Still love it!****(11/2012) Lost count, but just received my most recent order.  Taking a Q-Tip and applying to larger, freckle-sized spots.  After several applications per day, they actually crust up and create a scab like the prescription meds my parents use.  Scab falls off and fresh skin is underneath.  Still the best (read: strongest) product I've found to combat melasma.  Again, I cannot emphasize using heavy duty SPF."
0,"This was a complete and utter waste of money...here's the beginning of my laundry list of complaints:1.  There is no indication of when it's heated up.  I waited about five minutes and then just started to randomly touch it (that's what she said).  Impractical and annoying.2.  The rollers don't stay hot for long and generally didn't seem all that hot.  The only moderate curl I got was on the very first one I managed to put in.3.  The pins are the WORST and not do stay in place.  They completely did not stay on the roller, or in my hair and hurt when I tried to push them in so they'd properly hold.  My hair slid out of the roller before I could secure them.4.  The rollers are shaped oddly...with grooves.  What for?  I have no idea.  Do you want ridges in your hair?  If it's suppposed to help grip one's hair, it FAILS MISERABLY at that task.I wish I hadn't waited so long to try these out or they would have been a definite return.  I have fine textured long hair, straight with a slight wave, easy to curl but tends to fall flat.  If you have thicker or coarser hair, perhaps this may be a better tool."
1,"I have used progesterone cream before but after trying Emerita I am staying with this one!  It has helped my hormones to be balanced better since I have had a complete hysterectomy and wear the estrogen patch.  It helps with mood, sleeping, and overall feelings. I use about 2 teaspoons per night and it took me about 2 weeks to really notice a difference so don't' give up - give it a try.  Of course always check with your doctor but I am sure they will recommend.  The price for the Economy size is great and I don't have to order as often.  I hope this product always stays available!  It is great!"
1,"Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.  Although I think its Obagi's way of getting even further in our pockets.  The only reason I'll continue to use this product is that it claims that it restores your skin's ph in order for the other stuff to work.  Since I can't tell whether this is true or not..I'll just have to take their word for it."
1,"I have been using these for years (since I read Bo Derek stating in a post ""10"" interview that she used them to keep her skin smooth :-)).  As my skin has aged, I have switched from the regular to the gentle version.I have sensitive skin that doesn't like harsh chemicals.  Using these allows me to slough off the older layers as well or better than expensive exfoliants.  They helped control acne and now remove the old skin that keeps me from having the ""healthy glow"" that the commercials for costly creams promise.  It has been difficult to find these locally as the shelf space gets taken by new, expensive options, so I am really glad to find them on Amazon.Inexpensive, re-usable, no chemical reactions or worries about getting something in your eye. Perfect."
1,Have been using this for years.  It's a great cleanser that doesn't leave your skin feeling stripped or caked with soap.
1,"I like the smell, and the texture of this product. I just don't understand how, and when it should start working. Will I NOTICE a change?? I have no idea..I haven't seen anything different, as of yet. However, leaves you very soft."
1,These were a gift and my wife has been enjoying how well the rollers works for her.  Makes her thin hair come alive.
0,"I have a senstive skin...It stings, doesn't get absorbed at all, sits at top of your skin like a plastic, hard transparent flaky mask...feels very sticky when you try to remove it....too bad...good for nothing."
1,it turned it the right blonde i wanted but my hair was breaking off as i was brushing it. it just jept coming and coming out. i bought some intensive conditionar and it kinda fixed it...
1,"It was the first time I used this Quantum Perm, but my congratulations to the brand, it has a pre-treatment that protects the hair and after being done, my hair was looking so healthy and well done that I was truly amazing.  Definitely, I will buy it again and recommend to whoever needs it. I was using Izo 2 but this resulted being by far much better, you just have to follow the instructions, very easy to use."
1,"I not only don't see any difference after using almost the whole bottle, but it doesn't provide any temporary benefits either.  It makes my face look a little greasy, and there is not much of a cosmetic difference.  My skin doesn't really look better after I apply it.  But I have tried worse.  I don't think I will buy it again.  I'd rather try something else.  One thing though-it doesn't make my eyes burn like some other moisturizers with an SPF."
1,"This product is not what I was looking for as I tried to order a different type of cologne. However, it's okay and isn't as bad."
1,"I've finally finished my bottle of this stuff. I wanted to wait to review it until I had really given it a chance. I'd say this lasted me about two months.I'm rating this 'okay' because this isn't amazing. It didn't clear the redness like some folks said. My acne was just as bad as before. I didn't buy this for acne of course, I'm just letting those who suffer know this hasn't helped it in any event. If the fine lines have diminished, it is very minor. My skin is still dry and does flake in places.I will say I love the feeling of this. I use it at night and my skin feels very moisturized.Will I buy it again? No. I will look for something that better targets my issues: redness, drying, acne, AND fine line control.I'm lucky in that I've been using moisturizers since I was a teenager. At 27, my fine lines aren't too bad but I'm always looking for an amazing product. If anyone has some suggestions for the issues I mentioned, please let me know!"
1,"Noticed new hair growth on my hairline after 2.5 months of usage.  Not sure if it is due to the oil or to the fact that I have been taking fenugreek for the last month though.  My scalp condition improved much quicker, after a couple of weeks of usage - used to be very dry and flaky and itchy.  I am oiling scalp 3 times per week overnight, then washing my hair in the morning with a mix of shikakai/aritha powders, plus amla or hibiscus.  I am now out of this product and am switching to brahmi/ amla oil from the same supplier, as I had purchased it along with the brahmi oil.  Will try to review in a couple of months as I need to see if there will be new hair growth in other places.I found out that the word brahmi is used for two different herbs  - centella asiatica (gotu kola), which is used in this product, and bacopa monnieri.  From reading on websites of some Indian producers, it is bacopa monnieri that is actually used in traditional Brahmi oil.  I also found one US supplier that uses both herbs in their Brahmi oil.  Does anybody know which one is actually used in Ayurvedic Brahmi oil?"
1,"I was very pleased with this product.  I wanted to go from multi colored blonde to more brown and it covered it evenly.  It smells good and the conditioner did wonders for my hair.  I took a chance ordering a pack of 3, but I worked out."
1,"This handsoap smells so fresh and so delicious I sometimes wash my hands just so I can smell it. It I like a cross between the freshness of parsley and the floral bouquet of honeysuckle with out being so flowery that a man can't enjoy it. I should know, I'm a man."
1,This product will dry up a nasty pimple overnight!! It is STRONG and only a tiny dab of the product is plenty. I follow this up with triple anti-biotic ointment to avoid any scarring from a nasty breakout. Fabulous product!!
1,I love these hairbands. Ive got curly hair and it is puffy like. lol. So I used it to pull my hair back and it actually holds it in place and looks good. Plus you cant beat the price.
1,Just like I remembered 20 years ago when I bought this stuff religiously. It goes on a nice spray - a wonderful refreshing smell - great after working in the yard! Softens the skin without making it greasy. Came in 2 days - whoopee! Will buy again!!
0,"I recently tried Instead after seeing a positive review for it in fashion magazine. I read the back of the box and saw the informational video on their website prior to use so I would know exactly how to insert and remove the softcup. However, I could never actually get the cup in the proper place!Instead is supposed to be inserted completely into the vagina with the end of the cup's rim touching the back of the vagina and resting just under the cervix. The front of the cup's rim is supposed to be pushed up gently behind the pubic bone so that it stay in place. However, I have small hands and short fingers and could only just BARELY push the rim and position it behind the pubic bone. Or so I thought. Perhaps my anatomy doesn't hold the cup in place as securely as it's supposed to (according to the video), but throughout the day the cup would continually dislodge and would not catch everything it was supposed to. Instead only caught maybe 50% of the blood, and I would spot the rest.I think this may be a really great product for someone else, but I think I'll stick with regular tampons."
1,"I use clinique products on a daily basis, but I love doing this mask either weekly or every other week depending on how my skin is feeling.  It makes things feel nice and tight and supper soft!"
1,"These were a gift. I am unsure as to how well the person likes them.  However, we have not heard anything back from them so we can assume that they are being enjoyed."
1,"I like this brush as an alternative to curling irons and wands used on my slightly longer than shoulder-length hair.  I had one in highschool but I didn't like it.  I though 30 years later, the quality would have improved.  I was right.  You have to take the hair in smaller sections and the curl is not defined like with an iron. It's soft, flowy curls.  However, within hours, my hair was flat.  So, unless your hair is shorter and curlier, I would not recommend if you want real curls that last.  It is NOT good for fine or thin hair."
1,"The only issue I had was the color. I ordered medium and it was too dark. Otherwise it looks good and I plan on purchasing it again in a neutral color. Be aware that it also requires you to buy a powder and a remover. It is not returnable, but amazon was kind enough to give me a refund on my money anyway. Love amazon"
1,"I just have to say that I LOVE this shade of polish by OPI. I purchased it on a whim, and I'm so glad I did. The color is this awesome light gray with just the slightest hint of olive green. It really makes my nails pop, and I receive so many compliments when I wear this shade. Plus, the staying power is great. Definitely scoop this one up!"
1,Handle broke off and there is no way to reattach. It stated static free but it was staticy from the start. Would not recommend
1,"Within a couple of days of using this product there was a bit of stinging and redness and slight peeling but that soon stopped.  I had parenthesis around my mouth that is now starting to soften.  Also, the faint crow feet near my eyes are fading.  I also have creasing on my forehead that too are softening."
0,"I had been usingSheer Cover SHEERCOVER duo concealer LIGHT/MEDIUM 3gthat was gifted to me but when I ran out a couple of months ago, and didn't want to shell a load of money, I decided to try OTC versions.Overall, this version provides 'okay' coverage but it's not as dark as I'd consider 'Medium Beige'. It's more like Fair or light Beige. The product is creamy and blends well enough and it lasted for most of the day but I do have dry spots and it could end up looking flaky. I use a mineral or loose power over my foundation and concealed spots but it was a nightmare on any delicate areas where my fine lines exist, such as around the eyes, mouth, nose and even the chin area, made for a scary end result when using loose or mineral powder over it. In other words, the lines become more prominent and it looked really caky, especially under my eyes to cover the circles. It was obvious I was wearing concealer no matter where I was using it. It did best on the smoother planes of my face, just not in the spots I needed the coverage.The lipstick tube shape makes for an easy application and control, but that's all I really liked about it. Waterproof? Meh. For the price and results, I wasn't impressed and will throw out this one and try something new."
1,"Viobin is the standard of wheat germ oil; no one else comes close to Viobin, a 75 year old brand, founded in 1936, Kosher, non-GMO, no additive, pure wheat germ oil, highest oil in vitamin E next to almonds. I purchase no more than 16oz containers, only unfiltered which are produced in glass bottles not plastic bottles. Viobin sells filtered as well, used by many beauty manufacturers and producers which I never purchase as well as defatted germ oil either. I prefer 16oz bottles. I place it in the refrigerator away from air, light and moisture which are the biggest enemy of any food item since it is a natural oil and just like majority of oils, it will go rancid, losing its medicinal and nutrition value quickly. I shake the heck out of it before any use since it separates heavily unlike any other oil. I use it as a food item consuming every single day as well as make beauty items like scrubs, soaps, shampoos, sunscreens, moisturizing creams, lotions and all.My Omega-3 is extremely high due to high fish consumption so the bad Omega-6 contained in wheat germ oil is not much of a concern to me but Viobin's claims on their website about abundance of omega-3 vs. omega-6 is misleading.  There hardly is any omega-3 but full of omega-6 infact the ratio is 6 to 1 which is a very high amount of omega-6 just like any wheat food item. Viobin offers 1.25mg of Phytosterols in each spoon which increases my HDL and lowers my LDL so Viobin has zero cholesterol. What Viobin has is lots of vitamin E and Phytosterols. Viobin is not a concern to me when I use it as a beauty item but sure when I consume directly when it comes to calories since it is high in calories just like any oil."
1,"I have been using this since it was in the light blue bottle and when this was the lone Volum Express, before the Falsies, One By One, Cat Eyes, etc. I just love it. I will say that it is a very dry mascara and takes some getting used to. The first two or three times you use it, it's really thin and feels like it's not doing anything, then it gets thicker and drier after that, which is when it'll be much easier to build volume.I layer about three coats of this to get my desired look. The first one is normal, sweeping from root to tip. The second I focus more on wiggling it in the roots, then the last I use the end of the brush to get in and separate any lashes that may have clumped up. You can even go further if you want and layer on even more if you're going for a more dramatic evening look, and you won't have to wear false lashes.I like to bend the brush into a curve to better fit my eye and I feel like that helps to coat every single lash. You can't do that with the newer rubber brushes like the one in Cover Girl Lash Blast.This stuff will not budge. I wear it in the summer even when swimming and it doesn't go anywhere. Any other mascaras will smudge right underneath my eyebrows about halfway through the day, like right where the tops of my eyelashes hit. This one doesn't do that.As far as removing it goes, I have a habit of picking of my mascara at night rather than using a makeup remover, and this is the only mascara I've ever found that just comes right off and doesn't get all goopy when I do that. If I wear other eye makeup with this mascara that I need to remove, I just use coconut oil and it all wipes off very easily.I highly recommend this mascara, but I know mascara is something that is all about personal preference. Give it a try! And remember to try it out a few times to for it to thicken up."
1,"This is a pretty good cream for the price. I have noticed my skin being smoother. I have had a few breakouts and sometimes it tingles when I use this cream, but all in all I will buy this again. I also purchased the MD Forte and it has the same amount of glycolic in it, but doesn't tingle and is triple the price.  Although, I do really really like the MD Forte, if this has the same amount of glycolic and is cheaper it wins out, but the tingling and burning might be the ph level which most creams don't list. I hope with continued use I will get compliments on my skin like other reviewers."
1,"So I got this about a month ago. I had no plans of buying anything that day, but I ended up getting it. I absolutely love Prada Candy, I have worn it everyday since I bought it- I practically ditched all my other fragrances!!! It is a far cry from the Prada infusion d'Iris...and all the other Prada fragrances. They got it right this time..... Like everyone has said, it's a warm and sweet smell but it doesn't last long...I practically douse myself in it!! I guess the only solution is to spritz this over and over (rather cumbersome!! I know, but hey, no other solution in sight), or better-still layer it if they decide to introduce its body lotion or body cream into the market. One other thing that I wish they'd change is the spritzer thingy ( I don't know what it's called )- it's not very reliable in my opinion as you could easily pull it off in trying to figure out how it's used. Otherwise, it's a great fragrance and I love it."
1,smells just like it i have no more to tell. would buy again for sure. long lasting all day long.
1,This is one of the few Lacquer's that I only need to put one coat to make the color look even. Granted opi is higher quality than most of the other brands I use but even among the other opi polishes big apple red with Sech Vite top coat looks beutiful. It goes on with a profesional looking finish. I can't say enough about the ease and smoothness of the application. love love love this Lacqure.
1,"I don't know if you can buy this in the stores anymore.  Years ago, I could find it just about anywhere.  I didn't think it existed until I ran across it at Amazon.  I've used different products since. So, listen up, I believe that AHA is a strong contributor to my skin looking as well as it does.  I've been using different strengths of AHA's for years and have great looking skin."
1,I have been using obagi for many years now.  Toner is part of a 5 part system.  I got rid of uneven skin tone and sun spot using the obagi system
1,"These don't work very well for me.  First of all, they are uncomfortable (made of scratchy paper).  Second, they don't stay on well (and yes, I followed directions).  Third, when I removed the few that stayed on overnight,  I barely noticed any change (probably because they didn't stick well).  I've also used DermaGen Anti-Wrinkle Patches.  Those were much better."
1,"Our 5 year old son has been biting his nails since he was old enough to bring his fingers to his mouth and no amount of reminding, begging, rewards, removal of favorite toys or other creative solutions would stop him from biting his nails past the quick.... and he would even gnaw his cuticles.  We tried Thumb, which may as well have been candy for as good as it worked.  I was at my wits ends because his cuticles were getting swollen with infection.  I finally saw Mavala Stop and the reviews, and hoped it would work for us.  We have used it for 4 days, and already he is growing nails!  It took one time in his mouth and he was crying ""help, there is a bad taste in my mouth, ahhhhhh"" and I took that opportunity to tell him that was because he bit his nails.  He has not bitten them once since then, and even he is proud and gets a big smile when I show him he has white on his nails now.  I will keep using it for awhile to make sure the habit is broken but I am a believer.  I got a bit in my mouth after applying it on my son, and I can attest to fact it taste really awful, but it isn't harmful and it really works!  It is pricey, but well worth it."
1,"I purchased this moisturizer because I was looking for something that would keep my skin hydrated while also treating my acne. I'm afraid this wasn't the best product for me to choose, however. It doesn't contain a sunscreen, for one, so it's not great for the daytime. It does contain salicylic acid, but only .5 percent which is not a great deal, although if you do suffer from dry skin it can irritate it. I have pretty oily skin so that isn't a problem for me, but I also struggle with moderate adult acne and don't feel this is strong enough to really take care of it. I used this for a few weeks in addition to my normal skincare routine and saw no changes.The lotion goes on clear and dispenses from a pump top for easy application. You get a full 4 ounces for the price.I would say this product would be great for someone who breaks out with light acne very occasionally, and who is looking for a *nighttime* moisturizer for the oily areas of the face. Use something different if your skin is dry and/or prone to moderate or severe acne."
1,Obaji products are some of the best skin care options available.  I recommend using the Toner and the Gentle Cleanser together.  You really don't need too much else except a good face cream.  Amazon prices on these products are really good.  I have purchased them from a dermatologist and they are more expensive.  I highly recommend these products.
1,"Love this style of brush with both boar and plastic bristles. Really like the way boar bristles smooth my hair and leave it silky, but have found that boar bristles alone do not work well to detangle, as they can't reach through the thickness of my hair. This brush is the best of both worlds, and leaves my hair both detangled and silky smooth.I'd originally triedSpornette's The New Classic Cushion, 4-Ounce. While I really liked the brush itself the construction was lacking, as a gap in the plastic snagged and pulled out my hair. I appreciate this Revlon brush, because it has a smooth one piece construction, and therefore cannot snag my hair as the Spornette brush did.I received a very pretty mauve pink color, and at this price point I'm not sure what more I could ask for in a hair brush. Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a ""porcupine"" style brush."
1,"Neutrogina Triple Moisture Deep Recovery hair Mask is extremely moisturizing. I use this treatment overnight. I allow it stay in my hair for at leat 8 hrs. The next morning, i rinse it out. My hair is very soft,shiny, and deep-moisturized. It only comes in one size, small. It cost about $8. Its small enough to throw in your purse for traveling or overnight stays.When you need a emergency fix for your hair, this is the product to use. It will transform your dry damaged hair into beautiful healthy hair."
1,"I love it, it's not a thick goopey mess of a nail polish. It stays on and it looks great. I just wish it dried faster. But then again I'm very impatient :)"
0,"I am having the worst hotflashes and not wanting to take hrt i was looking for something else that may work. i saw all these great reviews and am so glad that this product works for so many, sadly not for me.."
1,"I've only used this lotion on my neck where there were some tiny brown skin tags. They had been there for a very long time and I didn't know what to do to get rid of them. I wasn't sure what this lotion would do but wanted to give it a shot. I applied it on my neck every night. After 1 week I noticed the skin tags had noticeably flatten. I continued to use it for another 2 weeks, and 60-70% of the skin tags were gone. However, whatever left on my skin seem to be stubborn. They don't react to the lotion anymore. I lost my patience and eventually stopped using the lotion. I am switching to ROC retinol serum and will see if it'll clear all the skin tags. I plan to use the remainder of the AHA lotion on my face. Hopefully it'll help to reduce my large pore size and acne."
0,"Didn't work.  My roots are as orange as ever. I used Ash Blonde.  I put 40 drops in a box of hair color.  It said 10 drops per ounce and it was total 4 ounces.  I wasn't sure if I was putting way too much, but it didn't end up doing anything.  Disappointing.  I think I'm going to try Wella toner.  I have heard good things."
1,I have shoulder length hair and this brush gives my hair so much volume. I had two people comment on how much thicker my hair looked and I noticed that I dont need to style my hair on a daily basis anymore. I can use this brush to shape my hair as I dry it and thats it for the day.
1,I'm not sure if I like this stuff yet...I just started using it so I can't really tell you but I haven't notice a dramatic difference.  My hair I think brushes easier after I use it which I think prevents the breaking.  I say it's worth a shot if you are looking to protect against breakage!
1,I have reordered this product because I do very well with it.  It provides good moisturization and does not cause breakouts.Better than some higher priced products.
1,I have excema and this bodywash is the ONLY one that reduces the redness and itchines of my skin. Those with excema know how annoying and painful that can be.Aveeno was originally created to target excema so I imagine that's why it's so great at reducing the effects.
1,"Love the smell of this cream!! Texture is nice. :) Not too sure about the firming. However, I do find this cream very moisturizing & my skin feels good in the morning. I prefer this line over the Regenerist line which costs more.*Review by Tom's wife."
1,"Suave Daily Clarifying shampoo is great for removing build up.  I use it weekly because my dandruff shampoo builds up after a while; my friend uses it daily because the many styling products she uses leave her hair looking dull.The bottle says for ""normal to oily"" hair, but my hair is dry and I've never had an issue with it drying out my scalp.This has to be the best bargain shampoo in the world.  If I didn't suffer from dandruff I would use it only a daily basis."
1,"Love it,can't imagine ever buying anything else.The peach is greatfor fair skinned people like myself,and makes me feel beautiful."
1,"Usually when I use regular emery boards, my nails feel rough and have little ""peels"" of nail that I have to pull of when I'm done (even when I make sure to file only in one direction).  Usually I buff the tips afterward to get rid of some of the roughness.  I have very thick nails, so traditional emery boards only last one use for me because they get too worn out.This nail file is the only kind I'll ever buy again.  It's a bit slower to remove nail material, but it makes it much easier to achieve a nice symmetrical shape, and the ends are SO SMOOTH.  Additionally, the file is made entirely out of ""grit,"" rather than being a grit coating over plastic, metal, or wood.  As such, I can just rinse it off if it gets clogged and it's good as new!!!  The only issue I can foresee is that it's brittle; if you drop it it may break.  It should still be usable, but you may have a bunch of little files!"
1,I love Olay products and again this is one more great one.  I highly recommend it for all.  I love it on my skin.
1,"Even though I brought this in Medium Brown, it has such a fine point that I can use it with my (somewhat gray; I'm 68) eyebrows. I don't use eyeliner (I use fancy eyelid gel makeup), but I have used pencil eyeliner in the past and this is one of the best on the market!"
1,When you don't feel like itting under a dryer or blw drying your hair this is what you need. I can carry it around the house whille it drys your hair.
1,"Product was as expected, good quality. I would recommend. My hair does not get stuck in it and it does not pull my hair out."
0,"I want to make clear I haven't bought this item from this seller, but I have used it every single day for almost 2 years, and I bought it in the UK and later here in Macys NYC let me tell you do not waste your money!!! it didn't do anything for my stretch marks and wrinkles, as I used it on my face as well. In fact do your own search about the strivectin scam. The company is shady and this cream has the same components as one of the Olay creams for a fraction of the price. They also say Idebenol which is also another fraud. I hope it helps."
1,"I love Olay but this is my least favorite. It feels too thick. My favorite day cream is Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum which makes my face feel like silk and my makeup goes on smooth. At night I like Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream. I use both on my face, neck and chest. I wish I had started using Olay on my chest sooner as my chest is sun damaged and looking wrinkly but my face and neck are wrinkle free at 53."
1,"I use spf a lot, and this is my fav, it absorbs nicely, and I don't sneeze when using it, plus it does give the skin a nice glow,"
1,"Good turban for wet hair! My other turban is getting old and I can't find that one anymore so thought this would be close to the old towel. It is small so better for people with a smaller head size and not a lot of long thick hair. I have small head and shorter thin hair and it is a bit snug for me, the elastic is snug. Seems like a good product it does absorb a lot if water because when I take it off the ycloth seems a lot wetter then my other regular towel turban. I like the button and loop feature stays in place real well.i I just hope after time the elastic loosens a bit.I haven't washed yet, need to remember do not use bleach or fabric softner on these."
1,I bought this to use in homemade body butter because I wanted the butter to be good for hands and nails too.  It works great with the body butter and I had enough left over to use straight on my nails.  I really like it and I think it is helping with the peeling on my nails.  It is a little early to really determine that but I have noticed less peeling lately.  The only change is the body butter and the jojoba oil so I suspect it has played a part in healthier nails.
1,"I love the scent & the lather! Slightly ""lemony"" with undertones of warm vanilla. Like, a warmer lemon fragrance. It feels a bit ""chalky"" and milky as you lather.... in a good way. I have used this on my face and it's great. I've washed my hair with it in a pinch, and I have heard from numerous women that it's especially good for washing their ""nether-regions"" since the PH of this soap does not disrupt the delicate bacteria/yeast balance down there. Use this if you get recurring BV or yeast infections. The bar dissolves quickly."
1,"I love this item! I have really sensitive skin and i am very careful to what i put in my face because some items make my face burn, this item makes my face feel fresh and once i peel of the mask my face looks brighter and cleaner, it works really well! It works good on taking your black heads off."
1,"I picked the 3.5 oz (100g) tube of this product off the supermarket shelf for silly reasons: it was bigger than most hand creams there but it was small enough to fit into my purse.After using it for a few days, I noticed that my hands and especially fingers felt soft and slightly slippery even after rinsing with water. I happen to read the text on the back of the packaging: the second of a list of 4 bullets said ""Lasts through hand washing."" Of course, if you use strong soap and really scrub, you do have to re-apply the lotion afterwards, but I noticed that even after washing out a glass using dish detergent, my fingers still felt somewhat moisturized. I do apply more lotion but I don't 'have to' every time."
1,"I've been looking all over for something that's adjustable for when I wash my face and do my makeup. I have purchased just regular stretch, and it's either too tight on my head or not wide enough. This was perfect, love the material and adjustable velcro...and it's wide enough to cover my hair for when I wash my face."
1,"I'm a fan of the cake eyeliner! I discovered gel eyeliner about a year ago and after the compact I had purchased started becoming dry, I decided to look elsewhere. I stumbled across cake eyeliner online and I think it actually works better than gel eyeliner. For some reason it shows up on my eyes better."
1,"I have tried many different eyeliners, and each had its own problems. Even the expensive eyeliners I had issues with.This eyeliner I am very pleased with. It dries quickly, applies easily (although it takes a bit of practice as the brush is rather small) and gives a clean line. It washes off easily, yet remained on my lids for approximately fifteen (15) hours. My eyes are very sensitive, and this eyeliner does not bother my eyes. It is also well pigmented. It did not flake and it did not smudge (side note: I do use a lid primer).My only issue is that the brown color is really more of a brown-black. Being a pale redhead, I do need more of a ""crayon brown."" Aside from that, I am satisfied and will be using this for as long as they manufacture it."
1,"First off I want to say that I have very thin, very fine, wavy hair.Second I want to say that I am a complete moron when it comes to styling my own hair. It's nearly impossible for me to get the curls that I want. I've tried everything including hot rollers, curlformers, wands, irons, flexi rods, hot flexi rods, spoolies, perms, and every crunching gel, mousse, cream, or spray known to man. And none of those have given me the look I want. I should explain that a great deal of my styling failure is due to user error. I am a 30 year old woman and I am ashamed to admit... I have no idea what I'm doing with any of those things. (even after watching countless tutorials)But FINALLY i have something that gives me the look I want. ... nice bouncy curls that last!I have no clue why this product isn't all over youtube or the rest of the internet. Like no one is talking about it... which baffles me. It's soooo cheap. You can find it at practically any store, and it works miracles!! I admit it does take some practice to master but I'm telling you if I can do it, literally anyone else can. I know most people probably use this brush for getting that blow out look or just creating volume or waves, but I use it for getting CURLS. Since the picture on the package itself showed tight curls and it says right on there that you can achieve tight curls, that is what I aimed to do. And I did! It can be easy to get your hair tangled, but just don't wrap the hair around tightly, and don't wrap any hair over itself, and you'll be fine. If you follow the directions it comes with, it's actually pretty easy not to tangle. And on the rare times that I do, I just kind of shake the brush a little and gently tug it away from my hair and then it's fine.Another thing I like about this is the ability for do-overs. I have a Conair curling iron that only gives you one shot. If you mess up your curl one time, it is impossible to fix it. But that isn't the case with this brush. I honestly have no clue why this curls so much better for me than any other wand or iron. I mean it's basically just a clipless iron with bristles but it just works so well. It also gives me volume that nothing else has ever given my flat lifeless hair.And the look lasts all day! No hair spray needed! I am so happy I found this. It's my holy grail!"
1,very amazing cream. lasts a very long time. goes on smooth. does not leave face feeling greasy. i love this stuff.
0,"i had high expectations for this mask after i heard so many good things about it. i was disappointed to find out it really is  no miracle solution, at least not for my skin. i have normal skin, a bit dry in the winter, slightly (not really) oily in the summer. i have never had acne before this year as a 25 year adult so maybe this mask didnt do anything because adult acne is usually hormonal? i dont know i am not saying dont try it because very skin is different but it might not work for you. definitely didnt do any of the magic in decreasing the size of pores ( my pores are small but visible on my nose and they were same size after the mask) or getting rid of blackheads and drawing the impurities to the surface. just didnt do anything in particular so still looking for that miracle solution but to those who found it, congrats"
1,"I love this scent and it's the only one my husband ever commented on.  And it lasts forever in that I only wear it on special occasions and it just takes a drop.But I guess it's not for everyone.I first smelled it on a friend about 30yrs ago and have loved it ever since.But I agree... if you can try a sample first, by all means do so.  I'm wondering if the reviewer who hated it may have put on too much.MEF"
1,"This oil reminds me of coconut oil in that it is a solid at room temperature and must be warmed to become more of a liquid.  It has an herbal scent like most ayurvedic products.  It looks like this thick dark green goop and is really greasy. Being natural, all the extra grease and moisture is really helpful.  I use it as a deep moisturizing treatment before i shampoo my hair. Sometimes I'll put it in my hair and sleep with it overnight then wash the next day. Or i will just put it in my hair for a few hours then wash.  I also put it in a bottle to make it easier to dispense when using it to oil my scalp.  My hair loves this stuff. It stays moisturized for days and the hair doesn't feel greasy like with a lot of creamy type products that can become overwhelming at a times.  A little goes a long ways so it will last a long time!! I love it!"
1,This is an absolute must to get great coverage with mineral makeup. I love it and use it from concealer coverage of redness.
1,I bought several of these for Christmas gifts.  Besides being very pretty and smelling nice they are great little boxes.  I may come back and order some more later for something other than shaving.
1,"I am in a nursing home and the No Rinse products are fantastic for bathing in bed. I am going to use it at home for those ""I need a quick bath and or hair wash"" moments. Good for anybody that's sick, laid up or disabled and showering and bath tubs are just too difficult and dangerous."
1,"Have used for years...Vagisil Anti-Itch Creme, Maximum Strength, 1-Ounce (28 g) (Pack of 4) good to have on time if you needed it."
1,"'Egyptian Goddess' is a seriously sexy fragrance.  Deep, musky and exotically mysterious.  A little dab will probably get any one's pheromones going."
1,"I had a sample of this stuff that I used on a trip to Disney World (in September). At the time I'd started using several new products so I couldn't figure out what was making the difference, but my hair, which normally has a halo of fuzzy frizz in humidity, would, at worst, curl and wave (which it does naturally). It was actually a better product for letting my naturally wavy hair do what it wants to do and look nice than anything I'd used, and if I used an iron it would keep it smooth, and either way, NO FRIZZ.Even without intense humidity, it makes my hair significantly more manageable. After the sample ran out I realized it had been the difference, since I didn't have a single good hair day without it. Keeps it smoother, holds style better, and much more tolerant of my terrible hair dryer. Just got this full bottle, and I'm sitting here playing with my hair nonstop. Normally my hair is like straw the day I blow-dry it unless I use tons of oils and silicone-based products, but I used only this and a bit of mousse and its light, smooth, silky (but not fake shiny), and looks incredibly healthy.I highly suggest anyone with frizzy, unruly hair try this and switching to a cleansing conditioner (like Wen, but there are cheaper versions). For the first time in my life, I love my thick, wavy hair without having to burn it into submission with an iron. I live in Savannah so the product gets put through the ringer fairly often."
1,"I have used this hair conditioner off and on for about four years now and I like it best. It works to help untangle my ruthless wavy/curly/spirally mess of hair after I shower, and leaves a pleasant smell :)"
1,I like this comb because it makes detangling damaged hair easy and it gets excess hair out of your hair that's ready to come out. I use this product on my healthy hair growth journey!
1,"I have extremely dry skin/psoriasis and I have tried all of the moisturizers in the world that claim to relieve dry skin but Cetaphil is the only cream that has ever saved me. It's really great for any skin type and I recommend it to everyone. It seems like it would be greasy but when its put on, it absorbs really fast and you can see that your skin really and FINALLY finally moisturized and its a rather wonderful feeling. I'm pretty sure that if I didn't use it, I'll have horribly dry/ peeling skin all over my face and look twenty years older than I actually do because of it. It's so wonderful! CeraVe and Cetaphil are the two moisturizers I highly recommend, but Cetaphil is still my favorite."
1,This is a good all around mascara. It is not my favorite but you can find this brand every where and it is always under 5$. It does not clump and makes my lashes look long
1,"No, I don't use this stuff, but my wife and many of her friends do and all report lessening of hot flashes and mood swings.  Guys, do not suggest this to your lady as it will not go well for you.  Ladies, please try it -- all the women I know to have done so love it."
1,"I believe that every woman should read the book, &#34;What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Menopause: The Breakthrough Book on Natural Progesterone&#34;.  It's a real eye opener. The physician author describes - in very clear language - why every woman needs progesterone replacement and why unopposed estrogen is dangerous. I'm an RN and even I got tons of false data regarding this issue as I was going through training years ago. I was shocked at what I read here and yet this author hits the nail on the head and makes perfect sense. At any rate, this is the cream he originally recommended and I find it to be very easy to use."
1,Good but not my favorite......Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash - 6 fl oz.......had some hormonal break outs ....did not do much in my opinion!~
1,Smooth you make up.Reduces oil on oily faces when used with the cover cream.I will recommend it a friend.
1,I have been using this sponge for years.  It is the best.  I will never use any other sponge.  I like that you only have to replace it every 3 months.
1,"I used to use my bath towel to dry my hair, but it was so big and heavy it would fall off. This is nice and lightweight, stays on my head for hours (literally!), and does a better job of absorbing moisture. I also bring it to the gym when I shower because it's absorbent enough to dry my whole body, but fits better in my little gym bag."
1,"This is by far the best and strongest smelling bar of soap made by Plantlife.  I put the bar in my guest bathroom and even after washing my hands, the whole restroom smells very good!  The size of the bar is quite bigger than I thought.  If you arn't sure which fragrence you like, i'd recommend first buying the sampler pack, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NV8Y3E/ref=oh_o03_s00_i01_details  To see which smell you like best. Just be aware that the sampler pack has much smaller sized soaps that if you buy the bars individually."
1,"Other reviewers mentioned already, so I list my use briefly as a pro:1. One cotton (both side) to wipe off all of your face2. Cotton doesn't get fallen apart so there is no annoyance3. You can CUT any size to use for treatment (Lotion mask on eye area etc)4. Cost effective ; Morning & Night Use with toner then 2 cotton if no extra treatment, that will last 1 month +For the quality and usefulness, this price is reasonable considering &#34;Made in Japan&#34; imported.Cons:No drug store easy buy... I always get at SephoraI have to say, This cotton & other Japanese made cotton (Koh Gen Doh etc) are really superior to most other companies'.  Try it once, you will know the difference!"
1,"I've been using the Alpha Hydrox for a little over two months now, and honestly, there's barely any discernable difference, if any. Now, none of us should have high hopes that an over-the-counter wrinkle remover will make a meaningful difference. In fact, Consumer Reports just rated a dozen or so and the best one was the $20 Neutrogena wrinkle remover, which received a better rating than Lancme and others costing $65. Even so, CR was quick to point out that NONE of the creams or serums, as they are oft called, made much of a difference.This cream may make your  face tingle a bit--it does on mine, which indicates that it might be slightly acidic and therefore help remove the thinnest layer of skin and with it, some fine lines (whatever that means--they're not so fine to me!). But it's just so hard to tell.For the price you can certainly give it a shot--just don't expect a meaningful difference. As I said, it's been about two months and if anything changes for the better, I'll adjust my review."
1,"I was pleasantly surprised. The Iron curled the hair very nicely and the price is unbeatable. I got it here for 10$ and in stores, it's like 16$."
1,"This is my 4th time buying this product. I meant to get the tinted but, missed that button :(. Still a great product providing SPF protection. Will buy again."
0,"I'm a fan of OPI and will continue to buy their nail polish and other products. Italian Love Affair didn't apply nicely on my finger nails as other OPI polishes. It may have been a ""bad batch"". It went on my finger nails streaky and the color is way too light, even after several coats.If you like a light polish then you may like this. I haven't tried it on my toes yet."
1,I really like this retinol night treatment.  Just follow the instructions and see fantastic results.  It has become part of my daily regime and I will always use it.  It doesn't burn or irritate.  Use it before bed time and see youthful results in the morning.
1,"This stuff really does work.  On some 'situations' it works overnight and other situations it may take one to three days - and that's still not a long time.  I had a pimple or two that popped while washing which was an accident.  It ended spreading into a few more pimples and I think it became infected.  It looked just horrible.I was desperate for something stronger to put on it.  I read about Bye Bye Blemish and majority of the reviews were good.  To my surprise, that situation on my face looked better within a few hours.  Overnight, it looked even better.  Within a couple of days it was completely gone.I think it was infected because as the BBB was drying it out, the pus would really ooze out.  It was disgusting.  After all of the pus finished oozing out within a day or so it just dried up and shrunk away.  I was so happy. I'd never seen anything like it."
1,I have been using this for one week now. Had to up the resistance to #14 the first week. #6 and #8 use alone just wasn't enough. I exercise daily and follow the DVD instructions. The results are yet to be seen.
0,"I'm usually the kind that doesn't need ""frills"" and if a product works great, I can deal with smell or looks or feel, etc. I am more interested in a product working than the frills that come with it. Well I could not do that with this product. It stunk so bad that you could smell me wherever I went. The smell faded at the end of the day but you'd stink almost a whole day after using it. And the bad thing is that it didn't even work well enough to make it worth the stench. Very disappointed as I was looking forward to this product. Instead I went with Raw African Organic Shea Butter. No frills and smell isn't great but it doesn't linger at all and works fantastic. I have really dry skin and the ""chicken bumps"" and was really wanting a cure from this product - nope."
1,"This is a great idea and useful for anyone who prefers to use Benzoyl Peroxide in a wash instead of a cream. I like using this once every few weeks to kill the bacteria that can cause blackheads. It is a rich, creamy clay-like mask that instantly dissolves when water is applied. You can apply this before getting in the shower and it easily rinses away.As the product penetrates into your pores, you feel a cooling sensation. This is also a wonderful product to use on large areas of your body, like your back in the summer, etc. If warm weather makes you break out, try this product a few times a week and I think you will see a difference in the clearness of your skin.It is rather drying, so you might want to use a more intense moisturizer on the day you use this product.3.5% Benzoyl PeroxideAlso look for Biore Deep Cleansing Pore StripsClean & Clear concealing treatment stick~The Rebecca Review"
0,"This is a descent, thick moisturizer. I usually really like Dessert Essence products so I was excited to try it. It leaves my skin feeling a little bit greasy. It also smells like pee, literally. I'm not just exaggerating a bad smell. It really smells like pee. If they could fix the smell, I would probably give this product 3 stars."
1,"Maybelline has a great line of mascara at a reasonable price. This is one of my favorites. I have used this line since I was a teen and continue to use it today, into my 50's. Very simple to use, great color options, just makes the lashes look fuller and darker; and that's what it's all about  :)"
0,"the smell of some sort of pineapple fruit drink is overwhelming... the &#34;tropical&#34; definitely dominates the &#34;coconut.&#34; I was expecting coconut with a hint of something else, and got almost no coconut scent and a powerful candy fruit smell instead, hence the rating."
1,"I use this toner as an after shave. It helps keep my face clear of blemishes and helps prevent ingrowns from shaving. Burns a little on first application, but is wayyy more tolerable than the red colored one. I keep a bottle around my office too to freshen up before meetings. Takes the oil right off. Love it"
1,They do seem to work! Go figure.  I can't leave them on all night as you can feel it and it bugs me but they do work.  I cut mine down sometimes and put other places I feel might benefit from a little retro beauty treatment.
1,I have been dealing with mild adult acne and I have been using this product as a toner and cleanser. It makes my skin feel refreshed and clean without drying it out. It also has a calming affect on my skin. I can see my acne spots slowly fading and my skin is clearing up. I have been using this in conjunction with a  20% salicylic acid peel to help control my acne... and I was very worried about my skin becoming overly dry but rest assure this puts subtle moisture back into my face. This is a good product. My mom swears by this stuff and now I see why.
1,"Recommended by my doctor and this price is the best I've seen anywhere.  Anytime I'm going to order something, I add this on."
1,"This Product is amazing ! i am dark skin and have been using it for about a week and i already see a difference. it leaves your face feeling smooth soft and new. Do not use around eyes! it will make the area raw because your skin is thinnest in those areas. it is enough foam on the pad to use for everything, I use it for my face, knees, and my arm pits to help even complexion and it works!! NO EXAGGERATION honestly it works money well spent!"
1,"I absolutely love this product!  Finally, a tinted moisturizer that actually has some coverage to it.  I would definitely say this falls more into the BB cream category without all of the marketing gimmicks.  I use this as my daily makeup, use some color correcting concealer if needed, and set with a translucent powder.  I love that it is actually light enough for me, but be aware that there is nothing medium about this product, unless you are in the middle of the fair skin tones.  I love that the product helps even out skin tone & has SPF 30.  This product is 14.99 at my local Target so be sure to price compare!"
1,Great blush or highlight.  I'm not liking it for my lips just because it's a strange consistency to have on your lips.  But it's a lovely  product.
0,doesn't work
1,"The item got here very quickly.  I used it on the second day of not washing my hair and I can't say I was thrilled with the results.  Maybe I didn't use it correctly, I will try again.  It seems to leave a heavy film on my hair.  It looked clean but felt very heavy so I ended up washing my hair."
1,"It is great that shipping is free for individual products on Amazon. Otherwise, I am not sure if I would have initially purchased. Formula is thick and moisturizing, smells of fresh apricots. The tub lasts a long time, as use is very minimal due to consistency. Feels lathering and smooth on the face. Noticeable results every morning."
1,"I absolutely love this water spray. It keeps my face moisturized in a dry climate and heals any acne or small skin infections. I always carry the small bottle with me, too. It comes in very handy."
1,"I needed a 1/2 inch curling iron and this one works just fine for my needs.  I have one of the same model in the one inch and I liked it, so ordered the same model in the smaller size.  I like that it turns itself off after a certain period of time because I often forget to do so.  I also like that you can adjust the heat or strength of curl.  I have had many Conair products over the years and have been satisfied with all of them."
1,"This face cream is very light and easy to apply. There is no harsh sunblock-y smell, or stinging when I apply it. Also, my skin absorbs it well."
0,"I don't know what's in this stuff, but it really irritates the delicate skin around my eyes (it makes my eyes water after application, tears literally rolling down as if I've been sobbing my eyes out) and burns the skin on my face.I've used Olay products in the past and used this with Olay cleansers and never had a bad reaction. I'm not allergic to anything that I know of either! At first I assumed I had something on my hands, like pepper from cooking. I tried again with the same result. Then I thought maybe I had a bad bottle. I purchased another and got the same effect again.Additionally, when I tried to put my makeup on over this (once my eyes stopped watering) I couldn't get my foundation to go on over it. It doesn't really absorb into the skin well (like many lotions with SPF in them unfortunately) and when I put my foundation over it both the lotion and foundation were sloughing off all over the place. I tried it a couple of times with different foundations (I really tried to do my due diligence) each time with the same effect. I'd have to remove my makeup and lotion and start over with new lotion and foundation. As a busy mother, I don't have the time for all that!My solution was #1 to stop using this lotion and #2 to use a lotion with no SPF in it underneath a foundation that does have SPF."
1,"I have used these cleansing pads for months and haven't seen much improvement in my acne or skin condition overall. They're good for scrubbing excess dry skin on the face, but I'm not sure to what extent they are cleansing anything. I always cut the pads in half because the whole pad itself was more than my face needed. My acne did not improve until I started a prescription from my dermatologist instead. This is probably better for those with skin that has acne now and then (very mild acne). I have adult acne, mostly around my jawline though it appears anywhere on my face as well. I think it would take a lot more than the amount of salicylic acid in this product for someone like me. My acne isn't terrible, but I look like I'm in middle/high school with what's on my face. Unfortunately, I will not continue buying this product anymore for myself, and will just continue with recommendations from my dermatologist."
1,"I purchased several bottles of Suave Professionals Humectant Moisture Shampoo when Amazon had it on sale for $1.24. At that price, it was a real bargain. It is a decent shampoo, that didn't dry out or leave my ""normal"" hair greasy. The shampoo is a poor man's Nexxus or Paul Mitchell formula. Having used both of those over the years, the Suave version isn't as good. If you have dry or damaged hair, you may want to look elsewhere. Also, the current Amazon price is $5.99. There is no way I'd pay this for a Suave product. If you can get it on sale, and have ""normal"" hair though, I can recommend Suave Professionals Humectant Moisture Shampoo."
1,"It is a nice big roller, gets very hot n quick. Has many heat settings. I have mine on the higher ones n I have very thick hair"
1,"I have very sensitive skin and this moisturizer works well for me.  I like this version better than the version specifically designed for sensitive skin because of the lactic acid, which helps moisturize my skin and also prevents breakouts for me!  I use this primarily at night.  It does have a slightly WEIRD smell which takes some getting used to... now I hardly notice it after a couple years of use."
1,Works like its supposed to.  Just have to get used to how much to use.  Sometimes too little and they come loose.  Solid bead of adhesive and it stays all day - over 13 hours.
1,"I use this on my face in the morning and at night. There is a nice cool sensation on your skin, which is great for the Summer heat. It cleans my pores and I actually see the difference it makes on my skin. I have a combination of oily/dry skin. I don't use any foundations or anything on my face except for Aloe Vera face day and night cream. Make sure you use warm water (not hot or it'll dry your face) to wash your face in order to open up your pores and and wash all the dirt away. Then apply the toner, which will clean off any left over residue and close your pores before more dirt goes in."
0,"Let me start by saying that I KNEW this soap had a very unique smell, described by other reviewers as being similar to a campfire. I thought that would be fine, since I love camping and campfires. Unfortunately, the soap I received smells nothing like a campfire; rather, it smells like a pile of burning tires. Or like burning garbage. (Having grown up in the country, I know what both of those things smell like.)Anyway, despite the awful smell, I tried using this soap several times. Contrary to what is written on the packaging, it did not lather white; the lather was more of a brownish-yellow. Fortunately it didn't seem to leave any discoloration on my skin. But the main reason that I won't be using this soap again is because the smell stayed on my skin for a very long time... 8+ hours. I could have lived with the brown lather and the nasty smell IF the smell had not stayed on my skin... but there is no way I'm going to go out in public smelling like a trash fire. Not gonna happen!I really, really wanted to like this soap. I've been searching for something that would help with acne and seb derm, and this soap seems to get a lot of good reviews from folks with those conditions. I'm wondering if the manufacturer changed the formula or something, because the soap I received is just nasty and is not like the soap described in the other reviews.Anyway, give it a try, but be prepared to smell like ashes and cinders."
1,"I love this hair curler set. I have purchased two of them now, one for each daughter. Both have long, thick hair and we find that it does an excellent job of providing just the right amount of curl for those occasions when you need it. It takes just a few minutes to heat up and the soft velvet lining on the rods make it less damaging to hair.The only thing I always hate is the clips! Even though there is a small case to hold them, sometimes they get lost!  Replacement clip sets would be much appreciated. I think the curler set contains just the right number of each size of roller -- even better though would be to have two ore large ones!!Recommended."
1,Love essie nail polish and white is a need for the looks and designs I want. love love love it!
1,Love this scent - it's addictive.  I love the way it makes your skin feel so clean and it rinses off with no residue.  Some soaps make you feel that you have to rinse and rinse and rinse.  Perfect soap.
1,"I think this product works really well for what it says it does!Only problem is I stopped using this to use another productbecause my acne started getting better )not sure if it was due to this,most likely this with combo of new face wash)recommended, & love that it doesnt smell too strong, like many other acne meds"
1,"This Full and Soft Mascara definitely lives up to its name! It gives your lashes a natural look, but more amped-up and defined. When I'm not in search of an almost-false-lashes look, this is what I'll go for! Very, very good product!"
1,"If I put this on in the morning; it lasts all day.  What I mean is that, at the end of the day, you will still have color on your lips.  It can survive kissing, eating, etc.  I like the yellow one, as it's a little less bright pink than the green (on me.)  A good way to use these lipsticks -- and to still be able to vary your lip color -- is to put this on as a base coat, blot it, and put another color of any of your favorite lipsticks on top.  If they are too bright for you, you can put another color on top that is kind of in the &#34;nudes&#34; range.  Works great!!"
0,"I was tired of spending $17 at Nordstrom for the similar Mario brand of this type of lotion.  So, thought I'd try this.  This looks the same but does not perform."
1,"I am a black woman with  natural hair (kinda kinky coily not soft loose curls by any means). I wear my hair straight, blown out and flat ironed. I attempted to use these rollers (after reading reviews stating it would not revert my hair, so yes I did read the reviews first) and the results were not good for me. These rollers gave me a few curls but all they really did was put too much moisture in my hair and leave me with a fluffy mess. I gave these three stars because they were packaged well, in perfect working order, and would probably work very well on someone else's hair.The rollers heated very quickly, you do have to get a rhythm going to get the shields on the rollers properly. The steam is not hot to the touch on the roller itself but you can feel the heat. The machine heats really quickly so you are ready to go almost as soon as you plug the machine in.As I stated earlier this is probably a great product for another woman but it reverted my hair and I had to send it back. I think I should go for a traditional hot roller system."
1,"makes my face more oily and the smell of tea tree is horrible. Didn't help much on pimples but it did excellent on my skin tag, yehey. I just soak my skin tag with a dot of the cream and cover it w/ bandage overnight. I did it for I think 3-4consecutive days then after that, the skin tag became painful and turned black. I tried to pull it but it's very painful so I left it. THe following day, it fell off by itself, and it's gone, THank God!!"
0,"nice packagingnice smell and texture.But if you are having difficulty falling sleep problem ,this product dose not promote sleep. At least for me it dose not work much. I need to go and take lorazpam!Since I paid for it, I use it as kind of face moisturizer on my face before sleep:)))"
1,"I have been using Olay Regenerist daily regenerating serum for a year and a half now (along with the Regenerist moisturizer and night cream) and I think it has slowed down the aging of my 56-year-old skin. There have been times when I've skipped the Regenerist skin care routine for a few weeks, and my skin looks duller and the fine lines on my upper lip look worse. The price is high, but you don't use much, so the cost per application is reasonable. The Regenerist products last a long time. I'm still on my first 3.4 ounce bottle of the serum. After washing my face, I use toner, then apply the Regenerist serum. By the time I've brushed my teeth, the serum has dried, and I apply either Regenerist moisturizer or Regenerist night cream. Another good thing about these products is the scent. The moisturizer and serum are unscented, and the night cream has a really lovely, mild scent."
1,I love Aveeno PRS. This is the best moisturizer I ahve ever used and I have tried most everything. The price on Amazon is beyond any store price I have seen. Much less expensive here. Enjoy!
1,it is not for water proof make ups.
1,I looked up the positive review of this product. I don't know if it works. I just been using it for 3 weeks. I would say the item was delivered on time and well packaged.
1,"If you have extremely dry, chapped, itchy skin, this is the oil for you. I ordered to replace sweet almond oil that I had been using in my skin care routine, but found that it was a little thicker and not exactly what I needed for my skin. I love what it does after shaving my legs, bikini area, underarms (smooth, soft, supple skin) and I put on after bathing everyday while my skin is still wet. I would recommend using an essential oil of your choosing to give it a fragrance if you don't want to smell like oil. LOL! I don't particularly care for the smell, which is almost non-existent anyway. I love NOW! products and this is another one that did not disappoint. For the price and the size, you just can't get anything better. I would rather use this than lotion anyday.  Also, it is very long-lasting as you only need a few drops to cover your entire body. I mix with baking soda for an exfoliator unlike anything I have ever used....wonderful!"
1,"Not sure how Philosophy did it, but this truly does smell just like a margarita from the lime to the tequila right down to the salt. Definitely rings lime, but not in a overly citrusy way. The scent is very fragrant is the shower, but as all 3 in 1's, this does not linger on the skin. I know for most people the lack of these scents lingering is a con, but for me it's a plus. I personally do not want to smell like a margarita all day, and in general I prefer to not have shower gels linger as it interferes with my perfume.I'm a sulfate free girl when it comes to shampoo so I haven't used this on my hair, but it doubles are a bubble bath just as well as a shower gel, lots of bubbles. Also lathers very well as a shower gel.Would repurchase."
0,I love Oil of Olay. My primary moisturizer is Oil of Olay Total Effects 7 in One and I love LOVE the creamy fine odor-free texture of the Total Effects but this one is just a weird feeling on your face. I also did not notice any results from using it. I think I even tossed the rest and I've never done that with a cream. Pretty sad it didn't turn out good as I do love the line of Oil of Olay.
1,"I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I love how silky my face is after applying. I have sensitive skin and this product feels great with out irritation, leaves my face smooth."
1,It came quickly and is reasonably priced.  My husband hair looks thicker and he is thinning at the top of his head.  I would recommend this to anyone that has thinning hair.
1,After receiving this I realized I had had one of these for the problems with teenaged skin. Now it does a nice job exfoliating!
1,Got this product and I never heard of this so I took a chance and when I got it I fell head over heels for this new smell I won't let anybody use this perfume but me sounds selfish but its my favorite now so thanks for selling a wonderful perfume I will be stocking up on this product
1,This is the best moisturizer that I have ever used. It is great for dry skin and also helps prevent pimples. I love it!
1,"I've smelled versions of Egyptian Goddess before and they always smelled soapy or too much like a stick of incense. Based on the overall positive reviews here (and the price), I decided to try this oil. It's warm, sexy and layers nicely with some of my other perfumes (like ""Boyfriend"" by Kate Walsh). And I have been getting compliments on it (mostly by women so I'm still uncertain if it appeals to men). I do wish the fragrance lasted longer though."
1,"Love this lotion.  I use it daily after the shower.  My skin soaks it up.  Smells good, light weight.  Love."
1,"I have used this product for years. Before I get out of the shower, it turn the water on HOT.. Let it get steamy. Then turn off the water and then apply. Great on the elbows and knees . The fragrance is ok but it is a great moisturizer and not oily."
1,"This product is pretty good but it wasn't what I was looking for, though it does strengthen your nails as is says it doesn't last very long under your polish, though I'm sure it would be good if you use it by itself and can keep adding every few days to keep your nails stronger.  I was hoping it was more of a strengthener base coat but it's not and in some cases the polish seeped under and stained my nails which shouldn't happen with a ridge filler but it did."
0,"this never dries, even weeks later and comes off on everything. Your hands will be covered with this and also your pillowcase. Also leaves a powderish film on your hair."
1,Scalpicin is the only immediate relief product that seems to work at all. Imanage to deal with the problem for good after a few months of experimenting with various shampoos and other treatments. But in the mean time Scalpicin stopped me from scratching my skin off!
1,"this and O.P.I are the only two nail polish's i will even put on my nails , yes i have become that impressed with those two brands ."
1,"I have been an insomniac all my life but don't like the adverse effects of most sleep aids. This was given as a gift to me. I would have never thought that something like this could work! I rub some on my temples and my lips and I slowly relax and fall asleep much more easily. Of course when I am completely wired it won't work as well or as fast, but I was amazed that on some nights that I forgot to use it I tossed and turned for while. Then I put this on and then fell asleep! I don't know how it works but it does. The smell is very discreet and pleasant."
1,"i purchase this as a recommendation to use along my clarisonic mia 2, and i love it, it leaves my oily skin feeling clean and fresh, and removes make up like no other, excellent to save a few steps of my nightly routine."
1,I am sensitive to the feeling of anything &#34;heavy&#34; on my face. This feels light and makes my skin feel so soft. Love the product.
1,"This bag really surprised me!  I bought it to store my electric toothbrush in because toothbrush holders aren't large enough. I figured I'd have to put it in diagonally because it is so large, but it fits perfectly!  I was able to put a lot of miscellaneous items from under my bathroom sink, so it isn't all cluttered in there anymore. I'm going to get more of these bags to organize the rest of my bathroom items, then probably even some of my other cupboards and closets!  I love it!!!  I am sure it would be great for taking on trips, too, and it's so easy to organize your things in the pocket, so that it all looks good."
1,"I love these! I only wish the ""large"" rollers were actually large. They made my curls too tight, it looked like I was going to an 80's prom! Otherwise, they worked great. I have long, thin straight hair, and let the rollers warm up for almost 10 minutes. They were definitely hot enough, but not too hot to hold. The clips held my hair very well. The case is small, perfect for traveling. Too bad they don't make a ""jumbo"" rollers version of this!"
1,"i gave up on false eyelashes because i never had any luck with the adhesives.  i tried doing it myself (using shu uemura glue) and they lasted about two hours.  for my wedding, i had them professionally applied and one side came undone!  then i read a how-to article and it only recommended one brand - &#34;it's duo or dirt.&#34;  well, i am definitely a believer.  i've worn them several times now without any problems.  and when i'm ready to remove the lashes, they come off very easily - no ripping out my natural lashes.  also, it's cheap and you can find it pretty much anywhere.  love love love this stuff!!"
1,I ran across this product from looking at YouTube. My nails were crying from slitting terribly (my fingernails as well as my toenails) I mean they were spitting way past the amount that I could trim. They became tender and started hurting and catching onto everthing which made things worse. I was at my witts end because nothing was correcting the problem. I'd take vitamins including a multi and Biotin and nothing was helping until I broke down and ordered this product and I am so glad I did. It arrived pretty quickly and I put it on asap. I noticed the difference within 2 days of application and I was amazed. No more sensitivity or pain and within of 5 days my nails grew very nicely and there where no new signs of the splitting and the old splits were trimmed down to a normal health healthy new nails. May I also add this stuff grows out your nails quicker than anything I've ever seen...AMAZING!!!
0,This HOT BRUSH does not curl is basically a piece of junk. Not an adequate hair curler. Get a real hair curler and use with oil treatments so your hair does not dry out.
1,"I have some SERIOUS acne. Like forreal. I've been using this for about a month, and it does a great job at getting rid of individual zits. However, when you feel one brewing under your skin, this doesn't help much. I would recommend."
1,"I have a set of Conair rollers from 2008 that are flocked and work great, but the set only has 8 large rollers in it. I need at least 20 to do all of my hair. So I bought this to supplement that set.I have long (just below bra strap), thick, coarse, slightly wavy hair that is very easy to curl, and holds curl for a long time.I used both sets at the same time so I could compare how they worked.This set does not get nearly as hot as my other set. But, I left them in for at least 20 minutes, and the curls they made were nearly identical to those made by the older set of rollers.I found that the little set of teeth on one side of these rollers really helped grip my hair so I could wrap it around each roller.The size of the large rollers in this set is just a bit smaller than the large in my other Conair set- but those also have the fuzzy coating on them. This difference in size between the two sets did not seem to make the curls look any different, though.I think the key with this set is to let it heat up with the lid zipped for at least 10 minutes, if not a bit longer.Based on my first use of the set, I feel it gives me what I was looking for: nice full waves and smooth, shiny hair. I also like that the set is small and compact and takes up much less counter space than my older set.Given that these rollers do not ever reach a high temperature, they might not work as well for people whose hair doesn't hold curl well. I am actually pleasantly surprised that they made curls identical to the hotter set, as it seems there is less heat damage I will subject my hair to if I continue to use these on a regular basis."
1,"I was impressed with how quickly they heated up and the amount of curl it produced. Wish they came in a bigger size, the curl was a little tight for me and maybe it's just an adjustment of time in hair and amount of hair per roller. Overall, excellent!"
1,"I have very sensative skin and have tried pretty much every facial wash (drug store, spa, department store brands). My favorite (very expensive) facial wash was discontinued, so I was back on the hunt. I finally decided to try this cleanser and LOVE it. Does not irritate my skin or cause breakouts. Cleans, but doesn't strip moisture. Give this one a try!"
1,This is not a rubber comb. it is clear plastic and cool looking. I like it for wet hair that tends to tangle. Great price. I got it to make the $25 free shipping when I needed to spend just $2 more. I am glad I got it nice item and not in my local store.
1,"There are those of us, of a certain age, who never managed the technique of holding a hair dryer and a round brush at the same time.  We grew up in the era of long natural straight hair.  Now we live at a time when more styling devices are required.  This is a great tool for getting curl or body into hair while holding only one object.  Be sure to have your hair damp-dry before you start, or styling will take forever.  The motor is small, and doesn't &#34;blow&#34; very strongly.  Get the majority of the water out of hair first, and you will be ok."
1,"I cannot believe how strong my nails are. I use this twice a day (morning and night). I started using this when my acrylics were removed. The portion of the nail that is still thin from drilling is like a strong nail. I am so excited. I thought I was going to have to go the whole 3 months with ugly nails, but instead could use the ones that were damaged. SO HAPPY!"
0,"I started using this a few years ago. I was on the hunt for a face lotion that had atleast SPF 30 and had light coverage. This seemed perfect. Unfortunately, it's too dry to really be a moisturizer. I find I have to use a serum (which I would use anyways at 34), a base lotion, then this on top for the spf coverage.  I don't hate this product. But there are some drawbacks:Cons:I have combo skin, oily on forehead and t-zone, but dry on cheecks. This is not moisturizing enough.Feels heavyGets REALLY greasyVery thick, almost like a foundation.BURNS MY EYES TERRIBLY. I can't use this around my eyes at all. I put it on with a foundation brush I lightly dab around the eye area. If I am in a hurry and just rub it on, it'll burn my eyes the rest of the day. (I don't wear contacts or anything.)Also, if you are outside and sweating it'll run into your eyes and sting.Seems to sit on top of the skin, instead of blending in.Has no anti-aging properties. Thought the soybeans would even skin tone or brighten...something! Nothing.Pros:Good coverage. I stopped using foundation when I started using this.Convienent pump bottle that locks for traveling.Size of the bottle will last FOREVER. One pump and your good to go.  If you use more than this, YOU WILL BE GREASY.Good for every day use. When I know I am going to be out in the sun all day, I use a 50 spf zinc cream. (I'm fair and burn easily.)I started using this when I was pregnant with #4. I know hormones do crazy things, but I got a horrible pregnancy mask while using this in the sun. I know masks are caused by hormones, but the sun accensenuates them. While I don't burn with this product, (I might get a little red, but not fry) this did not protect against the sun enough. Last winter,  I watched my mask fade. When the summer hit (after the baby was 9 months old) I would go back in the sun and it brought my mask out again in full force. I think this doesn't shield enough from the sun.I am currently looking for another lotion that has SPF and color that isn't greasy & won't sting my eyes. I have only continued to use this because most tinted moisturizers with spf are the same price for only 1.5 - 2 ounces. So price wise, this is a bargain.Also, I let my Mom try it & she said her eyes were tearing up constantly and burning as well. (She does wear contacts & doesn't have sensitive skin.)"
1,"Fast delivery, just like I imagined it would be. I could reuse them since their quality is good, but having ordered 30 of them in a batch, I don't really bother at times."
1,"It's an off white-ish color. Just what I was looking for. My only problem is that it goes on kinda streaky. I apply two coats and it evens out somewhat with the 2nd coat, but not enough. Maybe I'm applying the coats too thin. Maybe I need to add a little nail enamel thinner to my bottle. From a distance, it looks amazing and very flattering against my brown skin. Up close, there's room for improvement due to the streaks. I see that some people use this shade for a more natural looking French manicure. As of this writing, I've only used it for full-nail coverage. Other than that it stays on pretty well as do all of my other Essie polishes."
1,"I've been using this steamer for the last 9 years.  My first lasted about 8 years, but got a little crusty by the end of it.  The timer option is great so  I don't have to keep track of time.  This one includes a convenient measuring cup.  I wasn't crazy about the exfoliation tool (prefer to use a combo of Cetaphil and baking soda), but I guess it does the job.  I use the steamer about 2x a week for blackheads."
1,I love this product!!!!! and could not do without it. If you have problem skin please please try it. My Dermatologist recommended it to me and I have been so Happy. The price was a little steep but I did get a pack of three. Other than the price I would purchase again.
1,I have had acne since childhood and have tried almost every product under the sun to get rid of it. My sensitive skin transitioned to combination and was constantly red from all the products so finally I had had enough. This oil is amazing! A few drops covers my entire face as a moisturizer in the morning or can be blended with a moisturizer for a boost. It is lightweight and doesn't feel oily on.  I have left all my old harsh products behind and am using all natural now. I wish I would have done this years ago!
1,"I cannot begin to say how much I love this product. I have tried many skin care solutions over the years and run into a number of problems because they are scented with perfumes or have heavy petroleum additives that upset my sensitive skin. This oil is quite dense, not watered down like in some body sprays. The scent is refreshing and I find it works better for me than lotion. I've recently lost a large amount of weight and this has been the best solution to helping my skin firm back up again. My scars from surgery and my stretch marks have faded very quickly since I started using it. I also use it as a replacement for shaving cream (since I am allergic to most) and have found that it does a great job of protecting my skin and seems to make the blades on my razor last a bit longer."
1,"If you are looking to give yourself a hair spa treatment with castor oil, be sure it's cold processed.  The one you find on the supermaket shelf is not the same thing."
1,"I really like this product, it is my go-to peel off mask. All of Freeman's products are amazing, and this one is no different. It smells just like cucumbers, and it is not difficult to remove at all. It's kind of a thicker consistency so its a little hard to spread onto your skin but its not an impossible task. I just removed it from my face about ten minutes ago and it feels fresh and clean. I recommend this to anyone looking for a peel-off mask, and if you're just shopping for masks in general, I recommend any of the Freeman products, especially this one, the lemon and mint clay mask, and the anti-stress dead sea minerals mask."
1,This is probably the only beauty product where I've not switched or otherwise chased the next new thing.  I have complete brand loyalty to this face wash and even my boyfriend uses it now.  Not drying but totally removes makeup.  Burns like lava if it gets in your eyes.
1,"I USUALLY DON'T SHOUT IN MY REVIEWS BUT THIS IS SERIOUSLY THE BEST STUFF ON EARTH!Okay seriously though, I've used this stuff for around 5 years now and my skin has never felt better. The lotion is light yet tough enough to deal with almost any skin condition, especially dry skin. I have mild acne and it doesn't cause additional breakouts. The scent is amazing and I wouldn't be surprised if that was the &#34;stress relief&#34; part of it.I also use this after shaving, peels, Retin-A, etc. This heals your skin within hours. A 12-ounce bottle lasts 6-8 months. I used to be a Vaseline junkie, and I still like their products, but nothing beats this lotion. NOTHING."
1,"I wanted to try this soap out because I really like the cocoa butter lotions and creams Palmer's makes. This soap was just okay. The scent was not very strong and it was a bit drying. It was better than most commercial soaps, but I am used to Dove so maybe that is why this felt dry."
1,"At first I was a little hesitant to use this product as the last hand cream I got from this company several people remarked smelled like bacon grease!  But this is a lovely--not very effective though--product for those of us with very dry cuticles from handling lots of papers and books.Another good point is that it is quite a ""solid"" so it doesn't melt in your purse on a hot day.  The diliemma is that because it is ""natural"" it's missing some important healing chemicals, like AHA's, that I have found to work very effectivly in other cuticle creams.  So if your goal is natural first, healing second this is a good product for you.  Otherwise, back to the chemical lab for me!"
1,Fresh scent with no sticky feel left behind at all! That's one of the best parts other then the fact my sensitive dramatic skin doesn't break out from this stuff. I didn't see a difference in my skin so that's why I'm giving it 4 stars. Other than that this stuff is good.
0,Embarrassingly enough I was using this on nearly my entire face. I have always had mild acne but since I have had a lot of upper GI problems this year my skin has been outrageously hateful towards me. I have been using it daily for about 2 months now with no improvement for my acne.
1,"I have very stubborn fingernails. They commit every sin you can think of.  They split.  They peel.  They crack.  All I want is for these nails to just grow out fom the end of my finger, just once, without coming apart.  I'm working on it with this miracle stuff.  It's expensive and the bottle is tiny, but someone said you could use it every other day and it's just as effective, so that's what I'm doing. I am seeing a teeny, tiny bit of fingernail coming out right now."
1,I bought it for a friend. She used it only at night. She told me she really liked it and would like to purchase more.
1,My skin is feeling and looking so much better after using Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula moisturizing body oil; it really does softens and has a very light scent.
1,"I give it 5 stars,beleive me it has done wonders for me,my face and neck,..en thought for my age I really look very young,I will continue to use Olay work wonders for me!!!"
1,I've used this in the past so based on past experience it is a great product.I still have another product I'm using and when I'm finished using that thenI'll use this.
1,I use after my serums etc and it is sooo very refreshing.  I've found that it also works great to set your makeup for the day.
1,Good enough to cover a scar. I am happy that I bought thisproduct. I will buy again. It's a good price compared tomany other products like this one.
1,"Highly recommended when researching anti-wrinkle treatments.  No one guesses my age.  Love it!  This is actually more of a gel, and I mix it with my night and day moisturizers when spreading on my face."
1,"I rec'd this polish yesterday and decided to try it out quickly. I found out the color looks exactly like the bottle, except for the fact that the bottle looks a lot grayer in the picture than it really is. I actually googled before purchasing: ""Essie School of Hard Rocks"" and I liked the results in the Images section. The color of this polish is pretty much what is shown in those pictures, those are the real deal. I like the color because you can't really tell if it is a a gray, blue or green polish. It really depends on what you're wearing, your skin tone and the light etc.Overall I'm very pleased with the color. I think it will look great with the summer colors."
1,"I have used this product several times through the last 15 years to treat my tinea versicolor.  While in the shower, I simply ""shampoo"" my skin in the affected areas.  Use more than you think you need to create a rich, thick lather, then let it sit on your skin for 5 minutes while you shave your legs or just soak in the shower.  Then simply rinse it off.  Two to three such applications is enough to completely eradicate my TV and keep it gone for 3-4 years.  No kidding!  When it eventually comes back, I perform this routine again and am TV free for another 3-4 years.  This is the only product I've found that works this quickly and effectively.  It's wonderful!"
1,"In the last year or so my acne has gotten out of control, I don't know if it's hormones or what but changing my diet and excerise routine didn't help so I've been trying different products. Nothing worked, Proactive, any of the drug store brand of washes/cleansers/systems. I remembered that I had used this awhile back but had to stop because it severely dried out my skin. I decided to try it out again. It's only been 4 days and my acne is almost completely gone and what is left looks like it will be gone soon and no new break outs. I'm using this with Garnier gel-cream moisturizer and so far it seems to be helping to keep the Vanishing cream that comes in this package from drying out my skin. As for the pills, I was worried they'd taste horrible (you're supposed to chew them) but they're not even chalky and don't taste like anything. For the price it is, it definitely was worth trying again. I sincerely hopes this works for you too."
1,Really cleans your face.  Came quickly and is afford at a great price.  Peter Thomas Roth products are incredible.  I love how young it makes my face.
1,"I am over 50 and have used this for years, it works the best. I have some other stuff,its lighter and ok for summer. This is really great in the winter weather . poepl comment all the time on how lovely my skin is, I rarely wear any make up."
1,"This got me through the winter but I loved it so much I ordered another.  Great night cream, but I use a little in the day as well.  Love the smell, helps me sleep at night. I did (and will continue) to buy again!"
0,"This lipgloss was too pale, unflattering, and all nars lipglosses are way too sticky, make my lips peel, smell and taste bad.  My go to lip glosses are revlon over the counter lipgloss."
1,My wife and me use it as a daily fragrance (not for special days). It is a very versatile fragrance and actually there is no difference of sex in it.
1,This color is great for leaving summer behind and going into fall.  It has really helped me in prepping for the cooler fall weather.
1,"si han mejorado mis u&ntilde;as, pero aun se siguen escamando.  No lo aplico diario y no s&eacute; si ese sea el problema, lo aplico como base antes de pintar mis u&ntilde;as de color.my nails have getting better, but still pealing.  I don't apply it everyday, so I don't know if that is the problem, I apply it as a base before the color nail polish.UPDATE:this is the second time I order this product and I would say that my nails are so long for first time in my whole life.  I really recomend it, just be constant with the use, give your nails a time to react, remember the first growth won be probably healthy enough because it is the nail that already growth and cover your nail before the treatment, use a good polish remover that doesn't dry too much your nails, protect your nails, don't use them like a tool, they are not tools, for anything; use gloves to do dishes and for the cleanning and if you want as I do , use another color polish on top of the Formula 2 Plus so it help to protect even more the already growth nail."
1,"Bought this because my shower was getting cluttered with different kind of soap, shampoo, face wash and etc. After receiving this and putting it up on my shower wall, no more bottles!Pros:Each bottle holds a lot of liquid.Each to use buttons.Clean design.Comes with waterproof adhesive and it's stick as hell.Durable - I've dropped the bottles over and over again when I was clumsily trying to shampoo inside and it still works.Cons:The adhesive stinks when you first place it on but that's a given and does not take away rating for this product."
1,"I bought this towel to wrap around my hair because normal bath towels make my hair frizzy. This towel definitely cuts down on frizz and makes my hair look much more tame. It is the perfect size to wrap my head with and does not feel to heavy on it. The only issue I have with this towel is that it is not as absorbent as I need it to be. If I had fine to normal hair, I would probably give this product 5 stars. However, I have a lot of thick, curly hair that sops up water like a sponge so I need a little more absorbency than this towel provides. Overall, I would say to give this towel a try. There's a reason why it has got so many good reviews."
1,"I hadn't tried any of the Aveeno products before this, but my dermatologist recommended it and now I don't buy anything else.  It is light, suds well and is so gentle that it doesn't even burn your eyes.  My skin feels healthy and clean and never dry or tight.  I would recommend this to anyone even if you do not have any skin problems or sensitivities."
1,"I switch my cleansers seasonally, as in the winter my skin is too dry and in the summer far too oily. Purity Made Simple is good for the summer at cutting through all the grease and gunk. It's also pretty good at taking off waterproof mascara without irritating my eyes (I manage to do it, I think, without getting much in my eyes, but whatever makes it in there doesn't sting). It was my first cleanser as a step up from Oil of Olay type stuff, and I've never looked back since. It doesn't lather up, but that doesn't mean it's not getting your face clean. Doesn't do anything for zits, and I find it kind of irritating for dry winter skin, but for normal-oily skin without issues, it's pretty good."
1,"I use Jojoba Oil as a medium for essential oils (I add them as aromatherapy). I'm nearly out, so I must order more. It lasted many months."
1,"This lip balm is almost as wonderful as their Norwegian hand cream (which is the best), now I have two favorites neutrogena products"
1,My doctor recommended this so I bought it. It's a bit thick and hard to blend in but if you can get past that it's supposed to be good for you. The price was acceptable and with fast shipping I have no real complaints. I live in FL and need the spf on a daily basis.
1,"I have wavy/curly 2B/2C Hair. When it starts to get frizzy and out of control I shampoo with this, and it transforms my hair to silky smooth. It replaces a cabinet full of products, and it is curly girl friendly too!"
1,I have very sensitive skin and breaks out with lots of different skincare products but not this one. love how it feels and works!
0,"I hated the color that was sent to me, pale chalky beige.  I would have preferred a vivid color instead. Please don't be mislead into thinking that you are getting all five colors, because you will only get one. Advertisement not very clear, very confusing."
1,It took a little longer to bond then I thought it would but once it's dried the lashes stayed in place all night.  I used this for a costume so I don't know about it for everyday use but for my needs it was perfect.
0,"Made me break out like crazy...in places I never used to get zits. I have pimples on my upper lip, cheeks, underside of nose. Horrible. Waste of money. Cheaper in stores, but still not worth it. This has never happened to me before. I have loved all other Neutrogena products, but this one just doesn't work. Now I have to find another cleanser that can get rid of the zits this gave me. zero stars."
1,"I purchased the Wahl Clip N Trim here at Amazon and was stunned at how much use we really got out of it.  It has a great assortment of different length guides.  They snap on and off easily.  They feel like &#34;quality&#34;, too.  You are not worried it is the wrong length.  The touch up trimmer that is built on that &#34;flips&#34; to trim things like the back of a neck and sideburns is awesome but can be easily snapped off by mistake.  You always have to watch it and be careful with it.  Mine eventually broke off, but I was still able to use it by keeping a finger on it while I trimmed.  This trimmer finally just wore out and needed replacement but it's been almost 10 years. I came back to Amazon and am delighted to see they still sell this one.  I have a cheaper Conair trimmer I picked up in the meantime at a local store because I happened to see it on a  last ditch clearance, but the features of it are not as nice as this one.  What makes this one stand out to me is the flip trimmer.  This Clip N Trim  is a great buy and will last years with proper care.  Mine probably would have lasted longer had I oiled the blade each time, etc.  Don't hesitate on this purchase.  We have saved hundreds over the years on haircuts I know.  My husband was paying $20ish a cut years ago and basically I can put the #5 clip on this and give him a cut in minutes that is easy and it looks just as good.  There is no telling how much this has saved us over the years.  He gets a haircut about every 5-6 weeks, so we've saved a lot of money.  If you are trying this for the first time &  not confident in your cutting, YouTube has thousands (if not more) of clips on how to use trimmers and do cuts.  They are worth a quick watch.  You can do it with this little trimmer."
1,I'm no stranger to red hair and i have to say this dye faded the fastest. But the first week it was an amazing color. This is the only Feria hair color I have used that faded this fast. I feel like It would last longer if you are one of those people that can go a while without washing your hair. But i also only wash my hair about every three days because it doesn't get super oily.
1,I've always considered buying this brand because I've seen it advertised in several magazines as a &#34;best beauty pick&#34; so I thought it must be good.  I really don't find it that great of a mascara.  I think it's more of the wand than the mascara itself.  It's a very thin brush and you have to coat your lashes like 20 times to get decent coverage.  I also prefer curved mascara wands because I think they make application easier than straight ones do.  This mascara has a straight wand.  I'd rate this product as average.
1,"Oily, and makes makeup slip off without having to apply pressure on the cotton pad. A little goes a long way. Cuts through heavy duty mascara, liner, shadow, you name it (I've used it on stubborn lip stains). You will have to wipe/clean the oil off your lids and lashes if you want to reapply makeup after using this. If you DO need to reapply after using remover, you should consider a water-based makeup remover that will evaporate so you don't have to worry about oil residue causing your makeup to slip off. Usually I remove my makeup at the end of the day before bathing and don't reapply makeup until the next day, so the oil doesn't bother me. Will repurchase."
1,"I continue to use Neutrogena Clear Pore Oil Eliminating Astringent because it works.  The only problem that I had with this purchase is that it leaked in the mail.  Fortunately, it was wrapped in plastic and the loss was minimal but it was disappointing not to receive the full amount of liquid."
1,"For years I used the Redken's Clarifying Shampoo weekly on recommendation of my stylist. It has lemon and other citrusy fruits and really, I mean really cleans your hair. When you're done, your hair is squeaky clean. I ran out of that and this Suave Clarifying was the only clarifying shampoo I could find at Walmart which really had me baffled. I went ahead and bought it with the clarifying conditioner. Used it today and yes, it does clean the hair but no better than any other shampoo. My hair felt nice and soft and had very few tangles. But, it didn't really clarify like I wanted and I already have my favorite shampoo and conditioner. The funny thing was that the ""longer lasting fragrance"" was what was advertised on the bottle, not it's ability to clean hair. The scent wasn't bothersome to me and I am sensitive to fragrances. It smells like something between fresh and floral. I can't put my finger on it, but it's just fine. I'll probably use this about two times a week and hopefully the rest of the family will help me out using it up. I doubt I'll repurchase."
1,"Nothing fancy -- just gets the job done. Best for normal or combination skin, nothing too dry or too oily. Still prefer my pricier cleanser, but this one works well in a pinch -- especially considering the price."
1,Something about morning burst drives me crazy because i dont wear make up because i have really good skin all i do is put this on and some mascara and im all set it gives me that fresh look i love and have been using it for years even when i buy other moisturizers i always go back to this
1,"Clean and Clear Face Wash really works. I really love it. It has a cool minty tingle that makes your face feel refreshed, and it really prevents pimples. In general, I have pretty clear skin and this face wash keeps it that way. I go through this product so often that I am constantly buying it. Only, I have one recommendation. Be very careful with this product. It is very strong and it will bleach your clothes and towels. This happened even when I used it in the shower. Make sure to use a white towel or a towel you don't care about. Besides for that problem, the product works great and I am very satisfied!"
1,This serum is well suited to my sensitive skin.I can still use it when I'm having breakouts on the face and it actually helps breakouts disappear.
1,"I received a sample of Hanae Mori Butterfly and was instantly hooked.  It's feminine and romantic without being too young and sweet.  I loved the faint vanilla-like undertone then found out it's an almond/strawberry and mysterious berries. It's so nice I can't go to sleep until I have some on. If you like Lauren Romance, Donna Karan Cashmere Mist and others along those lines, try this if you're looking for something new."
1,I have been wanting to try a menstrual cup out but was hesitant. I decided to try these rather than the diva cup or reusable ones. I like the fact I can just throw it away. I was surprised I actually like this product!When inserting push back and down not up. I have not had a leak with this technique. I have not had any issues with it coming out. If you bear down too hard it might come out though. I put the garbage can right in front of me when taking the cup out. I really don't think it's messy at all. I pull it out slowly and am careful not to spill. You will obviously get blood on your fingers but you could put gloves on if it bothers you. I have not tried taking out or inserting a new cup in a public restroom. I would rather do this at home. It is really nice not having to worry about changing a tampon all the time!
1,"I was hoping this would be more of a pink coral, but it's more orange, which is also very pretty, just not what I was looking for.Love Essie nail polishes however and can't say this one is any different, two coats covered excellent and stayed well when a top coat completed it."
1,"This Witch Hazel Toner with Rose Petal is soothing and refreshing during hot and dry Colorado days.  Wonderful after dermabrasion treatments, as it cools, calms and heals the skin quickly and cleanly, without a residue.  I put the toner in a spray bottle, keep it at bedside and find it refreshing before sleeping - face, neck, chest - even on the pillow."
1,I use thayers witch hazel as a face toner and decided to try the pads. My only complaint is they're very thin and a little rough feeling. I would not recommend it for someone with very sensitive skin.
0,"I was trying to replace a peel off mask I had in college over 10 yrs ago but couldn't remember the name; it left my face soft and it was easy to peel off and it didnt have a strong smell, but this product is the opposite. This product is messy to apply and thick, and it takes a long time to dry and I don't see a difference in my face when I take it off. I left it in the draw with all the other products I don't really use because they do nothing special. I mean really!!!"
1,"""Shampoo that looks like a round, green lava pumice stone - you've got to be kidding!! Who thought up that packaging gimmick?"" This was my reaction when a friend showed me her latest method for washing and de-tangling her hair. My hair is plentiful, but it is baby fine and flyaway. I take very good care of it, always have, but any product that leaves more than a touch of residue, (for conditioning purposes), weighs my tresses down. Also, I color my hair and have to be careful I don't dry it out. Skeptically, I tried out Karma Komba, and WOW!This hard shampoo lathers up beautifully and quickly. It rinses out leaving my hair squeaky clean - with no tangles. I just use a dab of conditioner - and that's not always necessary with Karma Komba. Made with essential oils, with undertones of citrus and spices, this product is also good for the scalp. It works well for most hair types. A slight scent of patchouli lingers - but very faint and pleasant. The result is glossy, soft, full bodied hair. I immediately ordered 3 more ""rounds"" to have on hand when this one is finished. I am addicted - a real fan! I have since tried other LUSH products and have had good results so far. Very highly recommended!JANA"
1,"Get this. Now. Seriously. I have bitten my nails since I was a kid and I have not bitten my nails for two weeks now (since I started using this). I actually have some fingernails to paint now. It tastes horrible, which is exactly what I wanted. It is not peppery- it is something else that's way more putrid. Similar to licking a cotton swab of fingernail polish remover. I have to reapply every two days or so because the bad taste fades after that amount of time. Be careful when you eat finger food, as the taste can get on your food. I am delighted with this product."
1,"I love this liquid liner. I've only owned one before, and it was so runny and hard to apply that I never used it. I forget what brand that was. This one is perfect. The brush is the perfect width, and it holds the exact amount of liner needed. This stuff is not runny, and it dries almost instantly once applied. There is just enough time for me to wipe off my mistakes. Once it's on, it's ON though. The first time I wore it, I forgot to take it off before bed. I woke up the next morning planning to wash it off and reapply, but it was so perfect even after a night's sleep that I kept it on and wore it the whole day without issue. I use Cold's Cream to take it off, and it works just fine. I have such an unsteady hand, and I can usually not apply any kind of eyeliner for the life of me, but somehow even I can apply this evenly! I recommend this to anyone who has struggled with eyeliner or liquid liners before."
1,I needed a good hair extension brush since my other one broke. This one does the justice for mine. Highly recommended :)
0,"yes, it heats up, but the heat dial and on/off switch are constantly turned down or turned off due to their location.  Would look at other brands before purchasing."
1,"This may work on dandruff but does not work on seborrhoeic dermatitis. They are different. Dandruff is a generic term and coal-tar active ingredient products like this one may work on the kind of dandruff that flakes.If you have an itchy scalp which does not shed but instead causes sores, you may have the already mentioned seborrhoeic dermatitis. The latter is caused by clogged oil glands. It often takes place if you don't shampoo frequently. That was the case with me. I shampooed only once a week because I did not want to ruin my expensive hair-color. The problem took several years to really develop before my doctor and I finally figured out what was wrong. What you need instead is a shampoo like the kind of Selsun Blue which contains selenium hydride."
0,"I admit I havent tried this but I don't have to in order to know it only derserves ONE star! I have been researching skin care products trying to find out what the ingredients actually are because I am looking for the perfect face wash/moisturizer for my skin. I have gotten so tired of reading labels and having no idea what I am about to be putting on my skin (and as a result, into my bloodstream) I have sensitive skin which happens to also be acne-prone and have had a really difficult time with trial & error on different skin care products. TIRED of wasting money! I want something affordable AND safe! Is this too much to ask???I loved the idea of this cream and was really wanting to give it a try until I got to the 5th ingredient in this product list- Triethanolamine. After a little research on this ingredient I need not go any further with my Ponds Cold Cream research and will not be using this product!!! Here [...] a link to the alarming article I found on this ingredient:I would rather not risk it & if you read the facts on it you probably won't either!If ANYONE out there has any recommendations for skin products that are mostly natural & non-comedogenic  (I mean ALL the ingredients are)(NO salicylic acid or any other FOR acne (DRYING) agents in them,I am open!PS-SOMEONE please create a fragrance-FREE, all natural, non-comedogenic, NON-drying face wash that also serves as a moisturizer (as cold cream does)!Thanks!"
1,"I use this product as a base eye color.  It helps to look - as they say - well rested.  It goes on easy, it is obvious this product will last me a long time, a little goes a long way.  very happy with this purchase."
1,I have been using quality usually high priced skincare all my life and tried this on a whim as it was on a today's deal special and I had a coupon...OMG! I wish I had purchased a case at that price! It is amazing and I have used products that cost 5-6 times as much with lesser results. Love love love!
1,my manicures held the same amount of time as they did with out this product not impressed may work for other people didn't work for me though
1,"I tried this out because of the great reviews.I didn't really notice much of a difference, but that could be because I don't have any wrinkles.I hope this will help me not get bad wrinkles as I get older...NEVER TOO EARLY TOO START!"
0,"I don't know what's up with this brush, but my hair always gets caught in the tiny little grooves on the handle (the red part). I have no clue why people would leave a gap there when making this brush, but it hurts my hair and pulls a lot.  I still use it, but I would never buy another one."
1,"When it comes to many beauty products, I'm a big fan of going for the drugstore brands over the higher-end luxury brands and this Revlon lipstick does not disappoint! They're very pigmented and moisturizing, which is great for my chronically chapped lips. The color goes on smooth and I don't find it feathering out or flaking after a few hours like I do with many other lip colors.I was looking for some nice colors for fall and bought these in Rum Raisin and Raisin Rage, which go great with my medium Indian skin tone. Rum Raisin is a softer pinkish red color, which is beautiful for the daytime. Raisin Rage is a bolder red-burgundy. I didn't find it nearly as purple as the picture shows. It's awesome for the fall, and is that perfect red color I was looking for, without looking too 90s.Knocked off one star for staying power. This didn't last too long on me. Then again, most lipsticks don't due to my dry, chapped lips. The moisturization and pigmentation more than makes up for it. I don't mind touching up every now and then. Definitely my new HG for lipsticks!"
1,good product does what it says oil of olay products a good used it for my trip to mexico last month and the price was great
1,love the lotion.  i will wait until baby is at least 6 months to start using.  smell is great just taking precautions for allergy  reasons.
1,I recently purchased a toiletry bag similar to this online at Macy's and was disappointed at the lack of quality. This one is truly real leather... The toiletry bag is a bit bigger than I expected but I don't think my boyfriend will mind that since he does travel quite a bit. I like that there is a separate compartment on the bottom... that was a requested feature by its recipient so I am sure he will be pleased... not easy to find this!
1,"I discovered this product when I was searching for something to cover up the whiteness caused by Aveeno 85 Sunblock. This moisturizer is perfect for that purpose. It has SPF 30, which is not relevant to me, since it's going on over the heavy sunblock, but that is a nice feature for anyone wanting to protect their skin. I use the Fair to Light tint, and it covers up the sunscreen with a nice even coverage. It's very sheer and natural looking and I have gotten a lot of compliments on my skin since I started using it. I don't use a lot, just one pump in the morning and I'm done, so it lasts a really long time. Like all the Aveeno products, it has a faint pleasant smell that doesn't linger. Well worth the price."
1,"I love the ionic conditioning feature of this hairdryer. It works! Other than that, it's pretty much your average hair dryer. I do keep accidentally turning it off because of the way the switch is located, but I expect I'll eventually adapt to that."
1,"It doesn't contain alcohol so is non-drying, which is important since I use this product twice a day.  The alcohol-based toners make my face even more oily after initially making it tight and dry.  So I keep going back to this one.  Another good thing about this rose petal toner is that it lasts a long time.  Even using it twice a day, it takes me over 2 months to get through a bottle."
0,This product did nothing for me. It is basically a lotion. This did not wash my face or moisturize it. It is not what I expected.
1,"I HAVE TRIED NUMEROUS LIQUID EYE LINERS DURING THE YEARS, BUT ALWAYS REVERTED BACK TO THIS INEXPENSIVE PRESTIGE EYELINER. IT NEVER RUNS AND STAYS IN PLACE.  EVEN IN HEAVY WINDS, WITH MY EYES TEARING, IT DOESN'T BUDGE.I RECENTLY ORDERED TWO, JUST TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT I ALWAYS HAVE A SPARE AT HAND!!!!!!YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IN &#34;PRESTIGE'S EYELINER&#34; PERFORMANCE.I EVEN USE IT ON MY LOWER LASHLINE, GIVING IT A MORE DRAMATIC LOOK, WHEN GOING OUT IN THE EVENING."
1,"I see the beautiful hair of the Middle Eastern women and thought there must be some treatment for such glorious results. This oil is one of those treatments. I'm not too concerned about the herbal smell. It actually grew on me. However, the results of the oil on my scalp and hair is awesome."
1,"I just purchased this from a discount beauty supply yesterday and used it this morning.  I have somewhat dry, color-treated hair in a neutral red shade that was fading fast.  This particular color gave me the coppery deep red I like, without the weird purple tint of some other red dyes I have tried.  In addition, this is the shiniest my hair has been after coloring.  The smell is pleasant.  I will definitely use this again, but I will do a few things differently next time because I found the product to be extremely messy.  Next time I think I will shampoo and towel dry like the instructions say, but I think I will actually put the product on my hair in the shower and sit out the 25 minutes there.  This stuff is very drippy and even though I was careful, I wound up with droplets here there and everywhere.  I put on a clear disposable cap that helped a little, but still - very messy and that's coming from an experienced ""bathroom chemist"" who has used a lot of hair coloring.I left the product on for 25 minutes as directed and I rinsed but did not let the water run completely clear.  It's a little trick I do to ""set"" the color so it lasts longer.  Once I had most of the product out and the water still had a little tint still showing, I put on my regular cheapo conditioner, rinsed it out and blew my hair dry.  I was pleased that the color didn't ""grab"" on the ends of my hair and make them too dark like some other products have done.  So - I got a nice even tone - very shiny, soft and a vibrant copper red tone.  Why haven't I heard of this stuff before?  4 stars instead of 5 because of the mess."
1,My husband has been using this product on his back acne for years.  First time I saw it in Maximum Strength.  It's the only product that worked for him and we tried many of them.  All over the counter.  He's 55 so it might work on anyone will body acne.
1,Ditto all previous reviews. I do use or need foundation when I use this powder.excellent flawless coverage. I am 60 years old. I did buy this at Walmart for 5.83. Sorry Amazon.
1,I have thick hair and it works great. Makes hair soft and shiny.  If you use too much it will make your hair look flat.
1,"this little thing barely takes up any space in my bathroom, it's fast, it's easy to use and it works great.... sometimes i don't even have to heat up the rollers... i just put them on get dressed and by the time i'm done i take them off and i'm good to go.....:-)... and i have african american hair, so for this roller set to do such a good job on my hair means i'm never parting away from it...:-).... i really do recommend it."
1,I must admit that I love most pinks so I was not disappointed with this purchase. The polish was exactly as described and looked so pretty on my feet and hands
1,"This is the real Versace Bright Crystal fragrance.  My bottle was not open, tampered with, or have a strong alcohol smell. I love how clean this perfume smells. I tried it out at Macy's. I wanted to try a fendi  scent, but the salesman asked me to try Bright Crystal and another Versace scent. I smelled the other first and then Bright Crystal. I was instantly sold on the Bright Crystal. I sprayed it on myself and then came straight to amazon to get it at a fraction of the price. The bottle is huge! I'll be wearing this everyday to the office, I'm sure I'll receive tons of compliments. Because the scent is not overpowering and very clean, I don't have to worry about it being too loud in an office setting. Thanks amazon!"
1,This perfume is a must have for women who want a casual but professional scent. It is very nice and the price isn't too bad.
1,I have bad frown lines--so bad that botox and dysport doesn't last for more than 30 days.  These keep the lines from be coming permanent.  I'm allergic to adhesive and don't have a problem with these--and they really stick.
1,"I bought this to go with the art of shaving kit I bought for my husband for Christmas.  It seemed to take forever to get here, but it was worth the wait.  It looks beautiful out on our bathroom vanity & does the trick with no issues thus far."
1,"Being able to renew my old polish with all new Essie colors is my early birthday to me from me for me! Finding all the colors I wanted but just didn't want to pay the store prices is so awesome! Thank you Amazon & Essie. This is one of my all time favorite color's! This is top shelf nail polish, you pay more and it is worth it."
1,"Even dry skin responds to this gentle 'body scrub.' Aveeno products are usually affordable and effective so I have a tendency to purchase products from a brand name that I am familiar with and have used before. This will be another addition to 'my favorites list.' Recommended for normal, dry and sensitive skin. If you have skin allergies, be sure to read the ingredient list!"
1,"The Suave Apple Detangler works very well.  I've used it on my children's hair, and my own hair, and it does the job.  Things I like about the Apple scented detangler is that it is never greasy, and it doesn't  weigh down even fine hair.We use it on damp hair only.  And I would add that much to my surprise that the Purple bottle Swirlberry doesn't work as well.A fine detangler for children and for many adults.  (People with processed hair should probably use something stronger.)Pam T~mom/official family hairwasher"
1,"Olay is great.  I started using basic Oil of Olay over 30 years ago.  They've expanded their product line, and their prices have gone up, but compared to what you'd pay for department store skin lotions, well, no contest."
1,"Burt's Bees is an incredibly moisturizing lip balm/shimmer/gloss!  Usually anything this moisturizing does not have the amount of color that this has.  My lips feel so good after wearing this all day, but it looks as good as lipstick!  It isn't sticky or smell bad like a lot of lip glosses, either.  It has no taste (no strawberry, for example).  I think I am one of the last holdouts to try Burt's Bees, but now I am a believer!  I highly recommend it."
1,"great lotion, goes on smoothly and doesn't feel thick or gunky on my skin. Feels blended and soaked in quickly and can put makeup over. Keeps my skin's dry patches from flaring up, while not being too thick or making spots too oily for daily use. I also personally, really love the scent- but if you are bothered by scents you might want to reconsider.  SPF is a wonderful perk and addition"
1,It's just witch hazel that smells divine. However it costs double the generic witch hazel toner you would find at a pharmacy. It's also a lot smaller. Will not buy again.
1,i knew it before! the smell is citric! perfect for the summer.and is good for men and women to wear it
1,"This item goes on smooth, it absorbs instantly, and it does a great job at moisturizing. It isn't greasy feeling at all."
1,"My husband recently had surgery and was required to wear support stockings for several weeks. I had to help him get on and off the stockings. The bottom of his feed became very dry and ruined the stockings. I mentioned how dry his feet were at work, and someone recommended this cream. I was skeptical that it would be better than other creams but was pleasantly surprised. The cream is smooth but not greasy. It hasn't completely resolved the dry skin on the bottom of my husband's foot, but it has been helpful and is the best cream we have tried thus far. I highly recommend this cream for tough, difficult to treat dry skin."
1,this is great for people with sore tired muscles...as it spins I keep my knees bent and keep it under my legs...the seawees feels like a thousand little fingers against my skin...what a great way to feel better at the end of a long day....
1,I love this product. This is my second one. My first one was so old i burned it out. I'll keep using this product. Just love it.
1,Ever since my friend told me about Cetaphil a few years ago I have not used any thing else! Since then I have been introducing my friends and family to Cetaphil soaps and creams. Not only does it make your face and body so smooth and soft but I think it makes you look younger. I have noticed that the wrinkles around my eyes and forehead seem to have diminished a little. I highly recommend the lotions and face creams. This is a great product for all ages of women. You will feel the diffence on your skin as soon as you apply it!
1,"First of all, let's put things in perspective -- I am not a stylist.  I don't use a blow dryer to ""style"" my hair, but rather to dry it after showering.  I have very thin, fine hair that dries quickly but easily gets frizzy and fly-away.  The hand dryer I've had for over 15 years did the job, but unless I used a leave-in conditioner before drying, my hair would often end up looking like shredded wheat.  Not attractive!So when it came time to buy a new dryer, I took a look at the ionic ones, which claim to leave hair soft and silky instead of frizzy and fly-away.  And since this one was so inexpensive, I figured I'd give it a try.Well, it's fabulous!  When dried with this dryer, my hair actually feels silky.  And my hair has NEVER felt silky!  And to make things even better, that silkiness lasts between shampoos.I've read a few complaints here that the blower on this dryer isn't strong enough, or it doesn't get hot enough.  They may have a point -- the air emitted does seem to be less hot than my much older Conair.  But the blower seems strong enough for me.  My hair dries in about the same amount of time as it did with my old dryer.But what makes this so great isn't the heat or the amount of air, it's the ionic thing.  I don't know why it works, or how it works, but I love this thing, and the fact that it actually costs LESS than the one I bought fifteen years ago is just icing on the cake.It's a great dryer and it won't set you back much.  What's better than that?"
1,I am a curvy girl with a small waist and a bigger butt...so when I purchase bikinis I cannot get the medium as they will be baggy on my waist...but the small is tight on my butt.  So I put this on the bottoms and keep those small's in place!  Works great!
1,Do its job. Hair feel moisturized and smooth.I would recommend it to anyone has long hair.s s s
1,"i've tried a ton of blonde brands (as well as an array of other colors) over the years, and tend to be happiest with L'oreals blond section. The reviews for this product left me with high hopes to lighten my med. dark dirty blond hair to a closer match to my daughter's light ash blond. Pros: Love the added pre-conditioner that protects ends of your hair, and the creme sample that i add to my wet hair on a daily basis. Cons: Turned VERY orange. AFter repeated washes, a wash with dish soap (strips color), & vineger rinses (brightens blondes), there wasn't much improvement. Bought and usedArdell Red Gold Corrector Plus .25 oz., mixig half a single packet w/a small amount of thick condidioner and left on hair for 15 miutes. Pulled a lot of orange out, but still not happy with orange tinge in back. Will never buy this practicular color again, but will possibly try another color in the line in the future... Still on the search for the best blonde dye for my practiular head of hair!! ;o"
1,"I definitely have used a variety of cleansers over the span of my skincare life, especially since I had really bad acne as a teenager. But I would have to say that this cleanser was different because I never had a cleanser that left my skin feeling so soft but yet clean. I am not too sure how this product works on acne because I don't have much acne breakouts anymore, but I do get a refreshed feeling after using this.My skin type is oily skin by the way and thankfully this product doesn't seem to make it more oily. However, I would have to say that it also doesn't in any way reduce my oily skin. But I use a different product when it comes to that so it isn't a problem.I have really bad blackheads as well and I would have to say that this did nothing for them, which was expected because the ingredients in your everyday cleansers won't really help.If I run out of this product, I would probably purchase this again. Nothing is for certain because I am constantly searching for new products, but so far it's been a delight and no adverse side effects have occurred."
1,Smells great and really does make a noticeable different in my skin.  I used a too much the first time and it made my skin feel just a little bit filmy - be aware that a little goes a long way.
1,"I like this color, but it is a little darker than what is pictured - more like a dark beige."
0,"I heard that this eyeliner had super staying power, and it was super cheap, so I decided to give it a try.This stuff is awful. It smells bad, and the brush is kind of gloppy. I've been wearing eyeliner for years (gel is my preference), but this stuff was awful especially once it dried. It dried into this plastic strip on my eye, and it just felt awful."
1,"I love this product,  especially when you use a  facial product,  right after you finish,  you spray this on your face and live it out and is a fresh feeling,  very nice, you can also used it  when you're working out or doing some exercise to refresh  your hole body."
0,"I bought it, but I do not like it. It does not lather that well and my hair feels like stray after using it. I bought Enjoy and it has a great lather and smell and my hair is smooth. I can't recommend this product as it was not great on my hair."
1,works well with their brand........Acquarella Remover....when having natural nails I prefer this brand of polish and remover....if your having trouble with chemicals...
0,Pretty sure it caused my face to breakout so I stopped using it.  I do not recommend. It is Very cheap.
1,"I bought this because I wanted a chemical free shampoo.I have very oily skin and scalp (and lots of thick straight hair) the first week I used it (on a daily basis) I noticed that my scalp would look oily after about 8-9 hours, I almost went and bought another shampoo except I was too busy to make it to the store so I kept using it.  The 2nd week of use I noticed my hair was no longer getting as oily as quickly, by the 3rd week my scalp had gotten used to it and my hair no longer gets oily quickly, I've been using it for at least 4 months now and I'm very happy with it.If you smell it in the bottle it does smell minty but my hair does not smell minty after rinsing and drying my hair (I personally don't mind this) although I also started dying my hair at around the same time so maybe that's why my hair doesn't retain a minty smell??"
1,"I love the (slightly masculine) smell and ingredients; however, do NOT find this to be very effective on grease. Considering I'm a bit OCD and hand wash dishes prior to or after the dishwasher, this is great! If you're only handwashing, I'd look to different products."
1,"Maybelline Volum' Express Mascara is so much better than Great Lash.  It goes on evenly and lengthens without clumping.I always use my mascara long past the three month suggested shelf life and it doesn't get dried out very quickly.  (However using mascara after six months puts the user at a risk of infection, so be warned.)And it really is waterproof.  You'll need a reliable mascara remover if you want it to come off your lashes.  I've sat through tear-jerkers wearing Volum' Express and come out without a smudge (much less racoon eyes!)"
1,"Still is a very nice sophisticated scent if you like flowers like orange blossoms, roses, and jasmine combined together.  I would say this is evening fragrance."
1,Smells great.  Gets the gunk out of my hair after using the same shampoos and conditioners.  It smells like blood orange and this is my favorite.  The scent isn't over powering in my hair either.
1,"This has a nice scent, but I think it smells more like a men's fragrance than a woman's.  It's not feminine enough for me.  It's definitely not a bad scent though.  It lasts long too.  I could still smell it the next morning (until I showered).  It was nice the way I could smell it whenever I moved around, but it wasn't overpowering.  Nice oil.  I'm planning to try other Auric Blends."
1,"I love that there isnt a strong smell when you use this hairspray. I also like that it doesnt coat onto your hair. It doesnt seem to hold as good as some chemcially commercial ones, but I like that this product is better for your body. I have tried to switch all my products to ones that arent full of harsh chemicals. I dont use hairspray enough to make a difference in my daily life, but I do use it a few times a month and I think this is going to be a great product for that. I use it for flyaways when my hair is up in a bun. It does keep my hair in place, but I do notice that at the end of the day, I have more strands that have fallen. Its not a big deal thou, as most of my hair will stay in place. Its a good product. I would get it again, but this bottle will last me for years, at the rate that I use it!"
1,Finally got a color I was looking for. In the past the colors were too light or too bright. Out of 5 tries now have 2 colors that I like and use.
1,"This is a great item for a gal with oily hair. I try other things, but always go back to this shampoo. Totally affordable, cleans nicely, but doesn't strip my hair. I love it."
1,"I have been using this cleanser for years and I love it.  It does a good job cleaning your skin, while also leaving it soft.A few months ago I switched over to Biore Combination Skin Balancing Cleanser.  In comparing the two products, the Biore does a much better job cleansing your skin.  When I am wearing make-up, the Neutrogena Deep Clean always left a little reside behind.  The Biore, however, never did.But, after using Biore for 3 months, I decided to go back to Neutrogena for daily use.  The Biore was just too drying.  I never had a problem with dry skin with Neutrogena.  So, back to what I used for years before.  I'll still use the Biore for the few times a week that I wear make-up...but, for every other day, I am going to use Neutrogena.My husband also uses this and loves it as well."
1,"I was looking for a natural herbal shampoo that would keep lice away from my hair and wanted to try this shampoo.  I used to have a flaky itchy hair scalp but not since using it, nor have I had any lice and my hair is soft and fuller.  I've gotten LOTS of compliments about my ""beautiful"" hair which I never comb or brush because i'm too busy & lazy to fix my hair.  It smells kind of mediciny (because of the tea tree oil) and very liquidy so I mix it with a nice fragrance shampoo like pomegranate, berry, etc or fragrant shower gel with a ratio of 1:2 or 1:3 of jason shampoo to other shampoo.I RUB IT WELL into even the deepest parts of my hair and onto my scalp and LEAVE IT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE in my hair while bathing for the best results.Be careful, though, the drawback is that it DOES sting and burn (because of the tea tree oil) when you leave it on very long.  Oh well.....no pain, no gain!!Great product even if it does sting."
1,"This is worth every penny because it makes you very aware of what you are doing.  If I have a hangnail, Mavala made me stop picking at it because of the unpleasant taste.  It forces you to grab a nail file and be done with it.  The taste lingers for a minute or two, and it's enough to make you stop.  Perhaps now I'll have longer nails than ever now!"
1,This is good to use after you wash your skin. It will add moisture while toning and keeping gunk out. Smells great as well.
1,"Needed to get rid of the ugly bar soap in both the bathroom and kitchen. Figured I'd give this a try as it is suppose to be a moisturizing hand soap. I love the size of the bottle, the pump is large enough so even a man can use it easily vs. those skinny, narrow pumps on many other products.I'm not sure about the moisturizing part because my hands are always dry and the skin on my hands always feels tight but in all honesty, my hands are in water all the time. With 6 dogs, cooking, cleaning, and gardening I am always washing my hands so I don't know if the soap is helping or not.I got the 2-pack: one Aloe Vera (kitchen) and Milk/Honey (bathroom). My original idea was to use all the bath gels and bath lotions I've gotten over the years as gifts as refills when these are close to empty but I like the Milk/Honey scent so well that I've decided to get Soft Soap refill in that scent and find another use for all those 'gels and lotions' sitting collecting dust. The Aloe Vera scent is almost non existent so if you prefer a scent you can actually detect, go with the Milk/Honey choice.A little of this soap goes a long way. It is a thick, rich, creamy soap out of the dispenser that lathers quickly and easily and, a big plus for me, rinses easily and quickly. Don't know why I waited so long to do this but now that I've found it, I'm never lettin' go!!!!"
1,"An amazingly good smell and a nice, thick, but quickly-absorbing consistency. You will feel the difference and your nose will thank you. Excellent and I'll definitely re-order when it's done (which will be a while as a small dab will work)."
1,"Perfect, classic green mask. From the beginning of time, ladies have worn green facial masks. This is every bit as good as you think it should be. Leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean without being dried out."
1,"I bought this Helen of Troy 1574 Tangle Free Hot Air Brush, White, 1 Inch Barrel for my mom and I was very impressed when I used it on my daughter just to show my mom how to use it, you can get nice curls and straight hair without having to spend a long time doing it."
1,"while this cleans my skin great and freshens me up when I've been all sweaty or dirty. I was hoping this would help with my large pores and oily skin, but It doesn't have any real lasting effects that I can see. I have noticed less acne which is always great! you can also use this as an aftershave - i mix it in with 100% aloe vera to make it a better consistency for application it's great!"
1,"This device is a little bit stiffer plastic than I hoped and can hurt when you use it on your scalp.  It definitely creates the suds in the shower though.  With a little less pressure on it, it gets the job done."
1,"If you have really, really dry hands, you should use this product. It is awesome! I prefer the one with fragrance but this one was in a good price, so I bought two units."
0,Not my favorite eye makeup remover.... It is a bit oily and I was still left with raccoon eyes after using it. I will not purchase this kind again
1,"For the price, this is a great little tool to have at hand. I've been using it for a few weeks and I have to say I really see the results as far as smoother complexion and a lot less small bumps and blackheads. It's especially great to use in the summer after sweaty days when you feel your pores are clogged from sweat, sunscreen, etc.I have NOT used the fine mister, b/c frankly it just seemed like too much to deal with. The reservoir is tiny and looks like a pain to fill and keep the level up. Also, it came with a tiny little wand to clean out the spray nozzle and that seems annoying to keep on top with.I just use this with my face wet, or I use it in the shower. It works fine with your face wet, the mister just seems like an unnecessary add-on. Also, regarding the other reviewers comment about the mister being to close your pores- maybe she has another brand or model? I read every word of my manual and it mentioned nothing about the mister being to close pores. My instructions stated pretty clearly that the mister was used to aid in the wetting of the face to maintain strong suction during use.I like the little charger stand that comes with it. It's easy to plug in and slide the tool into to charge when not in use. The cord is also nice and long, or can be wrapped short.Take care to listen to the instructions not to use it on sensitive areas of the face or areas where there are currently blemishes. I accidentally made that mistake once and OWWWW!My only hope is that the battery lasts awhile b/c there is no way to replace the rechargable battery once it dies. The product becomes useless at that point."
1,I usually use Lancome mascara but I was looking for a mascara in blue.  I thought I'd give this a try and I'm happy I did.  It's just as good as the $25 Lancome mascara I normally use.  I'm now a huge fan and will definitely buy it again.
1,Good product. Used it for years...maybe decades. There is no better mascara at any price. Gentle on eyes too. My favorite.
1,My teenage daughters and I are transiting from a perm to natural.  Our hair is soft and manageable and we mix it with coconut oil and aloe Vera for an every other day cream for our hair.
1,I am an African American woman with natural 4a/4b hair. I like this deep conditioner. It's not the best deep conditioner I've ever used but it works. I bought it for 3.99 at Walgreens. I think it's a good product for the price and the quantity. I have noticed that my hair has more shine. I looks very healthy as a result. My hair has a hard time absorbing moisture so I use a blow dryer and apply heat to insure it gets absorbed. I usually buy Neutrogena's Triple moisture hair mask or the shea moisture deep treatment masque. They are more moisturizing than this one but this one is okay compared to them. But I'm not opposed to buying it again in the future. One of the main reasons I decided to try this is because of the ingredients. Things like coconut oil and mineral oil are pretty high on the list of ingredients.
1,"i love it, would not use any other soap again .i even use it on my face and my face feels smooth"
1,"I like how big the bottle it. I use it everyday, but I wish it had some kind of pump to get it out. I luckily had a old facial wash bottle with a pump and poured some in there to use. It makes it so much easier. This bottle def last for a long time. I will be buying it again."
1,I love this polish. The brand lasts for days and the color of this particular one is amazing. I have a light olive complexion and often feel some reds are too harsh on me. This one is perfect. It's red but has a sheen of orange so it doesn't look to harsh.
1,"I love this cream.  It is pretty strong, though.  Be careful at first.  I can only use it one or two times a week, and I need to keep it off my neck because it's just too harsh for that delicate skin.  Also, it will eventually bleach out your eyebrows and the hair around your hairline.  Nonetheless, this cream keeps my skin looking fresh and is having good effects on the areas that have a few lines.  I used to get a glycolic acid peel every month, but that got expensive.  I think regular use of this cream is nearly as good."
1,"Very hard to match to your skin tone on line. It covers alright, but not completely. Looks like you are covering up something."
1,"Too small for rollers, but great for conditioning, gloss, semi-permanent color, etc.  bonnet is the size of 3-layer cake.  Short hose, but that saves fan power and weight.  Consider spending more if planning regular use."
1,This makes a golden shine where those pesky gray starts showing.  Good Product and affordable.  Note does not make dark hair blonde.
1,This is a lightweight moisturizer with SPF 30.  I have had some burning with other lotions but this one has not had these issues
1,"I have written a fairly extensive review of permanent/semi-permanent hair dyes elsewhere.All I want to add here is that Herbatint is probably the best of that category available for home styling.It is absolutely odorless/ fume-free.  I loved this colorway - a deep, dark brown, with a slightly 'gold' cast in the light.It mixes to become a thick gel that is easy to apply and caused very little dripping.  There was no irritation or sense of stinging and it left my hair feeling sleek, strong, and smooth as well as looking glossy.If it lasts for my usual four or five weeks I will likely buy only this brand in the future.Amazon's price is lower than that at local stores, so I am completely satisfied with purchasing it via Amazon, online."
1,"This set of rollers heats up quickly!  I burned myself a couple of times on a hot end, but my hair definitely held the curl well after only a few minutes in the rollers."
1,Camille Beckman Tuscan Honey Glycerine Hand Therapy is the best.  I use all of camelle beckman hand and body cream.
1,"My Skin: dry/sensitive/dark spots I'm trying to cover.My Past Makeup Attempts: BareMinerals line (which I love(d) but couldn't cover these dark spots, which are very deep and dark.  Clinique concealers.I looked like a clown, when I first started using this, until I got this routine down.  Learn from the clown, as the clown has now received comments on my skin as ""flawless,"" ""perfect,"" and ""what did you do?!""  I did this:LESSON 1: COLOR MATCH it at a local retailer (Macy's, Ulta, Sephora - but call first to make sure they carry the line)LESSON 2: USE A PRIMER, REALLY.  I usePhilosophy The Present Clear Makeup, 2 Ounce.  The Present is great for skin health. I even use it under my eyes for those little lines.LESSON 3: WARM THE STUFF.  Take it out of the tub as a solid, slap it down on the back side of your (likely left) hand, and rub it in a circle with your right hand finger, until it is a liquid, creamy consistency.LESSON 4: USE A BASE LAYER (of this or another foundation, I still use BareMinerals) for all over face color blendingLESSON 5: USE A MAKEUP SPONGE, REALLY.  Cover Creme should be most in the center of the face and on problem areas, blended outward.  God bless the makeup sponge.LESSON 6: USE BLUSH so you're face isn't 1 solid color.  Brush lightly since the cover creme at this point is sticky and shiny.LESSON 7: USE SETTING POWDER so the cover creme doesn't shine so much. It will mattify into a serious ""glow from within.""Dermablend Dermablend Loose Setting Powder - Original, 1 ozVOILA: Flawless face.LESSON 8: Wipe off with makeup remover towelletes at night (no need for dermablend's expensive special makeup remover), and then wash face regularly.Highlights: Flawless face, no breakouts, dryness or other side effects, SPF 30, tub lasts about 6 months at the most."
1,"The best tips, the softest by far and worth the money.  I use these for everything from art projects to removing eye makeup gently."
0,"I don't have much to say about the product. Except I ordered from Perfumania.com seller and I received ""Dunhill Desire"" and not the Original ""Alfred Dunhill Desire"" which is in the listing description. Dunhill desire is an imitation of the originally designed version. I had it before, bought it for $15 on Canal St. and it's good only for killing a laundry scent or spray in the bathroom to kill nasty smelling bacterias. I had the original version of Desire back in 2001-2002 and that was really something... Stunning cologne. When I saw the image I kinda had a feeling that it's gonna be a fake, but I loved the originalk version so much, so I desiced to take a risk and.... boom, I got a bloody fake. Do not buy ""Dunhill Desire"" - it's a crap. Make sure you get Alfred Dunhill Desire - the original one."
1,"I bought these and they come with 28 pads. The formula is great - acne spots that usually took months to clear up, now clear up within a couple of weeks. It really does help to even skin tone and is gentle on the skin. It keeps my skin smooth and seems to be improving the overall look of it. However, I'm not the only one in my home that uses acne cleansers and these pads only lasted 2 weeks between my fianc&eacute; and myself. So my only complaint is that you have to get them more frequently than other cleansers. I ended up getting the Clear Complexion foaming cleanser - same formula and will last longer."
1,"While I'm not overly enthusiastic about the scent of this unscented product that is easily remedied by the addition of any essential oil I want to add before slathering this on my skin. The main ingredient seems to be Oat Kernel Flour and that is the main reason I buy this product.The skin calming and healing qualities of oatmeal are almost immediately apparent. Within a few days of using this product you will notice a difference in your skin.This lotion absorbs easily, it is smooth, healing and a creamy comforting addition to your day. If you enjoy scented lotions, try the Aveeno Stress Relief Moisturizing Lotion. I also enjoy using the Aveeno Body Wash and Soaps.If you want to scent this product, buy some rose oiland add a few drops. Rose oil helps to balance your emotionsand that in itself will help your skin.~The Rebecca Review"
1,not sure what it does... feels kind of cool though. the mist is refreshing. only used it for about a week and now it just sits there.
0,"I bought this after seeing all the great reviews, I'm glad to see it work with everyone else I only wish I got the same results. I've been using this for 4 nights on the SAME pimple and it's STILL there. Waste of $8 bucks"
1,Wonderful nighttime moisturizer.  Not greasy.  Absorbs easily and leaves skin soft and smooth.  Very happy with the results from use.
1,"This is a great, long-lasting fragrance that smells amazing. It has notes of sandalwood, vanilla, and musk. I'm very impressed by the staying power, which is much better than a lot of other fragrances. Highly recommended!"
1,"Saturday morning, I could feel the tell-tell signs of a pimple: a raised mound of skin, pinkish, & throbbing. Unfortunately, I had to go out of town that day & my tight schedule didn't allow for me to stop by a store to pick something up.  Sunday morning, pimple-threat-level was gaining, so I ran by a CVS & picked up the Clean & Clear Popped Pimple Relief Drying Paste. To be honest, I was looking for another brand of drying paste that wasn't so ""new"" but Clean & Clear was all they had and I was desperate. That night, I put it on, was able to sleep with it on, and the next morning, my was encroaching pimple had receded to about half its original size and the throbbing was gone! Monday night, same routine and the next morning, all signs of my blemish was gone--just amazing! I know this stuff is supposed to be for pimples that have been popped, but it worked as a preventative for me.  Now, to be fair, I'm not riddled with pimples, nor am I particularly prone to them, but for my one minor blemish issue, this stuff worked and it worked fast."
1,"i got this last week or a week ago i believe, it came in a timely fashion, thank you to the seller...although when i opened the box the packaging of the hair color (box) threw me off, first i thought it was wrong but the coloring of the box was brown n beige oppose to green like on the picture on amazon but it was the same and right product just different coloring on box, i used it last night, omg loved it the color came out so nice and rich...thank u to the seller for shipping this to me so quick."
1,I have used this cleanser in the past and have gotten great results. It smells wonderful and leaves my face clean without over drying it. I would recommend this face wash.
1,"I believe this shampoo and conditioner does work. It is a little pepperminty, and leaves your scalp feeling tingly and clean."
1,"olay has definitely the best skin care products, i have tried many brands in the past and always return to olay."
1,"Someone over on Naturally Curly's Curl Talk forum recommended this product to me as a great gel to use along with mousse.  I used it for the first time yesterday, and loved how my fine, 2C waves turned out!My hair is about four inches past my shoulders, and I used three or four quarter-sized globs of this smoothed and then scrunched into soaking wet hair.  I then followed it with three or four globs of mousse, which I also scrunched in.  I put my hair up into a plop for about 15 minutes, and then diffused with a blowdryer.  The result was soft, waves that were smooth to the touch -- and that had no surface frizz!  I usually add gel *after* I add my curl enhancer, but the gel itself acted as a curl enhancer, too.I did notice that when I woke up today, my waves were a little softer than they would be if I used a hard-hold gel.  For wavies like me, this might not give the harder hold we need to keep our waves in place longer, but I don't mind exchanging softer waves for a shorter drying time and softer hair.The smell on this also seems very strong at first, but it dissipates pretty quickly into your hair once you use it.It's also silicone- and sulphate-free for those following the Curly Girl method.  (SeeCurly Girl: The Handbookfor more information about the CG method.)I will be adding this into my regular rotation on days when I want a softer, looser hold and wave."
1,This is my new go to night cream. I think it firms my skin and evens my skin tone. I am 25 and just now falling I love with my skin and this product adds the extra boost to add radiance. I recommend.
1,"With an inexpensive perfume brand like Auric, you can generally expect to find one or two scents done surprisingly well amid a lot of scents that are mediocre or, frankly, bad. Egyptian Goddess is a cult favorite because it falls under ""done surprisingly well"" and is a decent, straightforward Egyptian style musk without a lot of frills.It wears pretty close to the skin and is light without being sharp or soapy, ever so slightly nutty, evocative of clean skin with emphasis on skin rather than clean. The musk is accompanied by some quiet and unobtrusive woods and spices that are hard to pick out (which in this case means they're doing their job well). It's a truly unisex fragrance. Fans of Egyptian Goddess would probably enjoy ""Special Delivery"" from the small soapery Dirty Sanchez Soaps on Etsy; it's an extremely similar musk.Side note: almost every musk oil fragrance on Amazon has its share of disappointed reviews from people insisting the product smells like nothing at all. Musk scents are created by several different types of molecules and interestingly, some people are anosmic to these molecules -- simply can't smell them. It's sort of the olfactory equivalent of colorblindness, I guess. And people who can smell one kind of musk molecule just fine can still be anosmic to other kinds of musk. So it's not the product, it's just that the people leaving one-star reviews literally can't smell the perfume."
1,I needed the smaller tubes to carry outside as the tubs are too big (but cheaper).Good cream for sensitive skin.Wish it is cheaper though.
1,"I switch around among the usual suspects--Eucerin, Aveeno, Neutrogena,etc. but this is my favorite. It's truly fragrance free with a high SPF, and a little goes a long way. It spreads nicely over the skin with a smooth feel. I don't notice the so-called white residue some have mentioned--I slather it on and let it dry for a minute or two, and if any excess cream is still visible I then blend it in easily. I haven't used it long enough to notice that my wrinkles are less visible--I don't really believe that anything topical will help anyway, and I'm not about to do anything more drastic, so this lotion is great for me. The price here for two is excellent."
1,"This product does what it's supposed to.  I don't have a huge acne problem and haven't tried a lot of other products for comparison, but anytime I have occasional break outs this is easy to use and clears it up pretty quickly.  Unfortunately it smells pretty bad.  I can deal with it though because it's effective and I don't have to use it all the time.  I have been wanting to try the pink grapefruit scent but any time I have ever gone into any drugstore anywhere ever it is always sold out.  So..maybe one day when they actually start keeping up with the demand I might get to try it."
1,I tried this with my daughter. Our skin came out smooth and soft. I think the best part of it was the bonding time. We posted our pictures and laughed at each other as the masks cracked. Worth it just for that.
1,"This soap smells so good. I love it. And it is in a cute package. Buy this by the case. One reviewer wrote that it is not a moisturizing soap, yet it did not dry me out.I think soaps like Irish Spring and other similar deodorant soaps [which I like by the way] are more harsh then this soap. This soap also kinda stays with you a bit longer, which I like because it smells so good."
1,I'm an esthetician and I use Dermalogica. I always recommend it to my clients because I honestly believe that it's a great product line! The multi-active toner is refreshing and does it's job- provides moisture to the skin and also brings the skin back to it's acidic pH state. I highly recommend this product! Give it a try. I also love that Dermalogica does not test on animals. That's VERY important to me!
1,"I am not very brand loyal, but this cream, this cream I just love!The texture is rich but not greasy. You only need a pea sized amount for your whole face and neck, if you use more, side effects may increase. It glides over the skin nicely and spreads out easily. With a little massage my skin just drinks this stuff right up and feels instantly soft and velvety. When I wake up in the morning, my skin looks glowy and radiant and still feels hydrated. I can feel it rinse off when I get in the shower. This is not to say this cream is overly heavy, it just creates an excellent moisture lock that lasts all night long.Though the absorption is excellent, if you really hate the feel of something on your face you may not like this. I love it because it reassures me that it's doing it's job.I am only 34 so I use this mainly preventatively but I did have a very superficial groove on my forehead and small lines around mouth that are now completely gone. The texture of my skin is so much smoother and more consistent. I honestly haven't read up a whole lot on the science of retinol, but it seems to do a lot more than treat wrinkles. My complexion has never looked better. I know this because I keep willingly forking over the $20 plus dollars a tube, I would never do this for something that didn't show results.One thing to be aware of is that when starting a retinol regimen it's best  ease in. This is powerful stuff and it may sting, burn a bit (think mild sun burn) and make your skin a bit red. I even had some flaking the first week. This is normal and your skin should adjust fairly quickly. That said, it's probably best not to try it for the first time the night before your wedding or some other huge event. My skin isn't sensitive at all, but I started with the sensitive version, then moved up to the regular one after the first tube. You kind of need to pay attention to your skin and listen to what it's telling you. If you are bothered by side  effects, skip a night and use a non retinol product that night. Again, I personally like the side effects because I know this stuff is doing something. Once my skin adjusted, the redness and sting totally subsided after about 7 nights.Bottom line, if you are willing to put up with the adjustment period and expense, this cream does ""keep it's promises.""  For my money, it's the best I've ever used."
1,This scrub is amazing.  Forget the other wannabes and stick with this brand. My skin is so smooth after I use this. I keep it in my shower and exfoliate twice per week.
1,"It took me weeks before I finally purchased this. I had a similar color and didn't think I needed one that closely matched, but I finally broke down and got it anyway. This color is best described as putty with a bluish/greenish tint to it. I paired it with Essie's protein base coat and Out the Door top coat. I am going on day 5 and it looks like I just painted them. Great color and I am glad I finally bought it!"
0,It goes on fine but my nail polish will peel off the whole entire nail. It's like it adheres to the polish but not my nail so it just comes off all at once. I find myself using different base coats because this one just doesn't work well for me.
1,"This goes on soooooo easily and absorbs quickly into my skin.  There is a very slight shimmer upon application.  NOT greasy at all!!!!  Since this product is fragrance-free, I've also used it in my hair, and it works as well as the Fekkai hair oil I use.  It's thin so it would be hard to overdo it like lotion.  The only thing is that when I'm in a rush, some oil droplets find their way to the floor or my counter.  Easy peasy to clean though."
1,"So, I bought this after seeing the reviews and was hopeful it would help me too! It did take a week before my body got used to it. The first night I used it I had insomnia!! :( But, I'm happy to report that I now have NO sweats/flashes/prickly heat at all! I use an 1/8 of a teaspoon at morning and after dinner. (Yes, I measure it!). It is a generous measure too. I put it on the under part of my arms - that seems to work best for me. Sometimes I forget about using it - that is how well it works! Of course it seems that I haven't actually forgotten to put it on - I just forget that I need to because with it I no longer have issues with the ""heat""!!! Yay!! And, the price on Amazon is 1/2 that of the store!!!! :) I will keep buying as long as I need it."
1,Did nothing to soothe the outbreak on my face but was effective for oily skin to combat the humidity of the DC summer.
1,This is definitely thick and kind of orange but if I am really careful about blending it looks pretty good. Sometimes I find it helpful to mix it with just a little bit of plain face lotion so it is easier to blend.
1,I purchased this and used it for one cycle. 13 days really...I believe I missed a day.  During this time (pre-period) I didnt experience any improvement in sleep quality nor in acne breakouts (which generally bother me before my period begins.  I am not entirely sure WHAT benefits I experienced. I chose to skip this cycle and will re-start next month as I travelled and missed the start date (after ovulation) to use it for December.  The scent is ok. Nothing perfumey really...infact...it smells a bit medicinal but it fades away in less than 10mins. (For reference: Am 30. Not menopausal at all. Have a regular cycle. Chose to try this to balance hormones to seek clearer skin...naturally.)
1,This dark grey is the perfect color for all year round. It looks so classy and goes with every outfit. The shipping was very fast and the item was just as it was in the picture.
1,"After developing allergies to practically every antiperspirant on the market, it was refreshing to find one that finally worked and didn't cause a rash.  This clear gel goes on smoothly, dries fast and doesn't stain clothing.  Although I've long used solids, it was work getting used to a gel formulation.  If you've had problems with allergic reactions such as rashes, irritation, itching and burnning, please try this product.  Highly recommend!"
1,"This product does everything it is supposed to, it smells pretty good too. It also doesn't smell like chemicals, nor does it leave that smell behind after use."
1,"This moisturizer is fantastic!  It makes my skin glow without looking oily.  It absorbs into my skin very well, and feels so silky.  I have noticed that my fine lines are very much minimized, and the color and texture of my skin has changed for the better.  Others have complimented my skin too!"
1,I purchased this brush to use when I am blow drying my hair. I does smooth out my hair when I am using it but the barrel is a little small for my length and thickness of hair. Next time I need to purchase a larger brush.
0,"I really had a hard time rating this product, being that I was allergic to it. It left my face red and stinging. Hope it works for others better."
1,Pretty color.  I was at a nail salon and they used this color.  Happy to see that I was able to buy it online.  Now it's my favorite go to color.  Its a rose-pink with a very subtle gold shimmer to it.  Very pretty.
1,"I am an AA woman with relaxed hair and an incredibly dry and flaky scalp, which has been so ever since I can remember. My one blessing is that even though it is dry and flaky, it isn't particularl itchy. I have tried almost everything with limited success to cure my scalp ailment. Coal tar shampoo, Nizoral, various scalp greases and ointments, evoo, coconut oil, garlic oil, tea tree, etc.. I even tried the medical route and my dermatologist gave a prescription for Clobex and Derma-smoothe. Both help a bit but no cure. I especially like the Derma smoothe because it make my scalp clean and free of flakes after washing. The pain was having to wet it and let it sit on my scalp for hours before washing. But lo and behold, the little beasties were back in days. Add to the fact that these medical products were super expensive and weren't covered by my insurance. The only thing that made me able to try these products was the manufacturer offering huge discount coupons.Needless to say I began looking for cheaper at home treatments. Research pointed me in the direction of ayurveda products which lead me to first henna and then neem. I couldn't deal with the pure neem smell so I decided to give this a try. As others have mentioned this is a very thin shampoo but lathers up well after the 2nd go around. But you know, I find that to be the case for all shampoos and since I always rinse, repeat this doesn't bother me.I have to say that for me it doesn't feel great while washing. It doesn't feel moisturizing at all. In fact, my first time using this while in the shower shampooing I thought I was going to have the most terrible time detangling ever in my life. As in, bring out the scissors to cut out the tangles bad time. This is where my surprise comes in. It was just a dream to section off and add my deep conditioner to. Keep in mind this was way before leave in. I wash, deep condition under a dryer for 20 minutes, rinse add then leave in conditioner and other products and roller set, dry under a hooded dryer for 1 hour +.The other surprise? After using this about 3 times so far, I have never had such minimal shedding EVER during a wash process. I am not one to count hairs, but it was definitely noticeable that the shedding was down considerably. Before this I was using Kenra Moisturizing shampoo and it is just the opposite. It feels moisturizing while washing but feels a bit dry/drying upon rinsing and attempting to separate in order to deep condition and it goes without saying that Kenra doesn't do a thing to stem shedding.This also cleans my scalp and rinses out very,very well. With Kenra, sometimes, there would be spots that still had some gross build up that didn't really dislodge during washing. With TheraNeem my scalp just seemed noticeably cleaner. As for the dry scalp. It didn't cure it, which was why I debated back and forth on how many stars to give this. I decided it was unfair to knock off stars for something that medical science can't even cure. Besides which the unexpected surprises somewhat makes up for it. The lack of shedding alone warrants 5 stars. I can say that my scalp seems clearer and cleaner after a wash for a longer period of time, the build up seems to be less & the flakiness seems to take a bit longer to show up and my scalp seems less gross in between washes. So it is working to an extent. Just not cured."
0,"A few hours after trying this mascara, my eyelids were swollen and red and my eyes were burning. It got progressively worse before improving.  It was supposed to be hypoallergenic!  It is horrible.  I buy inexpensive mascara all of the time but this one I will stay away from."
1,"I got this for my boyfriend, who wants to quit biting his nails.  Because I like to do terrible things to myself (apparently, at least), I put a tiny, tiny dab of this stuff on one of my fingers - not even my finger nail, just a random place on the top joint.What I learned is that, while I may not bite my nails, I put my fingers in my mouth a lot.  At the very least, I put them in my mouth twice within an hour, and let me tell you - I did not put my fingers back in my mouth for the rest of the day, especially because this stuff doesn't just wash off.  I have no doubt that if I put it on my fingers tomorrow, I wouldn't put them in my mouth later that day, either.It's terrible, and since that's the whole point...great job, guys at Mavala.  That was disgusting."
1,"l purchased this for misting my skin after derma rolling and moisturizing with hyaluronic acid.  It is fabulously scented, yet light and refreshing.  Love it."
1,"If you know of this product, you know that it is amazing. If smells great, it feels great and it works, hands down the best thing you can do for your skin. Full of moisture and luxury. The smell does not linger or interfere with you colognes. I love it, my skin loves it and there is no other product on the market today that will give you these results from the first use. I could go on and on but I will let you buy and try it for yourself and see what kind of comments you leave, I know they will be great ones as well."
1,"I have used both the moisturizing and the oil-free version of this makeup remover. Now, I will only rebuy the moisturizing one. The oil-free one was terrible.I can deal with having a bit of oil around my eyes after removing makeup, especially if it is moisturizing the area like it says it does. I end up going to sleep anyway after removing makeup, so it isn't a big deal. The formula is extremely gentle and it does its job without irritating the eyes. And if you don't want the oil around your eyes after removing the makeup, just take a towel and wipe it off. It is not a big deal.The oil-free one, on the other hand, irritated my eyes to no end! I couldn't even finish the container. My eyes became really red and bloodshot and I just couldn't keep using them. I am going to throw these out and re-buy the moisturizing ones."
1,"first, i really love the glass bottle and the box. it has the so professional marketing look. the gel texture is smooth, clear, a little sticky, smells like strong alcohol. i dab it only on my dark spots(sun spot and age spot) on my cheekbones that i got a little more and more for a few years. normally i use the sunscreen at least SPF50 to protect my face, and re-apply many times a day(i live in florida). i hope this gel will work for me. i will update improvement with this product again after i pass 1 month at least."
1,"If you like Touch, you will love Touch with Love. Very romantic scent I think. Highly recommend. Can't go wrong."
1,I love Crabtree & Evelyn. It really does wonders in keeping your hands moisturized. It smells fantastic as well. The aluminum bottle helps protect the lotion from damage from the heat or the sun's rays. The small compact size makes it portable.
1,"I've been using this over a week and I'm not too impressed.  It does take rough skin off, but you have to rub and rub and rub to get it going.  It's kind of a mess too and it's hard to tell if the skin is coming off your hands or feet if you're rubbing your feet with it.  After a week, I still have some rough skin on my heels."
1,"I just purchased the Caruso Steam hairsetter and I am thrilled with it!  Here's my story:  I used to have absolutely gorgeous below the shoulder, shiny light browne hair.  Last year, I decided to get it highlighted blond.  Since I really liked the blond (I have to admit, it looks good on me and totally natural) I continued to get it highlighted.  Unfortunately, the salon (it was a top salon by the way) that I was going to did not highlight my hair correctly.  After about a year, my hair started to get thinner and thinner and started to dry out and break off.  By the end of a year, my hair is wispy, thin and dryed out.  I had no idea what was happening until it was too late.  After going to a different salon (in tears I might add) and speaking with the salon owner, he told me that he could see exactly what they had done to my hair.  He told me that it was obvious that they had colored over the SAME strands each time they highlighted it; when in fact they should have been highlighting and lowlighting the ROOTS ONLY.  As I said, I had no idea what was going on until it was too late to do anything about it.  My once beautiful locks are now only shoulder length ( I had to get about 5 inches cut off) and I am really fortunate that I have anything left at all.  I now am not coloring my hair anymore, I will have to wait years before I get my beautiful hair back b/c of this salon's negligence.  Anyway, that being said, I purchased the Caruso steamer in the hopes that it would give my lifeless hair some of its bounce back.  And I'm happy to say that it absolutely has.  This steamer is amazing.  It made my hair bouncy and curly and shiny.  I was so thrilled with the results b/c I was desperate to find something that would help me!  If you have fine hair or hair that has been badly damaged or even if you have beautiful hair -- I would highly recommend this wonderful product.  The steam is GOOD for your hair and so much better than the traditional dry heat rollers which, if used too much will ruin your hair (not to mention a bad colorist).  Here's my other advice:  GRILL your colorist about what they are doing.  Don't ruin your hair with overcoloring -- it's totally not worth it.  But if you have, get this steamer.  In my opinion it is the ""mineral powder foundation"" of hair care.  It's incredible.  Period."
1,These are truly very comfortable--I never got a headache wearing them. So they live up to their name!What is more--they are very functional---I wear them often during cooking--no hair escapes.
1,"The picture is a bit misleading, but the product is very high quality.  I was able to use it to effectively thin some of my thicker, dried polishes.  I think it would even revive the driest nail polish.  Be warned that the smell is very strong, but I am not bothered by it.  You might also want to invest in a dropper of some sort in order to get the product out of the bottle and into a nail polish bottle.  Luckily the top coat I bought came with one, so I was able to use the dropper on this bottle.  Fantastic product.  I recommend it to anyone who needs a nail polish thinner."
1,Works fast no matter what kind of eye makeup you use. Price is good..... easy to pack.... not eye stinging either.
1,"Paid a good price for a quality name brand product, color will work for my wedding of cocoa and guava."
1,"Great spiral curling iron, reasonably priced, easy to use.  This curling iron has lots of features.  I would recommend this item."
1,I really like the Obagi products. The toner does a good job at neutralizing my skin after washing it. It doesn't make my skin feel dry afterwards like other toners.
1,"I like the natural ingredients.  It looks like a natural product in the hands, without chemical textures or synthetic appearance.  I like the way it feels on my skin, similar to the sensation of rubbing a mixture of delicate oils and fruit on my face.  It cleanses thoroughly removing makeup and sunblock lotion.  It doesn't strip my skin dry and instead leaves a nice moisture after wash.  The only drawback is the scent-- it smells more like old marmalade rather than a fresh squeeze of orange, more stale than I prefer.  Overall a good, natural cleanser."
1,I like the cream but I have been to Israel and LOVE some Ahava products I could only buy there so I didn't rate this 5 stars as I am comparing it to very high-end creams.  My skin seems to be softer after using this consistently for the past 3 weeks.  I wanted to wait until I used it for a few weeks before writing a review.  I will buy it again and it was a decent price for the product!
1,"I expected Swing Velvet to be more of a dark pink shimmer but it has a lot of red tones to it.  It's slightly more pink than Thigh High, but the two are very close."
1,"I was searching and searching for a shampoo that wouldn't make my hair flat, dull, and greasy etc. I was also looking for a shampoo that wouldnt give me breathing attacks because i have very severe asthma and sinus problems. I found this shampoo and, it works great!.Unlike Wen, Tresseme, Garnier, and Matrix, which made my hair flat, dull, and greasy while also giving me suffocating breathing attacks, Suave Naturals Daily Clarifying made my hair thick, smooth, and shinier than I expected. I have been using this product for 3 months and, it works every time. I have gotten countless compliments on how sleek and healthy my hair looks, and even my best friend (who uses Wen) was astonished when I told her ""I use Suave, nothing more"" And, on top of it all, my breathing is now better in the shower (I literally used to suffocate and wheeze, espically when I used Wen and Garnier) I would recommend this for everyone. It is certainly worth the price, compared to a $60.00 9 ounce bottle of Wen. The good thing about this is that it actually works!! :D"
1,"Like some other reviewers, I really miss the original Caruso units that required salt.  I guess I wasn't the only one who was nearly electrocuted on the metal prong several times.  That didn't stop me from using it until it croaked though. The original set truly made curls that would last for days.  This new set is somewhat disappointing.  It's better than the Revlon steam rollers, but I'm still not completely satisfied with the product.  My curls only last for a day.  Since I have long hair and only wash my hair every few days, I need more lasting curls.  Some people have complained that the curlers start to deteriorate. I believe that is caused from using the curlers after applying gel or hairspray or other hair products.  These curlers should be used only on freshly washed hair.  The only other complaint I have is that it the size of the curler is embossed in hard to read print and is on the opposite side of the curler than it should be.  Since the curlers will logically be placed with with the marked size down, it is hard to tell which size is which.  I usually group them in sizes, so I don't have to think about it.  The jumbo and large sizes look the same from the bottom and so do the small and extra small.  Overall, the curlers work as well as regular hot rollers, but they are much less damaging.  They do take more time to use though, since it is necessary to heat one roller at a time.  I probably would have given them 5 stars if I hadn't used the original Carusal rollers."
1,"I started using this because I had dry skin and rough patches on my face. One review said that it helped with fine lines and wrinkles... NOT FOR ME. After using these, my forehead fine lines were more noticeable. So I stopped using these on my face but I instead used them on my legs before shaving. Super smooth. Probably won't buy these again but I'll use the 6 pack till it's gone."
1,"I always love OPI nail polish colors.  However, this color was prettier on the screen than in real life.  I'll still wear it, but not my favorite."
1,"This color is a bluish black color.  I love ESSIE polish and this is another great one to add to my collection.  I like the coverage.  One coat will work, but I prefer all nail polish with two coats.  This color is great for everyone."
1,"This serum goes on like silk with no greasy or sticky feeling at all. I put it under my daily SPF lotion. Have only used for 2 weeks, but will continue with this one, it is a keeper!"
1,Love this product. Using for several years.
1,"My skin is very sensitive and very dry so i have to be very careful about what products i use. This lotion is definately a godsend. Since it doesn't have a sunscreen i only use it at night but it mosturizes really well and doesn't cause any breakouts. However, I think if you have oily or combination skin this may not work for you."
1,"Love the smell and texture of this creme, a very small amount goes a very very long way. The smell is simply clean and makes you feel good, and I am very sensitive towards fragrances in lotions especially on my face.I did try this out under my make up, when i wear my Mac Studio Fix, I prefer to use Mac's prep and prime , as with only the moisturizer it seems to make my make up just a bit uneven, not badly, but i saw a bit of a difference.Might try it under the Prep and Prime as I am not sure if the Prep and Prime will give my dry prone face enough moisture.But i do love using this moisturizer to use with my cinema secrets creme foundation pallet, (must try ladies, and amazing beauty product)Overall I love the creme, will definitely re order, and for my break out sensitive prone skin, no issue either. Definitely recommend"
0,"I have used almost all of the jar and my wrinkles dont look any better.  In fact, I think they look  worse.  It does moisturize well but its too expensive for that."
1,"Pros:AffordableReally works on my difficult to straighten hairProfessional qualityHigh heatCons:No automatic shut-off featureDoesn't seem to last as long as other productsI have had two of these straighteners over the past few years and I am about to purchase my third. That is my only complaint, they don't seem to last very long! Now, I will admit that I occasionally forget to turn my straighteners off when I am done using them which is not only really dangerous, but I think it is affecting the life of my flat iron. I really wish that the Solia had an automatic shut off feature like other flat irons do (where they turn off after an hour or so if not in use).Other than that though, this flat iron works better than any other I've ever tried - way better than my GHD in fact!It is difficult to find good flat irons with the larger plates these days. I have very unruly, curly hair just past my shoulders. Although I am Caucasian and my hair is relatively thin I have a really hard time getting it smooth and most flat irons simply will NOT get the job done no matter how many times I pass them over the same section of hair. This one really works and it works quickly. I really like that it leaves my hair super straight and soft.I will add that you should be careful when using this flat iron, it gets REALLY hot and it will FRY your hair if you don't pay attention to what you're doing. I didn't put this in the con's section because it shouldn't happen with a little bit of common sense, just don't turn the heat all the way up the first time you use it: Try a lower setting first and work your way up until you get to a point that works for you without scorching."
1,This is non greasy and works just like the manufactures says it works.  Use it mornings and at night. Also it is packaged well.
0,"The color of this is so lovely, a black blue that looks beautiful.The downside is, it lasts barely a week and if you wash your hair even once it will all come out.If it lasted a bit longer then I would definitely use it again."
1,I've been using this for years.  Very mild for sensitive skin.  Good for rosacea. Oil-free.  Leaves my skin very soft.  I found Cetaphil irritating but this never is.  It doesn't irritate eyes either.  I expect to buy this forever!
1,"I have been using the Caruso system for years. My mom used to use the old salt version on me when I was little. My hair doesn't hold regular curl well, so I tried Caruso. LOVE it. I use it every day and people often ask me how I get my curls.I use the Jumbo Rollers only, so I go through them quickly.  I ordered these and they appear a little different than the rollers that came with my last system. They are a little stiffer and seem to be made out of a bit of different material. They have a hint of a &#34;sparkle&#34; to these versus the older rollers I have. Overall, they seem to work as well, but I do wish they were a little softer. I still gave them 4 stars because they do still get the job done."
0,"I used this product to color my daughter's hair, she had never colored her hair before, and we didn't want to use permanent color.  I followed all of the directions, but the first time my daughter washed her hair, there was a noticeable difference in the color, with her dark brown beginning to show.  We had expected it to last through multiple shampoos, so this was a big disappointment."
1,Works well....Badger Healing Balm - 2 oz.....My son and his wife has have issues with dry skin from complications of type one diabetes...I'm always looking for things that work for them!~
1,"There's a curse in my family, the crappy hair gene.  Sure, our hair is full and thick and basically indestructible to styling, but it goes grey, very early.  As a result, I've been dying my hair for a very very very long time.I've tried Revlon, I've tried Ferrier, Garnier, Herbal Essence, Clairol, and basically every other hair dye you can think of, and I have to say I love the herbatint the best.Not only do I feel much more comfortable using a product I could practically eat on my hair, instead of a chemical that eats away at the shaft of my hair and can make me go blind if it seeps into my eyes, but the color is fantastic, and it makes my hair feel softer and nicer then before I colored it.  Other companies boast this, but they lie!Recently I tried Revlon again, I couldn't find Herbatint, and it left my hair dried out, so that if I didn't use a heavy conditioner every time I washed my hair, my hair ended up feeling like straw when I washed it.  Thats very unusual for my hair, usually nothing really damages it, so I was shocked at this!  I missed herbatint!  plus the color didn't stick, I find that most of them didn't.Herbatint has the nicest black I've found.  It looks like natural black hair, but not too light, not anywhere near brown.  its certainly BLACK, but it looks natural, not like you decided to stick your head into a pot of shoe polish and hope for the best, and not like your hair is dark brown, or like it hasn't been dyed at all.  The color stays too, I've never really had it fade on me, plus, after I color, my hair is soft, really soft, and nice, and it doesn't stink like chemical reek, it smells like, well, hair.  It's wonderful!Plus, if you dont have ALOT of hair, you save money.  You can save the unused portions of color and use it later, something that I've found very effective.  It doesn't make the product any worse, and you save money, instead of throwing away money with unused dye because the bottles warn you that it may ""explode"" if you keep it... (which is also rather unsettling... haha)I cant recommend it enough, buy some herbatint, save money, get really nice color, you wont regret it."
1,"I liked that this was light and hydrating for my hands. As an artist, I work with a lot of mediums that require me to wash my hands afterward (i.e. paints, oil pastels), so one can imagine that my hands are prone to dryness. However, after two weeks of use, I got an allergic reaction from the lotion in the form of tiny, non-itchy bumps on the backs of my hands. I gave the rest to my friend who does like Aveeno, but I'll have to search for another hand lotion."
1,I have a chocolate lab mix and he sheds his coat like once every couple of months.  I went out and brushed him really well.  He hadn't taken a bath for awhile so he gets dry and flaky.  I only had to use a small amount of product and it covered his whole body.  Left his fur really soft and smooth.  Still smelled like wet dog in the house.  Not very fragrant but still a week later he smells faintly good if you sniff his fur.
0,This product is overloaded with lavender.  Why not just buy a bottle of lavender and put it on my face? lol
1,"THIS LOTION OFFERS UV PROTECTION, AND LIKE THE REST OF THE REGENERIST LINE, AN AMAZING TEXTURE THAT MAKES YOUR SKIN REMARKABLY SOFT AND SUPPLE. I WAS A DEVOTED NEUTROGENA USER, BUT EVERY OLAY PRODUCT I'VE TRIED HAS BEEN FAR AND AWAY MORE EFFECTIVE. I DON'T USUALLY GUSH OVER SKIN CARE PRODUCTS, BUT THESE ARE AMAZING."
1,I use this product for several years as moisturizer for my body's skin. great absorption and effectiveness in keeping the skin moisturized till the next use.
1,There's nothing really bad about this product. All I can say is that I'm one of those product jumpers - I've tried lots of moisturizers. I was hoping this would lessen my acne because would be a cleaner option. No such luck. I'm now using Neutrogena Compete Acne Solution. I love that one. I also like the Aveno Radiance one.I know this doesn't promise acne curing. I was just hoping this would be a cleaner option. 3 stars because it is nothing special.
1,"I'm a female that gets hormonal acne...the kind of massive cyst that lasts 2-3 weeks!  I started using Nature's Cure about 2 years ago because I was desperate.  Well, within a couple of months, I really noticed a difference!  The pills are amazing.  They really cut down on the cystic acne I get, and the cream that is included is great too.  I feel it's not as harsh as some other benzoyl peroxide creams, because it doesn't dry me out as badly (but if you use it regularly, use a moisturizer or jojoba oil 15 minutes after applying the cream so that your skin doesn't dry out).  Used in combination, my skin is clear!  I got lazy and stopped using this for a about 3 months, thinking my skin was going to stay clear, but my cysts came back, so this really is the thing that is helping me.  It's reasonably priced and I have a *very* sensitive stomach, and the pills have not upset my tummy at all.  Overall, a wonderful product to try, just give it about 3 months to fully see results."
1,"This was going great for me at first... But then after a few days, I noticed a NEW pimple on my face.. this was a pimple that isn't even in my T-zone, where I get the most of my pimples. Plus, this drying lotion cannot get rid of all your pimples. In fact, blemishes are still visible after using this. So I say, trying something else first."
1,"This wasn't exactly a miracle product for me, but it's a great alternative and healthy product compared to toners and cleansers that contain alcohol. It moisturizers my face and cleans it so well! I actually like the smell since it's subtle. But I understand why some people don't like it. If it was strong, I wouldn't enjoy it either since roses tend to remind one of old ladies. I'll probably buy it again after it's gone, but if something else comes along, I may switch."
1,One of my favorite peel-off masks. A treat for my face. Exfoliates/peels and leaves my skin feeling super clean and soft. It's gentle on skin but cleans effectively.  The cucumber mask feels great in the hot summer months for deep cleaning and leaves my face feeling refreshed and renewed.  Dries fairly quickly and peels easily.  I use a cucumber toner after peeling off and my skin feels calmed and soothed. I have better results with moisturizing when I use this peel a couple times per week.
1,This is one of my favorite cosmetics products. It truly lasts all day (if you follow directions) and the color is vibrant.  I don't know why everyone doesn't use this lipstick!
1,"I bought my first tube at the local health food store a month ago, and used it up and it did help a lot with my peri menopause symptoms such as anxiety and insomnia.  I found this on amazon and thought this is such a good value and ordered the 4oz tube.  I used it for the last 10 days, and IT IS NOT THE SAME PRODUCT!!  My insomnia got worse and worse and my skin started to break out and my anxiety and blurred vision were all back, so I used it more and more thinking maybe I needed to use more, and nothing it didn't help at all!!  I got the 2 oz tube at the local store first thing today since I suspected the one I ordered through amazon might not be good, and I just applied 1/2 tsp on me, and i already feel the effect of the cream!  I compared this one with the one I ordered through amazon, and they are very different regarding consistency as well as smell and also how it rubs on the skin.  I'm afraid that what you are buying here is not the same as what you buy at the local store.  Just be careful buying it on amazon!  I thought I had to warn people about this so they get the real thing that works!"
1,It tends to clump around the threads and top of the applicator. As such it can get stuck. And you lose some of the product 'cuz it dries there.
0,"Too stiff. I can't use this, not even when it's wet. It feels like it's scratching my skin, and feels terrible. I'll save it for scrubbing walls or something."
1,"When I first discovered this stuff, I was very pleased because it was a safer alternative to deodorants that have aluminum and other chemicals. After a while, it did nothing for odor. I'd take a shower, pour the product into my hand and apply. Still didn't work. I noticed that other people who have used crystal deodorants have experienced the same problems. I guess for now, I'll go back to using Toms."
0,"i do my research before buying creams I apply to my skin and if I can I like to educate and inform other people too. So, here is the info I found.

1,This is a great nail color for any occasion.  It is a nice shimmer neutral that should look nice on any skin tone.
1,"I've tried a lot of different brands, this is my favorite.  Removes waterproof mascara and long lasting lipstick easily without a greasy mess."
1,"This cream has wax in it, great for the nails, and really makes your skin look years younger!  I use it at night"
1,"i didn't like this product as much as I thought I would as I am typically a huge fan of the Burt's Bees family.  I didn't love the smell and was hoping for a more refreshing, citrusy smell, but it wasn't.  It did a nice job of exfoliating, but I don't know if I 'd order it again.  I'd probably give it a 3.5 if that was a choice."
1,"There's a reason why these guys have been around for years.  Their quality and price have made them the best value there is for cotton swabs.  They do the job, however interesting that that may be, and come back for more.  They're indispensable if you have a baby or young children, but they grow with you into adulthood as well.  There's some things you shouldn't buy the generic and this is one of them.  They've been around for years and for good reason - they're great!"
1,"I've been using these for several years, and I try never to be without them. My face tends to get oily in the afternoons, and a quick dab all over with one of these completely takes care of it without disturbing my makeup.  I took off one star because they aren't quite as big as I would like.  If you're oily enough that you need to use the whole sheet, you end up having to hold it by a spot that is already used and then you have your face oil on your fingers.  If the sheets were a little bigger, that wouldn't be a problem.  Overall, though, one of my favorite products."
1,I have been using this for several weeks now in the morning (I use something else at night) and it works well.  The bottle is very nice but one pump doesn't seem like enough so I always have to do at lest two.  I use this with my Clarisonic face brush and it lathers up very nice.  Everyone has different skin and everyone's skin reacts differently to products.  This product hasn't broken me and leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.  It doesn't hydrate it as by the time I have my hair dried with the hair dryer I feel like I need some face lotion on.  But I feel this is pretty typical for my skin during the winter months as it gets pretty dry.  I would repurchase this cleaner in the future and would recommend it.
0,"Hate the smell, it's just like rotten fruits !! Lathers ok for an organic shower gel, it performs ok just the smell that's the most bothersome"
1,This comb is so awesome. It's perfect for women of color who have natural hair. It doesn't pull your hair. It gets the kinks out gently. I am glad I purchased it.
1,"As someone who has been dying their hair red for close to ten years, I know a good red dye when I find it. I tend to use this dye in the winter, when a darker red is more appropriate. The color is beyond phenomenal - it's bright, deep, luscious, vibrant, so many positive clich&eacute; hair dye adjectives. It's absolutely gorgeous in natural light. I prefer for my hair color to look as natural as possible, and this is on the very line between natural and unnatural. But considering that most natural-looking don't capture the vibrancy of true red hair, this definitely does the trick.I don't go to any extreme lengths to maintain my color, so with normal washing, the brightness lasts for at least a week. I assume washing in cold water will make the color last longer. Even after it fades, the color is still on the natural side of red. The hair dye itself is perfectly easy to use. The dye and conditioner smell really good, and the weekly conditioning treatment works wonders for dry hair.To put it simply: I strongly recommend this color. The color is true to the box."
1,"I was in search of a moisturizing conditioner because my hair is super dry (and color treated), so I bought this conditioner thinking that if I did not like it, I would have lost only a little under $2.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at the results!  Plus it smells amazing, too!  (I also bought the Humectant Shampoo and really like that, too.  Smells wonderful and lathers up into a very nice moisturizing; whipped consistency.)  The conditioner leaves my hair very silky, shiny, and...a little secret...I also squirt the size of a dime into my hand and run it all through my hair after shampooing and conditioning for a nice leave-in conditioner.  Yes...my hair is that dry!  And by the way, it does not make my hair feel greasy or weighed down at all.  I spray a little bit of my usual styling spray in my hair and blow it dry.  My hair turns out silky, shiny, and just overall LOVELY!!  I am so surprised.  This stuff is really amazing, and for the price...you just can't go wrong.  Obviously its not for everyone, but you won't know unless you give it a try!  I will definitely buy this again, and will tell everyone about how great it is!"
1,"my skin already looks better and younger each day that I use this product. It covers blemishes and wrinkles very well, I get comments of my appearance age is 5-6 yrs younger than what I really am. I complement the foundation also with age rewind powder, I think the combination of the two really help each other"
1,"...I need a wider selection, or at least a few more color choices, in the Warm category. BUT I will say, this lipcolor wears very well. Use, when not using this product, the best available lipcare/lipbalm you can afford, however, especially overnight. Otherwise, you will probably get dry lips. I live in Colorado, so I know. ANYWAY, the colors: Scarlett is a very COOl red. I am a redhead/auburn-head with gold highlights and pale, warm-undertoned skin. I can't wear cool lip colors without looking drained and sick. So, I'm disappointed with the Scarlett and one of the other paler colors of which I cannot remember the name. I am ordering the whatever Coral color now. I'm doing this online because local drugstores are often not fully stocked with all or most of the colors in this product line."
1,"I was looking for an orangy lipstick since ages, then I found this one on Amazon and I bought it after reading reviews on makeupalley.com, since I was not able to physically see the product.  I didnt know what to expect.I am very happy with my purchase.  Perfect color and excellent texture.  The product was also in mint condition and arrived on time."
1,"I first received this in the sample bottle, and honestly, I wasn't all that impressed with it. I wasn't crazy about the smell, it didn't lather, and it just didn't seem to do anything special. I kept it around for ""bar nights"" when I needed to really scrub out all the cigarette smoke from my pores, or nights I was too lazy to take off my eye makeup. (This works great for eye-makeup, and I use waterproof everything.)Fast forward to my senior year of college. I got mono, and my skin completely freaked out. I would get huge cystic pimples around my chin, on the corners of my mouth, and in between my eyebrows. NOTHING I tried seemed to work. I used Proactiv, Neutrogena products, all the over-the-counter acne sets. I was starting to get desperate, but after a night out, I used the Purity and went to bed. I woke up, and my skin felt smoother, it wasn't as dry and sensitive from all the acne stuff, and my breakouts seemed smaller. I kept using it every night, along with my acne cleanser in the morning and spot treatment at night. The Purity kept my face from getting too dry, breakouts were few and far between and healed faster. Within a week or so I saw a huge difference. In three weeks my skin was almost completely clear.I've completely stopped using any acne stuff other than the spot treatment, and my skin has stayed clear. I don't even need moisturizer. I still have blackheads and the occasional pimple, but the ones I get now are small and go away within a day or two. I can go into public without concealer- which is awesome, because I spent so much time dabbing on concealers and powder to hide my skin.I can't promise that this will work for everyone, but for my skin, which is dry, slightly sensitive, and breaks out due to hormones/stress, it worked great for me. It is expensive, but it lasts a long time. I'd recommend trying the 4oz sample bottle first- it lasts a good two or three months and isn't priced much higher than your typical drugstore brand."
1,"I don't expect to see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes until I have used this for at least a month, so this is a prelim review which I will update over time.  This product is a retinol product, and because it is non-prescription it is not as strong as Retin A. For me that is great - I have tried prescription Retin A and it made my face hurt and peel.  This product has had some good reviews and I thought I'd give it a try for the minor eye wrinkles that show when I smile.So far I am  happy - I use it just once per day, in the evening, after cleansing with Aqua Glycolic cleanser (see my review on that product).  I wait at least 15 minutes after rinsing off the cleanser, then apply this around my eyes and on my forehead. There is very little scent in this product and it has not clogged my pores. It has not dried my skin out but some users report problems with that.  If that starts to happen I will add a moisturizer after using it.I will stick with just using it at bedtime as I use Skinceuticals C E Ferulic every a.m. and would not want to add anything that might interfere with how the Skinceuticals product works on my skin (much less add another layer of a product before my foundation.)Tonight, for the first time, I put it on my cheeks and will see how they look in the a.m. (I have rosacea so I'm very careful what products I use on my cheeks).  I just noticed that one of the ingredients in this product is glycolic acid.  That is good because dermatology journals have reported good results in treating rosacea via glycolic acid peels.  (That's why I started using the Aqua Glycolic cleanser - I wanted to see if the glycolic acid would make a difference, but did not want the expense of a dermatologist peel)."
1,"I love this product!  It is perfect for the hands in the winter months, and I use it daily.  It smells wonderful too!"
1,"I got this to help with my dry winter cuticles, which were getting flaky and peeling. Immediately after applying, they felt soothed and softened. It might be a bit much in milder weather, as it is a bit oily, but it could just be that I applied it heavily. I've also put it on dry knuckles before bed, and by morning they are much softer.The smell is fantastic! It's a natural sweet lemon scent, not cloying or fake-smelling. Just fresh, citrus-y, and delicious. I think the smell is my favorite part.Due to the consistency, I would really call this more of a balm than a creme. This would definitely not be something you'd want to leave in the car on a hot day!"
0,"I thought I'd try this based on some lovely reviews, but sadly this wasn't for me. Gave me a man kinda smell. Not what I was going for. Had to toss. A little strong and headache-inducing as well. Ishall stick with their Egyptian Goddess Blend, which is soft and feminine on me."
0,"I purchased this at Fruitful Yield. I read all the great reviews online. I decided to try it on a cyst under the skin. Right after rubbing my finger on it to soften it up and get some on my finger I started sneezing. I put it on my skin anyway thinking it was just a few sneezes. My eyes welled up, throat felt dry and the sneezing continued. I really wanted to try this stuff so I thought I'd muster through the reaction but it was getting worse. Within 10 minutes I washed it off with soap and water. The allergic reaction stopped. I looked up the ingredients and I am not sure what I am allergic to. I have been exposed to most of the ingredients before except maybe ichthammol, so I'm just not sure. Who knows since companies put so much crap in everything - I guess I haven't put a marigold up to my nose since I was a kid, so I suppose I could be allergic to those too (one of the ingredients of this stuff). Anyway, I can't use it, that is why I gave it two stars. I will keep it around to use on the kids or pets and if I find it helps with anything, I will update my review! I sure would like to know what in it I am most likely allergic to if anyone has any ideas."
1,"I bought this brush because it combines natural bristles with synthetic ones, in a way that I thought might smooth my hair while combing or untangling it. It works well, but I have more hair volume than the average head, so this brush doesn't go all the way to my scalp. Since I bought another brush (the Chi paddle brush) that leaves my hair feeling ""combed"", I passed this nice brush to my daughter. She has long wavy hair, and more volume than the average head for a girl of her age (she is nine). I love to brush her hair with it, and she loves to use it even more. It smoothes her hair, and gets though it all the way to the scalp, combing and taming little frizzed hairs on her crown.The size of the oval (handle not included) is 13 cms x 7 cms approximately, which is a good size in my opinion (not too big, and not too small, yes, I bet Goldilocks would love this brush, too!). Mine came in a beautiful burgundy color, mate finish. My son had a try with it, and he likes it, so I will order another one for him (I hope they send it another color this time, blue preferably!)You want to try it, or have it already, but have a lot of hair volume, like me? Here is a tip for having this nice brush work for you: take with your free hand a good amount of hair, and brush it from the roots to the ends. Go like that with all the hair, and when done brushing by handfuls, brush them together."
1,"I love these turbans so much, I have several, so I can rotate them to be washed. This towel is super-absorbent and it secures well on my head. It's also very lightweight, which is great, especially depending on my hair length at the time. Since I've started using this product, I've had very long hair to shoulder-length hair, and it's worked great for every length.I highly recommend this!"
1,"This avocado & oatmeal masque is super cheap and I know some people complain about the ingredients. People! You get what you pay, if you want something better, pay extra to get something fancy to suit your needs. This tube is big enough so this should last me longer than 6 months really since I use it maybe once a week.I like how this helped me a little with reducing the size of pores. My face feels fresh and tight after I use this. My only complains are that whenever I apply this on my face, it stings my eyes so much although I did not apply it close around the eyes either, just around cheek area. Overall, I like it."
1,"I ordered the first one, it was missing parts.  Couldn't figure out how to put it together and there were no instructions.  Ordered a second one and it arrived with all the parts.  It worked, but was not easy to adjust the height.  So for me, had to get the height correct then leave it alone.  Kind of defeated the purpose since I have long hair.I used it after shoulder surgery.  Glad to have had it, but something wall mounted and easy to adjust probably would have worked better for me."
1,"I'm a bath girl.  I'll admit it, right now, to all of you, I am addicted to baths.  I am also addicted to bath stuff.  Anything related to a bath, you will find that I've either tried it or own it.  To me, heaven is a bathtub with some sort of goodness in the water.  Just.Love.It.A friend sent me some Lush goodies a year ago so when I went to visit her in Boston I all but drug her down to Lush to get a fresh supply.  As soon as I got home, in went Big Blue and I started my vacation - again.  There is nothing better - besides the tub - than sitting on the beach, sun warming your skin and feet dipped in the ocean.  This bath bomb brings it all back, including the seaweed to go between your toes!  The smell, the feel, even the color is nothing but the Big Blue.  Added perk of Big Blue was that the seaweed clogged the overflow valve so I got to immerse myself even deeper into the waters!I highly reccomend their ""Ocean Salt"" scrub to complement big blue!"
1,"This moisturizer is great, it makes my face smooth and it does help with acne. I will continue to purchase it, it is also very affordable which makes it even better.It makes my makeup look fresh and it goes on smoothly."
1,I saw results in my brows in about 3 weeks of  everyday use. It's not heavy and doesn't feel like paste. I also have sensitive skin and it caused me zero problems!
1,I would never go back to using a regular towel for my hair after trying this little miracle towel. Wrap it around soaking wet hair and it absorbs amazingly. It not only cuts drying time down but makes it unneccesary to rub and rub which is damaging to the hair. They also hold up to many uses. It's really revolutionary!
1,"I received my first Philosophy Hope in a Jar Daily Moisturizer as a gift. It's one of the best skin care items I've ever used. I use it at night, after removing cosmetics, and again in the morning. It's great under my makeup, and makes it go on more smoothly and gives my skin a more refreshed and glowing look.After using this for quite a while, I'm happy to report that I can actually feel an improvement in the texture of my skin. Roughnesss that I had always felt seemed greatly improved. Even without cosmetics, I can see how much better my skin appears.Perhaps not everyone will feel the same results, but this product is certainly worth a try! I am totally satisfied and definitely a return customer."
1,"Color is deep blue teal with a hint of pearl...Fabulous color for the unique go getter. I like Essies dark colors, more than OPI, because they all have such great flavor, and pazzazz"
1,"I have always had normal to combination skin. I would often get many breakouts but needed a moisturizer for my face daily as I would get dry skin as well.  I also get eczema on my skin in the winter.  I have found when using this product you only need a pea size drop and just dot it in different areas on your face and blend lightly(if you blend too hard or much you will irritate your skin).  If you apply too much you get the oily effect and it doesn't work as well.  I found that is the right amount and if you use daily you don't need anymore than that.  I've had many compliments since using this product saying my skin looks fabulous and with a glow.  It has helped my face dramatically. I have tried many products and this one is the only one that doesn't cause me breakouts and has improved my complexion.  It's definitely pricey and not much comes in the bottle, but if you don't overuse and use a pea size amount everyday it should last a bit. I do wish it didn't cost as much as I would stock up on more of this moisturizer. I am in my mid-twenties and use the 7-in-1 fragrance free one. It doesn't have any smell or does not leave skin oily."
1,"opaque with two coats... you know the drill, it is a great white and it right up there with alpine snow by OPI, had no problems"
1,I am very glad I decided to try this toner. It really does make a difference! I use it along with the special cleasing gel and the redness relief spf moisturizer. I have become very attached to the whole line of dermalogica products. I am hoping my skin will thank me someday!
1,"Love the smell, love how it lathers, love how it feels on my very sensitive skin....if you have sensitive skin you must try this product.  I hate the fact that I am usually forced to buy unscented products because of my sensitive skin.  You would think that in 2012 there would be more unscented products on the market.  I am excited about this product and I am hooked.......smelling good is a must!!!!!!"
1,"Finally I have found a delicious, light, everyday scent. Not to heavy or over-powering, this refreshing apple scent is great for any day. Just ask my dog, she agrees with me."
1,"I use this at night and the Alpha Hydrox 12% Souffle for day.  Between the two, I am definitely seeing an improvement in my skin.  I am 45 years old and before starting Alpha Hydrox I had the lovely situation of aging skin which is still oily and breaking out (am I lucky or what?  lol).  My skin is still oily (I don't think anything is going to change that) but I no longer break out.  On my face, I won't say that I'm looking younger, but I would say I have probably slowed the process that creates sagging & wrinkles - which is better than nothing for sure!  On my neck, I have experienced definite firming.  I was getting that little sag just under my chin and that is definitely firmed up since I've started using these products.  Who knows, maybe my face will catch up?  At any rate, with stuff this inexpensive while still so effective, I say you can't go wrong!"
1,"I debated stocking up since this has been my one and only chapstick, but the ewg site gives it a bad score because it contains oxybenzone. Apparently that is a pretty toxic thing, and it is absorbed through your skin - not nice since I've been putting it on my lips daily for YEARS now.Now I'm on the search for a new chapstick that is safer but works as well as this one did. If anyone finds one (no fragrance please) then let me know! Neutrogena is making a natural lip balm without spf that rates highly on ewg, but I'd really prefer something with spf (as long as it isn't oxybenzone).edit: I ordered the Beyond Coastal lip balm with SPF. I don't love it as much (softer than the Neutrogena so I feel like it won't last as long), but I think it will work fine. I also ordered the Neutrogena naturals without spf to use at night and when I won't be outdoors. I really like the ""natural"" one.I've read that there is research on animals that suggests problems with oxybenzone, but the negative results were mostly obtained when the rats were given the chemical orally. While there may not be evidence that enough is absorbed through the skin to cause problems. I still think it's prudent to avoid putting it on your mouth regularly."
1,"It's rare I say this, but I'll probably buy a back up. I have my go to color, there are around 10 but my top 5 rarely change and Tantalize Me took the place of a my Orly purple that I used all the time.Like most china glaze polishes this does need 2 coats. It is a light purple that reflects light bluish tones in direct light, it's the kind of polish you start moving you hand and your eyes get hooked to. I love this color and totally recommend it to other people."
1,I was looking for a nice hand cream since I have really rough elbows. This one is ok and I like that it has a really good EWG rating but it's ok. Elbows don't seem significantly different in the morning if you use it before bed.
1,"I am unsure what to say about this product. It hasn't harmed my digestion but I am unsure if it has helped. I have noticed an increased ability to digest high fat foods but only those of non-animal origin. No side effects. I would recommend at least trying it. Just because it wasn't a ""miracle"" for me doesn't mean it might not work well for you."
1,"So I drew short straws in the skin department and have sensitive combination skin. That means I'll have oil fields on my nose forehead chin and parts of my cheeks, and red flaky dry irritated skin around my nostrils and a few other places. Usually toners are too strong smell like crap and irriate even the oily parts. Not this. It soaked up excess oils and dirt left behind from my clarisonic and smelled great."
1,"LOVE THIS BRUSH! GREAT COVERAGE - SOFT, DURABLEAND WASHES WELL.WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BRUSH TO ANYONE WITHSENSITIVE SKIN."
1,i kinda regret not buying a plain bigger bottle bc i feel like its the same crap just different scent lol. but its smells ok i dont think it relieves stress but aveeno is aveeno always feels great on the skin i also use it on my 1 year old son it helps to protect him against eczema.
1,"Hanae Mori has come a long way from her birth in rural Shimane, Japan. She is now a world reknowned designer dividing her time between Paris and Japan. Departing from clothing she introduced this scent, a unique blend of aromas, some ten years ago.Highlighted by flowers and berries there are also notes of strawberries and almond.The lovely bottle has a top modeled of glass to represent the folded wings of a butterfly. This fragrance is suitable for all occasions.- Gail Cooke"
0,"The brown one broke as I was sliding it into my hair. The black one, I use very cautiously. Design is awkward. I guess the tilted ends are supposed to hold back the hair near the ears better? But its so weak it hardly serves its purpose. Cheap yes, but so is the quality. Would not recommend."
1,"this is one of my tried and true beauty products; it never fails me. The other night, after using a different (and much more expensive) cream for over a month, I reverted back to using this, and my gosh, I fell in love all over again! I highly recommend this product. It's rich and gives the right amount of moisture without a greasy feel or look. Due to it not having SPF, I use this at night, and use a BB cream during the day."
1,I've been familiar with this product for a while on and off. It's excellent and you see results very soon as one week after star its use. I use it after I clean my face and let it set and dry before I applied make-up and I see how smooth it looks. I recommend this product.
1,"The Cricket Static Free Brush is now my favorite brush, hands down. Works on both wet and dry hair and I've never had a problem with static buildup in my hair like I normally do. Perfect size (I have fine hair) and helps style when I blow dry. Easy to clean and a great price. You can't go wrong with this one."
1,Good stuff. I want to try out other scents as well.
1,"I love this product, wish they sold it in a larger bottle. It is great for all kinds of eye makeup, even stubborn eye liner! Don't hesitate."
1,"I'm one who needs to apply moisturizer all day long because my skin is so dry. I was immediately attracted to this when I saw the words ""24-hr moisturizing lotion"" listed on the bottle. And it's true! It really does last that long. I also liked how it was all natural. I have sensitive skin so have to be careful about what I use, this is why this product is so perfect. Having sensitive or very itchy skin, you need special, extra moisturizing, and Aveeno has it! Oats and shea butter have been very gentle, yet effective. Their moisturizer lasts and lasts.With other products that I had used before, I needed to keep applying and re-applying throughout the day. But with Aveeno, their 24-hour skin relief lotion offers a very long lasting formula that gets the job done. Applying once or twice a day is all I need. I can even go a day without having to lube up at all.Before using this, I tried the ""Gold Bond Anti-Itch Lotion"" for itch but that lotion was just waayy too harsh. It burned going on, something fierce, and smelled like menthol. The ingredients were so strong; it was something that I could no longer use.I was apprehensive to try any other anti-itching products after that experience, but then I saw the Aveeno, which had the natural ingredients, and NO menthol. Most anti-itch lotions I saw contained menthol, so I didn't want to go that route. I've finally found a long lasting moisturizer that works. The amount of moisture that you get from the 24-hour Aveeno lotion is amazing. And you won't have to keep applying lotion to your skin. A little dab will do ya."
1,"I first bought the Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler.  What it came down to was the bristles didnt grab my hair and I didnt care for the rotator. Anyway, I returned it and bought this one. Its not perfect, but I like it enough to keep it.The first thing I liked about this dryer is the extra nozzle attachment.  With this, you could potentially get rid of any other dryer you have. Use this nozzle first, as you would your normal dryer, to remove alot of the moisture. Just a quick dry. Then install the barrel. The nozzle gets VERY HOT. Removing it right after using it is dangerous.The bristles on the barrel are separated enough to grab my hair (and I have fine hair-doesnt take much). I do find myself using my hand to wrap the ends just where I want them - the bristles could be a little longer. I also wish the barrel were bigger. The bigger one is the smallest brush I would buy. The mini barrel is useless. I threw it away as soon as I opened the package.  I'm hoping the manufacturer will come out with some larger barrel attachments - 2"" would be great.  I get more voulme using the traditional brush/dryer method, but this is a little easier to get the job done.I like the ergonomics of it. Unlike the bulky Spin Brush, its shaped well to fit your hand.  And you aren't accidently pushing buttons.  The heat selector is a bit tough to push. At first I had to stop and put it down to change the heat setting, but after a few pushes back and forth, it doesn't require quite as much thumb power.I can dry my hair pretty fast - about 20 minutes from start to finish. I have relatively straight, fine hair and I still need several small sections to dry properly, but it does dry quickly. Most likely because of the heat - this thing is HOT. I put it on low once I get to the fragile ends. Low is still pretty hot. I suggest you spray heat protectant on your hair first.It is loud as some reviewers suggested, but I wouldn't say its ear piercing and compared to my old dryer, I don't notice a difference.Overall, I like this little dryer. It's not too expensive, and does a good job of drying my hair fast while still giving me volume.  I hope Revlon improves the product."
1,"Maybelline eye products have a long history of producing excellent eye products. Maybelline mascara has always been a favorite of mine.  I highly recommend theMaybelline Expert Eyes Mascara Remover, Moisturizing , 2.3 fl oz (68 ml).  Try it, you will love it. I ordered this product from Amazon, my favorite place to shop!"
0,"I ordered black opium and day dream send patchauly... What a junk... I'm not affordable return this item, don't deal with these junks... Waste of money and trust of amazon sellers... I ordered 3 different products 1) Egyptian Godess scent smell gone after 4days, 2) Black opium that was good so, I ordered again same BlackOpium but 3) got patchauly instead of Black Opium.Thanks and I will sure never deal with you guys.I ordered couple of Black opium by XTremek it's nice and ordering more... Long lasting, got correct order from xtremek... I like this xtremek seller only..HP"
1,White lash glue dries clear. Easily picked off removed lashes enabling reuse of the strip lash. Reminds me of rubber cement when dried.
1,You can't go wrong with this facial scrub. I've been using it for years - I have not found it's match. My skin is like a wee babe's bottom.
1,"Some years ago, I saw that an independent testing lab had rated Olay as the most effective at achieving visible results and had bested competing products costing multiple times as much.  I bought some and was very pleased with the results. This Total Effects Night Treatment was a new product that I wanted to try, and it's difficult not to sound like a contrived television commercial at how impressed I am.  It's nothing short of remarkable how smooth and nourishing it is to my middle age skin, with no irritation or oiliness.  After finishing my first jar and not being able to find it at my local grocery store, I opted for a heavily advertised competing product that they did have. Big mistake and I actually had to return it after just a few days for the disturbing irritation it caused to my skin. Everyone's skin, of course, has it's own sensitivity and chemistry, but for me at least, I can't recommend this highly enough. It does what it says and at a very reasonable price."
1,"A pretty color. But, it kinda clumps. So, I just use one stroke per eye. Or two. I'm ok with this product."
1,Love color and received so many complaints.
1,"I like these pads and use them in the morning on days when my skin feels and looks dull. One side is is the exfoliating side and the other is smooth. There is plenty of cleanser on each pad so it gets nice and frothy. I wouldn't use these daily as it is not a good idea to exfoliate your face every day but instead once a week. It would be wasteful to use the pads daily if you are using the soft side as you can just Aveeno cleanser and wash using your hands or a wash cloth. This would not only be better for the environment as you are wasting less but also more cost effective. As good as it might feel to scrub your face each morning, the long-term effect could be an increase in breakouts or make breakouts worse as they don't get a chance to heal. I liked the product, just not for daily use."
1,"MATIFYING is NOT CHEAP! Most ""matifyers"" are $10-$30 for a tiny amount. THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT! and SO CHEAP! For men with OILY SKIN, this product will keep you looking fresh without the worry of looking like a walking oil spill...truly I KNOW! Fragrance is very generic and NOT feminine and a LITTLE goes a LONG way...the cream cleanser is also great...combined, you'll see a HUGE difference in your sebum/oil production."
0,This is only for washable makeup not waterproof makeup learned thr hard way still not a good buy it seems like im just using soapy water ill stick to my almond oil removes makeup faster and is gentle on skin
1,"Now that I'm over 50, I can't believe I still get acne.  I found this product on a whim and use it 3-4 times a week.  It's a thick white cooling gel that you can wash off immediately or wait and use it like a mask.  I can't believe that it has cleared up my skin and tightened up pores.  I truly wish I had this as a teenager.  I've never had a problem with it over-drying.  It's not expensive either when you consider that the better your skin looks, the better you feel.  Great stuff!  Walgreens and most drug stores carry this."
1,"I have good skin. Not acne prone, but i still have some acne scars, and discoloration. when i use this, it makes my face very soft, but at times it stings. (I guess i have sensitive skin)I haven't seen an improvement, but it moisturizes real well."
1,"I started using it only a few weeks ago. I have combination skin. I recommend using a moisturizer with it because I noticed my skin started peeling. Although, my skin looks clearer, some of my old freckles seem to be fading, and I just really notice a difference in my skin. I also feel it helps my vitamin C moisturizer absorb better. I used to use Retin-A and Retin-A micro, but I feel this stuff works just as well, plus it has other ingredients that help improve your skin."
1,"Nothing more to say that this is a great cleanser. I have sensative skin, it works great for me. Doesn't strip skin of oils."
1,I have been using this for about a month and see fine hairs coming in along my hairline.  My edges are so sensitive and thin due to stress and/or medications I currently take for Lupus.  Hopefully this will bring back the fullness to be able to wear my hair back in a bun!!!  So far so good!!!
0,"I picked up the PanOxyl 10% Bar when I couldn't find the Foaming Wash at my local Wal-Mart which usually has the Foaming Wash of the same type, which I am still an enormous fan of, at a reasonable price. The bar was $4 cheaper as well so I figured hey, same thing but in a bar, why not right?Well, for reasons that I cannot explain, my acne has never flared up so badly with a Benzoyl Peroxide medication. I can't remember the last time I had so many zits on my forehead and cheeks. The kind of zits that are stubborn too, they returned over and over again. I am under the impression that the medication's tendency to dry the skin accelerated oil production. Even using a good lotion after application made no difference. Maybe there was something wrong in my routine I don't know.Taking a look at the ingredients the two are different. Not my much, but they are different. Perhaps my skin just disliked something in the bar. Either way, I cannot rate this product very highly for what it did to my face. I have since switched back to the PanOxyl Foaming Face Wash of the same grade and my skin has started clearing up again within a matter of a few days which makes me think something about the bar, whatever it was, just didn't get along with my skin. I am sure this bar will work miracles for most, but those of you who have some more sensitive skin like mine, try the Face Wash instead, it works wonderfully."
1,"ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHADES FROM M.A.C.  SATIN TAUPE IS A SOFT TEXTURE AND GLIDES ON SMOOTHLY. THE COLOR IS VERY PIGMENTED AND LONG LASTING. I WEAR THIS TO WORK AS WELL AS FOR EVENING LOOKS. CAN BE WORN ALONE WITH A LITTLE BROWN OR SMOKE IT OUT WITH SOME BLACK. LOOKS GREAT WITH GREY, TURQUOISE OR PINK (COMBOS I HAVE TRIED) BUT THE VARIATIONS ARE ENDLESS.  IF YOU LIKE MAC PRODUCTS ADD THIS TO YOUR COLLECTION."
1,"I have been using this eye makeup remover for about 10 years but was excited to see it offered through the Subscribe and Save  Program. Now I don't have to worry about running out and the price is great. This product is definitely superior- I once tried to switch to a look alike generic brand, which burned my eyes and did not remove any makeup. Great for contact lens wearers and gentle for daily makeup removal. I don't use waterproof stuff, so I can't comment on how well it removes that."
1,"I love the scent, feel, and gentleness of all of the mustela products that I've tried. Love washing and pamering my baby with this brand. The lotion is not greasy and has that fantastic Mustela baby smell."
1,"This is a fine moisturizer, one that I often turn to in the summer when my skin suffers from too much exposure to the sun or too much air conditioning.It's also helpful in the winter when skin suffers from wind and cold. It's a bit of a first-aid treatment for my face.It has been a great hydrating lotion for me, as well as effective on rough, chapped areas such as heels and elbows."
0,The item arrived on time an in great condition. I have a couple of sun spots on my face and I was hoping that this product would do the trick to lighten them. I have been disappointed with the product because it as done nothing to get rid of the spots or to even lighten them in the least.  I used the product for over 4 months without noticing any difference in the appearance of the spots on my face. In fact this product is harsh and there were a few times that my skin felt as if it were on fire and I had to wash it off.
0,I have thick hair that tends to get slightly greasy if I don't wash it everyday so I thought this would work for not washing my hair for a day. Turns out it just made me hair feel heavy and greaser and more unclean. So not for me I guess.
1,"*****This Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream is amazing. It's not really creamy---more waxy---and so it's not greasy as you would perhaps expect. It stays on the cuticle and moisturizes it for a long time. My husband lets me use it on his cuticles when I give him a manicure and he really hates conventional beauty products. I think that this is one product that women, men, and children will love. The scent is yummy, too, and not overpowering. It's a treat to use. Burt's Bees is a company that uses great quality natural and health-promoting ingredients, too. This is a product that works very well. Highly recommended.*****"
1,"I cannot say enough good things about this nail polish color. The consistency of it is excellent, the color is bright and vibrant (great for all seasons, really!) and flattering, it's wonderfully opaque, and it doesn't chip quickly. Really lovely."
0,"I have really thick, hard to curl, dry, asian hair. This iron did not work for me at all.  The iron did not get hot enough to do anything. I guess it would work if I did small one-inch sections, but I have so much hair, it's just not worth the time.  The waves it did create were fizzy and ugly.My friend, who has thin hair, uses this iron all the time and it works great.I recommend the Hot Tools Deep Waver.  It worked a lot better on my hair and created well defined waves."
1,"Doesnt weight down my face, I can breathe and keeps me moisurized all day. i love it. Not just for pre teens"
1,"This polish is beautiful with a great formula and its a dark berry pink that is SO easy to work with, glossy and overall a great polish."
1,"very nice color, great price, and it's very longlasting :D BUY THIS COLOR IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A NICE LAVENDAR COLOR"
1,"As one who spends most of my time in high humidity, this product is an absolute must have! Buy it before summer humidity hits!"
1,"I absolutely love this product, however, I stepped out from ""fulfilled by Amazon"" or Derm Store and purchased from Beauty 4 you; the product looks very different and smells very different from the product I have purchased in the past.  So after I cautiously use It, I will come back with a review...I just hope it does not mess with my very clear and flawless complexion.2 stars because I'm just not sure what product is in the container, and ""real"" Alpha Hydrox is great and I don't want to smear the Brand Name of this ProductAPRIL 10, 2013: Update; I have used the product purchased from""Beauty 4 you"" and I have not had any problems with the product. Alpha Hydrox has done what it has done for my complection in the past. However, I still suggest that one choose a reputable seller to purchase this product. Although, there are some very great stores on Amazon, one is always taking a chance purchasiang any product when stepping away from the Amazon Halo.Post Note: this product has really gone up in price, although $14.00 is still reasonable, it used to cost roughly $6.00 in the past, so watch for sales and deal breakers!...changed my stars to 5....Good Luck"
1,"I've been using this for the few weeks since I've gotten it and haven't noticed any benefits yet. The smell is very unpleasant and it's very difficult to rub in - even a small amount! I got it to help with the keratosis pilaris on my arms and it really hasn't helped with that at all. I thought it would help with dry/itchy skin, which I get sometimes, and I haven't noticed any benefit with that either. In fact, the coconut oil I was using before was doing a much better job so I'm switching back to that. Wouldn't recommend!"
1,the color is quite glossy and solid. It lasts well. I like the color. not too shiny but very warm. good for festivals!
1,I love the smell of rosewater. It's so clean and refreshing. It reminds me of the country with a garden full of roses.
1,"I think my skin cannot handle looking it's best without this creme. I never get a pimple using it, but if I change to another product it's not good. I have found this to be my best friend for skin since 10 years ago, when it was a new thing. I do need this. . . .it is the only thing that works for me."
1,I have a disability which causes me to drop things often. I wanted to get rid of all the bottles and tubes in my tub as they were forever landing by my feet causing a risk for me to fall. This unit is superb. It was easy to install if you follow the clear instructions. Once up it takes 24 hours for the glue to cure and then you can fill the pumps. The bottles are quite large so you do not have to refill to often. Included in the package are labels so you can choose which pump goes for shampoo or shower gel or soap. I do not use conditioner so I used 3 pumps for shower gels and 1 for my shampoo. The products flow freely once you prime the pumps and so far there has not been a problem in pumping out generous amounts of gel and shampoo. It looks neat and clean in the tub and shower. It can be removed safely by sliding a knife down the back of the unit to disengage the silicone glue strips. It does not come with extra glue so if you were to move it you would have to purchase some silicone glue and about 4 contact strips which can easily be obtained in any store with hardware. I recommend this product highly.
1,"I have scaly feet (too soon?), but this product works wonders! I read another review where the lady/man puts the product on their feet then wear socks. I do this and it works! When I shower all the dead skin comes off easy!"
1,"Gorgeous! This is very close to my natural hair color in the summer (well, the last time I saw my natural color -- about 13 years ago!)  I had been coloring my hair a dark shade of red by Manic Panic for about a year. After letting that fade a bit through washings, I became impatient and bleached my hair from light coppery orange back to blonde (used L'Oreal Super Blonde).As normal with bleach, it turned my hair a yellowy blonde with some remnants of orange as red is a very stubborn color to get out, even with nonpermanent color! After toning it, it still wasn't great. I put this Rose Gold Blonde dye over top of that bleach hoping to make it a little more natural looking. I didn't want to go to an ash blonde as my natural color is much more of a gold. This didn't bring out awful red/orange tones like many gold-based hair dyes can do. It was an absolutely even, rosy gold shade. Highly recommended! Didn't dry out my hair even after the bleach, which I impatiently used the same day. I will note that my hair was fully natural underneath the Manic Panic so my hair was in very healthy condition prior to use. Definitely recommended. I am planning on growing out my natural color now, but if that ends up not being such a pretty shade at age 32 now...I'll definitely continue using this shade!"
1,"Over the past five years, my hair has gotten quite thin, and the difference is especially noticeable in my ponytail, which is less than half the thickness it was only five years ago.Wanting to halt the hair loss I've been experiencing, I began using Rogaine for Women a few months ago.  I haven't yet noticed any hair GROWTH (that can take many, many months), but I have noticed that my hair isn't falling out at nearly the speed it had been.  That's a very good thing!There are a few ""side effects"" of the Rogaine that do bother me, but not enough to make me stop using it.I religiously apply 1 ml of solution directly to my scalp twice per day.  I generally apply it about 30 minutes after getting out of the shower/bath, so my hair is damp, but not wet.  I am careful to measure out the solution and apply it to my SCALP, not my hair.However... it still gets all over my hair and makes it ashy-looking.  My hair is dark auburn, but where I put the Rogaine is now an ashy whitish-gray.  That's definitely not a look I am trying to acquire!  And, in addition to the ashy look, it also makes my hair flat.  Very flat.  It is supposed to have the consistency of water, but it acts more like oil when it hits my scalp.I had read that Rogaine can change hair color and/or texture, and I am beginning to see that.  It seems to be making my hair much more ""wiry"" than it ever has been.  I'm needing to use much more product to control my hair now that I'm using Rogaine.I'll continue use for at least another five months to see if it helps my hair actually grow/thicken, but I'm hoping the ashy look and greasy feel will be temporary!"
1,"This 1"" curling iron works great so far! No complaints. The one thing i would change though, is the iron part could be a little bit longer. I have really long (a little above my butt) hair and it 'fills up' the space on the iron."
1,"Please note: I had light hair when I used this, if your hair is darker than the box you will not get the same results!I had a coupon for a free box of L'Oreal hair color and decided to go ahead and try my luck with the 7A (Dark Ash Blonde) color. Despite my natural color being more Neutral toned, I used the ash base color for cancelling out my remaining warmth in my current color and bring me down to a more neutral or beige color. Any other shade would have left me with more orange/gold. I left it in the advised 25 minutes, then rinsed.My color is just about perfect! It's pretty spot on for the woman on the box, though a little darker than my natural color (which is what I wanted!). I emphasize the darker color than what I wanted to match because even though this is a permanent color, IT WILL FADE. By the time my roots grow out significantly this color will have faded to a color somewhere between a medium and dark blonde level and that's exactly what I'm looking for. Preference however is one of the longer lasting dyes I've used (at least in other shades). I usually get a good 2-3 months out of their color before I notice it start fading.I docked a start because this color IS drying. My hair feels very dry and almost straw like despite me leaving in the included conditioner for a good hour after rinsing the dye out. While all dyes do this to some extent, I find that L'Oreal is one of the worst about it. It takes my hair a lot longer to recover after using their dye than it does from other lines and my hair is generally very resilient, strong, and difficult to damage. I wish they'd find a way to make their hair color a little less harsh.However, I love that this color actually comes out the way it's supposed to! There will be variation depending on your starting color, but if you use it properly, at least going from light to dark, you won't end up with something drastically different in color or tone."
1,Bernese Mountain Dog ate the last Cricket and  now I'm glad she did.  This version is slightly larger and has a unique way of keeping my hair pumped up so it has volume while  still smoothing out the kinks.
1,"My friend turned me onto Dr Bronners Bar Soap a few months ago, and I haven't looked back.  The Peppermint is my favorite scent, and I love the way it makes my skin and face feel.  It was a little pricier on Amazon than my local stores here, but I needed a delivery quickly.  Prime came through for me, and I received my soap in a timely fashion."
1,"We have been using this for years on our grandson's hair.  This is simple to use as it sprays on and it is a gentle formula that is tear-free and easy on his eyes.  We applied it normally to his wet hair after a shower but sometimes when he took his shower before he went to bed this was the answer to bed head in the morning.It quickly detangled his hair and made it easy to comb or brush.  It also has a nice fragrance and even my wife has used it on occasion.  The only problem we have is that now he has a burr haircut for the summer and we don't need to use this, at least for a while!"
1,"This was the cheapest nail polish thinner, so of course it's the one I bought. It works great. I put a few drops in a polish that's gotten thick and clumpy, and this restores it to a usable state. However -- the next time I go to use the polish, it's generally thick again. Not a big deal. After a year, I've barely made a dent in the bottle of thinner, and my clumpy polishes are generally the ones I never use anyway. Unlike other reviewers mention, I haven't noticed any unpleasant scent from my bottle of thinner.My biggest lament is really that this doesn't come with one of those sucking syringe things, so that has to be bought separately. Otherwise, good product."
1,"I also saw this product used by Paula on the Real World Key West and I love her wavy hair so I thought I'd try this out for a cheap enough price. I have super thick hair which can be slightly wavy if I let it dry naturally but I also have some straight sections too. This waver made my hair look like I have a loose perm, I love it. And if you want to have more defined waves/curls you can scrunch in some mouse or whatever styling product you prefer. My hair is about four inches past my shoulders and it took me 30 minutes to do all of it, but like I said my hair is very thick. This is a great way to get wavy hair without getting a perm."
1,"I bought this product about 3 months ago, I finished my tube of xtreme  brite, as soon as I was almost done with the product I started seeing results. As I applied the gel in a circular motion i was doing so, I started to see dirt like skin come off. It was incredible :) as of today my arm pits are still white, well as they should look."
1,"Nice smell, majority organic and natural ingredients.  You only need a little to get a good lather and my hair feels clean and not STRIPPED of all oils.  I will purchase this again."
1,"I have very sensitive skin so I have to be careful about what products I use when I have breakouts on my body (notably my shoulders and back).  My dermatologists recommended that I try the Neutrogrena Body Clear Body Wash, Pink Grapefruit for when I broke out.  She was adamant that I did not use it on a daily basis because my sensitive skin and she is right! This body wash is great for when you breakout during the summer months- the salicylic acid treats your pimples.  It does so quickly and without much irritation to my sensitive skin.  However, I thought because it was rather gentle when I did breakout that I could use it on a daily basis- WRONG.  After using it for about 5 days in a row, my skin was extremely irritated and very dry.  I would recommend that sensitive skin people only use this product when they breakout or KNOW they are going to breakout, otherwise it will dry out your skin."
1,And its HUGE! Great volume and does not tangle in my hair. Seems really rough to the touch at first but does not hurt head and flexes when you need them to. Great brush!
1,"This product does make it easier to blow dry and style hair.  However, the stand is somewhat flimsy.  The screws that connect components are small and easily stripped so be sure to use the correct screw driver the first time you attempt to connect the parts.  The screws are somewhat hidden in the packaging so use caution when removing the packaging.  The product is not intended for large and heavy hair dryers.  I have a pretty small hair dryer and the top of the unit, which is flexible, often lags under the weight of the hair dyer.  I love the concept of this unit, but it could have been constructed much better."
1,"I bought this because I remember using Freeman products as a teen and liking their scents and results. This peel off facial mask is good enough for the price. It feels pretty thick, gooey and gross, but most masks do lol. It dries in a fairly good amount of time and peels off like a nasty sunburn lol. It does have a lovely clean smell."
1,"I do like this moisturizer. I've been using it for a while now & it makes my skin really soft & seems like I will never run out of it. When I first got it & seemed like it would last me a week because it doesn't weigh anything, it feels empty but it seems like I won't need to purchase more for a long time. :)"
1,"I have no more to say but beat glue ever, it stays there, doesn't show color, doesn't smell, I love it"
0,"The lotion is fine, moisturizing and non-scented but it rubs off in little balls as soon as I put on makeup primer or anything else on my face.  It just does not layer well at all.  If you need this for bare faced days, then it may be adequate but for a daily moisturizer underneath concealer or even very light makeup, it's awful.It was the least expensive moisturizer with sunscreen at the drugstore on the plus side."
1,This is gentle on my skin but leaves my face feeling clean. I have tried lots of different cleansers and this one doesn't make me break out. I also like the fact that it lathers a lot even if I use just a little amount.
1,"I have simply fell in love with this facial moisturizer. I've found that most sunscreen containing facial lotions feel heavy on my face and irritate my skin. This doesn't do that at all, and the best part of all is it's not greasy but actually leaves a kind of dry finish to my skin that is perfect for applying makeup. I would recommend this again and again!"
1,"I like cake eyeliner, but will be using this at the upper base of my upper lashes and probably not on the lower base of my lashes because I have been warned away from waterproof eye make-up by my ophthalmologist.I bought it for my travel case, as it will last long than bottled versions, which have to be thrown out after 3 or 6 months, because of bacterial contamination.I do like the look of it, though, therefore the 4-star rating."
1,I dont feel this soap does anything special. I've always used Dial soap but I thought i'd give this a try. I still prefer my dial soap.
1,"Early in my married days we were living, well let's call it, a low-income life. With a baby on the way I picked up another (lower-cost) brand. The sticks were harder and the cotton wasn't nearly as puffy and soft.All I can say is that on this item you CAN tell the difference!So in my house we always carry the Q-tips brand of cotton swabs and I must admit we also use a decent (and soft) toilet paper as well.Some things just aren't worth skimping on no matter how tight your budget."
1,"I like the ""naked"" color of this lipgloss...I have very red lips and I try to buy colors that will hide the redness and this does a good job. However, it tastes absolutely disgusting!!! I don't know if I just got a bad one or if they all taste this way, but the taste & smell are horrible!"
1,"I have oily skin and normally my makeup (Giorgio Armani) works well in winter or summer but needs a little help with summer humidity.  I had been using Dickenson's Witch Hazel in the summer just to clear my pores after washing my face and to cool off when I was outdoors with no makeup.  I ordered this on a whim just because I love the smell of rosewater and thought the scent might be better than Dickenson's. Well, to my surprise the product is more gentle on my mature skin and dries with a light rose scent that disappears but is quite pleasing. During a hot, humid summer I have found that the Thayers witch hazel seems not to over dry my skin and leaves it nice and soft with a fresh, clean feeling. It also is not at all irritating and I love the scent. My skin is so balanced now I can wear even L'Oreal makeup in the summer without feeling that my foundation is going to melt and disappear. Now I can save money with the cheaper makeup and save my Giorgio Armani for times I really want to look special."
1,"I read up on this before buying it from my local CVS. I had been wanting to go ombre for a while and this is one of the only kits could find. I didn't want it THAT bad that I was willing to shell out a ton of money to pay for it to get done in a salon, and I'm pretty good with my own hair so I thought I'd give it a try.I have medium/dark brown, which I've never bleached, highlighted or dyed (beyond demi-permanents that only slightly alter my color). I got it trimmed recently, so it was pretty healthy looking with only a few split ends right before I used this kit. I have very thick hair, and the bottom layers are especially dark. I do like the color of my hair, so I figured with the color being stripped down and lightened... how bad could it actually be?I was concerned and super nervous about this, especially because of all the negative reviews, and because I've never seen what my hair looks like bleached before... but I do really like the way it turned out. The last time I colored my hair (temporarily) was about 2 months ago with a demi-permanent dye that is about a shade darker and much more red than my natural color. I thought that they dye had entirely washed from my hair by now, but I could see some strawberry pigment after I used this kit.This kit itself is pretty user-friendly. I was actually very surprised with how well the brush worked with achieving the gradient look rather than the &#34;oh man, girlfriend has some SUPER bad roots, she should get that fixed&#34; look. Obviously you need to be careful about how and where you apply it to make sure the application remains consistent on both sides, and do some lighter brushing closer to the top to make sure you get that fade. I also made sure the ends of my hair were super saturated. I would recommend starting with the darkest part of your hair (so that develops for the longest time) and ending with the lightest parts (so that develops for the least amount of time). You also have to be careful about over-brushing with the brush in the kit, and apply the bleach quickly. If the bleach starts to dry, you're going to have to yank through the strands, and yes, the bleach COULD damage your hair. That's the nature of the chemical. Stick to very small sections of hair (3-inch sections max) so you can work quickly to get the bleach in before it starts to dry, leaving you with more tangles and breakage the more you try to pull the brush through it. I stuck to the 45 mins MAX total time (per the included instructions), and my hair does not look unhealthy, fried, dry, etc., but like I said before, it was pretty healthy to begin with. I showered immediately after and let my conditioner sit in for a solid amount of time.I like the way my hair looks, but I can see how this would be an issue with anyone who has any kind of dye in their hair, especially if it's semi-permanent and they had it done in the last 6-9 months. If I were to guess, most people who gave negative reviews or this product either 1. didn't apply it correctly. 2. didn't let it process for the correct amount of time, 3. didn't like the color of their hair once bleach was applied, 4. had colored their hair recently enough that it would affect it, or 5. had unhealthy/dried out hair that just didn't take to the bleach very well. I was just lucky enough to have the stars align with my current hair conditions, and the kit worked well with what I have.I gave it four stars for a few minor reasons: because the gloves that came in the box were super flimsy, and because the bleach just didn't work as well with my my darkest hair.Overall, I think this is a great kit as long as you are careful, don't have a lot of previous dye jobs, remember to deep-condition your hair afterward, and are willing to tone your ends if you are unhappy with resulting color the bleach leaves behind. Just be smart, follow the instructions, and be kind to your locks. Good luck!"
0,I read all the time about Aveeno being good for your skin and having locally grown ingredients in & wanted to try it. I was surprised when I received this and you can clearly see it is just Vaseline coming out of the tube and that is exactly what it is. Will never order again because I could have just went to the dollar store and got a tub of Vaseline for $2.00
1,"I love this brush.  The synthetic bristles are great for gripping my long, coarse hair, while the natural bristles smooth my hair.The one-piece construction means my hair doesn't get caught.I read a couple of reviews where folks didn't like the way the synthetic bristles hurt them.  Well, just don't hit yourself with it.  I hit myself the first few times I used it, but I quickly learned how to use the brush without hurting myself.  :-)"
1,"But once she figured out she can just lick it off in several short attempts, it was  done deal...it became more of a &#34;I got you, you didn't fool me&#34; war, we stopped using it.  It just became annoying."
1,"While I can't say it rids me of acne, it does feel nice on the skin. I agree with another reviewer who said it's like soap and water though."
1,"I like that I can buy on amazon in a three pack, for cheaper, because my daughter loves these.  It is a little thicker than most lotions, but not thick like creams, so she feels it works better for her dry skin, without feeling sticky."
1,This is my go to brand when I change the color of my locks. Shimmering color that lasts a couple months if taken care of properly! (Although all color must fade eventually.) To lighten hair dramatically you must use a bleaching agent; a little helpful hint. Have fun and take care because you can lose your locks of love if you're not careful.
1,"So far so good this facial moisturizer has been doing good things to my sensitive acne prone skin. Its got the spf, the size is perfect for the price, its non comedogenic and dermatologist recommended. Also not heavy at all :) The ONLY thing i dont like about this product is that it leaves a white residue after application. I just dab off the excess with some facial tissue and its gone. Good stuff."
1,"recommend buying it if you're looking for a cleanser that makes your skin not only feel healthy, but clears it up. It makes me feel sexy and i will buy it again."
1,"When I buy moisturizer the single most important factor is the SPF, and I also consider the price. This is a good moisturizer that not only has the proper ingredients to provide great sun protection, but is also reasonably priced and lasts a long time. I will buy another brand if it has the right ingredients and is cheaper, but this brand is available at most stores and I know I can trust it."
1,"so i've been using this product for around 5+ months. it stung a lot in the beginning and became a little better once I started using it regularly. the cream isn't very moisturizing and to me doesn't have a velvet-ey texture that some of my other moisturizers have.i guess it did seem to work but only after a few months. my skin's texture feels somewhat softer but i'm not sure if it's entirely because of this. in the past couple of months i've improved my diet and also incorporated gym trips.i recently switched my cleansers from the PINK loreal 360 to the apricot scrub also by Loreal 360 and since the scrub dries out my face, i used this and it STUNG SO MUCH. i don't have sensitive skin and i have normal/dry skini have a little product left but i am not repurchasing and i'm switching to st. ivers elastic collagen? cream."
1,"I used Loreal Dark Golden Brown which I've went dark before but not with Loreal.  First off buy a better brand.  Nice and Easy has worked better for me in the past.  Dyed my hair 4 days ago along with my daughters hair which was a dirty blonde.  Both of us had the same problem it went a darker red hers more lighter than mine but mine was dark brown with dark red hightlights and more light red at the roots.  I was not happy.  I did a lot of research yesterday with the Ardell Unred and Ardell Red Gold Correcter Plus trying to see the difference and maybe what it would do for me.  I said why not and went to the local Sallys Beauty Supply and bought both products.  (You can't get the .25 bottle of unred at Sallys just the packets).So last night I added 1 packet of unred to about 2 ounces of my conditioner for color treated hair after I shampooed hair so my hair was pretty wet when i applied.  I let it set 30 minutes and then rinsed it out.  Although my hair was still wet when I went to bed it didn't look much different.  This morning I woke up and decided to try the Ardell Red Gold Correcter Plus.  I used a 3 minute deep conditioner (3oz or so) with about 30 drops of the correcter and I put it on my DRY hair with just a touch of water to get it smoothed through. I let it set 30 minutes, rinsed it out, dryed it and straightened it.  AND I CAN tell a difference.  It looks less red and less brassy and more ashy.  I think if your using this stuff (either one) as a correcter instead of adding it to your dye then it will take some time and more than one treatment.  I am thinking that the red gold corrector worked a little better but it doesn't hurt to try both."
1,"I have been biting my nails for 37 years and had thought that I had tried everything- nothing had worked.  This product is amazing!  Yes, it tastes horrible and it lasts for days!  The best surprise with this product is that it actually strengthens the nails!  I cannot believe it.  My nails are growing and they are growing strong, therefore I do not expect them to break and tear.  I highly recommend this product to everyone, especially people who believe they have tried it all!"
1,"My family has a multitude of skin types.  My husband is very oily, I am combination, my biological kids have a combo of the two of us, and my adopted kids have everything from super oily, to super breakouts.It does not matter who uses this when it is available in the shower, everyone's complection is improved.  I started using it after Oprah turned me on to Hope in a Jar.  I haven't changed my regime since.  A couple of my (8) children have tried products like the popular infomercial ones (you know the brands), only to come back to Purity because of the deep clean and quick changes in their skin.My daughters love that their makeup comes off in a breeze.  I love that I can get the same product for all of us and get great results.Even my spa facialist comments on the quality of my skin.  What more could you ask for?  Don't believe me?  Amazon does offer the smaller sizes before you jump into the large pump size.  Try it for yourself."
1,"I moved to the high desert plains a couple of years ago and the combination of low humidity and hard water began to wreak havoc on my skin. I've tried many different products at many price points, including some extremely expensive ones. Lotions did not last and most creams I tried felt too heavy or either looked *or* felt greasy. This Cetaphil formula has the perfect balance for me; it is light enough to sink in deeply and thick and creamy enough to make my skin feel incredibly soft and have that feeling last.TIP: I buy this extra large size to keep the cost low but I reuse small cream containers to make this ""portable"".Leaves my skin soft and supple. Doesn't leave a scent. Doesn't cause breakouts. Quite simply the best!"
1,"I've used this for years, and it's a must-have for helping to keep my heap of curls controlled and conditioned. I use a little every night after I shower and occasionally in the morning, and it really helps to keep my curly hair from tangling and the ends from splitting/frizzing. It also has a pleasant, light scent, and it's a good deal price-wise compared to other leave-in conditioners (many of which I've tried and not been nearly as impressed with).The only drawback is that I have very thick hair and thus go through a bottle of this in a month -- I wish it went a little further. Still, for the price it's hard to beat."
1,I like this moisturizer it is light yet effective. I have acne prone skin and I can use this w/o suffering breakouts. I highly recommend this entire line for acne and/or pigment challenges. I use this as my evening moisturizer and use the oily skin sunscreen/moisturizer in the mornings. Although if you have a separate sunscreen you can use this during the day since it is light.
1,"I've used Philosophy products for a while, and love trying new smells for the shower/bath gel. The coconut frosting smells great! I read a couple reviews about it, but tried anyway and I'm really glad I did! This stuff smells like a sweet tropical dessert! Would recommend!"
1,"This product makes my face feel amazing. I bought it in bulk not too long ago.And, truthfully, I am never disappointed with aveeno products. They always do thier products justice.amazing and I love, will be buying tons more soon.&#9829;"
1,"I was very skeptical about buying this because I have tried just about everything out there on my skin. I haven't had any noticable results until now. I use this with Alpha Hydrox facewash. My skin has never looked better! After the first week I noticed amazing results. I have oily acne prone skin, but the combination of the two products has made a huge difference in my life. My complection has never looked better. I finally feel comfortable going without my make up, which I haven't done that since I was 13, pathetic huh?  I reccommend this to EVERYONE! It's worth every penny! I started noticing fine lines in my forehead so I wanted to find a anti-wrinkle cream to help with all my skin issues,uneven skin tone, breakouts, oily skin, etc.After a 2 weeks of this wah la! PERFECTION!!!!"
0,"I don't like it at all, it has a good staying power though but is a flowery scent, not very strong but you can feel it. If you are into flowery scents then try it."
1,"Yes, this product is great at getting rid of dandruff and deserves a 5 star rating just because of this factor!!!However T-Gel deserves a 1 star rating for the following reasons:1) Stinks link coal tar! Yucky!2) Dries out your hair out.3) If you color your hair, like I do, then you won't want to use this product because it washes a lot of the color out and may make hair look brassy!"
0,"My hair colour is the same dark brown as shown on the box before colouring.  I really liked the promised colour shown on the box, Hi-Lift Cool Brown (almost a caramel colour), and so wanted my hair to be the lighter brown shade promised.  The actual results are nothing like the colour on the box.  At best it evened out and and coloured my natural highlights to a darker shade of brown.I picked up two boxes, since I have thick hair, and took them to my beautician to ask her opinion on the colour.  After talking with her I decided to let her do the colouring for me since the shade difference was so drastic.  I wanted to make sure it was applied correctly.  After applying as directed, 20 minutes in, my beautician checked my hair and said ""it's not making your hair lighter, if anything it's darker, even toned, but darker.""  I was quite disappointed as I had flip-flopped back and forth trying to talk myself into this ""extremely"" lighter shade for almost a month.The box promises Extreme Lightening-a promise that didn't deliver.  While the resulting colour is not awful (it's very similar to the natural colour of my hair in my teens),  I was really wanting the lighter shade shown on the box."
1,the first Hot Tools marcel that I bought from Amazon had a problem with the rotation mechanism in the handle. I returned it and bought one from a local beauty supply store where they let me test the item before purchase and it worked fine. I think it was just random defect. I like the one I have now just fine.
1,be careful...if you use too much product your hair does not curljust clumps together...use it with a little bit of moraccean oil
1,"Love the Geranium scent, which is more like a rose, to me.  Sure helps everyone in the house to clean up more often.  Effective, reasonably priced, low impact on environment, and recyclable."
1,"i love this product, when i first read the comments from other costumers i thought &#34;OK i'll go with it and try what will be the results&#34; & oh i must say i was amazed, when i have something on my face that disturbs i put it and thats all its Gone :))). i do i either in the evening or morning  ..."
1,"Needed to replenish my lash glue supply and went with Duo because of its high reviews and affordability. I felt that I needed a bit more than the recommended amount of glue to get my lashes to stay, but otherwise it worked pretty well."
1,"Almost didn't buy this because I didn't see the entire list of ingredients but it's all natural & earth friendly. Very thick, does not need to stay on for any lengthy time, smell is not at all overpowering, just fresh. Company gives 10% back to animals, women & planet."
1,"After the first use, I thought, &#34;Oh no! This is going to make my skin SO DRY!&#34;  But it wasn't so bad.  The next time I used it, there was no problem at all.  I love that it is basic and unscented.  Works great on face and body."
1,"This is one of my new favorite perfumes, and so inexpensive!  It is intoxicating, warm and inviting.  It has a powder smell, which is the nature of sandalwood, I usually hate any powder smell but this is so very different, the vanilla adds a little extra sweetness and softness. I found a store near my house that carries all of the auric blends fragrances and I spent nearly an hour smelling each and every one and ended up buying three that I simply could not live without. They are far superior to any expensive brand name perfume.  I used to work in a perfume shop and nothing I came across can beat the staying power of this perfume oil. I've experimented mixing each of my new scents and every one turns out just as delicious as the original."
1,"um.. well the only thing i can complain about this spiral iron would be that when i put it on its highest setting 30 i think it is, the little light that lets you know when it reaches that point that of heat mine never stops. a little frustrating but its no big deal"
1,"This brush delivered soft & full hair as promised.  I found it easy to handle, gripped my long hair well (I got the x-large for hair that is a few inches below my shoulders), and dried it quickly (as quickly as long & thick hair dries)!  Would recommend if you are looking for a nice but not too pricey brush to blow dry curly/wavy hair straight."
1,"Last week I used Clairol foam to dye my hair back to its natural medium golden brown from a blue streak... and it came out a dead dark auburn (not to mention the mess on my sink that's still there). It looked AWFUL. I'd heard of Sun-In before and knew the bottle said not to use on colored hair. But a lot of people had tried it and said it was fine, so I used it on a hidden section first.The spray is easy to use and the smell is very nice. A hairdryer later and that section was slightly lighter. If figured if it wasn't light enough I could do it again later so I did my whole head. It looks GREAT. It took out the deadening greyish red that looks so unnatural with my skin and replaced it with my natural gold.So yes, this product works great on at least my colored hair. But always test it first!"
1,"I recently read the book Curly Girl and have been trying out different organic/natural products for my hair that are free of sulfates (very drying), silicones, alcohols and parabens. This shampoo is amazing! It smells fantastic and cleans very well. I use EO's restorative conditioner after and my hair looks fabulous and my curls are magazine-worthy!!I purchased an entire line of EO hair products - shampoo, conditioner, pre-shampoo and styling cream and the gel for curly hair. I love every single product.It is so refreshing to find a company that offers AFFORDABLE chemical-free hair products that actually work extremely well. Thanks EO Products!!!!"
1,Awesome color. Really great for summer. The application brush makes application easy. I bought this so I could touch up after mani/pedis.
1,"Okay,,, so tmi review! Seriously!This product works perfect for days 3-5! It's amazing! I wore it on the airplane, used it during intercourse, and no blood at all! But it really lacks in the first two days when I have a heavy cycle. Not surprised. I would suggest maybe wearing at least a panty liner or doing what you regularly do for your time of the month.Out of all of the options (tampons, pads, softcups) it's is soo comfortable. Let's be honest, pads feel like a weird diaper (and I always feel like I smell with pads) and tampons can be a pain to get in especially when you're cramping!I feel like you definitely have to be familiar with your body and comfortable with it to put it in. You have to stick it a little bit back in there. It's more complex then a pad or tampon. But it really is amazing! Clean up is probably the worse of all options. You have to pull the softcup back out and it acted as a bucket for the blood (meaning you're pulling a pool of blood out). It can be messy and awkward to dispose of in a plublic restroom. Lot's of TP needed!So idk... it ultimately depends on what you like to deal with during you're period. I wish females didn't have a period!I would recommend anyone to give it a one time try! :DPS never writing a review for a &#34;feminine product&#34; again. BYE! :D"
1,"i LOVE this moisturizer. It is thick enough that i can get proper coverage for just a small amount. It absorbs very quickly and does not feel heavy or oily. I will put this on in the morning and be good all day.My main issue before using this moisturizer was my forehead would dry out in the winter and would have skin flakes. It was particuarly bad after i got out of the shower. Now i just put this on and my skin is perfect.I use this with a combination of cetaphil in the shower and i rarely EVER break out. My skin is very soft and looks amazing.Yes, this is kinda pricey. But a little will go along way. Any more that one squirt and you have too much. So that bottle will last a good while. If you are in doubt, BUY THIS!"
0,This is nothing more than a big bottle of liquid soap. You are better off at the dollar store. I tried as a shampoo and it left my hair dull and dry...even though I diluted it a lot. I tried cleaning with it but it didn't do an adequate job. I tried it as a body wash but again it left my skin dry. I have now resorted to using it for dog shampoo! would not recommend
1,"Sometime a little more help is needed than a lotion offers - that's where this Creme comes in.  It's especially beneficial for those with dry skin or delightful ladies of &quot;a certain age.&quot;Jason was one of the first natural personal care companies to manufacture Ester-C products, and they've been doing it ever since.  The Ester-C line offers a natural type of Vitamin C that helps skin form and maintain collagen thus serving to discourage fine lines and wrinkles."
1,"I wanted to use henna to thicken my hair...add body and shine.I just used it an it did a great job.  I really did not care about the color, just wanted the body, the color turned out good as well.I was able to use half of the package saving the other half for later.Good price...good product"
1,"I have struggled with acne, blackheads, and scars since age 11. I have tried lots of products and seen dermatologists with little help. Now, about to turn 30 and still dealing with these issues, I tried this product after all of the reviews. I cannot tell you how amazing this is. It's so affordable, too. Admittedly, I use it 1 to 2 times a day for my best results. My pores are much clearer and squeezing the blackheads on the nose, which my esthetician used to do, (the only place I would squeeze d/t scarring), has become much easier and I have to do it less frequently with regular use. For the price, I would recommend everyone try it until the product is gone and see how it goes for you!"
1,"Lemon essential oil is just amazing smelling. I've made my own tub and sink cleaner and it just leaves the bathroom smelling heavenly, not chemical smelling.  My only complaint is that I wish there was a dropper cap on it. I had to buy seperate eye droppers so that I wasn't wasting it. The price for the size was great."
1,"I really wanted to like the cleanser but I just didn't because I felt like it wasn't really cleansing that well. It foams well and easy to use but I don't like it over my Cetaphil cleanser, which is supposed to be another light cleanser for sensitive skin. There's also a slight fragrance to it that I didn't like either."
1,"I do not use after shave and instead opt to use this product. It seems to help with moisture, any cuts, doesn't sting, helps with breakouts, etc. It really is a great product but it does have that tea tree smell that does NOT really disappear. I get whiffs of it off/on during the entire day. I hardly doubt that others will smell it unless they're licking your cheek but you will be able to smell it. I'd rather have great skin with a medicinal scent that isn't all that bad!! This is great product at a very reasonable price!"
1,"I use this after make up removal to tone and remove any remaining makeup.  It really does a great job of lifting dirt out of clogged pores, and it smells really good.  It is something I have purchased many times and will keep using.  It is just that good."
1,"Well, I used it for the first time today and it BURNED my skin, but as they say, the burning means it's working! To many people, breaking out when using this product is COMMON. In almost any acne treatment, usually because the dirt in your skin is being cleaned out but still is in your skin, but this masque is helping it. The first step to this is actually making you break out, then it will start working.I'll keep you guys updated on what happens within the next week or so, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. But so far, I think it was a good thing to get. And for the price it's not really a dent in your budget, so why not worth a shot right? :)  But the burning is some-what unbearable for the first few minutes, but then it becomes soothing and feels like you're skins being cleaned. :)----UPDATE----Now I give it 5 stars!Oh, how I LOVE this mask! It absolutely did give me smaller pores, and helped clear up all these annoying pimples around my face. I mostly get them around my chin and this mask took it all away! My Fiancee also used this, he has dry sensitive skin, and used this and in 1 week it cleared up. I love this mask. :)"
1,"I have been a loyal user of Inner Grace for more than a year--and that remains my fave Philosophy shower gel. However, I got a yen to try one of the others. I almost got the Amazing Grace, but at the last minute, changed to this one. Why? There's something about this scent that takes me back. There is this ""baby cologne"" smell that is reminiscent of the way children smelled in my Cuban childhood. Not the violet baby cologne, but a more perfumey, less floral one--crisper, more unisex and ""soapy"". That nostalgia is worth paying extra for.I like the creamy formula, even though it does have a strong surfactant--SLS--which will irritate some. I have supersensitive skin and, sometimes, I have to go strictly with Cetaphil or Aveeno or Aquaphor or other unscented products. But when I can handle scents, I like Philosophy's line, as it doesn't irk me like some skinwise. Between the more sensual Inner Grace and this crisper Pure Grace, I have shower gel/cream to cover a couple of my moods.For a cream, this lathered exceedinly nicely on my washcloth. I felt very clean--well, duh, it has a strong cleanser--but also moisturized somewhat, which is nice.Not everyone is gonna love this scent. Some might find it on the sharp side, on the Zesty soapy side, but it fades quickly, like all other Philosophy bath scents. Layering only helps slightly. Dunno why, but Philosophy scents just don't have ""hold."" But that's okay. Smells so nice while you're showering.One star off for the 1. strong cleanser when they've made a cream formula to be ""gentler"" and 2. the quick dissipation of scent.But I would rebuy just the same. Nostalgia is a potent thing.Enjoy,"
0,"I have long, curly, fine hair so when I shampoo I have to move this brush all over  from point to point otherwise it will tangle my hair like a rats nest!  The bristles are a bit stiff, making it a little painful in some spots.I would probably go with one that has longer spikes that are a little softer."
1,"This is great for extremely dry, winter skin that's prone to dashes. My husband uses after each shower and rarely uses his prescription hydrocortisone cream."
0,"I tried it because the reviews were encouraging, and it does work on water proof eye liner if you let it set for a half a minute or so.  BUT  the smell is truly awful, and I will not be buying this stuff  again.  I have found it to be irritating on my eye lids, maybe because I'm in my 50s?  Could be.  Sorry ladies, but in a pinch I think cold cream works better."
1,"Works wonderfully with hair dryer, now I just need to get more coordinated to use it! Doesn't leave my hair as less-staticky as I'd like, but that's what I get for having curls."
1,"Been using this for three months now and it is all right. I have thick hair so it does not dry quickly enough, but what more can you ask for for a mini turbo? For travel, it is absolutely ideal."
1,"This is a fun product to buy and it actually works well. If you are going to use this I would suggest applying the product liberally so that you do not have a thin layer but a nice thick one. I also suggest leaving this product on for longer than 10 minutes, maybe around 15 so that it really gets to dry. Before you apply the product pull back your hair because it can get a little annoying when the product gets stuck to your hair. I would also be mindful not to get any on your eyebrows cause it can get inbetween the little hairs.Once you remove the mask you'll find that your skin is nice and soft and less oily. It does remove dead skin but do not anticipate removal of blackheads. It also leaves you with a nice soothing/cooling sensation afterwards."
1,"I was a bit skeptical about spending so much for a simple nail file, but it was 100% worth it!It takes down long nails quickly, but doesn't leave any burrs nor rough spots.You don't need a finer grain file to finish, just get this, and throw all your other files away.When it starts to seem like it isn't doing as well anymore, wash it, and use and old tooth brush on it to clean it out.It will work like new again!"
1,"This product is great for everyday use and wont strip the skin like a lot of other cleaners I have tried before. It cleans the skin well, and even removes foundation. It doesn't leave my dry skin feeling sensitive. I also like the glow it leaves. Having been in the fashion and entertainment business, I am very particular on making sure my skin looks its best and this is the best product I've found. Its my go to staple skin cleansing product. Highly recommended"
1,"I suffer from estrogen dominance and under guidance of my OG/GYN, he recommended we try progesterone cream. Now, I have been working out, and changed my diet (no dairy, lots of fruits and veggies, lots of fiber) so I don't want anyone to think it was just the cream alone.I already saw a difference with my menstrual cycle. I don't cramp as much and I certainly don't go through many pads/tampons as I used to. I'm mainly using the cream to increase my progesterone levels so I can achieve pregnancy so this is a good start.I highly recommend this cream."
1,This is my FAVORITE hand soap.  It's creamy and moisturizing and has a wonderful cherry/almond scent...and I can't find it in the store ANY place.I found it HERE!!!  Happy happy--joy joy joy!!
1,"Love this because it is not heavy at all, goes on smoothand produces a natural look (mine was light to medium).Not sure how well it lightens age spots, but mine don't seemas prominent after a few weeks' use."
1,"This is one of the first eye creams I have ever enjoyed using without getting red eyes, itching, or discomfort. I had stopped using any eye creams due to unpleasant red eyes.It goes on and disappears, does not migrate into the eye.  The small bottle with a pump is great for not contaminating the product and also getting out just a bit at a time. Light and without any perfumes. I have used it as an over all face moisturizer under make up while traveling (reduce the number of things I need to take with me). It works well for that also.I would recommend it as a good product at a rational price."
1,"I usually read ingredient lists carefully, but I guess the name fulled me and I thought this product had some AHA's.  After using it for a while and not seeing or feeling any difference (AHA's should sting a bit) I checked and sure enough, despite the name, no AHAs.  I wanted a product with AHAs and think the company's name is deceiving on such a product.  I thought they only sold products with AHAs.  Perhaps they aren't doing this intentionally, but it is confusing and I wanted to let everyone know in case you were fooled too."
1,I use in my anti aging arsenal. Use it about 3 times a week and feel I get value from this. It has a slight sting but doesn't last long. I would recommend and use along with a regular moisturizer. I see a difference so enough said.
1,I don't like spending a lot of money and I don't like going to get my hair done. Over the years I try to save money by buying the cheaper boxes but my hair never turns out the way I want it to. When I use Feria it comes out exactly how I want it each time. I also love that it's pretty much the only box that gives out true highlights. It's amazing. Other plus about Feria is that it comes with a lot of actual product. Meaning if you have long hair you only need to buy one box! In the end it's just better to spend a couple more dollars to make yourself look great. I've never had a problem with any Feria hair colors. I love it!
1,"Its ok,would buy again love the smell.I just won't pay alot for it can buy over the counter that does just as well.Don't shave your legs than use it though irritation."
1,I have very thin fine hair.  Almost every product I have used to curl my hair leaves it straight and limp after about 1/2hr.  This product using the small rollers I had actual curl (not just wave) the next day.  This without even using hairspray.I some ways it reminds me of those old pink rollers of my childhood.I'm very pleased with this product.
1,These are not too scratchy or too soft.  They do get a bit big when they get wet but they stay on my hand and they shrink back down when they dry. I've had mine for two months and no sign of wear yet.
1,"I was told about this incredible cream by my brother-in-law MANY years ago. As a contractor, his hands are often chapped and dry and, as a man, he HATES putting on any type of cream. This one is different, he said, because it works, period!!!  It has a slight, very pleasant fragrance and absorbs quickly.  I tried it then and there and have used it ever since because it works. I carry this tube size when I travel, but also love the large tub it comes in for home. It goes on smoothly, absorbs super fast, and stays on well. I use it in my hands and feet. Absolutely LOVE this product and will always use it."
1,"Very good quality for this price! I would recommend this oil-- I use it as a bug repellant, with olive oil to &#34;dust&#34; wood furniture and mixed with other EO's and carrier oils for skincare and aromatherapy."
0,"I've had some luck with Clean & Clear products so I had no qualms picking up the Continuous Control Acne Cleanser from the store. However, as soon as I used it I became a bit frustrated.To begin with,the formula is very watery and thin. I prefer something a little thicker and this didn't feel like it stayed on my skin long enough to do a very good job. While it might have helped with acne a little, it definitely does not live up to its name.I also felt that it made my skin more oily and I quickly stopped using it to switch to a different product. Over the course of the day, my skin would become uncomfortably oily. Where is the continuous control in that?Clean & Clear's Continuous Control Acne cleanser sat in my shower for quite some time before I finally picked it up again, a sure sign that this product was no doing its job adequately.There are definitely other acne products, some even from Clean & clear, that I prefer of the Continuous Control Acne Cleanser."
1,"I was looking for a new facial moisturizer. I have combination skin so it's difficult to find one that goes on evenly. This is further complicated by how dry parts of my skin gets in the winter months. I tried out Clean & Clear morning glow moisturizer since it had an SPF-15 and would moisturize the dry parts of my skin while not going on heavily or greasily on the oily acne-prone parts. I was delighted when this moisturizer revitalized my face and neck, while protecting against sun damage. In the winter, my skin does still dry out in places, but I use this moisturizer in combination with a tinted moisturizer from Wet n' Wild:Wet 'n' Wild Ultimate Sheer Tinted Moisturizer, SPF 15, Sun Kissed 183, 1 oz.and it works perfectly.Wonderfully scented. I LOVE the dispenser!!!!!"
1,"I received this last night and washed first with a mild soap then a Glytone Body wash with a loofah.  After, I applied this and when I woke up this morning, I noticed a change in my skin already.  *I have KP (Keratosis Pilaris) on my back and small areas of my thighs* Don't expect a miracle overnight, but expect to notice a change in the way your skin feels instantly.  You don't need to apply much of this product.  A small, less than a dime sized amount, is more than enough to work with.  On the box it says that if application does not dry within a minute or less, you've used too much.  It's true.  I think this is a steal for the price and the thickness of this product.  I look forward to more results after a week, two weeks, a month, etc. and will be back for a second review.  7/24/13"
1,I am. On my first jar and I definitely feel my skin has improved and is softer. I use this at night along with some Clinique washing and toning products. I do use another dry skin cream on dry areas like around my nose and eyes as they seem to require extra moisturizing. I think this product is a winner and priced right.
1,"I use to use this Fade Milk 3 years ago and it worked but can't remember why I stopped until recently when I started using it again. I take a star off because I got a small rash on my left elbow, that's when I remember that it use to give me rashes on my elbows. I wouldn't recommend using this during the day if you're going to be outside in the sun. When you're wearing this lotion and sweat its not a pleasant feeling, it makes me feel sticky and want to shower all the time. Using it once daily before bed made a big difference and now I love it. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth, the smell isn't bad either. In the beginning my left elbow was itchy and I got a small rash, but after a week of ignoring it, I guess my skin adopt. The lotion is white but when I shower in the morning after using it at night, the washcloth/soap sud/water have a dirty pinkish color, this only happens when I use the lotion. I would assume that's fading my skin tone, that's the only explanation I can come up with. Over all this lotion works in lightening the skin, as well as making skin feel smooth and well hydrated. I only use it on my body and so far my tan is lightening and my skin is slowly going back to my natural light tone. I highly recommend if you're not allergic to hydroquinone."
1,"I recommend this brush, because it makes your skin smoother & softer. It also is wonderful for circulation, and I love my daily ritual with it. It is really relaxing. If you're someone who suffers with depression or something like that, I find this is a nice self- treat to wind down."
1,"I really wanted a very light night cream. I'm sure this mosturizes well but it left a residue that was still present the next morning. I tried it again and again, using less each time until I was putting the merest suggestion of cream on my face - no longer enough to even begin to moisturize. Reluctantly I took this off my subscription list and won't buy it again.But I do realize this is a preference thing. For some people - different age, different skin, different preferences - it might be wonderful. Certainly it seemed well blended and was fragrance free as described. For me, it came out probably one or two stars. But I'm giving it three because I think it's a nice enough product - just not for me."
1,"My dermatologist friend has this all over his home... he's got two little kids.... so I figured there might be something to it.Bit pricey but I can see how this will last me awhile.... I like to use it on my drier bits... feet, knees, elbows, face, etc. I was never great about lotion on my face but when I've used this, it's been kind of awesome.... it just love that it feels so rich but so neutral... I guess that's the point... don't want it to aggravate the skin!So I figured I'd splurge a little in my mission to become better friends with my skin. I figure if I get a good running start now, I can look more youthful even as my body has other plans ;)Really like this cream!"
0,"With all the great reviews, I thought once again I would try something to help my nails grow.  I applied the cream 3 to 4 times a day.  I even took my polish off, hoping that would help.  My nails are now more of a mess than when I started.  I am truly disappointed."
1,I have been using it for about a week and my hair definitely does feel softer! My ends are very dry due to lightening my hair for the summer. And my hair is almost impossible to brush after I get out of the shower. Not because it is dead but because of the texture of my hair. The conditioner definitely helps to make it a little easier to brush out.I'm hoping to see more progress as I use the product more! (:
1,"No fragrance, lightweight, does not feel tacky, uses titanium and zinc oxide, which block rays that are not blocked by other sunscreens. Very nice."
1,"the best cleanser i have used. foams up nicely, rinses nicely, cleans nicely. i proceeded to buy the 32 oz refill. great for sensitive skin and use before topical treatments and vanicream."
1,"This plus Nail Tek II has given me tough as iron nails.  I have tried absolutely everything, and this works.  I swim several hours a week, and still have great nails.  I top it off with Revlon &#34;Nail brightener&#34; -- just one thin coat."
1,"Very easy to apply and non greast. Good for under the eye, crows feet and frown lines. Great buy for the money."
1,"I have used Jason products for many years, mainly because they do not test on animals. I believe that is very important to many people. This body wash lasts a  long time, just one pump onto my fluffy wash thing, (I never know what they call those little round net things we have so many of), anyway, one pump is enough to supply a ton of foaming suds that make you feel so clean and it rinses off so easily. Leaves my skin soft and not dry. I am a great fan of this body wash because I do like tea tree oil for it's antiseptic properties,  and  I also buy the lavender one, for it's soothing effect. I alternate between the two of them.  It is a great bargin for the price considering how much body wash we use.  I think it would be good for a large family of kids because the Koala bear is just too cute."
1,"Been using this for a few months now, and although it works great as a primer and a moisturizer, I have not noticed any decrease in the number of wrinkles or had any reduction in the fine lines around my eyes. I will not be purchasing again after it's used up."
1,"I wear make-up almost every day and it was a pain removing the eyeline and mascara. This cleanser is foamy and smells nice. I have oily/acne prone skin and after using this product, instead of having an oily face like I usually do, my skin was soft and still felt clean. Great price too, will be ordering again!"
1,"I am an Opi nail lacquer fan and have not been disappointed with any of the colors. I have 10-15 colors and think each one is the best.This rich wine color is perfect for Fall. It is a color that mixes well with any of the color spectrum. This year wine, merlot, and burgundy are the really big fashion colors.. For the nail polish, the best accessory for fall is lacquer. ""So what shades arevthe best for Fall, think deep, dark variations of red and navy offset by cool tones of minimalist white and beige."" , according to Harper's Bazaar.This 'Louvre Me Louvre Me Not', is the essential color to head this trend. Opi has the reputation for one of the best nail lacquers, and with a base undercoat and quick dry coat to seal in the color, this lacquer is good for at least a week.Highly Recommended.  prisrob 09-24-12OPI Nail Lacquer, I'm Really Not a Waitress, 0.5-Fluid OunceO.P.I Limited Edition Germany Collection Nail Lacquer, German Icure by Opi, 0.5 Fluid Ounce"
1,This oils absorbs inmediately and you can add lotion after and your skins stays hidrated all day.I think for tropical or humid climates is enough because is not heavy or too oily.
1,"I tried the Aveeno Facial Cleanser, and it is smooth and comfortable, and I have been searching for a daily facial scrub for a long time, and it is good."
1,"I have been a regular customer of SkinStore.com, but they no longer discount MD FOrte Products when they have their special 20% off, so I tried Amazon.com and found it at a much cheaper price.  Thanks~"
1,Love! Ive been using olay products for years and Im still in my 20s. Neva too early to take precautions lol
1,I really like this hairspray.  I cannot use regular hairspray or I would be washing my hair way too often.  Regular hairspray makes me itch like crazy.  This does not cause me any itching or sensitivity problems.  Bonus is that it works!  Maybe not strong enough for a bouffant but it works well for me.
1,"I was looking for something to aleive my scalp build up so that my hair will grow out again.  I tried Nioxin, and all it did was burn my scalp and make my hair feel dry and brittle.  I had tried T/Sal a long time ago without any adverse effects.  I went back to it, and I'm STILL in love with it!  No burning, itching, or other adverse effects.  (It doesn't strip my hair either!)My scalp is actually sun burnt right now and it didn't even agitate the burn when I applied it."
1,I have used OPI polish in the past.  It is a nice polish and wears well.  This is a beatiful color not to bright or dark just a nice rose pink color. This is a quality polish I am highly satisfied with purchase and color. (I normally put on 2 thin coats allowing 1st coat to dry completly before adding another.)
0,It globs up very quickly and I have only used it twice and it needed to be thrown out. Not happy.
1,"I bought this product in despair after Neutrogena discontinued Oil-Free Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment. But I found I liked this product better. True I am older and it is time to switch to a more intense moisturizing regime, but this product really worked. I know Neutrogena has put Oil-Free Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment back on the market but I am sticking with this Anti-wrinkle stuff from now on. I highly recommend this to anyone over the age of 25 who has the intelligence to wash their face before bedtime. Use this, it may not get rid of wrinkles but it really does keep your face softer and prevents peeling and helps heal sun damage. I speak from experience. This stuff is not a miracle (most products are not) but it really does a good job and the price is very reasonable."
1,"I don't use too much makeup, maybe concealer sometimes, but my skin is super duper oily. So even if I use a sunblock, after a few hours, my skin will be very oily. So I use this sheets to remove the oil from my face. Its very easy to use- just take a sheet from the package and press it against your skin and that's it! The sheet will turn transparent as soon as it absorbs the oil from your skin. It saves so much time since applying powder foundation to your skin after every 2-3 hours is such a hassle."
1,"I actually love this product because it doesn't have harsh chemical that'll rip out the oil out of my skin. But here is why I gave it 4 stars: the smell! Not everyone can get used to the tea tree oil smell. It's STRONG! But it goes away the MOMENT I wash it all off. So it's  does the job. And If you can stand the tea tree oil smell for like 1 minute, this is a great purchase. Since the liquid is so light and light in viscosity, I do recommend getting a foam soap dispenser or a face scrub to create some foaming action."
1,"Not sure why everything needs to be so perfumed these days.  I would especially expect a product advertised as 'natural' to be just that, natural w/o perfumes.  Not the case.  I won't buy it again just because of that factor."
1,"I am a 47 yr old woman.  I've been using this night cream for approx. 2 yrs now and really enjoy the results!  As soon as I apply I can feel my skin tighten and to be honest I do not have any wrinkles - YET! ;o)  I love ROC products, the only product of theirs I was not happy with was the eye correction cream...it was very strong so I have been using Olay eye serum and really like it.  I use to have this line between eyebrows and fine lines on forehead, and as soon as I started using ROC I noticed that they disappeared...Had to keep looking at myself in the mirror because I couldn't beleive it.  I really was ready to begin Botox but no!...no Botox required as of YET! Thank you ROC!!!!!"
0,"This product includes parabens,read the package . I thought this is going to be my favorite but I scared to use any more. Not only Aveeno, other brand products are  the same and  have harmful ingredients. therefore I  decided not to use any product with harmful ingredients.finally all of  products I have gave to my mothering law. at least I am free now."
1,"I'm used to getting the regular detangling comb for curly hair that everyone's seen but every once in a while I like to try something new. I also own the Ouidad double detangler comb for when my hair is long. The Tangle Teezer Brush broke every single one of my 3b hair strands. So far, this detangler works great."
1,I am in my 40th and have very good skin in general.  Over the years I tried many different creams (both expensive & inexpensive brands) and keeps coming back to this one.  It's light weight and it does not feel greasy at all. It works great to keep my skin moisturized at night & exfoliated at the same time.  It's a great cream and the price is great-I get it from Butystore when they have super discount :-)NeoStrata makes very good functional products. Will definitely buy it again.
0,I did not like this brush at all.  I have thick hair and it hardly felt like I was brushing it - it's too soft with little fluffy bristles which impede the brushing action of the longer stronger ones.  Since it's not worth the cost of returning it I'll give it to my grand daughter and will let you know if its a hit with her as she does get a lot of tangles in her very fine hair.
1,"After years of gel, I have given my nails a break.  They weren't very strong at first.  After a couple weeks of using this my nails have grown stronger and longer; they look great!"
1,"I do like this product but can not say ""I love it"" because I am constantly looking for a good moisturizer.  MY face is sensitive and dry and it is difficult to find a product that isn't too greasy,too smelly,or too expensive.  I can't afford to buy $50.00 moisturizers; I am a retired 68 year old senior living on restricted budget; however I do care to look nice.  I do not like the dispenser, I would prefer a jar and not this pumping action."
0,"I've been using clear Duo adhesive and it works great, I wanted to try some dark adhesive so I bought this. My lashes were falling off within hours... not sure if it's just not as strong but I did (heavily) powder my eyelids, a trick I use to keep my liner in place. Duo sticks for at least a day and a half even with the powder, this doesn't. I'll try it without the powder but so far I'm not impressed."
0,"I was excited to try this product especially reading that it helps in absorption of foods after having the gallbladder removed.I took these as it said on the label, however, I had some serious adverse reactions to these. They made me sick to my stomach as though I had diarrhea. Perhaps the strength was too strong for me, but I threw these out! Perhaps I will try the one's that are 125mg."
1,"This is wonderful lipstick.  Goes on easy, dries matte, then you put the gloss side on and your lips look wonderful.  This color is great, too, not overpowering.  Lasts all day.  Love it!"
1,"We have tried the store bands and the &#34;off&#34; brands and find this product, while not perfect is the best of all of them. For us the swabs stayed intact and firm and did not unravel as was noted with other reviewers. In fact that was what the store brands did. The only reason that we did nto give a five star rating is that soem of the swabs were packed so tightly on the ends they did not absorb much."
1,"I love the Java Mauve-a colour,  I consider it a neutral colour.  The formula is ok, not too thin or thick.  It's opaque in 2 coats and I had no problems with chipping or bubbling."
1,Great skin serum and for using the electrostatic wands to tighten.  Use it in the morning and at night.  It really softens my skin.
1,"I've used the Olay Regenerist cleanser, St. Ives scrub, Neutrogena, Estee Lauder, Ahava - need I go on? But I really like this Aveeno scrub (though ""scrub"" is a bit of an overstatement considering how small the beads are). I like the citrusy smell and the way it cleans gently. I wish it were a little more scrubby but I can't seem to find something that's about half way between this and the super-rough St. Ives so I'll stick with this until I do."
0,I was unable to use this product as it dried my skin out too much.  I would not expect that to have something scent and dye free meant that it would be so harsh.
1,"Really like these essential oils, and the price is right.My current favorite is Peppermint/Eucalyptus/Lemon for a wake-up call. Just a couple drops in steam or a diffuser and away we go!"
0,"Not an effective moisturizer (for me, anyway). It feels and smells perfectly nice. After use, my skin feels even drier and itchier than it did before I used it; it also seems to create a barrier on my skin: lotion applied after the oil (later in the day, for example) doesn't help at all. Looks like I'll be getting rid of this and going back to a shea butter-heavy lotion."
1,By far the best Wheat Germ product Ive bought in a long time! Quality vs price is great! Thank you for such a great product!
1,Awesome smell. Wonderful soap. I gave this away to my girlfriends for Christmas in my &#34;My Favorite things&#34; box. It's great and the price is hard to beat.
1,"Best moisturizing cream ever. Great for after peel ( use NCN Peel...The best!). Cant use during the day unless I put on olay regenerist over the top to combat the greasiness. Love,Love,Love!"
1,"This is my absolute FAVOURITE OPI colour!  Everyone comments on it, it goes with everything and is pink without being neon.  Just love it.  And it's so cheap here on amazon too!"
1,Perfect shade for my skin tone at a great price! Couldn't ask for more!! I will be buying more in the future!
0,Iodex is becoming both increasingly scarce and expensive.  I should have bit the bullet and bought another jar of Iodex  instead of this crap.  Nothing draws infection out of and heals a wound like Iodex.
1,"This is a fantastic brush and has literally transformed my hair, period. I seriously wish I had discovered this brush years earlier."
0,"I purchased this some time ago, but when new, for some reason I never used it.Pulled it out of the cabinet to try it again, and only ONE curler heated up.So whatever I paid for it, it didn't work."
1,"Used this on myself and my 6 year old. It started to relax me within minutes. My 6 year old also mellows out and he is never mellow. :) My older kid hates the smell, it is very herbie, also saw it at my local wegmans."
1,there is not a whole lot to say about this nail polish but that it is a very nice color. my wife loves it and it looks very nice on her nails will buy again when the time comes.
1,"******UPDATE JULY 10 2013********Regarding my old review below, I WILL NOT USE THIS PRODUCT ANYMORE. Sadly, they have changed the ingredients. It is loaded with chemicals now and I will not put them on my skin. If it helps any, I now cleanse with pure coconut oil, using same procedure! Hope my sharing helps you.God bless.********************************************************Now I know why my grandmother swore by cold cream! If you have DRY skin this is hands down THE BEST moisturizing cleanser on the market.Recently I've have had to change my skincare routine because my skin is now DRY instead of normal. I've been searching for products to both make my skin look radiant and to actually improve it. I have found my cleanser: PONDS COLD CREAM. Who would have thought?PROCEDURE:I use Ponds to clean my face/take off my makeup in the evening.After applying it to my face I use several tissues or a damp cloth to take it off.NOTE: I've noticed that my skin stays more ""dewey"" if I use tissues.IMPORTANT: If you're wearing mascara it WILL get a bit messy! (You may prefer to use an eye makeup remover - I don't.)RESULTS:My skin looks moist and I could NOT be happier.I hope you have as great of results as I did! God bless :)"
0,"This lotion is the worst lotion that I have ever bought because it leaves my hands sticky and gross feeling.  It's a useless lotion because after I apply it, I have to wash my hands because I can't stand that sticky and gross feel.  Urg!!  Going back to ucerin."
1,"So I dunno if it's hormones or what the heck happened but I hit a certain age and BLAMMO my skin SUCKS. I have acne that would rival any teen boy. I have tried MULTIPLE other high end products and until I tried the Peter Thomas Roth line I was not getting relief. I like that the products have medicated and homeopathic aspects to support them. They don't have strong odors, and don't bleach my sheets. I will be a repeat customer - oh and a little goes a long way....."
1,this ws okay i personally like the mint masks the queen helene makes alot better than this one.
0,The lotion seems extra oily which broke my skin out.  I used the remainder as a hand cream and still felt the extra oil.
0,"let me explain that  - I love their orange smell. Even the paper mint is ok, but the lemon smell is...simply not there. It is not strong enough."
1,"My daughter has thick curly hair which is a chore to comb through every day.  I use this comb on her now and she likes it - it didn't have any weird plastic rough edges that could get caught in her hair as others did.  This one was very smooth.  The color was nie.  My only concern, long term, is that it appears more brittle than other combs and I can foresee a tooth cracking off at some point.  We've been using it daily for a few months and this hasn't happened.  If it does, I'll update the review!  It doesn't have any give to it at all like most plastic combs."
1,"I love this stuff so far, i am an African American woman who has been growing her hair out for years using weaves. And for the past 4, 5 years i have been successful in achieving length ..so far about 16, 17 inches worth. Anyhow this is the first year i decided to wear human hair instead of the cheap synthetic ones. Since April this year the hair was doing fine than!! it started getting so tangled and dried out.. i had no clue had to manage it; than i used QP Elasta from sally's ..good but is expensive this stuff i found at the dollar store, yes the dollar store!! did way better of a job at detangling. I got out the shower ran my fingers through the hair i was sure was still tangled.. but no.. like butter it had so much slip!!! I wish i would had used this stuff in the beginning. the reason i gave 4 instead of 5 stars was it didnt leave a shine like my v05 but my v05 doesn't detangle like suave either."
1,"I have used many different products on my face, but they would irritate my skin. This one was perfect for me. I am very happy with this one. I would recommend this product for people who have sensitive skin like me. This product is a little expensive but worth it."
0,"I purchased the Jasmine scent because I wanted to try something new (my signature smell is ""Aphrodesia"" by Song of India), but I'm totally underwhelmed by the smell. Well actually, its a pretty overwhelming smell, but it doesn't register as Jasmine to me. My dad (who is in his 60s, and who's senses aren't as sharp as they used to be) thinks it smells amazing (I think it makes me smell like a hotel bathroom (y'know that generic soap/air freshener smell?)), but my boyfriend (who is a big fan of my usual scented oil) can't seem to smell it at all, so I'm quite dumbfounded. When the package arrived, it was clad in bubble wrap along with a free box of incense cones (my dad was thrilled), but the container somehow leaked during transport, and just reeked. I had to wash my hands several times to get the smell off them. When I put it on, I kept forgetting, and so would periodically wonder what the terrible smell was. I don't think I'm gonna get this again, and I feel bad, but I've considered never purchasing from this brand again. Perhaps I'm just a Song of India gal through and through..."
1,"This product is amazing. I am 33 years old with combination skin and have always struggled with breakouts. I was looking for something that would prevent aging and reduce the impact of smoking on my skin without causing acne. Olay Total Effects moisturizer has meant incredibly smooth, soft skin and no more breakouts! Plus, it is SPF 15 so there is some sun protection included.Also, unlike most other moisturizers I have used, this absorbs well and does not cause unsightly beads of sweat to form on my forehead after application. The only thing I did not like was the scented version as the smell is insanely oppressive, but there is an unscented version available so that problem is easily solved.I highly reccommend this product!"
1,I loved this base coat it makes my nail polish go on smoothly and protects my nails. It looks like I got a professional manicure!
1,this is a good color polish if u like dark coffee brown color. i didn't think it would have been this dark but....
0,"This product is really runny and watery.  I don't like the consistency of it and does not seem to clean my face as well as other products.  I think I will stick to expensive facial cleansers, such as philosophy"
1,"I purchased the Nars Matte Multiple in Aliti. Its a amazing bronzer or contour shade. These go on so smoothly and beautifully it looks like a second skin with a little color (if that makes sence). I now want every color! The matte multiple looks so nice on the skin, and blend like a dream.  The color range is also really nice. I can't wait to try the Matte Multiple in Orgasm,  my favorite blush color of all time!I also want to mention this amazon store, Bluemercury inc. I was originally sent the wrong color and I needed it for a job that Saturday (it was sold out everywhere in the color I needed). They immediately sent the right color, Altai. I revieved it a day before it was expected.  There customer service was above and beyond.  If they have a product your looking for, pirchase it from blurmercury inc!"
1,I really like it but from the pictures I saw on the internet I thought it was going to be more glittery.... still great but it looks the best under sun light. That's when the shine comes through beautifully!!!!!!
1,I love almost all the Avalon Organics products but this smell is wonderful. It reminds me of daffodils... Will purchase again.
1,"They are very small, so they are good for on the go. They don't pick up very much oil so if you have very oily skin they are not for you, if not they are fine. I don't use them very often because they don't do too much for me because I have decently  oily skin."
1,"I've got this color on my toes right now. It's one of my fave classic OPI colors in the cool spectrum. It's a sort of lighter, brighter version of Bogota Blackberry.  And this formula LASTS. I've had it on my toes for 2 weeks, and only now do I need to redo it (though it still looks okay, just a tad ""tired"" on the top edges, if ya know what I mean?)Hard to describe the color for me (I'm not expert on color names) but this is a vivid cool-toned but deep pinky-red-wine. Not very dark. Not light. More medium-dark with a lot of gleam to it, a shimmery color. An attractive color for a lot of skin tones, I'm guessing. I'm a med-dark olive skinned Latina (NC44 via MAC shades), and it suits me very well.Love the gleam. Love the long wear. Love the girliness of it.  This baby hangs around the OPI stock for a reason. It's a great color.Mir"
0,"NOt sure if it does anything to my 4a/b hair. I dont hate it, but I have found no difference either way."
0,"NOT REAL! I still had powder left from the real Bare Escentuals (tried to get it cheaper ...) and this is not the same. One, its darker. Two, made me break out. Three, does not go on or blend like the real one. Four, clumpy and sticky - does not come out easily. BUYER BEWARE!"
1,"Awesome. Get some. Your hair will thank you for not exposing it to hot dry heat any longer. Just don't leave the roller in the steamer pin too long or it will make your hair too wet. Quick, simple to use, with excellent curlability  and with curls that LAST! I have thick, wavy, hard to curl hair that and always took a lot of heat ( and time) with hot rollers that damaged my hair. I wonder why these aren't common knowledge. I YouTubed use just to be sure I was using right. Couldn't be easier...and the price is very reasonable. I did buy 6 extra jumbo rollers."
1,"This is one of the few hand creams that I can whole heartedly recommend. It is a concentrated formula so you only need to use a little bit. It's best to use this cream at night, maybe even with some lotion gloves, it will keep your hands feeling nice and soft."
1,I use all of the NIVEA Men products. This is a great face scrub it leaves your face nice and refreshed. Great for the skin also.
1,The other is much finer - it's strange because they don't say that there are different grits to be had but you have to file forever to get the one to work. Good product.
1,"This is a great product, and a good color.  Natural look, lasts a long time, even on oily skin.  Will continue to purchase Bare Mineral products--just wish they would bring back the &#34;heaven&#34; blush--it was the perfect color for my skin tone."
1,"This was the first waterproof liquid eyeliner that I used. When I first started using it, I loved it. However, I had nothing to compare it to. Since, I've used different drug store brands of liquid eyeliner and this one sort of fails in comparison. Don't get me wrong, it isn't horrible, but there are others out there that are better. It is waterproof, but it isn't air proof. It dries, cracks an then flakes off throughout the day. As it dries, it feels as if it tightens and shrinks (which causes the cracking). While it does this, IT ITCHES SOMETHING FIERCE! After a while, the brush starts to get weird and application gets messy. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,"This is the only remover I have found yet (I've tried maybe 7 different brands), that actually works to remove waterproof mascara. It also removes lip stain very well."
1,"I've been using them for about 12 years, after I received a facial using their face cream.  Recently had a facial and the technician said my skin was in excellent condition (and I'm 45)."
1,"this product it great when first applied it feels wet ,but soaks in so quickly,best ever the itchy dry hands and red cracks are going away."
1,"This cleanser is OK, and I will finish it but I won't purchase it again.  One thing I don't like is that the fragrance (a pleasant enough, citrus-y scent) still lingers on my face even after I have rinsed very thoroughly.  Also, at times it seems a little &#34;strong&#34; and my face is reddened afterwards.  I was trying to get away from my department store cleanser and go with something more affordable, but I think I will go back to my original cleanser.  As I said, it's not bad - I personally just don't care for it too much."
1,Love this night moisturizer. If I have a dry patch of skin this knocks it right out. I have acne prone skin and none of the excuvience products I've used irritate me. Only thing I hate is the container. Would give 5 stars if they would change it.
1,"So last summer I decided to lighten my hair after 6 years of dying it black with mainly dreaded box color, I proceeded to highlight my new medium brown shade and eventually got pretty light. Winter came and I went back to a level 3n ombre'd to a 7n. My natural hair is dry, curly and a level 6 or 7 so when my roots come in boy the contrast is bad. I took an edgy bright dark purple and put it all over my head and let my hair go atleast 3 months. Now it's almost summer again and I've now used colorzap 3 times. Each time it strips out a significant amount of dark color. I'd say it lightens it 2-3 levels every use. It's gentle enough that I'm confident in bleach washing my head in two days to a light yellow/orange blonde without my hair going to mush and breaking off as I just stripped my hair again today. my desired result in the end is a bright amazing purple/blue - I can't wait ! This does work on semi permanent hair color too. To everyone who says this is basically bleach, well it's called color zap not bleach duh. it's color pigment eraser.... bleach lightens, this eats color that's why you get such an ugly flat shade when you rinse out. DUH. good luck and invest in quality treatments/conditioners for after and you will have no problem!!!"
1,So far so good.  No complaints.  Skin is always moisturized and the product smells good.  You only have to use a little bit.
1,"I used some expensive serum that worked very well but I decided to try some cheaper ones to see if they would work the same so I can save some money. Oil of Olay never did anything to my face but since it is an ""more expensive"" product of this brand so I expect it would be good. Used the whole bottle but nothing happened. Face felt greasy like usual, spots didn't fade away, skin texture has no improvement. In short, nothing happened but not the worst thing I have tried. So I give it a 3 star. I don't think I will buy it again. Will try another brands"
1,I have patchy inflamed skin and after the first few uses my skin has calmed down a lot. Hopefully it will help clear up my skin totally.
1,The guys in the family say that it works well and makes their skin smoother.  I guess we'll order more.
1,I love the fact that Amazon carries EVERYTHING!!! I got this product through a dermatologist and was afraid I would never be able to get it again.  Wrong!!  Amazon is terrific!!!
1,Ditch the lotion for this fantastic body oil.  I use this immediately after I shower and a little goes a long way.  My skin always have a healthy glow - even during winter.  My skin is moist and NOT OILY.  This is a FANTASTIC product!!
1,"I have been using these since my bunion surgery and I still use them after, they worked well for me, soft and pliable, washing well"
1,"Hands down the best liquid eye liner I have used yet. I don't believe on spending a lot of money on something like this so for the price it's simply fabulous and even though it's not waterproof it lasts pretty much all day. I use this every time that I apply eye makeup, a thin line along top lashes ( I draw it from outer corner in, it seems like an easier way to control the thickness of the line) and one right under the lash bed sets a dark contrast that makes any other makeup I apply pop. I usually smudge a darker shadow on top with a medium short slanted brush and blend it out and smoky eyes in no time. To create a natural look simply make the line thinner and add a pencil or shadow over but lightly and keep the colors simpler.The key to a good liquid liner is the brush, it's very important to me that the applicator is like a felt lip marker, not a little puny brush with some hairs on it, that is not something usable at all and it's something I never buy no matter how interesting the product is. I think many people find liquid liner intimidating but it's a great tool to add a lot of depth and to enhance any other makeup that is applied on top. Like with everything else in life practice makes perfect and it didn't really take me too long to figure this out.- Kasia S."
1,"This lotion claims to be an anti-wrinkle cream, and guess what?  It does work!  I purchased this with the the Alpha Hydroxy face cleaner.  It is mild and does not feel greasy on my skin.  I plan to use this and reorder it when I finish it.  I recommend this without reservation."
1,I have been using this product since 10 years ago whenever I havd dandruff issue.It is fairly reliable.  Smell is fine too.  Recommended for people with dandruff.
1,"This works great as a makeup and as a moisturizer, make you skin look perfect not too shiny not to matte, it's just great if you are looking for a natural look and fair means fair, not chalky white"
1,"I started using this with my mother, chemo dried her skin out. I use it after a shower, 2-3 times a week. I like the smell of the original. thisis best for everyhting but hands, for that I use working hands, my hands take a beating. The amazon price is excellant."
1,"I do wish it stayed wetter in the tube but I love the way it thickens my lashes. The brush applicator is terrific. I don't like waterproof because my lashes fall out. This last all day for me and washes off completely with soap and water.Never flakes, never smudges."
1,"I suppose &#34;witch hazel&#34; is &#34;witch hazel&#34;, but his one has a very pleasant aroma.  I love the way it gently removes residual traces of residue (soap, etc.) and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth."
1,"I had the old Caruso hairsetter years ago and ended up throwing it away when I couldn't find any replacement foam for the curlers.  I was so happy to run into the product again.  I have very baby fine hair...and since I used it years ago...it's a little thinner these days.  Anyway, I never feel like I'm burning it as with curling irons or ruining the hair with perms.  The curls hold all day whether I want small tight curls or larger ones."
1,I've used that before I came to the States and feels very good. Rose and cucumber are both good. I'll try vanilla next time~
1,"Love itgreat for teen acne, no harmful additives or strong smell.Convienent with subscribe and save, and the cost is comparable.I would reccomend it and will continue to purchase"
0,"Lies lies lies. I shouldn't have believed these positive reviews!! This is like mascara from early 90s or something, just black stain on your lashes, that put your lashes TOGETHER and clump. Oh yes it's waterproof so it gets a one star, thats the only good thing about it....it definitely isn't pretty!!!! And NO IT DOES NOT ADD ANY VOLUME. Wasted my money thank u very much! Sigh. I want my money backkkkkkkkkk!! Grrrrrrrr and I bought this for my wedding!!! D:&lt;I should've gotten l'oreal voluminous waterproof mascara instead......"
1,"...anyone complaining how rough they are... maybe you shouldn't scrub as hard?  If you use softly, it's soft. And yes, it hurts if you're digging it into yourself."
0,"It's definitely not for oily/acne prone skin. When I would use it on my relatively clean skin first thing in the morning, my face would feel greasy and start breaking out later that day. When I would use it to take my make up off before I went to bed I would usually wake up with several pimples."
1,"A Sales Associate at Ulta recommended this to me a few years ago when I was looking for a new concealer, saying that it was a customer favorite.  Over the years, I've tried concealers from drugstore brands to higher-end brands, and this is my absolute favorite concealer.  I absolutely love it!I had assumed that I would need the lightest color, but the Beige actually blends in better in my fair skin.  (I wear NW20 in MAC foundation.)It's also great that this has some SPF in it.I still need to use a foundation primer under this (and a moisturizer with SPF 30 under that), but doing so means that this never settles into the fine lines around my eyes (I'm 42), and it never looks cakely or dry on my skin.The texture of this is also silky, so you don't have to tug at your delicate eye skin when applying it.  You also just need the smallest amount.I tap on a bit under each eye, and then use a fluffy dome brush to blend it in.I strayed from this recently to try to the Amazing Cosmetics concealer since I had heard such great things about it, but that one sunk right into my fine lines.I hope that they never stop making this!  It's my Holy Grail concealer!"
0,had to return on christmas morning! :( the light didn't work at all!
1,"I get the brown and it always gives me the perfect soft, natural liner.  Unlike powders, it gives the definition to make the eyelashes stand out.  The liquid blends well with the eyelashes, but dries really fast.  It never flakes unlike other liquids.  The brush is exceptional; thin for a good line but large enough to control and leave a mark.  You do not need another brush."
1,A wonderful product. It is made well and does what it's suppose to do well. It's really relaxing to use and makes my skin look and feel great!
1,I have used witch hazel as a toner for quite some time..but the Rose petal smells soooo good..this is now my favorite witch hazel and will reorder for sure.
0,I did not care for this product at all.  I have oily t-zone and break out easily and the oil in this product didn't help.  It didn't remove my makeup very well either.  My face didn't seem clean at all after using this.
1,"This is by far the best western BB cream I've tried so far. Not orange or greasy. However, it still does not hold a candle to my Skin79 BB cream, which remains my holy grail."
1,This is my go to lipstick and the best long wearing lipstick on the market.  I would give this lipstick my highest recommendation.  Love it!
0,"I lost so much hair!I followed the instructions of this product since it was my first time using it. I went to rinse it out, and my hair started falling out in clumps. I used the included conditioner as suggested which did make my hair soft, but did not help with the hair loss.This made my hair prone to breaking off once dried, and also caused me to lose about two handfuls of hair in the process of washing the dye out. I did not experience any burning of the scalp while I had the dye in my hair so I have no clue what would cause this type of reaction.I hope this review helps anyone thinking of trying it. Beware!"
1,I love the fact that the ingredients are mostly natural.But I have to use a lot to barely get my hair clean
1,"My daughter has very long, rather fine hair that tangles extremely easily. She uses this before she dries her hair after shampooing/conditioning, and it gets the tangles out without causing her undue pain. It's pretty sturdy as well, the other detangling combs we've bought have all lost teeth fairly quickly, this one is still like new after a couple of months of use."
1,Absolutely fantastic.  It does what it says it does.  Came  right away and was very reasonably priced!  Thank you so much .
1,"Seems to be a somewhat different formulation than I used to buy... Not as smooth, thinner and evaporates quickly from the face.  Would be ok if you don't need much moisturizer."
0,This applies smoothly and feels good on my skin right after application but it ends up making my skin feel oily and greasy. This breaks me out when I use it on my face but I don't want to let the tube go to waste so I started using it on my neck. It doesn't irritate my neck because my skin isn't as sensitive there.
0,"For reference: I have very pale skin with red undertones. I use topicals for acne and rosacea. Rosacea means that at any time, for any reason, my skin can and will suddenly flush red and blotchy; it can stay that way or it may calm down. My skin is combination; it starts out dry but becomes greasy in a hurry throughout the day. It's also 'mature skin' now, I guess. Just some crinklage starting in the eye area, I try to take good care of my skin.I've been experimenting around with foundations again, seeing what else is out there. I love Smashbox Camera Ready, but that cream formulation is not really serving me well right now, with summer here. My face is like waterfowl near the Exxon Valdez about an hour after I use it, and even the BB Cream isn't containing it. After a year I finally broke down and gave in to the MAC hype, I ordered a box of foundations directly from MAC to see which one matches me. You may need to experiment heavily to find just the right tone, and if one doesn't work, try the opposite tone no matter what anyone tells you you 'should' wear.This formula, in NW15, was a perfect match. But it's a powder, and Retin-A means that my face is perpetually peely and flaking. Powder formulas normally make beacons out of the dry skin areas. I put this foundation on last night, straight, with no primer at all. I used the Sephora Mineral brush (my absolute favorite for powder foundations)SEPHORA COLLECTION Classic Mineral Powder Brush #45 and it went on like a dream. I started on the nose, and worked my way outward, and it looked great. So great, that it totally covered up every single discoloration, and I looked stark white. But, I *am* stark white, I'm just not used to seeing my skin look completely blank like that. It almost looked geisha-like (but in a good way). With such a perfect canvas, it was easy to make blush look like it should, and not like I'm having a fever or embarassed. What's more, I guess I'd become accustomed to the shine that inevitably accompanies a cream foundation; the BB Cream itself imparts a lustrous finish. This stuff was flat out MATTE. (Others suggest using the Fix+ for that, I now use Urban Decay De-slick which acts as a mattifyer AND makes it dewy) The makeup washed off easily when it was time to remove it.So...on to today! I primed with the Smashbox BB Cream in Fair. Then using the Real Techniques Buffer (wanted to try it, and it's fabulous, not as dense as the Sephora)real Techniques Core Collection Set I applied the MAC foundation again. Once again it was flawless, but with the BB Cream as a primer it was not dull and matte, it had a little shine to it. But by essentially whiting out my face (hey it matches my neck!) all the other makeup really popped because it wasn't competing with the pink undertones. I put on some MAC Half Red lipliner and some lighter gloss on top to kind of lighten it up a little, and it really looked great. I was super impressed! But, it felt like a mask. In the heat throughout the day, I could REALLY feel this on my face, and it felt like my face was suffocating. As I was driving I noticed that my nose looked shiny, so I took a good look and all my face was *!!SHINY!!**I had read some reviews from others that Philosophy The Present was the perfect primer to use with this instead of what I've been using, so I went to the store to get it. The sales clerk asked me some questions while I was swatching on some of The Present; she thought I had never used primer before and I told her I normally use the Smashbox BB Cream. She kind of reared her head back a little as she looked at me with my super shiny robot face and her mouth made a funny shape as she asked, ""You use it now??"" Yeah lady I know how I look right now. I told her I was wearing the MAC and she curled her lip as she said, ""I've heard it's not worth the hype"". Thanks, lady.When I got home I couldn't wait to wash this thick paste off my face! By then my face felt like it had mud on it. It essentially looked great, just shiny like I was on a sweaty coke binge. I noticed as I washed my face, that my skin along the jawline was peeling off in pieces. Not flakes, but actual pieces like little sheets. WOW this stuff must be drying as all heck. Even with BB Cream. As the hours have gone by since I removed the makeup, I've noticed more and more zits popping up on my face. Just about 20 minutes ago a big red welt came up on the end of my nose, and it looks like I have a 3rd nostril trying to form. I can feel them on my chin as well. NOT HAPPY that I'm wishing I had a paper bag like the Unknown Comic!!!!!!!!!!!UPDATE: Using Philosophy's The Present Philosophy The Present Clear Makeup, 2 Ounce under this powder, with the Urban Decay De-Slick Urban Decay De-Slick Oil-Control Makeup Setting Spray 4 oz..(The Present, apply foundation, light misting of De-Slick) made the appearance of the makeup much much better. It wasn't anywhere near the grease/shine level as previous wearing. However, it still felt heavy on my face (Unlike the Smashbox Camera Ready) and I still couldn't wait to wash it off. And, sadly, it still broke me out. But on a good note, I'm loving the Philosophy product under foundations that are more drying than the Smashbox, it's a whole other animal from the Smashbox BB Cream. Normally I don't like Philosophy skin care products, but have to admit this one is a real winner! It also has a soothing property to it that the BB Cream doesn't impart. NO SPF though, that's a bummer. I have since found that MAC products work great with the Philosophy primer but I cannot get any of them to cooperate with the Smashbox BB Cream.UPDATE II: This foundation caused such a severe flare up that I looked like I'd just won a cherry pie eating contest, with my hands tied behind my back. Chin and cheeks engorged with red inflamed bumps and pustules, knots and pimples on my forehead, end of my nose, and cheeks. Some under my jawline as well. To make matters worse, I could't use my Lancome Huile Doceur to wash, without it stinging and inflaming my face further. My backup cleansers (Cetaphil, Cerave, DHC Deep Cleansing Oil) similarly irritated my face. The only thing that calmed it down and enabled the healing to begin was straight coconut oil. A week later my face is just down to the healed but flaky stage and I still cannot use any of my normal cleansers without inflammation and irritation. Maybe that is a good thing, since the coconut oil costs a fraction of the cleansers! But I do find it disturbing that a foundation product can incite such an allergic reaction that it changes the way your skin acts EVEN WHEN YOU STOP USING IT. Thanks to this MAC product I had to completely change my entire skincare routine and eliminate all cleansers except for just plain coconut oil. That profoundly stuns me, that ONE PRODUCT can change your skin like that. Just...wow. On the plus side, my face loves the coconut oil."

1,"My hands have always gotten pretty awful in the winter but this year is worse because I work at a job where I have to wash my hands many many times a day.  My hands were horribly red and between my fingers were starting to bleed.  It got to the point if water even touched my hands, it really hurt.  I bought this after seeing some adverts for it.  I am so happy I did.  The first time I used it, it was a little off putting because it is so thick.  I didn't know why it wasn't absorbing into my hands.  Then I realized I just had to work it into my hands more than normal lotion.  After the first use, I noticed a difference.  After daily use for months, my hands feel great and are still soft.I only use this right before I go to bed.  I work it into my hands, wait a couple minutes, then work a little more in.  Some people may find this overkill but like I said, my hands get very dry.  Because it's so thick, I don't use this during the day.  I uses Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion a few times throughout the day.  But, if I didn't use this at night, the Aveeno wouldn't be so effective during the day."
0,"I guess I don't know how to use a facial peel off mask or something, but I am not happy. First off, it's like glue. It's the same thing as getting elmers glue, just smells like cucumbers. I can't spread it around to my face and it peels off like glue on your hands. You know when you get glue on your hands and peel it off as a kid? Same thing, except you can't spread it around like Elmer's. It took me forever to get it off my face and was not nice because I have peach fuzz. It got in my hair and I had to wash it out, and I didn't see a difference whatsoever in my face except that it was red from trying to get it all off. If you want a pain in the ass (and I don't like to cuss), buy this. This is something that I would never recommend to anyone whatsoever. If I'm doing it the wrong way, please someone tell me!"
1,I am using my husbands account. I like this eyeliner pretty good. I have used it a few times. However I do like gel liner better. To me using this is about the same as using your eye shadow for eyeliner which I do from time to time.
1,"From what I understand, Mane 'n Tail was originally developed for horses. Horse owners reported seeing ""significant improvement in the health and appearance of their horses' manes and tails."" The improvement in their animals' hair prompted horse owners to try the shampoo out on themselvesI use this conditioner in conjunction with the shampoo and this over the years has been my favorite go to shampoo and conditioner.  After using both the shampoo and then the conditioner, my hair feels both healthy and clean.Over the years, I have gone to other brands but I always seem to come back to this brand.  This is a good quality clean feeling conditioner without chemicals.Shop around though as you can find the big bottles of these cheaper locally in the big box stores."
1,The aquis microfiber hair towel is the best one on the market....just the right size to wrap around wet hair without it falling off......second one that I have purchased.
1,"This is not a good everyday soap even for someone like me who has a lot of breakouts. But, it is a good soap for really damaged or irritated skin, like sunburn, etc. The name says it all. I just wonder why no one else ever thought to put calamine lotion into soap before this!?!"
1,"This is a great night cream for sensitive skin.  It's not going to take away wrinkles or remove dark spots, but it's so inexpensive that you'll have money left over to spring for the expensive creams."
1,"Excellent product, shipped quickly, and I received exactly what I was expecting.I use this rose water in conjunction with a serum. The serum is great for my skin, but leaves it just a bit tight after it fully absorbs. I apply a bit of the rose water after the serum, and it refreshes, locks in some moisture, and prevents that tight feeling from occurring. Also, smells divine."
1,"I love this mask. I have been using the expensive masks since I was early 20s. But this one is much better than the ones cost me over $80. My friends told me that I look younger than my younger sister now. hehe... I'm using it once a week, my skin tone is more even now and skin feels tighter too. I have been using the rose water as toner, they are great combination. Maybe the rose water is doing a good job too, I love them both."
1,I'm on my second jar.  I could reall see a difference is a few weeks.  I keep using it everyday and continue to see improvement.  I thought it make my face a little red in the beginning but it dosen't do that any more.
0,"I bought these awhile back and wrote a favorable review on them, but they seem to have become useless somehow. I used to get nice bouncy curls, but now the rollers don't hold heat and when I unroll my hair it comes out frizzy, fuzzy and kinky. I was shocked because they used to work so well. I've taken good care of my set, I never leave it on or forget to turn it off for long periods, and I can't imagine it wearing out so quickly, especially because I only use them maybe twice a week. I will not be buying another set, I think I'm going with the BabyLiss hot rollers this time.P.S. They only come with three clips."
1,"I am a big fan of the Obagi skincare products. But to be very honest, as far as any &#34;whitening&#34; goes, I think I had better results with the Obagi C then the Nu-Derm. The scent is exactly the same as the C line. Very clean and refreshing."
1,This feels more moisturizing than plain cocoa butter and feels more compatible with the skin.  It is lightening up some dark spots and I only used it for a couple weeks.  I love it and will continue to use it to see what the benefits are over a longer period of time
0,He said it did absolutely nothing for his skin condition. He does not use it now. Waste of money. He has eczema of the scalp.
0,"I thought we'd upgrade our home clippers and get these since they seemed a little better quality than the ones we already. They did not cut cleanly, I had to go over the same spot many times.  These also vibrated so loudly that it hurt my hubby's hearing and I had to return them."
1,"This is a very nice soap that lathers up very well and makes me feel very clean. My one complaint is that the soap smells a bit funky. I got the peppermint, and while I can definitely smell peppermint, there is an underlying smell that I don't like that takes away from the peppermint. I was hoping for a more pure peppermint smell, but the soap itself works great!"
1,"A gorgeous darker red. I love these shades of red especially for winter season and this is a really nice, beautiful shade of garnet red."
1,"As someone who has battled acne in the past and still gets occasional breakouts, I learned over time that the beauty companies will keep coming out with their new facial cleaners that are supposed to do some new thing that all the other previous facial cleansers didn't do. The cleansers that were advertised as for acne always made my acne worse, especially if they had salicylic acid. This is a basic facial cleanser that does everything you need. Personally I don't want to wash my face every single day with a cleanser full of chemicals. The 6 ounce bar of this is a great value and lasts a long time. The only thing to be careful about with this bar is that it can be a little drying. Make sure you don't use too much, and I always use a moisturizer. I use once a day before bed."
1,I have tried other products in attempt to save money.  They simply don' work as well.  This is a great multi-tasker and will help your mani dry fater as well as keep your polish shiny and looking good.  It is much more tough and seem to prevent chipping better than the cheaper stuff I have tried.  This is well worth the extra money spent.
1,"I have used L'Oreal Preference colors before and have never had a color bleed as long as this one! It took a week and a half for the water to FINALLY run clear in my shower and I spend a lot of time rinsing in general and shower every day. That being said, it's an ok color. It is dark but not as an intense red as I would hope for. Id say it's more of a dark brown/red. It's more of a natural color. I would use it again if I wanted to make less of a statement and just make sure I used a towel for my hair that I don't mind ruining for a while."
1,I love this base coat. You can use it alone to help repair nails after acrylics. It noticeably strengthens the nails and fills in any ridges! I will definitely purchase again!
1,"I like it, I just didn't love it.  I love patchouli, but this smelled alot more like dirt or earthy than I would have liked.  Just a preference.  I loved using it, very fragrant and lathered well.  Kind of an awkward shape.  Next one I might cut in half."
0,"I tried this product after I heard people raving about it and was not pleased at all. It made my skin look very shiny, even after I used the mineral veil. Also it accentuated every little line and pore. I thought it must be my application technique, but tried several times exactly as instruced, it just did not look good. Would not recommend this  product to anyone over 35....(I am 42)"
1,"Nothing is better than to be slapped with bay rum after a hot shave. Well, something is better but I can't say it out loud. But it does involve bodily fluids. Every man should have a bottle of bay rum in their arsenal.Women love bay rum. If she doesn't love it then you need to find a new woman."
1,"I have rosacea, very sensitive dry and acne prone skin. The Vanicream cleansing bar doesn't burn or irritate my skin like so many other cleansers have.  It removes face and eye makeup easily and doesn't leave my skin feeling tight and dry.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  I have been using for a week and my skin is clearing up and healing up."
1,"These are impossible to find in drugstore, don't know why. They are the ONLY sponges that distribute foundation evenly and smoothly though imo."
1,"My 92 year old mom was offended by this.She couldn't figure out what to do with it!Said it was cheap. disgusting and smelled like rotten flesh.Said she would never talk to me again!And it only cost me less than $7 bucks,to get her to shut the hell up!  :-)"
1,"I foolishly sandpapered my fingers to get rid of hard skin and they ended up with cracks in them that were bleeding, I couldn't pick anything up, my fingers were so sore.  After using the cream for one day the pain has gone, I can pick things up and the cracks are healing beautifully.  I would recommend this cream to everyone who has sore hands.It is indeed a miracle cream that does what it says!!!!"
1,I have had this color before and it is one of two standard colors for me.  OPI keeps colors around so I do not have to annual find a new reds.  Seller was easy to work with and I received this polish very promptly.
1,"Covers great, smooth, glassy appearance. Dries almost instantly, even on multiple coats of polish. Am buying this again. This is my new go to quick dry top coat!"
1,The original Norwegian Formula hand cream rivals the original European Nivea cream. This was a perfect winter hand cream that wasn't as turbo-greasy as Aquaphor but rich enough for chronically dry/cracked hands.
0,If you are truly sensitive to scents do not buy this as it has a noticeable scents and is not returnable.  Plus it is quite expensive for hair spray.
1,"It didn't work for me, but I could see how it would for others.  It certainly tasted bad, I just couldnt get it concentrated enough to matter."
1,These are perfect and gentle enough to use in place of facial scrubs. I cut these in half and use them once a week or so just as if I was using a facial scrub.
1,"I really like the ingredients in this product and the fact that a little goes a long way. What I do is pour some of the face wash into a small hand sprayer and when I get in the shower I "" mist "" my body from head to toe and then proceed to wash. It leaves your skin soft, and you know you're clean and the tea tree in it is an antibiotic for the skin."
0,I bought this for all the amazing reviews. I don't like it at all and will not buy again. Does not moisture. Squirts and is too watery!
1,"This washes your dog , yes, but that's it. There's no lingering scent of lavender OR mint or any particular softness afterwards either. My groomer has a secret shampoo OR conditioner and I'd love to know what it is."
1,"I love Bare Mineral products. They stay on forever and never look too powdery. I also love the eyeliner, brushes and well rested really works well!!"
1,"This is a good, softening lotion.  It seems to have a bit more staying power than some I've tried.  The one possible negative is the scent.  If you do not like the Tea Tree smell, you will not like it because it has a very strong smell that lingers.  Other than that, it is a viable option for keeping dry skin soft and smooth."
1,"This is one of the most potent tea tree oil's I've ever used. I use this tea tree oil to kill acne, I take a cotton swab, dip it into the bottle and apply it directly to acne and the acne will disappear within 2-3 days. I also put this tea tree oil in a homemade mouthwash that I make, I mix 1 cap full in a 32oz bottle of water and salt, it winds up being a lot more potent than commercial grade mouthwashes. This tea tree oil is extremely potent, most folks may need to dilute it before applying it to their skin so be careful before applying.PROS:- Very high quality, strongCONS:- None that I can think of.Country of Origin: Australia"
0,"I agree with the other reviewers in that this product used to have a light, wonderful lavender scent.  Now it has more of a Pine-Sol cleaning smell scent to it, and it smells more like Rosemary than Lavender.  :("
1,"I &lt;3 Fallene's Total Block UVA/UVM sunblock!!  I've been using it for a little over two years now.  I have slightly acne prone skin and this is one of the few sunblocks/sun protection lotions that does NOT cause me to break out at all - regardless of how sweaty or oily I may get while I am wearing this.  The sunblock is super thick and requires a decent amount of shaking before application in order to mix the fluids.  As other reviewers have stated, this sunblock DOES leave a pasty film - it definitely lightens/whitens my skin while I am wearing it.  However, I actually really like this effect (particularly as an Asian-American woman). :)  There isn't really any smell to the sunblock, which is also nice and makes the lotion even more wearable.  My only complaint is that, the sunblock is so heavy and thick that I have to wipe my eyebrows after application; otherwise, my eyebrows will also be lightly tinted / paler.  Also, if I do happen to sweat a lot while wearing this, sometimes little pale-ish white (albeit, translucent) beads will run down my face because the sweat is mixing with the sunblock.  Not the prettiest effect but, this really only happens when I am at the gym and sweating profusely.  I highly recommend this sunblock if you're looking for a heavy-duty sunblock that will not break you out."
1,"muy buen producto lleg&oacute; sin problemas y sin defectos, el empaque fue apropiado y no tenia problemas visibles, en lo personal lo recomiento 100%"
1,"This stuff is great.  It doesn't dry out my skin, it doesn't have harsh chemicals.  I wouldn't say I have acne, but I get really big pimples once in a while I get lots of black head and other little zits.  My facialist turned me onto Clear Skin and I love it.  I realized that Amazon is cheaper then buying it anywhere else.  This keeps my breakouts at bay."
1,"Would have given it a 5 but it doesn't have have instant heat and the automatic turn-off [a very nice feature] sometimes turns off before I'm finished. I've had it 2 months and find it to be a nice size for my semi-short hair. It is easy to use, does the job and doesn't tangle. I recommend it -- but buy it on sale."
1,My hair feels fresh and hydrated right after using this conditioner. But doesn't last too long. My hair feels dry again before the end of the day.
1,I used to use this as a teenager but for some reason stopped. I've been using covergirl foundation over olay face cream for years but for some reason my face started breaking out recently. So I bought a bottle of this and my face cleared right up and I don't even need the olay cream because this cold cream moisturizes my face plenty
1,I have been using these pads for quite some time now. I use the soft side of the pad and literally use them every day. If I run out and have to skip a day my face feels dirty. I love the softness and overall texture of my skin after using this product. I really hope they never discontinue them. A must have product and an awesome price!
1,"CK One a clean and fresh fragrance with a mild floral basenotes.  There are similar fragrances out there, but One is masculine enough that men can freely wear...My reviews generally consider the following areas that are important to me: appeal and uniqueness of the scent (i.e. easy on the nose); ""wow factor"" (compliments), projection/sillage, longevity, appropriate season and event for fragrance; quality and/or uniqueness of bottle and packaging (i.e. easy on the eyes); and, the price/value of fragrance.While not totally inclusive, my evaluation of CK One is as follows (scoring is out of 5 stars - 1 star is low, 3 is average, and 5 stars is best):Appeal/Uniqueness of Scent: 4Wow Factor:  4Projection: 4Longevity: 4Appropriate season/event for fragrance: 4Quality/design of bottle and packaging: 5Price/Value: 5Total Points:  30 pointsAverage Score: 4.18 starsComments: The real beauty of CK One is the flexibility or versatility.

1,"I've been buying Camille Beckman ever since I lived in Eagle, Idaho.  An 8oz jar lasts for a few years.  The consistency is thick, the lotion smells amazing, and it's a great product."
1,"I have always had very sensitive skin but lucky that my only outbreaks were hormonal and not chronic.  I haven't always been so kind to my skin, sleeping in my makeup during my wild youth and perhaps no so wild youth, but now I'm trying to stick to a regimen that's simple and effective.Enter this wonderful product.  After washing my face, when it's still just slightly dewy and completely clean, I do one pearl of serum in my hand and then dot it under my eyes, between my brows, along those 'Howdy Doody' smile lines that eventually catch up to us as we get older, and then I work it in all over my face.A little goes a very long way and it soaks into my skin almost instantly, so there isn't that oily or heavy feeling that some moisturizers can leave behind making you worry that you'll pick up pillow case lint after you go to bed.The fragrance is light, citrusy, and it gives me a little aroma-reminder that I have done something good for my skin.  When I get up in the morning my face is so soft and fresh looking, no oily look left behind and it doesn't cause my own natural oils to become a problem.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a simple regimen that produces clear results in no time at all."
1,"For some stupid reason it never occurred to me that a brush could make that much difference when it came to blow-drying my hair.  For years I used the same plastic bristle metal barrel round brush from Conair.  That was dumb and probably terrible for my hair.  This brush is MUCH, much better.  It grips my hair nicely, seems to make it a bit shinier, and I think it's obviously better for my hair than my old one, which is now going in the trash.  I debated a bit about what size to get, but I'm glad I went with the 2-inch.  Works great for my bangs and roots alike.  HIGHLY recommend this brush."
1,"I've been using Jason's products for over ten years and this is one of my favorite hand soaps. I like it because unlike other hand soaps this doesn't dry out my skin. It also has comforting ingredients like aloe, lavender and chamomile. For those who care about such things this product doesn't contain any petrolatum, sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates. Give this a try I'm sure you will love it.~The Rebecca Review"
1,"I used this product throughout high school when it first came out and could only be purchased by mail. The first model required the use of salt; however, this model does not require the use of salt, but works just as well. With this newer model there is no chance of being burned since the water at the bottom of the reservoir is not hot at all like in the older model, in which the water would be boiling hot by the time you emptied it unless you waited for it to cool off.For my short somewhat pixi hair style, I use 6 jumbo rollers, 3 large, and 2 medium rollers to set my hair. These are the perfect sized rollers for my layered hairstyle. This roller set gives my hair so much body and fullness. Sometimes, my curls can last for two full days.You can't go wrong with this product. If you use it as much as I do (3-5 times a week). You may want to get new rollers in about 3 months just to keep the shape of the rollers full.Also, on days that my hair looks over-processed, or dry. After using my Caruso I notice that my hair looks very moisturized, shiny and healthy. It looks like brand new hair. I just love this hair setter and I've used the Caruso for almost 20 years."
1,"This soap make my skin soft and doesn't dry it out. That is exactly what it says it will do, so I'm happy. I've use the &#34;calming&#34; lavender and ylang ylang version and like the fragrance of that better than this unscented version though. I thought I'd try this one but, surprised myself by liking the one with the scent. Not usually like me. I really like these Aveeno products over any bar soap anytime."
1,"This is a 5 star scent, but it gets 1 star for longevity.  Upon initial application, it smells wonderful - the citrus is very light and sweet.  But sniff quickly - it begins to fade to nothingness quickly.  If you want a fruity citrus scent to last for a while, look elsewhere (Chanel, Hermes, etc.).  But for the short while it lasts, it is quite nice.Clinique should really consider making a loner lasting EdP version of this - I would certainly consider getting a bottle of that.  But this one, while I dont regret owning it, I would not re-purchase."
0,I have to be honest and say I haven't noticed a difference using this night cream. Maybe others have a different results but my pores and skin look the same. Its a nice cream but no real changes folks.
1,I have been using the product for at least five years and it really has kept my skin in tip top shape. It smells so good and really does moisturize and lock in the hydrating power of your moisturizer. Just something to freshen the skin and add to your beauty arsenal as a must have staple. Perfect!
1,"I'm in my mid-twenties and have never truly dyed my hair. I started getting white hairs toward the front of my head and didn't want to start dyeing my hair just for a few strands of white. This crayon works really well and covers the white hair. It does have a strong smell, but I haven't noticed it once I color my hair. It's not like I can smell it all day. I'd definitely purchase another one of these in the future."
1,"This Conair hot brush has so much quality built in at a sper low price.  Even auto-shut-off!Great size for short to median hair or just curly styles.  Many heat temp selections sogentle on hair.  Use on DRY hair !  Heats fast, easy to hold without burning fingers.Better than curling iron because it grips the hair easily.  Same results, but much faster.Leaves hair super shiny as the barrel is ceramic.  Nothing else on the market that has this muchquality at such a low, low price.VERY, VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER !!!"
1,"These headbands are the only ones made with plastic that really are comfortable. The fabric/ribbon-like headbands don't stay in place nor do the headbands without teeth; these have teeth that don't dig into your scalp. These headbands can also be worn comfortably with glasses on. As a person with chronic headaches, I just stopped using headbands for awhile but I took a chance, ordered them, and am happy I did."
1,"I am a big clean freak when it comes to removing make-up or cleansing my face.This cleanser is a standard cleanser that I keep available at all times.After a wash, your face feels moisturized and soft. The scent is really mild and nice.This cleanser does not lather though.  If you are a foam cleanser person, this is not a cleanser that you will like.If you wear a non-waterproof mascara, this cleanser will clean your lashes as well. (not so much for waterproof mascara)Very good product! Will buy more again :)"
1,"This is the stuff. And as pointed out by another reviewer, SPF 25 would definitely be a better precaution than 15 but this moisturiser is so good otherwise I can overlook it for now. The main aspect of it that appeals to me is that the product actually stays on the skin and keeps moisturising all day. On a face as dry as mine is that is a rare accomplishment. Other creams bite the dust in a few hours on me.A reliable product that does what it claims to do at an especially good price."
1,I use this on my scalp everyday lightly and i have seen growth my hair is growing fast with this oil and its thick so it lasts a very long time. It doesn't smell great but it doesn't stink either it made my hair thicker and longer and its a great price for that size.
1,"UPDATE: Since discovering Nail Tek II, I switched over to it instead. Nailtiques gets gummy in the bottle too fast. Nail Tek II can be found at Sally Beauty, Sephora, etc. I like it very much and it's very effective. Doesn't peel off either!I've used this for years. My hands are in water a lot, and I have just awful nail problems if I don't use this.  They are naturally thin and peel without protection. If it weren't for this product, I wouldn't have nails at all.Tried other products over the years, and many work initially, but then overall dry out the nails so badly, I end up with a bigger problem. I thought Nail Magic would be the answer (bought it at Sally Beauty). The nails initially grew, but over time became brittle due to whatever was in that product. I then started breaking nails often and realized it had to be that product.***switched to Nail Tek II now.  No peeling or breakage and no gummy product in the bottle. ***"
1,"recommend- strong, fresh scent.  Good lather.  Good moisturizing effect.  All natural ingredients.  Only drawback is the price, but this is a high quality soap, so one expects to pay more for this quality.  Dr. Bronner soap comes in several scents which is also a plus."
1,"This brush overall is wonderful, the only thing i have to say about it, is that while you are turning the brush (like you would to straighten your hair with a round brush)the hair gets cought in the handle, and it hurts :( I own many other branded round brushes, and this has never happened!!But overall it's light weight and easy to use."
1,"DML Daily Facial Moisturizer, SPF 25 - 1.5 oz is an alright product, still hooked on Skin Ceuticals, Olay ProX, ROC, and Boots No 7 products, but glad I tried it.  It is a light moisturizer which does moisturize."
0,Ive been using this for about 2 months and i dont really see a difference. I think this smell is horrible. Very chemical and gross. Also i believe this formula is too liquidy. Hardly a a conditioner. I shouldnt have believed all the hype and wasted $17 on this.
1,This is perfect powder over my foundation.  It sets it perfectly and it lasts all day!  It is not cakey and it feels like you have nothing on.  You will not be disappointed.
1,"I thought those 11's between my brows were here to stay..seeing that I developed them from over 15 years of suffering from migraines, but after one week they are barely noticeable.  I naturally, was also using anti wrinkle products in addition to these but before I got the FROWNIES here ( BTW best price on the web) I was using the anti wrinkle products alone &  wasn't seeing any results!  I'm so glad I leaned about these in one of my searches!"
1,"Slight irritation when using it, but it goes away. It seems to be a strong cream but feels good. Not greasy. I feel like this is working in combination with the St. Ives timeless moisturizer."
1,"I have owned the same curling iron for several years, and when it broke I looked for a replacement, this I thought would be it, but Revlon has not made it the same way and it doesn't curl my hair like how the first one did, why couldn't they keep it the same way."
1,This was my first Hugo Boss perfume and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. The fragrance is very refreshing and I enjoy using this perfume. Will be coming back for more in the future for sure.
1,"Maybe it's the rose scent, maybe it is the fancy old time label. I don't know. All I know is that I wish this stuff came in a gallon sized jug. It smells amazing, and it is refreshing and moisturizing. Love Love Love!"
0,Brush snapped in half after less than two weeks of use...right where the handle joins the brush head.  Would not recommend.
0,"I should have listened to the reviewers who have complained about the smell.  I can't quite describe it.  It's almost a strong chemical smell.  If you live in or have ever been in Southern California, we have a ""stink weed"" that is very pungent and smells very strong but artificial.  It's almost like that strong chemical stink weed smell.  When I put this on my face in the morning, I have to quickly put an Aveda moisturizing lotion over it just to tolerate the smell otherwise I smell that stinky chemical smell ALL DAY.  Since I really haven't noticed anything as far as an improvement in my skin or complextion and I really don't have major wrinkles to see an improvement, I will never buy this product again.  I'd rather buy something that smells better that offers moisturizing components.  Plus, with this product, it's rather thin and doesn't feel like it really absorbs into the skin.  It's not thick.  (I hate thick greasy products and this doesn't fall into that category so that's a plus I guess.)  It seems too thin like they put too much water in as a base.  Overall the smell ruins the product and if it actually improved the skin, maybe it would be worth the sacrafice.  Since it does nothing for the skin, why suffer with the smell when there are hundreds of other facial products that are much better?"
1,"I have always loved Nars and this color appears perfect w/a beautiful shimmer, but the pigment is very light...I have fair skin and can not get it to show, even after using multiple applicators."
1,"This product works great for me. I normally have an oily, itchy scalp with buildup, and I notice that I have no itching afer using the T/Sal for a month. I wash first with Nature's Gate Tea Tree shampoo, then wash once with T/Sal (leaving on for several minutes), then condition with Nature's Gate Tea Tree conditioner.I initially bought both the T/Sal and T/Gel, so I used the T/Gel last night, and I notice I have a little itching today. I will update my review after I've used the bottle, but I already prefer the T/Sal.Update: after using the T/Gel for a few weeks, I do not have itching, but I have a dry, flaky scalp, which I did not have before. I will gladly be switching back to T/Sal."
1,"Crabtree & Evelyn Gardener's Hand Therapy has been my favorite lotion for many years.  While I don't have a problem with very dry skin, I still like a good, non-greasy lotion for my hands, arms, feet, and sometimes even my face.  This product is not greasy.  It does not have an annoying fragrance, actually not much at all.  My sister-in-law told me she uses it on her psoriasis and it helps.  It's not a cure, of course.  There really isn't one.  But it helps the skin feel better.  Since she liked it so much, I tried it and have been using it ever since.  It's hard to find in stores---almost impossible---but Amazon.com carries it.  Thanks again, Amazon."
1,"I have been trying lots of these facial products that are sold at CVS/Walmart type stores. So far, Olay and Aveeno are the only brands that consistently work. The effects of this serum are very subtle, but they ARE noticeable. It tends to just soften the look of your skin over all, and while it doesnt affect deep wrinkles, it does help minimize smaller ones. I also have skin that is very prone to break outs, and this has amazingly never caused any! Over all, for me it is definitely worth the money."
1,I am very happy with this nail polish. I also bought the purple opi nail polish then put this silver shatter over it and it looked amazing! The silver is almost more of a shiny/glittery silver and it crackles just like it states and show's in the photo. Just make sure you let it dry really good! I bumped and messed up 2 nails because it wasn't completely dry but to be honest you couldn't tell because it had that crackle effect therefore hiding the flaws I made. Would recommend and would buy again!
1,Tried it on my granddaughter to test it out and it works fine.  I need to wait until my hair grows out a bit to use it.  Think it's easier to use on long hair.
1,"like others have said, the quality of the cardboard piece in the middle has cheapened...it's a bit more flexible and less durable. That said, they are still 10 times better than any generic brand q-tip, so there is no way I'll be switching for now."
1,"I love this stuff. It's mildly scented, a little goes a long way, and it does a great job of removing makeup and thoroughly cleaning my skin. You can't ask for more than that."
1,"I used EcoStyler Gel and it didn't work for me. Fantasia IC  does a great job.  It doesn't make my hair hard or straw-like either.  I have 3c/4a/3b, low porosity, dry, medium/fine mixture.  Fantasia gives me a medium-soft set that can be styled further if you like."
1,"As I'm getting closer to 30, my skin is changing and so are my skin's wants/needs. Aside from the occasional breakout, my skin is clear and all I use is tinted moisturizer to even it out. I have several powder blushes that I like the color of, but they all streak when applied to a dewey tinted moisturizer.I'd been on the hunt for years (literally) for a liquid tint, cream blush or blush stick that could look completely natural. Benetint was too bright pink and hard to apply.... Tarte's cheek stain didn't last longer than if I'd instead applied cherry Chapstick to my cheeks. But then one day, I found myself wandering around to every counter checking for a product I had almost given up looking for when, finally, I came across the Nars part of Sephora and saw blush sticks. It was peachy/rosy with a hint of gold sparkle... and dewey versus oily (which means it could cause breakouts and slide off your face at the end of the day)--- it was ""Maui"".My skin is VERY fair, and maui seemed like it might be too dark until I tested it on the back of my hand... it's actually really sheer at first! You'll have to add extra applications/layers for dramatic effect. Otherwise it's very natural looking.It was blendable, highly pigmented and it lasted all day in 80 degree Florida heat/humidity. It also didn't make me break out with was a HUGE plus! There are not enough good things I can say about this product, so buy it and enjoy! This product is wonderful!!!"
1,"It's sooo inexpensive, feels great on your face, and you'll see results instantly.I use this mask 3 times a week and it really rejuvenates it! I don't generally have problem skin, but I just do it as a refresher and my boyfriend notices after I use it!One tube is actually huge and will last you a long time."
1,Ralph Lauren's Ralph is one of the best perfumes i have EVER bought! It not only smells GREAT but the bottle is absolutley charming.  It is worth every penny because it really DID stay on all day! I reccomend you buy it as soon as possible.
1,"I love PCA and this is the only product that I am not 100% excited about.I use it after cleansing (and applying my toner, etc) and it burns after application every time :(  In addition, I am not seeing any marked improvement in lightening my dark spots."
1,"As a lifelong resident of Florida, at 51 I have skin that's decorated with many, many sun spots.  My arms and legs are especially affected by the spots and I've been self-conscious about them for years.  I've been very happy with the Alpha Hydrox cream for my face so I decided to try the lotion on my arms and legs.I've been using it now for about 6 weeks and the change in my skin's appearance is fantastic!  The spots will never go away, but they are much, much fainter and less noticeable.  Overall the skin is smoother and softer and just looks and feels much better.I use this most evenings, putting it on my arms and legs while I watch TV.  I wait anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and then put on a regular moisturizing lotion.  I've read warnings that the AHA will cause the skin to be more susceptible to sunburning, so I've been careful to use a body lotion with SPF 15 every morning since starting this routine.  I have no idea if the AHA really makes sunburning more likely, or if the SPF lotion is making any difference, but my skin looks and feels great so I'm happy.If you have sensitive skin and haven't used AHA products before you might want to start out with a 8% solution and work your way up, but I haven't had any reaction to this lotion.  If I have a fresh scratch or boo-boo it might sting a little when I first put it on, but that's it.  I very highly recommend this product for anybody who wants smoother, better-looking skin!"
1,I am not sure what the secret is but I have seen results. I take very good care of my skin but I live in Colorado and  the weather is dry and toll taking. I did see more resilience after just a few applications. It works best for me on clean toned skin. Skin looks tighter and no makeup (foundation) is needed (most days).  i do apply an appropriate layer of  sunscreen over it. Will buy again.
1,Great product and reduces fine lines. SPF 15 is an added benefit. Have been using for years. Works just as well as higher priced lotions at half the price.
1,Great face mask at an excellent price. me and my better half both this on weekends for a mental health pamper session. Stings a bit but feel like its doing a good job. I just bought the olive oil mask and will update what happens.
1,"Fantastic, gentle, milky product. Gets off all traces of makeup and dirt without stripping the skin. My mother even uses this now!"
0,"I almost can't believe the positive reviews here, but then I remember everything doesn't work for everyone. I used this cream everyday three times a day for a couple of months with no results. On top of that its very greasy so I didn't want it anywhere near my face."
1,"At first I thought this was something just for the face, but I quickly learned when I perused the back label that this is for the body as well and can be used on babies. This is meant to retain needed moisture and I notice immediately a glistening on one arm when I compared both arms.This can be used while in the shower and rinse off after applying and rubbing gently. I prefer to use the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser without water. The cleanser is a clear/off white gel type of texture that rubs into the skin with a light lather. There is no scent evident when squeezed into the hand or rubbed into the skin. With a cloth you can easily remove the excess, while leaving a thin film on the skin. There is no tight feeling to the skin, just soft and smoothness.The gel cleanser is not gooey to touch and works rather quickly in obtaining clean skin for the entire body. I prefer to use it on my hands and legs and sometimes go for the face. This is much better than using soap on my sensitive skin and leaves it moist and almost glowing.The bottle is clear so you can see when you are low and plan on restocking. I have some left still since I do not use it on a daily basis. The problem I have is the bottle is too large to fit someplace where I can remember it and see it daily in the bathroom, so it is confined to the bottom cabinet below the sink and it gets pushed back when new items are placed there.The statement on the bottle of Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser states, Softens As It Cleanses, one that I totally agree with and can attest to as an eczema sufferer."
1,"I've used it once after a shampoo and reconstructor (same brand).  It was lightweight and didn't leave any residue like others have done.  The scent could be better.  It's watery like other reviewers have stated, but mine came in a spray bottle. I air dried my hair in a wrap.  My hair didn't burn at medium-high temperature with a Ceramic Tools flat iron.  Hope this helps!"
1,"I received a sample of this from another online retailer awhile back and I love it! The Intensive Formula is really rich so I use it at night like a repair cream, then in the morning I use the regular MLE Face Cream. Atopalm is great not only for people with sensitive skin but for those with sensitive eyes. Usually fragrance is the culprit in skincare products that irritate my eyes but even fragrance free ones have made my eyes water. Atopalm hasn't made me shed a tear! Love this stuff!"
1,I even use Alpha Hydros Foaming Face Wash  to remove my mascara at night.  It cleans my face without being harsh.
1,"I recently had a bad case of hives from an allergic reaction to a medicine.This product helped a lot in the short run, which was worth quite a bit. Cooling and soothing. However, I found that after a couple of applications over the course of half a day or so, the product buildup became an irritant in itself, and I had to shower and remove it, which I didn't necessarily feel well enough to want to do. I didn't have that problem with aloe vera gel.However, this product contains a mild local anesthetic, so it may be more helpful for some things. I didn't think of the aloe vera gel until the hives had improved somewhat, so it may not have compared as well in the beginning.I'd buy this again, but I sure hope I don't need to."
1,"I'm a big fan of Acquarella since it's (from what I know) the most natural nail polish on the market (as natural as painting colors on your nails can be, hah).  This conditioner is great to put on the naked nail for a pretty shine or over a different aquarella color to seal.Love it!"
1,"Lush is an amazing bath store near my house, but sometimes it's easier to order from here.  the sex bath bomb is not to be missed, as it is sexy, silky, luxurious, with a lovely scent that lasts on your skin and lingers in the bathroom for a whole day.  just pop one in and it immediately fizzes open for bath time enjoyment."
1,"I buy this product all the time because the shade is so natural and pretty. Also nobody except me seems to notice when my silver roots start showing. I get lots of compliments about my hair and other ladies at my salon have asked what I use, much to the annoyance of my hairdresser (who is also the owner. Heh heh) so yes I would def recommend it ."
1,"I've loved and used Olay Regenerist for a few years now -- the fragrance and the feel of it on my skin was a daily little luxury.  Recently though, after giving myself a mini-peel to freshen my skin, I found the Olay Regenerist stung a bit when I applied it.  So I gave the fragrance-free version of Olay Regenerist a try and found it was quite soothing to my drying, flaking skin.  I think I'll stick with the fragrance-free version from now on, though I really did like the scent of the regular Olay Regenerist.No matter which one you try, I don't think you can find a better facial moisturizer."
1,"Bought this today at Publix (our local grocery) on clearance for $8.00.  I really didnt need a sunscreen, just a tinted moisturizer as I dont like to wear foundation in Fla. in the hot humid season.  I read the other reviews and (1) The texture is due to the spf30 and quickly absorbs into the skin.  (2) Dont buy this if you have very dry skin as it is a lighweight moisturizer.  The fair to light works fine for me."
1,"I like the color, its a good fall color and looks good on my fair skin tone, happy with my purchase"
1,Somone recommended me this comb as i'm not going natural. it's good but nothing great as my hair is between coarse and soft...don't know what you would call that but it hurts going throuh my hair
1,"I love this stuff. Rose water and witch hazel without alcohol, you can't do better for you skin. The only complaint I have is the price. Normally Amazon is comparable if not a deal but it is even cheaper at the Thayers site and other sites have it for $6-7. I buy mine at a local drugstore for $6.50 in San Francisco. I love Amazon especially the convenience but I can't imagine paying almost double. Maybe the intended to sale 2 at this price and there was a typo?"
1,"I am only 34, but I am a very hormonal gal and have always suffered from severe PMS, menstrual migraines and hot flashes.  I was searching for something to take to help my severe PMS mood swings and decided to try this.  Not only did it help that, but I was completely blown away by the impact it has on my energy level!  Instead of feeling tired most of the time, when I take this product I wake up feeling ready to go.  I wasn't sure at first if I could giv e all the credit to this cream, so I stopped taking it for a month.  I went back to my 'slump,' and when I resumed taking it, it had the same effect again.  I can tell if I miss a day.  I don't know how it will work for anyone else, but I wanted to share this and maybe help some other woman because this cream has become a very important part of my daily routine!  It also has greatly reduced my night sweats I used to have right at ovulation and prior to my period."
1,"I've been replacing other cleaners in my life with natural, safe ones and had yet to find a face wash suitable for me.  I have acne-prone skin.  While the sun and my diet naturally help me to keep them at bay, I do get a few once in awhile.  So I just opted for this after reading a few reviews.  I followed what one reviewer said about putting it in a bottle that helps to foam it and making it 1:1 (1 soap: 1 water).  I happened to find a sore throat spray container.  I emptied out the leftover medicine and am using it for this.  Works great!  The price is good considering how long it will last."
1,"I've been using this product for about 2 months now. I try to use it 7 days a week, once in the morning and evening but that doesn't always happen. I'm using it to fade acne scars on lighter skinned african-american skin (similar shade to beyonce). I've noticed a huge improvement on the acne scars that I have had for years.the one con is that this product stinks. :( but you are only using this product for a couple of minutes a day so you can suck it up and deal with it.you don't have to use a whole lot of this product at all. a little bit goes a long way so you could have it for several months. i would say that theres at least 95% of the product left after having it for 2 months."
1,I'm hooked. I've tried so many toners out there and none works as well as this. Makes my skin feel so soft and it just leaves a fresh feel. Highly recommend it!
1,I've been using this product for about a month now. I am very happy with the results. I've had some drying/peeling but I got it under control switching to a gentle face foam cleaner (Olay) with a facial loofah pad instead of my Neutrogena soap bar. I have a very oily T-zone with large pores. I'm 44 and have hormonal chin breakouts monthly. Afirm has really smoothed my skin and balanced the color tone very well. Also my pore size is smaller (or less noticeable). I still apply a very light dab of benzoyl peroxide my chin nightly for the breakouts after using Afirm. I also like the fact that you can get the grade that you need and go stronger slowly. I think the price is great compared to most and does the same job.
1,"I have been using this for about 10 years now and I really love it! I usually buy it at Walmart because I can get the enormous jar for a pretty good price. I have always had pretty clear, dry skin so this moisturizer is perfect for me!"
1,"I bought this to use in my hair but also use it on my skin as well. It has no smell that I can decern. It arrived cloudy and semi-solid. My first thought was that the stuff was defective After looking this up online, it turns out that is normal when it is below room temperature (it was a cold day). Just holding the bottle in my hand made it turn to an oil again.When my hair was a little longer, I would sometimes use a couple of drops in it to a little more manageable and give it that feel of not having been washed for a day or so. I'd imagine that using more would make a nice treatment for hair if you weren't going anywhere and could wash it out later.After getting my hair cut short I started trying it on my skin, and it makes a really nice, non greasy moisturizer. A little goes a long way."
1,I absolutely love this cleanser its so gentle on my skin. I had a little bit of breakout near my lower jaw and overnight the redness and little bumps were reduced. My face feels so smooth and silky. Did not irritate my skin. Would highly recommend!!
1,Fantastic product love how you can subscribe and get even a better deal this is a very good product will continue to have it automatically sent to my home with is great price and quick service.
1,"Mild pleasant skin fresher-upper. And it seems gentle enough for the under-eye area. I Didn't notice any therapeutic effects, however."
1,Lovely scent in a generous size for a wonderful price makes this superior smelling product a must have for the lover of all things lavender.
1,"I love blackberries and that is what this scent smells like.  I'm very sensitive to scents and get headaches if something is too chemical.  ""Falling in Love"" never affects me that way.  It's light and natural smelling.  I wish they'd come up with a better name however. Despite the silly name this is a simple yet sophisticated scent."
0,Bought his lip moisturizer based on reviews.  I personally did not like anything about this lip moisturizer.  It has a silicone feel to it and had to reapply all day long.  I went though a whole tube in 1 week.  Gave the other one away.  I will go back to eos (http://www.amazon.com/Sweet-Mint-Organic-Balm-Sphere/dp/B003ND183O/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid=1364137223&sr=8-10&keywords=eos+lip+balm) which is wax based lip balm but it does the job and love the sweet minty flavor and it lasts forever.
1,"I love the smell of this.  This shower gel/shampoo smells just like a cantaloupe- very fresh and summery.  The formula is luxurious- it's very rich and thick, and bubbles up well in to a moisturizing lather.  I'm a big fan of Philosophy's 3-in-1 line, and I really like this scent in particular."
1,Does what it says it will do. I love this product! Shrinks my pores as well. Overall this is greatness in an 8 ounce bottle.:)
1,Natural Dark Blonde is so pretty.  This is very close to my natural color and I'm trying to go back there.  The color isn't mono-tonal like many other box colors.  It has highs and lows and looks natural.  I don't have any red undertones in my hair so I can't speak for brassiness.
1,I just  got my Egyptian Goddess roll on today and it smells divine. I already  got compliments on it when  I went out earlier. I will be buying  more :)
1,"I've been using Mrs Meyers Clean Day products for over a year now and love them all.The dishsoap is gentle on my hands. I've tried all of the scents but basil has been my favorite so far.This soap is not a big sudser.  I suggest to refrain from adding more than necessary to get more suds. A little goes a long way. I made this error when I first tried the brand and even though I rinsed my dishes well, I could taste the soap in some of the cups.  I do not recommend tasting it!  However, for cleaning, I give it 5-stars."
1,"This is a great value and offers great protection.I have very fair skin and I'm often frustrated when selecting moisturizers... anything above SPF 15 is either expensive or just regular, old sunblock.And then I found this! It's reasonably priced and offers SPF 30. Even more importantly, it's &#34;broad spectrum&#34;, which means it protects from rays that cause sunburn AND wrinkles and cancer. (Although BEWARE: Eucerin's similarly packaged body lotion with SPF 15 is NOT broad spectrum - BAD EUCERIN!)Previously, I used Olay, but couldn't find a higher SPF.I have VERY sensitive skin. Derms always recommend Cetaphil at the bargain end for skin like mine, and that even gave me a terrible rash. Even around the eye area, I'm able to use this moisturizer with no clogged pores or irritation.It's the best I've tried and I've tried all the usual drugstore suspects. I hope it stays on shelves for a long time!"
1,"I have some dry patches no moisturizer seemed to be able to control over the course of a day.  I know this is a night cream, however, I've been using it in the day mixed in with my sunblock and it lasts all day.  I haven't seen those dry patches in the last month or so since I started using it.  I don't know about wrinkle control just yet but I does work very well for me as a moisturizer.  It does have a scent to it, I don't consider it offensive but I grew up in a time when most beauty products had some scent to them some more than others so I don't mind it.  It doesn't linger."
1,I believe that Progesterone Cream really works. When I was younger I used this cream to eliminate the discomfort from fibroids in my Uterus.
1,"I bought these rollers to compliment my full Conair set that I use all the time.  I thought these were the big daddy's that would give me full wavy volume.  However, these are the same size as my OTHER rollers.  So, now I have several of the same size, and another container to store.  I'll keep them, maybe use them when I'm traveling, but not what I expected."
1,"Neutrogena's Pore Refining Cleanser is actually a wonderful 1 Step Cleanse/Exfoliate/Refine product that is perfect for traveling. Why take three products when one will work very well. In fact, my husband brought this product home when I asked him to buy me a similar product and I'm even more impressed with the Alpha and Beta Hydroxy Formula than any of the formulas with Benzoyl Peroxide.While I'm only testing this product at home, studies have shown that a combination of glycolic and salicylic acid is more effective than benzoyl peroxide. I read about it after I tried this product so my short time of personal experience proved the study was quite correct. Glycolic Acid is also found in many products sold to you by your Esthetician and it is known for stimulating collagen and elastin. It will even help to reduce acne scars and will keep dead skin cells from building up inside the hair follicles. Glycolic will also help the skin not to grow over the pores and so it prevents ingrown hairs. This product will be especially enjoyed by men who shave. Women will enjoy this product as it may prevent hormonal breakouts.This product contains ""Glycolic Acid"" which seems to prevent problems and is derived from fruit, whereas Benzoyl Peroxide has to fix the problems caused by a lack of exfoliation. So, using a product with Glycolic Acid seems to keep my skin exfoliated. While there are gentle microbeads, you don't really feel them and this is much more like a facial gel wash than an abrasive cleanser.This product impressed me so much I even sent a tube to a friend in the mail. Not something I'd normally do unless I was very impressed.For even better results, try a cream with Glycolic Acid or look for Vital Sciences Glycolic Liquid Exfoliator or Skin Eternal DMAE Serum. There are also quite a few Glycolic moisturizers for face and body from Peter Thomas Roth and Reviva. I also love the Derma E Glycolic Facial Cleanser.If you use a product with Glycolic Acid and one of the Derma E skin care creams or the Kiss My Face Under Age Organic Moisturizer, you should notice a much clearer complexion.Other essentials include:Derma E Tea Tree and E oilKiss My Face Acne GelAroma Land Problem Skin Blend - Essential oilDerma E Alpha Lipoderm with Green TeaDerma E Age-Defying Day CremeDerma E Clear Skin 2D'Arcy Drying LotionZia Sulphur MaskZia Papaya PeelDerma E Microdermabrasion ScrubJoey Pure Pores~The Rebecca Review"
1,I cannot get enough of OLAY. I love this product and it deliver what it does to your skin. I am not the only one using it but my husband too. it really help deter fine lines from coming out so soon.You can rest assured I will be buying this again.
1,"So I recently wrote a bad review for this because my skin would feel tight after using it. I was using Aveeno Clear Complexion moisturizer at the time. I have very dry & very sensitive skin so I decided to try Cerave moisturizing cream which I cannot recommend enough. It makes me skin feel very smooth and healthy. I recently started using foundation and after a few disappointing tries with other cleansers I went back to this one and was amazed at how quickly my stubborn foundation would come off. I know it's not good to pull at your face to get a foundation off, and I'm very happy that I don't have to do that with this cleanser. The foundation just rinses off and my skin feels smooth and then I put on my Cerave moisturizing cream. Very happy and I deleted my previous 1-star review."
1,"I live by this product line! The mist is light-weight and it moisturizes skin. Clean, crisp smell that is not over-powering. Strongly recommended."
1,"For a lip gloss, the pigmentation and staying power is pretty great. Once it dries, it stays put and doesn't feel sticky (no more hair sticking to your lips on a windy day!).Just a head's up: it seems to form a plasticky coating on your lips that tends to peel/flake off, instead of just fade away. If I gently rub my lips together when wearing this, it literally forms little clumps that flake off. I wouldn't recommend this for people who tend to have dry lips. If that doesn't bother you, go ahead and give this a try."
1,"This moisturizer does have a handy dispenser, but it takes a lot of work to get the lotion worked into your skin."
1,The fine brush tip makes for precision eye lining and sculpting once you get used to doing it. Very well designed long tappering cap/brush combination.
1,Great product. I have very sensitive skin and I use this on my feet. Skin is smooth and soft after use.
1,I use this along with the regular moisturizer and am happy with the product.  I believe it helps with redness but it is not a miracle so don't expect perfection but it does have some benefits.
1,"I swear, I've tried so many different types of moisturizers that contain SPF in them but each one seems to leave my skin feeling oily or like I'm at the beach putting sun screen on my face. NOT cute! What I love about this product is that it contains sun screen but doesn't FEEL like you're wearing it. It literally just melts into your skin (well mine at least! Don't forget, everyone's skin is different). I use a bunch of Olay products & I have nothing but nice things to say. I love Olay!"
1,"""Moisturizing Liquid Hand Soap with Milk & Honey""Exodus 33:3a ""Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey...""Milk and honey is a sign of the fullness of God's reign in justice and righteousness. Flowing honey and surging milk begin with fertile land and rivers of usable water. Ample milk means abundant cattle grazing on luxuriant grass, bovines that bear healthy calves--and that fertilize the ground. Bees make honey; bees pollinate fruits and flowers. Dairy, beef, honey and harvest mean nourishment for farmers, families and community, with overflowing everything to sell at market or barter and trade in order to get whatever you cannot grow.Another in Softsoap's extensive line of liquid hand soaps, this particular one is symbolically and realistically perfect for washing hand before helping prepare community dinner at church or elsewhere. It feels good, smells good, lathers well, and rinses off properly."
1,the smell isnt so wonderful but the waxy balm really works great on cracked finger tips and hands.. My tattoo artist suggested this for healing and I have kept it around thru winter and love the healing qualities it offers.
1,"Having used this fragrance free oil for years, I was saddened to find it had disappeared from my local stores.  Only the scented one is available locally, and after trying it, I vowed never to use it again.  How delighted I was to find my old favorite on Amazon.  It works best if applied to wet skin after bathing, then towel dry gently.  It is a very light oil, and is absorbed quickly. Regular use will restore dry skin to a soft, supple condition. Very highly recommended.  Thank you, Amazon! (And, of course, thank you Neutrogena, for developing the product in the first place!)"
1,"This cream is simply the best moisturizer available today...non greasy, great texture, penetrating but my skin absorbs it nicely.  I especially like the way it is dispensed which allows me to travel with it easily.  It is now hard to find in drugstores so I am thrilled that I can get it on Amazon."
1,"i bought this for the summer and to use after a workout. omg its great it smells nice, doesnt make my skin dry, and deeply cleans my body after a workout and being out all day. i love that it comes in packs of 3. i gave one to my sister and she loves it too.great product i love neutrogena"
0,"I had really bad luck with this product.  I used it for the first time yesterday, and, even though I followed all of the directions and even contacted their customer service for advice before dying, it left me with bright orange ""hot roots"" and left my hair feeling very damaged and dry.I bought this in the Terracotta Blonde color (7C).  Before purchasing it from Amazon, I went to the Naturtint website to check out the color chart, and then found it locally so I could see the color chart in person.  Since I still wasn't sure what color to get and was trying to go to a lighter red than my current color, I emailed a photo of my hair to Naturtint's customer service email. Someone emailed me back right away with two suggested colors -- and so they definitely have excellent customer service!This color contain hydrogen peroxide, which means that it can lighten your hair over time.  If you want to move to a lighter shade, you can use Naturtint to do so gradually, by slowly going down two shades at a time.  The peroxide, however, is probably what makes this so drying on your hair; it left my hair feeling awful afterwards.That being said, when I rinsed this out of my hair, it took forever to rinse and burned my eyes really badly as I was rinsing it out.  It also left my hair feeling like straw, and I had very healthy hair to begin with.  Even after using their shampoo and conditioner, my hair felt awful, so I did a deep treatment with one of my own hair masques, and that seemed to help a bit.  Overall, though, my hair feels really dry and straw-like, and I had a lot of residual color left on my towels and pillowcase last night, which I've never had before.When I told my stylist that I was going to start dying my own hair again, she said just to do an all-over color every four or five or so colorings when doing box color, and just touch up the roots in the meantime.  I'd like to do so, but this seems to be so damaging to my hair that I'm not sure I want to use it again.  Before now, I was using Robert Craig color, which left my hair in much nicer condition, but was more of a pain to use because you have to measure and mix up the color.  I might go back to RC color, depending on how my hair recovers after I try to baby it the next few weeks."
0,Ended up selling this at a garage sale for $2.  It didn't work very well at all.  Would not recommend.
1,"No more bottles all around the bathtub, on bath supports, etc. Great idea. Easy to refill, sturdy enough to hold the amount of liquid. I recommend it.  It is important that you glue it on a perfectly dry surface, and wait for 24 hrs before you fill the containers."
1,"Seldom used, Aveeno positively radiant skin brightening daily scrub.  This item was a gift.  Description is relatively accurate.  Delivery of this item was professional."
1,"This is my favorite brand and favorite color of polish.  It looks nice and not too bold for my professional office job.  But it's not boring like a pale pink I used to wear. Additionally, the polish goes on smooth and shiny, and stays that way when dry.  I really can't complain about anything with this polish.  Oh, and it dries quickly too. Highly recommend!"
1,"For me the lotion is too greasy for my face so I use it for hand lotion.  I also purchased the 2-pack of Eucerin Q10 Cream which is really good for the back of the hands and I will certainly use it for that.  However, the Q10 Anit-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Lotion is just too greasy for my face which is already oily.  I suppose for ladies with ""dry"" skin it would be a good thing.  But as I've said I will use it as a hand lotion"
1,"I don't bother with products that look cute and smell nice but don't work, so this is something I can whole heartedly recommend as a delicious product that's really adorable and is mighty in moisturizing power. This little tin lasts forever and it smells like the zestiest lemonade that makes my nose feel as if its full of fizz.The ingredients are 94.91% natural with sweet almond oil, beeswax, lemon oil, vit E, cocoa butter, candelilla wax, rosemary extract and beta carotene. I love to massage this in right before bed and then slather on some of that banana Nesquik like Burt's Bees Banana hand cream and put on my little gloves that also are made by Burt with little bees on them and I always wake up with soft hands and shiny nails. I don't ever cut my cuticles, as they protect the nail matrix which consists of delicate tissues and cells below the nail responsible for making your nails growing out nice and hard. This little tin of salve like goo is wonderful and slicks right on, I always have it on hand and it's a real natural beauty product that smells good enough to be eaten.- Kasia S."
1,"This blow dryer is a little on the heavy side, and the sound isn't exactly quiet either. BUT, like most people said, I do feel a difference in the way my hair looks and feels when I use this one compared to other regular dryers. My hair tends to be dry to begin with, so maybe that's why i notice the change. But if you already have smooth hair, I wouldn't know how the product performs. Another plus is that it dries my hair quickly...takes about 1/2 the time I usually need."
1,"I purchased this for a gift. He says he needed something to keep his ties from getting wrinkled while traveling. He used it already and likes it. Also, a good thing to have in your vehicle if you're going to have to put a tie on and need somewhere to put it while you're not wearing it till you get to your destination."
1,"Excellent staying power.  Can be sheer or built up.  Still stays even over suncreen (to add to the SPF).  I use it on my face, too. Put a dab on the back of your hand, let it try a tad and it works very well as a conceiler.  What a great price, when you think about if, for SO much product that can be used on face and other areas.  Great product."
1,"this picture is misleading, much more brown in it, so more of a fall color. was disappointed, but it is still useable, but not for now.. or I will be a chemist and mix it up a bit! still love my OPI."
1,"I love Mrs. Meyer's products, as they are all-natural and cruelty-free, and this is no exception.  Excellent lather and grease-cutting capabilities.  The only downfall is the scent.  It doesn't really smell like basil; it smells more floral and sweet, but it's not that bad.  I've found that the other scents are a bit stronger and I don't like them as much."
1,I have not use this long enough to rate it. I keep you post it. I don't have a horse.
1,"My digestion is challenged due to a chronic illness. Oxbile helps me digest my food, especially fats.I notice when I run out. My ND recommended it and she was right. I used to take a lot of mylanta, etc.I changed my diet and take this stuff. No more indigestion."
0,Maybe  you need to use all the products together to get results but I felt that I spent money on this for no reason.I really never noticed a difference while using this product.
0,ITS WATER IN A CAN.IT SMELLS LIKE SWEAT (SALTY SMELL)DOES NOTHING!WASTE OF MONEY WASTE OF PRODUCT! DIDNT EVEN HYDRATE MY SKIN IT MADE ME LOOK LIKE A WET MESS!
1,"Love this product for my back but probably not for my nose. It smells terrible but i can endure it for a nice, soft back without acne."
1,i love this stuff...makes my polish last longer...i will be buying more off amazon...beauty stores charge too much for stuff like this.
1,i have oily and acne prone skin. this is the only moisturizer that doesnt make me break out. i hope eucerin never stops making this!
1,Love! Keeps my eye area smooth and cool. Does not irritate my eyes and helps my under eye concealer go on. I use morning and night.
1,This is my favorite clay mask. Its easy to use and it does exactly what it says. I only apply about once a week (more if needed) and leave it on for about 20 min while I go about house chores. Its great.
0,I thought this would be a nice way to give my hair some shape and smooth out the frizzies instead of pulling a flat iron through or even a curling iron with the clamp...I was WAY WRONG.I get absolutely NOTHING fro this iron.  I can't even get my hair to heat up with it.I'm thinking it would MAYBE work better with shorter and thinner hair (my hair is fairly coarse).
1,"I bought this product to use with a plunging swimsuit I purchased thinking that it would be great together, however they didn't say that this adhesive comes off in water, so the search is back on for a product I can use with my swimsuit."
1,This is a simple easy barely there color tint for lips.  Moisturizes and gives just enough shine.  This is a staple in my purse.
0,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT THIS STUFF IT IS ABSOLUTELY NASTY.IT MAKES YOUR HAIR STIFF AND ITCHY AND AWFUL TO TRY AND BRUSH OUT. I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
1,"I read the other reviews about this product that mentioned it possibly being a knock-off. I am now skeptical about the authenticity of this product, and am also curious about whether or not the things I don't like are inherent to the product or if it's due to some type of contamination or tampering with.I love that it has tea tree oil. I can smell the tea tree, so I know it's in there. I like that it was such a huge bottle. I like that it foams up so well. I use it with a washcloth, so it lathers well.However, I do find this to be drying to my face. I live in a very dry climate, so I need more moisturizer than I used to when I lived in a more humid climate (obviously).I wash with this in the morning and then put on a pure honey mask in the shower (to restore moisture). I use a blend of castor oil/jojoba oil at night. It seems to keep a good balance."
1,This stuff works pretty fast it takes redness and swelling down within hours and the pimple is gone within 3 days no blemish left behind
1,"This lotion is the only lotion I could find that had the two ingredients recommended by dermatologists (urea and lactic acid). It seems to really help my skin, particularly when I put it on after a shower. It takes a minute to rub in really well but it is worth it. My skin gets really dry in the winter and this lotion seems to work better than the Vaseline soothing moisture lotion that I had been using."
1,I DO believe this will do the trick!!!  Just tried it a little yesterday even though I don't need it just now.  Be sure to wet the stick a little before applying.
1,"This is my favorite soap in the whole, wide world. It makes me happy when I use it. It smells fresh, like the wind, the ocean, grass, sand. I don't know, it's just the perfect scent. I have both the ""karma kream"" lotion and karma dusting powder from Lush, and I love them as well, but the soap is still my favorite. Next time I go to their store I'm going to buy the biggest brick of this stuff that I can, because it's great! Just a simple gylcerine-based soap with a dark orange-red hue, but the smell is just so wonderful that every time I wash my hands it turns into some sort of new-age deep-breathing exercise while I try to get as much of that lovely scent into my nostrils as I can.I've found that this soap lathers better than others, but you have to be careful not to leave it in the shower all the time, or it will get soft and melt away with the condensation. Trust me, you don't want to waste any of this stuff by letting it leak into the drain while other people are using the bathroom! I leave mine out so it can make my bathroom smell really great as an added bonus :)Fresh, fruity, citrusy, with just a tiny hint of patchouli to give it an earthy note. Definitely a winner from Lush! As soon as I smelled this soap in their store for the first time, I loved this scent. As you can tell from the reviews, a lot of other people do, too!"
1,"I would use only this, but need to darken only from time to time.  The highlighting effect in Feria accumulates negatively for me in gray areas and I need to darken and go back to this for new highlights."
1,"I got Jade is the new black and the color is more like a forest green. I have been looking for a teal colored nail polish with no such luck. I visited the OPI website to look at the colors there just to make sure I was getting what I was looking for. I have tried, Lost my Chzechbook, Teal the cows come home, and Jade is the new black. The first two were very Blue and this is very green. I might try my luck at mixing Teal the cows come home and Jade is the new black and see if I get the color I am looking for."
1,BEAUTIFUL and Cheaper than going to the store even with shipping. Makes me look 5 years younger and looks smooth and natural. LOVE IT!
1,I have been wearing Touch for years so this time I thought I would try this version to be different. I trusted I would like it without sampling it because I just loved the original touch. It is a soft elegant scent. That is the best I can describe. I love it.
1,"This is a great little hair dryer and I like the various settings.  My only complaint is that it's a bit noisy, but that's to be expected with most compact dryers that put out any volume of air."
1,I bought this last week based on all the good reviews.  Takes off all the eyemakeup without having to rub.  I follow up with a splash of water.  I'll bet the bottle lasts the whole year.
1,"I have eczema and use the &#34;free products&#34; mostly. The dermatologist recommended I use the Aveeno body wash, which does the trick for those stinky places, sparingly. I've had no problems."
1,"I like shower gels that make my skin feel hydrated after I get out of the shower... this one didn't deliver. It's a 3-in-1 combo (shampoo/bath gel/bubble bath) which I usually stay away from but it was priced right and Philosophy is a pretty good brand. Also, I know it's pink so I didn't expect it to smell masculine, but it smells really girly."
1,"I'm not sure this is working. I have not had a period in over four months (35 yrs old) but every time I use this, I bleed a little. Not sure what is going on. I believe that it helps regulate my estrogen though from books I've read. I've only used it consistently for three weeks. I have to cycle on and off."
1,This is thick and kind of difficult to spread throughout hair and doesn't smell that great. I've also not noticed any benefits one way or another. I'll not be buying this again.
1,"Great product I use it in my hair. Its healthy and it smells wonderful too. Between you and I, I've used it as a quickie perfume too. In that capacity it's not an all day thing but the first couple of hours got me complements."
1,"I came upon this product when it was used on me during a 3 week hospitalization while I recuperated from colon cancer surgery.  I used it during my entire hospital stay.  I began chemo immediately thereafter and began using this during chemo too.  My mother-in-law, in her 90s, and my father in his 80s, use it as well because they have great mobility and disability problems.  If you remember from years ago when they used powders in your hair when you were ill, this is nothing like that.  This shampoo is liquid.  You rub it into your hair and then you towel dry your hair.  When you are done towel drying your hair, it is clean.  You cannot tell the difference between having used this shampoo versus regular shampoo.  This was developed for the astronauts at NASA.  I don't  know what I would have done without this shampoo.  I still use it from time to time but I am fully healthy again so it is not a big issue today."
1,I brought this product for my husband and he loves it.  Works well no complaints.  Will order it again.  It feels great when applying it to your body.
0,"I am so unhappy with this item, I oredered it because It said 100% aloe, I fell for thepackage info, this isn't 100% aloe, and when I put it on my face after a derma roll, oh my god, it burned, real aloe doesn't burn, because I have used other brands and real aloe. I am returning this, Ican't believe the waste of money and time getting it through the mail. consumers need tostop deceiving to sell. :("
1,"I recently had back surgery and was not allowed to take showers for a number of weeks. Sponge baths worked ok for the body, but washing the hair was a problem as chances of getting the water on the scar (and thus risk of infection) were high. I was miserable not being able to wash my hair until someone told me about No-rinse Shampoo.Small things make a big difference when you are hospitalized/recovering from surgery.  No-rinse shampoo removed one of the things that was making me feel bad and I am so pleased someone told me about it."
1,I've been using it for years since menopause. I recommend it to a my needy friends. It's a little on the expensive side so I try to switch every few months to a less expensive substitute and then alternate back again. It really evens out my moods
1,"I absolutely love this face mask, its the best one i have used.It evens out my skin, soothes it and makes my skin feel clean and feel really nice. I use this product once and a while and do spot treatment on places where i am prone to get breakouts (i touch my face a lot on my chin and i use this to wash this area to prevent breakouts)I have been using this product for years now, and I still haven't run out. I dont use it too often but when i do its really nice and refreshing for my skin. its lasted so long that my bottle isn't updated to this photo, but its the same ingredients. I will be re purchasing this product as im almost finally running out. I would recommend this to anyone."
1,Makes your skin look and feel moist  with no smell or stinging .great for sensitive skin  at a decent price .would reccomend to a friend

1,"I actually didn't really see a difference on my back. However, I tried the neutrogena grapefruit body wash and it worked a lot better! And I have the foaming face scrub too. Def a lot better!"
0,"I didn't buy it here but I still feel the need to write a review. I like Conair but this product was a waste of money. The hose doesn't stay on the cap so while it's supposed to be drying your hair, it's falling out at the same time. Then.. it concentrates on only the section that the hose is connected to. I have to keep moving the cap all around my head just to get each section to dry. It was also HELL just to get everything back into the compartment. I could go on and on but I think that's enough."
1,"I'd been messing around with lighter shades of red for about a year before I came across this color. I loved being a strawberry blonde, but the deeper, darker reds always intrigued me. So, I picked this up at Target. I wanna say it was the same price as on here.. At first, I thought it was too outrageous. I don't want to attract attention everywhere I go. But then I started getting compliments. I mean, everywhere I went. I had people tell me it was the prettiest hair color they'd ever seen. And I have to say I agree with them!The only downside is that it didn't seem to last as long as I'd hoped. I use a color depositing shampoo so I expected my results to last a tad bit longer. Either way, I'm happy dying my hair every day if that's what it takes to keep my hair this beautiful!"
0,"I waited three months to give this product a fair shot. My skin did not peel to reveal new skin, my pores did not diminish, in fact it diminished the glow to my skin and dried it in spots. I will be returning to Olay products and probably get a professional peel."
1,Great face wash.  I use this about 3-4 times a week in conjuction with another exfoliating wash and I think my skin looks better. I've used for about 6 months and ready to order more. I'm pretty picky with face creams and washes and I think this does the job in the description.
1,This product not only smells amazing but lathers up extremely well.  I do not need any water to get the lather going and it soaps up my face nicely.  The disks are a generous size and if you were frugal you certainly could snip them in half and get double duty out of them.  I feel that I am more apt to cleaning my face at night when I have the cleaner ready for me.  One side of the disk is smooth and the other side has more of a texture to allow deeper penetration of your pours. My face looks bright and clean!  I was on facetime with my mom and she had commented out radiant my skin looked as I just got done washing it.  I will be picking up more of these when I run out!
1,"This is like the travel sized shadow or something, much smaller than their regular palette size. Nice neutral color though for daytime."
1,"I originally bought the 1 1/4 inch Instant Heat Hot Brush because I had allowed myself to be convinced by watching a demonstration of a similar product on television that the size would work well for my hair.  I was not all wrong, but after I used it a couple of times I wondered if I would have better results with a smaller brush.  I have short hair (does not cover my ears) which is very fine, but also thick and straight.  As it gets some length on it between haircuts it lays down completely flat on my head.  I need height and volume, but don't want curls.I bought the 1 1/4 inch brush and liked the convenience of it, but the brush was simply too large to wrap my hair around.  I had a lot of difficulty picking between the two sizes for my first purchase and quickly began to wonder if the smaller brush (closer to the size of my curling iron) might not be a better choice for me.  I ordered the smaller size and it does exactly what I want.  I get lots of volume, the cowlicks on the crown of my head are controlled, I don't have curls or waves, but the little tag ends of hair around my ears and nape of my neck now lay down flat.  Oh, and did I mention that I don't like to spend a lot of time fussing with my hair?  This small hot brush is perfect for me.Both brushes work and are designed exactly the same.  Everything pertains to both hot brush sizes.  There is an on/off button with red or green indicator light, turbo heat on/off button, a turbo heat indicator light, comfortable textured handle, chrome barrel, plastic bristles, and a cool tip.  Begin with clean, dry hair.  Damp hair works too, it just takes longer with more passes of the brush through the hair.  Styling products can be used on the hair.  Hair should only be wrapped around the brush twice so longer hair will require moving the brush along the length of the hair, beginning at the end.  Trust me, you don't want those plastic bristles to get tangled in your hair.  There is a temperature guide for the 25 possible heat settings, but you have to be prepared to experiment.  For my short, straight, fine, thick hair I have settled on a heat setting of 17 which Conair's chart considers medium-high.  I was surprised that it took that much heat.Turbo Heat is a feature which provides a constant amount of heat, no fluctuations caused because of power changes you have no control over.  I turn on the brush and turn on the Turbo Heat at the same time and for the setting of #17 that means it takes the brush over 1.5 minutes before the indicator light stops blinking.  That 30 second heat-up they talk about is for the lowest heat setting number with Turbo Heat not turned on.  If you turn the brush on and allow it to come up to heat, then turn on the Turbo Heat it will go through the entire heat-up time all over again.  Turn them both on at the same time if you are going to use Turbo Heat.I am really happy with this product.  I do not shampoo my hair each day and the volume stays in my hair very well.  If I want to refresh the style, I simply heat up the brush and run it through my hair as if I am simply brushing it.  That actually brings the volume back.  I tried today to change the style from the styling of yesterday and it actually did work.  This product has dual voltage ability, but you must buy an adapter that configures to the plug you will be using.  That information is easily available at various online sites.  I don't know if I will keep the larger brush or pass it along to one of my daughters or granddaughters.  Just remember to be careful when using the hot brush.  That chrome barrel gets very hot and will burn your fingers if you touch it.  Even the ""cool tip"" gets warm."
1,"It's supposed to be one of her more sophisticated scents and I certainly agree. The bottle is pretty cool. The scent is like a light musk. It's very soft, which I think u could do during the day. It's like a strong floral, so it's not too overly powerful. I could see myself going to work with this, like it's not one of those head turner perfumes, it's subtly musky.It's a day time thing in MY OPINION. But it's also a nice night time scent, it's versatile in that sense. For a very detailed review, see: [...]Hope this helped :)"
1,"I like the toner and the smell.  It is more expensive than some of the other comparable witch hazel toners.  After using the whole bottle, I switched to another brand that was half the price, but it really made my face feel tight and dry and didn't smell as nice.  I think I am going to swich back and pay the extra money."
1,works well. dries in a good amount of time in order to put on lashes. don't push on tube to hard or to much will come out. if you are careful not to put on lashes makes it easy to take of the fake ones.
0,Dries white alone or whatever color foundation/ eye makeup you are using. Does not really stick and peels off very easily.
1,"Love the quality, as usual. They never fail you. I wish, though, there would be color sample outside on the tube so I don't have to open it every time to see what's inside (I have plenty and they're all unmarked. There is a name - in words - on each tube, but it would be so convenient to just have a color sticker). Other than that, perfect!"
1,thought this was a good product bt a bit pricey did find the same thing in a generic brand that did just the same but the price was way better ad it only came in a single item.
1,"I regularly use this for everything in the house from cuts and scrapes, sore throats, canker sores, piercing care, and for healing stretches.Its great!Some people say that you can use ""wound wash"" (which is a saline spray that costs less then a dollar usually) and its the same but that is not true.  This is made with sea salt, which has dozens of micro-nutrients that your body needs but often does not get, that allow wounds to heal faster.  Also H2Ocean has Lysozomes inside, which eat the bad bacteria and clean the wound.  The sea water draws out lymph and wound secretions.  This stuff is great, I really love it.A similar product, Simple Care Spray, (which you cannot buy here) is also great, I use that one more now, because it has neem oil in it (which is a anti fungal, anti microbial, anti everything bad pretty much oil) but it doesn't have the ""Stay sterile"" design that the H2Ocean does, so I'm still a huge fan of H2Ocean.Its a great product!  you can get it for cheaper on [...] though, and those people are awesome."
1,This item was very well-described so I decided to try it.  The description turned out to be spot-on.  It's well crafted out of quality materials and the bristles are neither too stiff or too soft - they're just right!
1,"Rosemary has a nice subtle scent. I don't find it to be too drying, would buy again for another room."
1,"I sucked my fingers till I was 12 so when my son started sucking his fingers we tried to get him to stop but nothing worked. He would suck ""thum"" off and not even flinch so with him being in 1st grade we need him to stop immediately. This product stopped it the first day! It has also helped with the booger eating issue too. Great product!!!!"
1,"It's OK. Nothing to write home about.  I probably wouldn't buy it again but it works well as a detangler and finishing spray for a little more shine. I find that when I spray it into damp hair it instantly softens so I can comb it but once it dries, it's like the product is non-existent.It does do what it says however, and that's to add a little extra umph to your hair when it's dry. I just wouldn't spend my money on another bottle."
1,A very useful product at a great price.  Good service.  A must for people who suffer from scalp issues as a way to find relief.
1,Love this lotion! Makes my skin glow and keeps the acne away!! Very moisturizing too! Use it everyday and the price is perfect for the product that you get!
1,"Alba Botanica's Honey Mango shower gel smells really good, without being overpowering.  It cleans just as well as any other shower gel.  Great price for a soap with natural ingredients."
1,It smells pretty good does a good job with fading so I'll be ordering more I'm almost out and it last a long time to..
1,This is the best polish you can get next to CND's shellac but that's a different story. Love the color names - opi i love you.
1,Its got  a nice aroma and just like roses smell. It makes your face feel good.Im not sure that it actually does any cleansing perse but it has a nice fresh clean and very delicate water like appearance and feel.VERY REFRESHING!
1,"I have dry skin on my scalp, and this product helps work the shampoo into my hair and slough off dead skin.  I've been really happy with this product...simple design, great price.  I think they've been making this brush for decades."
1,"I liked this soap, but because it had a short life span (even when you cut it into chunks), I was about to chuck it. Then I realized you can buy it in liquid form. GREAT stuff. It is hard to find but it smells better and it has a pump which is awesome!"
0,"I've experimented with different shades through the years, so I've tried various hair color removal products in order for my next shade to go evenly. (I also find that red likes to stick to my porous ends forever, despite the fact that its a fast fading color!)This is one of the worst ones yet. First of all, I doubt this stuff is very gentle. I was wearing an old hair raggy dye shirt and it bleached it so bad it ate through the shirt, creating several huge holes. My goodness, I never thought something could completely ruin my old hair dying shirt. I've never had anything 'gentle' do that before! It's also liquid-y like water, making the application process real messy. The worst part is it's very difficult to apply evenly, because once you rub it around your hair clumps to it...it's almost a glue-ish texture. The only way I could get it to go on evenly was to comb it through, which I did very little of, since it was literally tearing up my hair. Instead I tried to saturate it as much as I could while rubbing it through.It really started to burn after 15 minutes, so I couldn't wait any longer than that. The results were completely uneven. I found it left some red parts almost untouched (it turned it into a pinkish color) while some other areas were bleached yellow/orange. What I wanted was the yellow/orange all the way through. I had applied it to the end areas first and let that sit for 5-7 minutes before doing the rest of my hair. Even then, I still found the root area to be almost blonde. So be careful for you will see 'hot roots' from this stuff quite easily since your scalp area is naturally warmer. So my entire head was real patchy.I've applied my new hair color, and thanks to the bad results with this product, I decided to go with a slightly darker color than I had originally intended. Now it looks almost completely even, but you can still see some of the red dye at the tips. This stuff is too damaging to use again. Next time I'll pick up Ion hair color removal. It is gentler to my hair and is much easier to distribute evenly (plus it doesn't bleach at all!)The box does lie...it does NOT simply remove the box color, leaving you with the pre-lightened strands it had created. It will lighten it even more than that, IF you can get it all the way through your hair. This stuff burned my skin as soon as it touched it, and yeah, my poor old shirt has finally made it into the trash..."
1,Perfect brush for dry skin brushing. My mom had done skin brushing for many years and she does not have one bit of cellulite and she swears that its due to skin brushing. I had always heard of the benefits of skin brushing and I feel like its very important to aid our body in detoxing because lymph only moves around if we stay active but if someone is sedentary the lymph just sits there and your body can't get rid of toxins. Its a great quality brush and once I finish the skin brushing my skin is sooo soft. I will keep incorporating it into my daily routine to receive all the benefits.
0,"Somewhere in the fine print for this item I'm sure there is a sentence that says, ""Buy this if you're a sucker.""I use a regular ceramic curling item to make spiral curls in my hair.  It works great, but when I saw this item I had visions of even better curls, so I ordered it.What a pain to use.  This iron has a raised spiral pattern along the length of the barrel, and you're supposed to painstakingly wind your hair between these raised spirals... I'm guessing to make an even curl.  It takes forever to do this.  I did ok on the right side of my head (I'm right-handed) but I had trouble doing the left side.  You have to be a contortionist to get the iron at the correct angle and roll it up smoothly.  And remember that this is coming from an experienced curling iron user.Were my curls any better than with a conventional curling iron?  That would be a big fat NO.  AND it took double the amount of time to curl my hair.  I kept it, solely because it is good to have a back-up if your regular iron dies at a critical moment, but I don't have any interest in using it."
1,"I have shoulder length thick hair, but the ends are brittle and break too easily due to consistent wear n tear from my heating tooks (hair dryer and flat iron used daily.) My stylist told me about this product but I didn't want to buy it from her because the product was marked up so much, so I went in search of it a year or two later. I found it at a local store more expensive than online, so I purchased it here.Wow o wow is my hair happy. My hair has a shine that wasn't there before, my hair seems stronger with the weekly use of the VO5 hot oil treatment and I'm having less issues with our humidity creating flyaways. My hair is noticeably softer to the touch, and easier to manage when I straighten. I'm no longer having to use the flat iron as long.Love love love this product. Buy it once, and I promise you'll want to keep buying."
1,"i love this scent. it smells like vanilla but isn't super sweet, it's like the perfect combo of sweet and floral... i love it, i have the largest size and it's SO worth the price.. it used to be $90 a 3.4 bottle at sephora back in the day, but it's just so good, i wear it often... so worth it."
1,A cute  milky pink shade! Great for delicate looks and great for those who just sometimes want to be a bit more on the lighter side. Im a huge fan of light milky colors. I love how it looks on your nails. So chic and cute
1,"NO, it's not Snapple - it's THIS STUFF! I use this daily after the shower on arms, legs and chest/belly.  This stuff is amazing, it absorbs quickly, no residue, leaves skin soft and over time does have a tightening effect.  But best of all, products are all organic, so you are not slowly poisoning yourself through absorption of parabens and other toxic chemicals found in nearly all lotions these days. I am a lifetime fan of Avalon products for this reason...and Jason soaps."
1,"Sparrow me the Drama is the cutest!!! Its soft, like a purple/pink color, really really cute!! I love it. Soft and romantic and girly. :) my favorite OPI color right now."
1,"First off, love the scent!  Also love the exfoliation I get.  However, the word &#34;creme&#34; is not quite accurate... a creme should rub in completely, and this does not.  I use it at night, and end up rubbing it into my hands so as not to get &#34;grease&#34; all over my sheets.  Would use it more often if it would rub in better!"
1,This is the only thing that will keep my acne away! I love this product so much. I have tried SO MANY products to help with my acne but this tops them all. I stopped using this and tried taking Zinc for acne but it made my acne worse. I will never make the same mistake and stick with what works. Thank you Nature's Cure! :D
0,"After reading the other reviews I thought this would be a great facial cleanser. Unfortunately, it just dried out my skin. Which is odd because my skin is oily and it takes a lot to dry it out. I am glad I only bought the small size."
1,"I like this Revlon hair shine improvement products , i make hair look more manageable and less  frizzy ,  i have a lot of hair ,  its brushes wont stick long into it  when i style , but it is perfect  and good quality product for those have normal not thick freezze hair"
1,"great for short hair,does not get static electricity,was was a little higher price then i wanted to pay but was worth it."
1,This works very well for the occasional blemish.  It has witch hazel in it and benzoyl peroxide and it seems to work so much better than other over the counter products for acne. My skin is more on the oily side and I don't have any problems using it but my daughter's skin turns very dry after a couple of days of treating a spot on her face.  One of my favorites from this product line.
1,"I have been using the L'Oreal Preference, Lightest Golden Brown shade for many years now, and still get compliments on the golden highlights and how healthy my hair looks. The color is always consistent and natural looking and the coverage very effective, though with the increasing amount of gray in my natural hair, I have to be careful with the application, particularly around the temples and where I part my hair. Now, if the product could only make my face look as smooth and wide-eyed as the model, I would give it 10 stars !"
1,"It really cleans your face without leaving residue.  I was seeing improvement after just one week of routine use.  My face looked less dull.  It didn't dry out my skin like other clensers have, so if I didn't moisturize after, it was okay.  Alas, it was confiscated at the airport because of the size.  I dound this at a local store and I still use it."
1,"Great color and easy to apply - only need to coats of the color and it's perfect. Great for an everyday standard, or for special occasions. Looks good in almost any season as long as I have a tan ;)"
1,"I love lavender oil, and when I used up my first bottle of it, I decided to check out the lavender oils available on Amazon.  This Plantlife brand of oil smells great!  It is calming, and like some of the other reviewers noted, it works well when added to a cotton ball next to your pillow to give you restful sleep.  Below are some of the other uses for lavender that I use:1.  Homemade body sugar scrub:  I use my favorite homemade sugar scrub recipe and add drops of lavender to the mix.  It smells so delicious and feels great in the shower.2.  Body Mist:  I add water, drops of lavender and orange oil (or any other essential oil) to an empty squirt bottle.  I use it to freshen up a room and when at work and I'm staring at the computer screen, I spray a couple of squirts in the air as a refresher.  It feels heavenly.  It helps keep me alert (in particular after lunch when feeling groggy), and perks up my mood.3.  Homemade body oil:  This is one of my favorite uses of lavender oil.  I mix it with sweet almond oil (which is scentless), vitamin E oil, and orange essential oil to create the sweetest floral fruity body oil.  I rub it all over my body after a shower, and it feels so therapeutic.  It's a great start to a day or the best nightcap before bed.I know there are hundreds of other uses for lavender oil (and I'm going to check them out).  I am very pleased with this lavender oil and my uses of it.  I give this oil my HIGHEST Recommendation.  You'll love it!"
0,"I just simply do not like the smell of this oil.  Different body chemistries make the fragrance different on everybody, so you should probably try for yourself.  After I first apply it, the smell is like that of Opium perfume.  Unfortunately, on me, it morphs into a body odor smell shortly afterward.  I didn't realize at first that it was the perfume oil and was concerned that I was having a sweating problem (even though I was not sweating and I shower at least once a day) - after smelling my wrists repeatedly, I realized it was the perfume oil.  I am going to give this to a friend to try, I hope it works better for her.  I won't be ordering this fragrance again."
1,"PRO's:Smells good (like a yummy almond christmas cookie and dried fruit), goes on easily with a brush applicator, not expensive, soaks in fairly quickly (about 5 minutes for it to absorb completely).CON's:Doesn't really feel that moisturizing after it's completely absorbed. Comparable with any other oil based cuticle oil.Now I've only used this product a few times today and so far it's comparable to all my other cuticle oils.  Not any better, not any worse.  If it does miracles on my cuticles with my continuous use I will update this review.Update:  I've used this product for a really long time now and haven't seen any amazing results.  It's still just an average cuticle oil to me.  Nothing super special.  I actually use Lush co. ultra balm as my cuticle oil now since it feels more moisturizing and lasts much longer.  I still give this product a B rating because it does it's job but needs to be reapplied often for effectiveness."
1,I like this product because it is not greasy and it stays on all day.  I will recommend it to others.
1,Great oil....I use it in laundry detergent and it works great....it smells really good too...a must have for the product mixer
1,"It's a beautiful pink with blue-ish iridescence, it gives a sort of glow to your nails. And it has a great formula, not too thick or too thin. The shipping was speedy too. I'd repurchase in the future."
1,"After reading reviews, I was very anxious to try this concealer.  When I first put it on, I was so pleased!  It really seemed to cover well.  But, within a few hours, I could see a lot of dry lines under my eyes that had never been noticeable before.  Bummer."
1,I used to use Pacquin hand cream which has been discontinued. The Camille Beckman Glycerine Hand Therapy is now my new favorite. It has kept my hands from cracking near the knuckle which most hand creams don't do. My hands stay soft and moisturized even if I skip a day. And it's not at all greasy once it dries just a minute or so after you put it on. This is now my Pacquin replacement and I like it even better than Pacquin because it smells better. I use the French vanilla scent.
0,"Since I am allergic to Benzyl Peroxide, I did not use the cream, so this is a review of the tablets only.I used the tablets religiously twice a day, in the morning and at night. No change in my acne at all. I really wanted it to work, but the truth is that it did not work for me."
1,"I'm used to using ""kiss my face tinted moisturizer"" which I thought was alittle cakey but I loved the coverage with a little moisturizer added to it. This Aveeno product doesn't seem so cakey to me.  It actually has less coverage then I'm used to and bc it's ""radiant"" has a bit of sheen, which I'm not used to and actually don't really like.  It would prob. be nice for going to the beach, to the lake or for other active outdoor activities, but not something I want to wear to church or to a nice function (which is usually when I want to add some tint).  I won't buy this again, but will be shopping around for something without sheen, as the kiss my face tinted moisturizer has been discontinued."
0,"This is not a good curling iron at all. I think I only got it for $15 so I guess you get what you pay for. It might curl a little bit, but it's not how a curling iron SHOULD work. The curls aren't pretty and they barely stay.I would spend a little more money and get a better one...I know I'm going to."
1,"This product works as well as people say it does. excellent for very dry hair. Restores the moisture and life in your hair. My hair is heat and chemically damages, but this product really made a difference after using it only twice. It's now part of my routine daily."
0,I used it for anal bleaching and it burned a bit there are no directions on it about time and how long to wear it
0,Had to toss this in the trash after reading it's ingredients.  There are plenty of other moisturizer out there that doesn't contain these cancer causing chemicals.
1,"I worked as an assistant makeup artist on the set of Current TV and the hosts loved the Bare Minerals, they liked it because it was light and gave them a lot of coverage.  It also looked natural under the hot lights.  So if you want a light foundation that does not look heavy I would suggest buying this product."
0,"I had pre lightened hair with roots. I added some low lights and they didn't turn out good (too muddy and ashy looking). So I got this color remover at Sally's. I put it on my hair. It has ammonia in it, smells awful. Anyway, I went through with the application. After literally 5 min, I looked in the mirror and notices my hair below the roots turned platinum blonde. OMG! It felt like I put 100% bleach on my hair. I washed it out immediately. Now, I have dark brown roots and platinum blonde the rest of the hair. Very dreadful look. Why did it lighten my hair so much?! I can't understand. I thought it was supposed to wash out hair color molecules by shrinking them. I'm surprised my hair is still on my head. I really really really would not recommend this to anyone."
1,"This stays on during those humid summers and I actually snorkeled in the Caribbean, (with goggles) and it stayed on perfectly.Is there anything more to say?The price is amazing and the product does what it is suppose to. No more raccoon eyes, ever!"
1,"My mom used to use the old salt version of this when I was a child. My hair is fine and straight, but I have a lot of it. I use this system every day and I always get compliments on my curls. Its MUCH healthier on my hair than ceramic curlers. I will never stop using this!*The trick for me is I don't start to roll the curls at the ends of my hair. I put it halfway down a 2&#34; section of my hair and wind the hair around the roller starting with the bottom half (almost how you would wind hair around a curling wand). Then I wind it up to my roots (going in the same direction as I did the bottom half). I then alternate each roller clockwise and counterclockwise so that each curl is not going in the same direction. The top layers will have a bit of a crease from where you fasten the roller, but I run a flat iron over my roots after I take the rollers out and it takes it right out. I part my hair how I will wear it BEFORE I start rolling (side part) vs rolling it the &#34;normal&#34; way that we are taught (down the middle of your hair, like a mohawk). I hope that makes sense!"
1,It's hard to pull my hair back into a neat pony tail or bun or at all really because I have thick full hair that is also layered. This product is seriously amazing. I use this on my hair (when dry) to calm any fly aways and to hold down my layered hair. The style sticks all day long until I brush it out and it's soft to the touch - I love this!
1,"I use this particular products every 9 weeks, color is very nice, not harsh, product lasts well on my hair"
1,This shade is really nice. I wore this on an interview and found it to be very appropriate for the setting. It's a little to princess-y shade for me though.
1,"This is a really cool waver-it doesn't create curls, it creats really cool waves. I used this for new years and my waves stayed the entire night! didn't have to hold it for long on my hair, Love it!"
0,These give me a headache. They sit right on the pressure points and they have these built in combs on the side that get stuck in your head. Trying to re-adjust it in your hair is a pain b/c it gets caught. These are terrible.
1,I tend to be rough on things but these are very durable. The colors are great. The style allows me to wear something cute and casual.
1,Using on eyebrows. Don't know if will work but it is fun to try. No smell.  Basic castor oil. Thank u.
1,"I'm loving this soap. I've been using it exclusively on my face for the past couple of months and it's performing beautifully. I have combination skin and this works well with it. It is non-drying, lathers well (rich, creamy lather), and I find the scent to be light and non-offensive. After use, my skin is super clean but it doesn't make my skin feel tight at all."
1,Excellent product. No skin irritation. Easily remove the remains of mask. I highly recommend it. Just saw him I knew it was good buy
1,"I am an African American woman with natural 4a/4b hair. This product is better than I expected. It did a great job of moisturizing, detangling and adding shone to my curls. I also like that it has UV protection. The only thing I don't like it the amount of product you get for the price. It's only 6 oz. This is water based product so you don't need a lot of product for it to be effective, but I am used to buying leave-in creams with the same price for 160z of product. I am simply too cheap to continue buying this product."
1,"i USED ROGAIN AND IT'S BEEN HELPING ME SLOWLY SO YOU NEED TO BE PATIENT AND CONSISTENT, USE IT TWICE A DAY, I HAVE HORMONAL HAIR LOSS AND IT HAS BEEN GREAT, ALSO FOR MY EYEBROWS."
1,"Both of our twins have pilaris keratosis and we went through several brands of soaps and lotions before giving Mustela a try.  It is expensive but it does wonders for our kids' skin and keeps their PK to a minimum and their skin soft.  We love the scent too and a bottle lasts us a long time (using it nightly on two kids, a bottle usually lasts 2 months)."
1,"This is the best tinted moisturizer I have tried, with the exception of Sonia Kashuk tinted moisturizer which ishard to find.  I only gave four stars, because it fades after a couple hours, probably because of the moisturizer.It goes on easily, it just doesn't stay long."
1,This is a great night cream. I use it nightly along with the serum. I have noticed the fine lines getting a little less noticeable. I think it's even helping the deeper wrinkles. I have noticed the lip lines fading a little. I was thinking it wouldn't help at all but it has.
1,"I bought this a year ago did not use it. I found it a couple weeks and decided to give it another try! Boy was I glad I did that! Its a really good toner and moisturizer! Good for my acne which Ive seen a improvement in. I have been using Gental purpose cleanser, queen helens mask  green one and mud mask, manuka honey, and this!"
1,"Don't be afraid to try this!  It's much easier to use than it may seem, and the results are AWESOME. My hair came back to life ... rich color and brilliant shine.  Shampooing does not cause fading ... and I used a burgundy shade!  This will be the ONLY brand I use from now on!"
1,"This lotion works really well to relieve my extra dry hands. I tend to prefer the lighter variety for my body, although this works well too. I've also found it helpful during the course of the day when indoor heating makes make face feel parched."
1,"I love this taupe-y pink shade. It is pretty unique, and I like it for most seasons. It's got good opacity and is easy to apply."
1,"Highly recommend for oily skin. Could be a little drying for other skin types, though. I have had excellent results with this product, and I have tried EVERYTHING, both over the counter and prescription. I find this works best during my ""downtime"" from Renova--I take 3-6 months off after an 18-month stretch to give my skin a break. During the down time I use ROC at night and this in the morning. It mimics the dermatologist-prescribed routine I am normally on, just gentler. Be sure to wear at least SPF 15 when using this product!"
1,"Im a 30-something with pale (dare I say see-thru)skin. When I get a blemish, it is totally noticeable and quite annoying/embarrassing--I mean come on! Wrinkles AND Pimples?!? I digress. I grabbed bye bye blemish at an online drug store about 4 years ago when I was suffering thru a particularly bad outbreak. It works like a charm. There is a trick to it though. You will be immediately tempted to shake the bottle to incorporate the pink goo at the bottom & the clear liquid on top. Do not shake it like a polaroid picture! When you receive this, you won't even be able to use it for a day, because the shipping will have shaken it. Just let it sit out & I assure you, the product will correct itself.Here is my routine:Before I head to bed, I cleanse my skin thoroughly and apply any serum/moisturizers Im using at the time. I dip a q-tip into water and clean off any spots I want to treat with BBB. Take a new q tip & dip it into the pink gooey sediment at the bottom of the bottle & dot the zits. (Make sure to use a new q tip for every dip!) Then I will set my hair dryer to super low to dry my face, otherwise, you might end up with a pink pillow. When you wake up, if the offender isnt completely gone, it is greatly diminished.Overall, I give it an A+. I only recently ran out of my bottle, so it is really a great cost effective way to deal with nasty breakouts.Lazy Girl Tips:You can't wear this out in public during the day. Dont try-you will look like a nutball. It basically looks like little dots of Calamine Lotion all over your face. Not sexy.Too much is really too much. It will dry your face out in sensitive areas with excessive use, so just keep it to the once nightly application.You will inevitably forget you have this on and your husband will look at you like you are an alien the first time you use it. Best to prepare a snappy comeback before exiting the bathroom."
1,"I have been using this hand cream for nearly 20 years and is perfect. I have has issues with my hands cracking and bleeding during the winter months, I worked at a hospital and a nurse told me about trying this and it almost seemed impossible to have hands that could feel so soft and not bleed. I have dry skin to start with then the winters have made them almost impossible to keep them from hurting and this stuff has made them feel almost normal. I gave some to my grandma that had very dry skin like mine and this is all she uses and was so thankful for the product. I would recommend this to anyone who has any issue with dryness on the body. You will thank yourself for giving this a try."
1,"This is my first curling iron. I was so confused when I chose this since the price is kinda inexpensive. I could choose something more expensive and popular like Hot Tools brand but I was not very sure with the ideal that I would curl my hair often or even if I could curl it (lol) but this one works great (for me). It gets hot pretty quickly and doesn't take long to curl my hair. I like it, and I believe it's good buy. I read some comment said it doesn't last &#34;too&#34; long or something but I don't really mind. For the price, just can't beat it or at least give it a try!!!"
1,"I agree with previous reviews that the bubbles are small and don't last long.  If you just want a few bubbles with very little scent, this is a decent bubble bath.  If you want something that smells good and creates long-lasting bubbles, do not use this product.  However, I have no idea if there are any medical benefits--it certainly doesn't make your skin tingle or feel any different than before the bath."
1,This is a nice finishing touch to your bath. I think it leaves my hair feeling fresh and clean. I still haven't noticed the thickening effect it promises but I think I still can wait a month more for it.
1,The first time I bought this.  I forgot about it and one day when my eyes felt dry puffy and tired.  I tried it.  It was shockly awesome.  It felt cool to the touch.  The puffiness and the tiredness went away.  The lines were noticeble deminshing as well.  It is a great product.
1,"I live this product - it is great as a moisturizer and isn't too heavy for my oily skin. I love the scent but, unfortunately, I think that is what made my skin tingle when I first started using it. The tingle has gone away, for the most part, but people with sensitive skin or people (like me) who use things like Retin-A that make their skin sensitive, take note. I think next time I'll try the Olay Pro-X Age Repair Lotion or the Total Effects 7-In-1."
1,"This is by far the best sun block I have ever used.  It goes on well and does the job it says it will, totally blocks the sun.  I used it in Florida recently and never burned and I have skin that burns within 20 to 30 minutes of strong sunlight.  Also this did not cause any irritation to my super sensitive skin.  I use in whenever I see that we are having a sunny day as UV rays penetrate car windows.  The key to using this product is to put it on about 20 to 30 minutes before going out and to reapply every three hours or so."
1,"why did I waste years on chapstick?most amazing and works in cold, dry , wet , any condtions.I am fair and 52, love it. love it!"
0,NOT AT ALL WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS.  I AM NOT ABLE TO USE IT BECAUSE MY HAIR IS TOO THICK WHEN I WASH IT AND THIS COMB WILL DEFINITELY BREAK.
1,I really enjoy their regular combo lotion that looks just like this in the white pump bottle- but I'll use this one over it because of the added break-out protection I get. I have very sensitive skin & this product never bothered me or made me red like the other review- it works really well to prevent breakouts. I use it in the morning before make up & then after I scrub my face at night.I will admit though- this is not moisturizing. I wait about 10 minutes for it to absorb & use an Olay lotion over the top- it makes my skin feel very tight & thirsty. That's the only reason I don't give it 5 stars.Definitely worth the dry skin because it works so well!
1,"The product itself is WONDERFUL!!! Though the seller that is being fulfilled by Amazon sent me expired, OXIDIZED product that is completely worthless. Didn't do a thing! Even had a brown tint to it -- gross!! I understand this review isn't fair to the product, but Amazon doesn't sell it directly therefore there isn't much to do. Plus, I wanted to inform you guys that there's a big change you too will receive a defective, brown, goopy mess!"
1,"Good for skin and sinuses. My skin is so smooth afterwards, so clean. Especially if you follow witha mask.  And during allergy season, you'll breathe better."
1,"I have used this with my last 2 pregnancies and have no stretch marks. Don't know if it's because of this oil, but I know it can't hurt! I love that this oil does not stain, however, I only use it at night under my tank tops that I wear to bed. This oil does have a slight cocoa smell, but it's not nauseating at all. I am easily turned off by strong odors, but it's so faint that I don't smell it for long. Would highly recommend!"
1,"I have very curly, type 3 bi-racial hair. I have heard people say that finger detangling works best for them-I simply do not have the time (or money to pay the massive water bill) to sit in the shower and pick the knots and tangles out of my hair, one by one. I have tried finger detangling on dry hair and it results in tearing, tried it with wetting my hair outside of the shower and applying conditioner-there is something about running water that makes detangling easier for me. I was resigned to attempting to finger-comb my hair in the shower in absence of finger detangling, but that won't get my hair perfectly detangled and knot free.Enter the Mebco Tortoise Shower Detangler comb. I bought this at Sally's for around $3. The long teeth and the way they were spaced attracted my attention first. I tried it in the shower after filing down the edges of the teeth with a metal rat-tail file. It took me a couple of times to get the hang of using it.First off, don't even attempt to use this without a conditioner that has SUBSTANTIAL slip. I used Trader Joe's Tea Tree Tingle, and even with that I still ran into snarls and had to start over from the ends and carefully work my way up. For me, this comb works best when I use it with Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner. The slip from that conditioner is amazing, and it seems to melt tangles in my hair with ease. Using the comb knocks out any remaining tangles even when I get to my roots which have a tendency to mat. Forget about finger detangling my roots. I would be in the shower or sitting on my bed for hours.I still have to section off my hair when I use this, and it still takes some time to fully detangle my entire head (about 15 minutes). But at least now I can sit in my bath and detangle my hair without worrying about using up all the hot water or wasting it when it could be better used for thirsty plants.I am very glad I tried this comb. It makes shower detangling much easier."
1,Have used and loved entire Obagi line for years.  Highly recommend for aging skin but start early ......... you won't be sorry!
1,I have tried other creams and keep coming back to this one.Nice Moisturizer! I read some recent reviews saying theydidn't like the NEW upgraded version....but I assure you...itis the same and does not have any weird odor??I still love it!
1,This is a really nice soap and lathers up perfectly.  Great for both my face and for shaving my legs.
1,"Ok- here's the thing: the image in the pic on the right hand side of the screen is the bottle for the DICKINSON'S ORIGINAL WITCH HAZEL PORE PERFECTING TONER which is a 5 star pore perfecting toner (See my other review). The words describing the product under that image are the descriptive words for the DICKINSON'S WITCH HAZEL- the one in the BLUE BOTTLE.  Dickinson's does make a witch hazel in a yellow bottle. The differences between the blue and yellow bottles of Dickinson's witch hazels? WITCH HAZEL EXTRACT. The yellow bottle has witch hazel extract. Amazon has to fix the blunder. I made a review for the PORE PERFECTING TONER (The image in the picture on the right hand side of the screen) but now that I think about it, on that page- THE IMAGE FOR THAT PRODUCT IS THE YELLOW WITCH HAZEL BOTTLE WITH THE DESCRIPTIVE WORDS FOR THE PORE PERFECTING TONER. I made this review because of the folks saying that they didn't receive what's in the picture. I believe them because I see the error. YOU CAN BUY THE PORE PERFECTING TONER at Walmart or your other preferred drug store for about $3 cheaper than what Amazon is offering. All of T.N. Dickinson's products that I've tried are all 5 star witch hazel products. The only reason that I gave this one 3 stars is because of the ERROR here. The pore perfecting toner that is in the picture IS a 5 star item but I have a strong feeling that if Amazon doesn't fix the mix up- YOU WILL THINK THAT YOU ARE GETTING THE YELLOW BOTTLED PORE PERFECTING TONER  BUT WILL RECEIVE THE BLUE BOTTLED REGULAR WITCH HAZEL. *I am LC from NC*"
1,"This is a beautiful purple.  I thought it would be a little softer, but it is actually very bright and pretty.  Great formula, full coverage in 2 coats."
0,"Sorry but these round brushes are terrible for me.  I hate the fact that whenever you go to pick the hair out of the brush, the bristles poke underneath your fingernail causing redness and pain.  Even worse is that I live with family members who refuse to remove the hair from the brush so... guess who's job it is to remove the hair?  Hey *somebody* has to do it and it's me I'm afraid.  Ugh!!!"
1,I ended up giving this to my husband as I couldn't get it to lather in my hair. His hair is much shorter and didn't seem to bother him as much. The smell is great however!
1,"Ever since using the likes ofHeritage Store Castor Oil, 32 Ounce, I've been interested in trying different castor oils.  This one in particular is one that I found to be quite useful. It really does wonders for the skin. I think if you are looking into castor oils, this one would be good one to try."
1,Nice silver color. A little sheer but with 3 coats its completely opaque. what can i say its China Glaze. They rarely disappoint.
1,I have always purchased oily skin products and I did not realize I purchased an item for dry skin. Combined with the md forte 3 cleanser this product is literally amazing. Mt nasty acne issues have gone away and I am finally seeing a reduction in pore size. I have been using for about two months. It is a slow but steady improvement.
1,I gave this to my mom. She is a hair product freak and she really likes. She has very curl hair and Ouidad it is the brand for this type of hair
1,"While this is much stronger than other salicylic acid products I've tried, it smells really, REALLY funky. It also reacts weirdly with any other products I use, like moisturizer or the Persa-Gel - the other product sort of pills up and rubs off really strangely."
1,This is my favorite. It smells comforting. I think it smells like there is just a touch of cinnamon and musk with woods. Just my guess. I layer it with Marilyn Miglin Magic. It's wonderful!!!!
1,"Love Alba, love this gel, love this scent.  I will buy again and again.  And you will love it too!"
1,"Great product for the price, you only need a little bit!  I use it twice a week on my face at night!"
1,Some of the cons people write about this I kind of find as a pro. Yes it does crack a little though. But it applies nice. I really like how it lasts awhile but can be easily removed. Basically peels off. So if your looking for something that inks to you instead of being able.to peel it off after it dries then this isn't for you.
1,works for me... it has slowed my hair loss and I definitely have regrowth... my hairdresser says she sees a huge difference.  It's a slow process but definitely worth it.
1,"I have good skin and a couple of problem areas.  This works great.  I personally have not used the mist more than a couple of times, it seems to still work, but since I usually use it in the shower I don't generally use the mist.It helps with my T-zone."
0,Another failed sunscreen!It does not go on clear as advertised and it stains clothes.It dries out the skin and makes wrinkles more pronounced. I also had a breakout with this one on my face and neck as I did with the one for sensitive skin.Something in these Fallene products does not agree with my sensitive skin. This was the 2nd one purchased at the same time.
1,I don't know much about beauty products but I've been using this for a while.  I'm confident that it is working well.
0,"Maybe its me but this product doesnt seem to work at all, I had a few splinters and it did nothing for them."
1,A really good shampoo. I have tried other non sulfate shampoos but they either have a smell or don't really lather. So I did not expect the luxurious later of this shampoo. The scent of the hibiscus is very invigorating. Would recommend tis shampoo to daughter for my grandson who has a sensitivity to most shamoos she uses on his hair.
1,"I've been using this for over a year as part of my daily skin care routine and couldn't be happier. I'm an adult in my 30s who has tried every acne treatment under the sun. Most acne products are weirdly too drying for me, even though I have incredibly oily skin.I believe Clean & Clear and Neutragena are the only ubiquitous skin-care brands that sell affordable BHA exfoliators, and (hooray) Clean & Clear's Oil Absorbing Treatment works remarkably well for me, despite being comparably cheap. It keeps my sebum under control throughout the day (I apply it first thing in the morning), and it seems to help my makeup stay put (probably because my skin is less oily throughout the day). I use a BHA moisturizer at night and have not had issues with excessive drying. I've also been known to apply this product more than once a day when my skin is being particularly difficult, usually in the summer.While I don't think there is such a thing as a cure for my probably hormonal acne, this product has helped me manage it pretty successfully. I would say that the severity and frequency of my breakouts has diminished by more than half since I added this product to my skin regimen more than a year ago."
1,"Burt's Bees Lip Shimmers provide your lips with a bit of color and shine and are a nice alternative to lipstick.  Like the original Burt's Bees balm, the Lip Shimmers contain peppermint oil, which gives your lips a slight tingling sensation; I actually didn't like this at first, but I've come to enjoy the little pick-me-up it provides.  Rhubarb is a pinky red that is just a bit too bright for my tastes, so I've found that a light hand during application is key.  As another reviewer mentioned, I wish this product came in more colors, as I've sampled testers of the other colors and have found them all to be a bit on the bright side.  Finally, don't be concerned by the ""shimmer"" in the title, as you'll get more of a gloss than sparkle from this product. Overall, I would recommend Burt's Bees Lip Shimmers as great option for days when you don't want to wear lipstick but don't want to go bare."
1,i keep this eye gel in the fridge when i need a good pick me up under my eyes i apply this on a clean face and it makes me feel bright and refreshed i havent noticed anything with dark circles on fine lines. but im not repurchasing this product again on that note
1,"This product works well to cover gray at the stage in between hair color appointments. It seems a bit awkward to use at first, but once you get the hang of it, it does the job."
1,"very good comb, easy to hold on to.  granddaughter objects to the color.  what can I say?  she is way pickie.  I was 7 once but somehow I don't remember being allowed any personal opinions on things like this."
1,"When I couldn't find my old cleanser and everything else I tried failed, I decided to ""google"" it to see what everyone else was using.  This item came up again and again.  I have sensitive/combination/adult acne prone skin and so it's extremely difficult to find the right ""fix"" that doesn't cause more harm than good by causing eruptions or drying out and damaging my skin.  I was wary of this item because of all of the reviews that said it caused them to break out.  However, I decided that even if it did break out to hang in there for a week or two and see if it was the ""storm"" before the ""calm"".  It was.  I got some small blemishes for the first week or so and then it began clearing up my skin and even reducing the appearance of my pores!  Not to mention, my skin just ""felt"" better.  I am very pleased!"
1,"I WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO SOMEONE WITH DRY SKIN. IF YOU HAVE OILY SKIN, I'D PASS AND FIND ANOTHER ONE. THIS IS MY FAVORITE MOISTURIZER WHEN MY SKIN BECOMES DRY AND IT REALLY KEEPS MY ACNE AT BAY, HOWEVER, IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE OILY SKIN ONE DAY THEN USE THIS, YOU WILL BREAK OUT LIKE MADDD!! WHAT I DO, IS EVERY NIGHT I WASH MY FACE THEN RUB BP ALL OVER IT, THEN I PUT THIS MOISTURIZER ON. IT NEVER MAKES ME BREAK OUT WHEN I USE IT LIKE THAT. REALLY GOOD PRODUCT. JUST NOT FOR PEOPLE WITH OILY SKIN."
0,"I used this color years ago and was always happy with the outcome of the color. I thougth to give it a try again, and was so dissappointed with the result. I didn't like the auburn color at all, and above that it dried out my hair. I am so glad when all the color has washed out. The company must have changed the formula, because it is totally different from the color I had used some years ago. I will not purchase this product again!"
0,"I've been suffering from combination acne prone skin and thought that this would be the answer to my problems, with Salicylic acid as one of the ingredients and other multiple promises this moisturizer said it would do. However, I was horribly wrong; this not only made me break out in little pimples all over my face but left my face even more oily. This was also expensive so I was even more disappointed. In conclusion, I will NEVER purchase this again."
1,"This stuff holds the hair just fine, but I can't get past the smell...it's just awful! I have considered buying some essential oil of one smell or another and adding it to the hair spray just to make it smell better. I don't know if this would make it lose its' holding properties, but as it is now I don't use it, so if it failed after that addition, oh well."
1,"This is the mascara I always go back to. I try other brands, other formulas, but this oneworks best for me so I'm stickin' to it."
1,"I love the Meyer's hand soaps.  They do the job without harming the planet.  This parsley scent smells good, but my nose doesn't think it smells like parsley."
1,"Its a pretty summer color, however when I put it on my nails, I felt like I had red nail polish on..  I kept asking people how it looked and the stated it was a nice summer color.  It was just a little to strong for my taste."
0,"used it just as directed, but didnt appear to do anything.  i know i have little pores, but nothing??? first time using a product like this, wont be wasting any more money. . .. ."
1,love this stuff!
1,"This product has replaced my Proactive cleanser. It has 3.5% benzoyl peroxide, 1% more than proactive, so it really keeps your skin clear. CAn be used as a mask and cleanser. It is non irritating, and does not dry my face out. Dissolves oil too. I use the benzoyl peroxide moisturizer (step 3) from proactive. This is the only product that always works and does not irritate my skin, with exfoliants. I also use this with the Neutrogena Wave Duo, I rinse out the soap from the disposable pads and use it to deep clean my face."
1,"I ordered this product on Sept. 23rd and received it today, October 6th. It was well-packaged and when I opened it, it smelled very good. It has a nice, light fragrance, hence the 3 stars. Too bad I can't use it!Upon reading the full ingredients listed on the bottle I found that it contains grapefruit seed extract (I seriously don't know how I missed this fact when reading the product details! I ALWAYS read the ingredients list...I'm almost positive that the description did NOT include this fact at the time I decided to purchase). Anyhow, those of you on statin medication know that we're not allowed to ingest grapefruit as ""It can interact with cholesterol-fighting statin drugs by increasing the amounts of those medications in the bloodstream."" Also, ""The compound bergamottin is found in grapefruit, and when it interacts with certain enzyme systems in the body, it can prevent these enzymes from breaking down statins, which causes the drug to accumulate in high levels in the body. Some of the conditions this can cause are liver damage and rhabdomyolysis (severe muscle and kidney damage).""Since anything we put on our bodies is absorbed through our skin and into our bloodstream, I think I'll err on the side of caution and refrain from using this product :("
1,"Soaks in, good product, small amount comes out when you push the top, so no waste or contamination. I like Olay products"
1,"At first, I did see a pretty profound line on 1 side of my mouth when I first started using this product, but that was because I would pucker my upper lip, which the instructions tells you clearly not to do that. I view the DVD again to learn how to use it and the line is dramatically decreasing now. I use Collagen cream with this, and I believe that's what's helping the line iron out as well. I will continue using every day, no more complaints."
1,"LUSH's Fresh Farmacy is one of LUSH's best sellers for a reason: it works!This facial bar is extremly good for people with problematic and irritated skin.  It gets it color from the soothing calamine powder, which everybody knows works wonders for itching.I love this bar so much but I never keep a lot of it in stock because I noticed that unless the bar is fresh from LUSH, it starts to turn a whiteish pink color and gets kind of hard.  That's why I rated this bar a 4.  As far as the way Fresh Farmacy works, I LOVE it.  I ust took off one star because as I get to the ending part of a piece, I noticed the bar is really rough and I don't get as much lather out of it like I used to.  I've never tried storing it in a sealed container, but that may actually work better.I know you're suppose to let it dry out completely before storing, but my boyfriend just throws it in a zip lock bag when he's done using it.  He doesn't seal the bag, but it keeps enough moisture in it to keep the bar moist, not mushy.  I may try this way and if it works, I will update this review.Fresh Farmacy and Coalface (see my review) are still the only facial cleanser I use and my skin has been clear ever since."
1,"I'd forgotten just how wonderful Les Blondissimes hair color by L'Oreal really was until recently I used a hair color product by one of their chief competitors, and the color it left my hair was anything but what color it should have been!--I finally decided to give Les Blondissimes another try, hoping it might help correct the color my hair had become at the hands of the other brand--but, once I used Les Blondissimes, I could not believe how gorgeous the color actually had become thanks to it, and how beautifully conditioned my hair was--finally!--I will never buy another brand so long as I live now--it's my go-to brand from here on out!"
1,"I have really dry skin. It runs in my family and I've had to deal with it all my life, so I have experience with all kinds of lotion since I was a little girl. For dry skin I've mainly stuck with oil-based deep moisturizers. I tried ""water-based""-feeling type lotions before and they were always so lightweight. But then I discovered Aveeno moisturizing line, specifically the 18-hour and now it's all I use. I have need for nothing else. What I like most about it is that it PENETRATES and HYDRATES from within (rather than sits on top of skin acting as a sealant). It hydrates within and how long it lasts (staying power) is the best I've seen. Also, I'm NO LONGER left with an oily or ""smudgy"" body (I'd leave smudges everywhere I touched due to the heavier, less effective lotions of the past). I feel deeply moisturized and non-oily - can't beat it. I'm a customer for life!"
1,I use this with the rest of the Obagi line. My face is the best it has been for years. I buy this from Amazon & never regretted it.
1,"This is a lot like the Nivea Visage Q10 that stopped coming to the US and you can buy online still (made by the same company, Beiersdorf, in their factory in Poland). It's impressively cheap, it moisturizes really well, you can use it morning or night, it has no fragrance or dye, so you can use it around your eyes without them getting red or swollen.Negatives - it doesn't have the immediate effectiveness that retinol products do, then again you can't use those during the day. Also, an sunscnreen would make this more useful. I'm not a fan of using many different lotions, so I'm unlikely to buy this again, as it's neither an ideal night nor day lotion, even if it is a great value and a solid product."
0,"I've owned many hair curlers, and I was looking for one that offered large rollers and fast heat up.  I was disappointed on both points.  First, the ""large"" rollers are not large.  They're medium.  The smaller ones are really small.  I plug it in before my shower, and even after showering and blow drying my hair, it's still not really heated up like it should.  The only thing I can say that's positive about this product is the compact size of the unit and the number of rollers, which is nice.  But if you're looking for large rollers (greater than a one inch diameter, and something that heats up really fast -- this one is NOT for you."
1,"Back in the day, I would have seen a girl with her hair like this and thought she needed to do her roots.  However, I had gotten sick of my plain dark brown hair and wanted something new.  I saw this at Target and went for it.  I have actually tried before with highlighting kits to do this but thanks to the Feria brush it is now much easier to get this look.  My hair at this time is shoulder length and I took the brush and bleach and at chin level created a new look.  It is really cute!  I curled the ends and can't wait to premier it.  If it gets accolades, I will update this review!!!  LOVE IT...In case my low votes are due to my lack of editing...SORRY, My hair did look fantastic and A LOT of guys liked it!  I have used this again and again."
1,"I bought this color when I read the reviews. To me the color looks more orange red in the bottle ,but when you apply it to your nails it's a blood red color. I used sally hense red nail polis over to give it a gloss and a slash of shimmer. It's beautiful with or without. But it looks better to me with the shimmer. I haven't found a nail polish like that since I bought theon number 5 in red what a beautiful color."
1,"My hair get's a REALLY ugly red in the summer when I'm in the Sun. I have to use an Ash Color This toned it down a lot. I had to do my end's for 10 minutes and then all over for another 15-20. My hair tend's to not dye evenly if I don't do it this way. Even when I pay A TON of Money at Salon's. I'm very happy with this color. I have been dying my hair for 30 year's and  have tried almost every color. I used to use Feria, but I'm sold on this now!!!"
0,"I suffer from acne and wear makeup every day. I use Revlon Color Stay foundation and put a Baremineral's concealer powder over it, and finish with Maybeline translucent setting powder. This wash doesnt get it off. It gets off the powders and a part of the foundation, but it never does a good job. I stopped using it."
1,Love deep purples so much and soo glad I found this one!! The hint of shimmer isn't tacky at all and looks very chic and deep. In love
1,"I had this item in my wish list forever and I'm so glad I finally bought it.I use the buff puff with a good facial cleaner in the shower and wow - it exfoliates more effectively that anything else I've tried, and I've tried it all. I really feel like my serums and moisturizers are able to penetrate after using the buff puff instead of sitting on top of my skin. For the first few uses, I suggest using a very light hand, as it can be a little harsh."
1,"Purchased 5 roll-on fragrances in 1/3 oz bottle size: Majic (ok), Africian Musk (better), Forbidden Desire (ok), Egyptian Goddess (weak, not ok), Black Coconut (ok).  Not particularly impressed.  Too much carrier oil and not enough of the perfume scent.  So, you have to use more of the fragrance (1/3 oz won't last long).  The shipment was fast, was wrapped well, and the bottle/dispensers work very well.  I just wish the scents were more powerful.  Maybe I should try a few different scents..."
1,Love the scent of this product. I like all of Mrs Meyer's products and will buy again.  It's a very gentle hand soap.
1,"I love this so much and its so sweet...  When I saw it in stores it was great to have and use. This smells so nice like you want to eat your self up and can't wait to get more, Try it you'll love it!"
1,I love it. Will buy again! although it is a bit drying. it might not be a good everyday use.
1,"I loved it! I use it daily, and will definitely be buying again when this runs out. Thank you very much."
1,"We had used this product in the past to stop thumb sucking and it worked just fine.  Now our 7-year-old wanted help to stop biting her nails so we turned again to Mavala Stop.  And it worked!  It has been a week and she hasn't bitten her nails and is very proud of how they are growing.When we first put it on, she seemed to accidentally get it on everything - her food, her face, her lips - and the taste is bitter.  But she learned how to avoid that and now it is working well."
1,This really does cover under eye circles and redness but a little goes a long way. Since it's a thick cream stick you should mix in some moisture cream on your hand and smooth it on sparingly. Too much will look cakey and get into wrinkles. Just a very thin layer is best.
1,"I recently purchased an organic bath wash which had honey almond in it.  It smelled so great that I wanted something else with the scent. This was great!  I love to wear designer perfumes, but I also like simple fragrances as well.  This oil goes a long way and has a great smell.  I have used it many times for the last month, and the bottle still looks completely filled.  I think it will last for a long time.  Great purchase and excellent price."
1,I am Olay girl!  Ever since Olay has launched its regenerist line I have used all of them. Hands down the Regenerist serum is the best serum! I use it daily under my sunscreen and it makes my skin baby soft. Since I have been using Olay for about 5 years now my skin is even better than in my early 20s (I just turned 30). I would highly recommend people to use the regenerist line.
1,"I owned a Panasonic Pore Cleanser for years.  I used my first one all the time and because of that I never really had a problem with blackheads.  Pimples from time to time, but hey, natures beauty marks, right?!  Anyways, My cleansers battery died out after years of use and I figured my skin was fairly good and I didn't need it anymore.  Wrong!My nose and cheeks are problem areas. I wear sunglasses a lot and the plastic frames in Southern temps can make a girl sweat.  Combine that with makeup and southern temps and your pores get clogged.  After a couple years I started to see little black dots on my nose and sometimes on my chin.  Sure everyone gets blemishes from time to time, but I was shocked at how no matter what refiners and scrubs I used they just didn't go away.  I've used Biore Pore strips and while they take away some of the impurities, I find what they are best at is pulling the micro hairs that grow on you. You look at the strip think ""WOW"" but really it's not doing much at all.  So I decided to hunt down another Pore Cleanser and found this System.  After using it a couple times my nose is almost spotless.  I can barely see anything left behind.  My cheeks look clearer, and so does my chin.  Some have said that the Mist setting is useless, but I like it.The trick to this cleanser is use a hot compress on your face for a few minutes, I use the water as warm as I can personally stand it, and I do it a few times before using the cleanser.  Then I start passing it over my trouble areas.  I go slow never leaving it on a spot very long.  As my skin starts to dry I turn on the mist.  What the mist does best, to me, is as your skin starts to dry, it adds enough moisture to keep gliding the wand over your face without making it skip or having to stop and do another compress.  Of course The more you use it over time the more of a difference you will start to see but after just a few times, I vow to not go without another Pore Cleanser again as long as I can help it.I recently added TheOlay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, 0.68-Fluid OunceOlay to my regimen of weekly skin care and together my skin has never been softer or look more fresh and dewy.  Must Have For Me."
1,"I am disappointed in Cocktail Bling--I thought it would be more of a light, concrete gray, but it leans very purple/lavender. It is pretty and goes on smoothly and dries quickly, but it's not what I was looking for. I have Bobbing for Baubles and think that is the best shade of this collection--it is a deep, rich navy that looks beautiful on. The hunt for the perfect gray continues..."
1,"I got one of these years ago at a salon, and wore it out.  I checked Amazon last Christmas to see if I could find one like it, and voila!  I bought one for myself and several more to give out as teenager Christmas gifts.  It's a wonderful brush, and I will buy a couple more!  The best thing about it is that it doesn't hurt your scalp (it is very flexible) and it's great at getting through tangles."
1,"Well I was using Everpure for my horrible dandruff but it stopped working for me for some reason, so I decided to try this.  I love the lather and the way it leaves my hair feeling but it did absolutely nothing for my aweful dandruff.  I tried letting it stay on for three minutes, I tried washing every other day rather than every third day, and it didn't matter.  It just didn't work for me.  Still as a cleansing shampoo I felt my hair was clean and very silky soft, but since it didn't solve my problem I can't give it 5 stars."
1,"Been around a long time and with good reason, it works! Read an interview in a magazine with Tyra Banks and other super models who swear by this stuff.Smells great, works good, inexpensive ~  try it!"
1,"Yes, it's very expensive but so worth it. I wish I could afford to use the entire Demalogica line but it's just not in the budget.  The toner is very refreshing and just seems to balance every thing out. I would also recommend the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant.  I got it as a sample after a facial but I simply can't afford. I have found that St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub works really well and is a fraction of the cost."
1,"I used to use liquid foundation when I was younger and my pores were much smaller.  Now that I am in my 40's I find that liquid foundation doesn't apply well and leaves my face looking flaky.  This product is perfect to use in place of liquid, applies evenly and covers blemishes well.  It can be applied throughout the day to reduce shininess and doesn't cake or build up.  This is the only product I use unless I am going for a more dramatic look, in which case I use a silicone primer and liquid but, even then I apply this on top of the liquid with a brush to reduce shine"
1,I last bought one of these files in 1972 and I'm still using it! I have looked for another one for literally decades --- why didn't I think of Amazon sooner !?!These files last and last! They work great! They're reasonably priced. I wish I could say this about everything I buy.  Thank you.
1,"It is a teeny bit lighter in person than in the picture, but still a gorgeous color. I have yet to figure out how to keep ANY nail polish (aside from a gel manicure) from chipping, if anyone knows the secret please tell me! Overall I'm happy with my purchase as far as a &#34;regular&#34; nail polish goes, but I think I'll stay with the Sally Hansen Gel Manicure. The stuff I'm wearing now has been on for 5 days straight and still looks perfect. They just don't have the best selection in colors unfortunately, which is why I tried this."
1,"*****I really like ""Purity Made Simple"". It is a one-step cleanser for those of us who like things easy and who don't want to buy gajillions of products that we end up not using. It has a clean, fresh scent that is sort of herby, yet kind of minty, while not smelling like mint at all---it mostly just smells pleasant and fresh, if there is such a scent.I do not wear makeup at all, but my skin is a combination type. So I have dry spots and wrinkles, and then really oily places (like my nose and forehead). I am menopausal to boot so I have wrinkle concerns and no longer scrub my face with soap. ""Purity Made Simple"" is the solution to all of these problems for me. I put a little bit on my hand in the bathtub, and gently wash my face with it each morning. It feels so good and is fun to use, because your face feels incredible afterwards!It doesn't foam up at all, but it's not that kind of cleanser. You get used to no foam. Kind of like with your antiperspirant or your moisturizer---you don't want foam from them either, but you don't expect it right? If you're used to suds with a facial cleanser, I'm betting you'll get used to the simplicity and effectiveness of this product and will not miss your old cleanser one bit.Some other reviewers said it irritated their skin, which I'm sure can happen with any product. Check the ingredients listed on this page and make sure you're not allergic to any of them, then try the product, and hopefully you'll get to use it and be as happy with it as I am.You only use a little bit, so it lasts a long time.Highest recommendation.*****"
1,I had a guest who wore this and it was so amazing!! I just had to get some myself! It's just like hers I couldn't be more happy!!
0,"Even with the suggested heat-up time, it would never reach a temp high enough to create anything. Easy to use, and crimp plates were wide, if you do insist on buying. Too good to be true."
1,"Now that we have to cram into one suitcase, i got these strictly for travel. I haven't yet had the other problems people say. I just love the size of the rollers. Thanks to the reviewer who said converter- I assume in europe that a converter would have to be used on everything and I will be sure to bring one.I have been stuffing the big set into my suitcase, but this one will fit much better and hopefully not looks so suspicious on an xray scanner."
1,"I received a sample of the Fekkai Shea Butter Moisturizing shampoo and conditioner in the mail.  I tried it and very impressed.  I WAS considering purchasing, but the price put me off.  My next thought was to try Suave Almond and Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner . . . and to me, I received the same results for much less.  Although I am not knocking Fekkai in any way because it performed as promised, I felt I could achieve the same results for less.  I will continue to use Suave, have more $$$ in my wallet, and my hair looks and feels just wonderful!"
0,"I purchased this product from our local MCX for a change from my regular moisturizer, and two months later I'm less than enthused. I experienced no extreme medical issues, like some other unfortunate reviewers, but neither did I experience any sort of positive results. For the amount of money spent, I could have just as easily purchased a moisturizer from a local pharmacy for $5, gone for a nice lunch, and two months later had the same results.""Hope in a Jar"" did not work for me."
0,Tried this and even dousing different materials I found that it required way too much scrubbing and pulling on the eye area.  Back to Estee Lauder I guess :(
1,"I'm giving this curling iron five stars.  It has numerous heat settings, heats up quickly and works well.  The only problem is that it does NOT work on my short hair.  I should have listened to another review who said the same thing.  It's a great curling iron and deserves the five stars, the barrel is just too big for short hair.  I'm keeping it for when my hair grows back."
0,"I was so hopeful about this product. I tried it both on dry and wet hair, and either way, it just made my hair feel greasy. By the end of the day I looked like I hadn't washed my hair all week. I used varying amounts, pea to nickel-sized. Didn't matter. I give it 2 stars because it did make hair feel fuller (which is weird, since greasy hair is usually flat). I have very fine hair, and an oily scalp that needs to be washed daily. This just didn't work for my chemistry."
0,I didnt like this because it did not get hot enough and my hair was still frizzy. I prefer hot tools because it cord doesnt tangle and it is hot like the ones a professional uses since I do my hair at home. It is better the spend an extra 15.00 to have quality and use it for a longer time .
1,This product was just ok for me. I got it for the concentration nozel so that I can just blow out my roots (I have chemically relaxed hair)and stretch time out between my relaxers. I have seen women use it on you tube really well so maybe it how I am using it. I think it has potential to be a great product and depends on your skill. I found it easier to flat iron.
1,"It was only OK because yes, it takes make up off great, but it's very oily. So when you rub it on your eye lids, and say you don't completely take all your eye make up off on accident, it will rub off when you try to put a different make up on because it's oily. I would rather buy a store brand non oily one I think"
1,"I always use a toner and have been sticking to the same one for a few years now that I love, but this was on sale and decided to try it because my skin tends to really like AHAs and BHAs.Pros:* Makes skin super soft.* Doesn't dry skin out despite the pretty high alcohol content.* Didn't cause any redness or ittitation to my relatively sensitive skin.* Didn't break me out like some do upon first using them.* Could see the residue my cleanser left behind on the cotton square letting me know my face is clean.Cons:* Not convinced it did anything to shrink the appearance of my pores (mine aren't a huge deal to me and I didn't buy it for that, but don't expect it to perform miracles if you have large pores).* Pretty high alcohol content which I like to try and avoid for the most part (at least ones that have alot of alcohol in it; a little is ok for me).* Seemed to cause my already oily skin to be shinier. I'm used to an oil controlling toner that keeps the shine on my forehead at bay whereas this did not control oil for me beyond an hour or so (but it does not claim to be oil controlling and is most likely due to the high alcohol content that can make skin produce more oil).All-in-all, good toner for what it's designed for. I would repurchase again. I'm now using this as my nighttime toner or on days where i'm not going anywhere where I won't need my forehead to remain shine-free. Your results may vary depending on the sensitivity and type of skin. For mine, there has been no adverse effects and I feel it does a pretty good job of leaving it clean and toned. Hope this helps."
1,"This is a good face wash and not extremely expensive, which is nice. Usually it comes with prime shipping too."
1,"I've only used it a little, but it's a good brush. It's easy on my wig and worth the price. I'm glad I got it."
0,"I have been using the YouCurl wand (Conair) for over a year, and have loved it! Now my hair has gotten longer and so the diameter of my YouCurl created much tighter curls than I like, so I was simply trying to buy a similar product but of wider diameter, but this is obviously not the right choice:1) Using the base clip is not very intuitive, maybe its just me, but I couldn't figure out how to use the clip and twist my hair around it properly quickly enough (I'm sure if I spent some time on it, it would have been OK, but who has time to spend trying to &#34;train&#34; on using a curling iron?!)2) The spirals are purely decorative I think, there is almost no way for your hair to neatly fall between the spirals, so it just wraps around and over them, which in itself is no big deal, only it means they really don't have any purpose other than to make it look more gadgety.3) The heat adjustment knob has no numbers on it (yes, really, no numbers!) so there is no way for you to know what setting you are using, what temperature you are on, and if you happen to hit the right temperature by coincidence, there is no way you can replicate that experience next time4) Even when turning the dial to the maximum (at least I think its the maximum, again since there are no labels on the dial), the wand never got hot enough to actually create any curls.This is the second wider wand that I have tried and both were terrible (the other one was the Remington Keratin infused wand, which was only a minor improvement from this one).I will just buy another larger sized Conair model (the original model that worked perfectly for me for 2 years doesn't seem to have a large enough size, so I have to try a different model from the same manufacturer) lets hope that it works as well as the original!"
1,"Works better than OPI & CND Stickey for me. Polish stays on long. Goes on smoothly. It is my go to, base coat."
1,This product smells great and I love Alba products.  I've been using this product since finding out I was pregnant.  I feel good about the ingredients and will continue to use this product.
1,"This moisturizer is OK, but I find it a little greasy.  If I use it very sparingly it's not too bad, and I think the oil does soak in after it's been on your face for a while.  Overall, about the same as most other lotions of this type.  Will probably try something different next time."
1,I have very sensitive skin (to fragrances mostly) and this doesn't break me out at all.  I also have severely dry hair and using this 3 days a week has helped to make my hair a bit softer and MUCH easier to brush out.
1,I absolutely love the color. The problem is that it does not last past 2 weeks at best. It begins to fade from the first wash after you dye it quite dramatically. I love the color so much that this is the third time I have used it. I have become completely sick of dyeing my hair so much to keep a decent color. Going to find a better quality dye. I recommend going to Sally's and getting more for your money.
1,"I have been a sufferer of dandruff ever since I was a child. When I was younger, my head would itch so bad, I would sometimes scratch to the point my scalp would bleed. As I got older, I learned to only wear light colored tops and buy light colored coats and jackets so that my flakes wouldn't be so overt.One day I went to the doctor for a sinus infection and while I was there I asked him what he recommended for my dandruff - thinking he would write a prescription for radioactive kryptonite or something expensive that would turn my hair green.  The doctor said, ""Neutrogena T-Gel."" I asked, ""Is that a prescription?"" ""No,"" he replied. I was stunned. I had used Head and Shoulders, Selson Blue and just about everything else on the market - how would this be different? The doctor was persistent and emphasized that T-Gel should work, so I gave it a shot.This stuff has been a life-saver. It's not very glamorous looking - brown, weird smelling shampoo - but just a dollup the size of a nickel is all I need to lather up my entire head - and I have very thick, curly hair.  The longer you let it sit on your scalp, the better - 3 minutes is ideal. Despite the unusual smell from the bottle, your hair just smells fresh and clean.Unlike other shampoos, I have never had to take a ""vacation"" and use another shampoo to ""liven up"" my hair. T-Gel is pretty basic stuff - no perfumes or weird chemicals - the active ingredient, Coal Tar, is a byproduct from the coal processing industry and this gives it its dark color.  I have used T-Gel for almost 15 years now and I never have flakes and I probably scratch my head 3 times a year. About 30% of my hair is now white and silver and I have not had a problem with the shampoo discoloring it.Once in a while I will get free shampoo samples in the mail and use other shampoos, but just after 2 hair washings w/o T-Gel, my scalp will start itching again.  It seems expensive when you see the price, but one bottle usually lasts me for 3-4 months since you only need a little dab.When I used to color my hair, I used a conditioner for colored hair and it didn't seem to cancel out the effects of T-Gel... and after my hair is dry, I use yet another brand of mousse and a hair serum to style my hair - and still, no itching.If you have dandruff and haven't tried T-Gel, just give it a try - in one week, you should be symptom free!"
0,"I have been searching for a leave in conditioner which leaves my hair moist after cool blow drying and this conditioner left me with one conclusion. If you like straw like hair, it's the right one for you.I've been using less sulfate based shampoos and instead using Conditioning shampoos along with deep conditioning regularly. This leave in is water based and can be used as a detangler. Otherwise, don't look forward to moistness and shine you obtain from other leave in conditioners. This doesn't live up to the Lacio Lacios or Chi Silk Infusions of this world."
1,premium quality cotton swabs. dispenser not particularly handy.the cotton ends hold up. substitutes are cheaper in price and quality.
1,"I am a 20 year old african american girl. Okay so I know this product is for acne, your pores or whatever, but I heard you can use this for razor bumps as well and I have razor bumps in my bikini area.. So I tried this applying it as directed before bed.. It didn't sting at all the first time I used I applied it.. and I also applied it on my face. I have a very smooth face with like 1 or 2 small blemishes but it's not big deal.. But I haven't seen no changes.. I started applying this for three days every other day and now I use it everyday! If you apply this after you shave, girrrrrl your s*** is going to be burning!! Lol. Just make sure you apply a moisturizing cream afterwards.. Am I doing something wrong with applying this? I use black soap to shower and wait 30 minutes and then I apply the cream on the affected areas and have seen no changes.. Help!**Update April 24,2013Okay so after my poor review in February, I started seeing results in March when I used it everyday for like a week. My face got brighter and I had a glow to me. I experienced no pimples by using this product. I stopped using it on my razor bumps because I got burned smh. I currently just had a MAJOR breakout using the Neutrogena Oil free acne wash the orange one. That face wash murdered my face!! I have normal skin but I had some pimples by my chin and used the face wash for like 5 days and my face broke out so bad smh. I'm starting to use this glycolic acid again so hopefully it will clear my face up. I never have pimples maybe just one or two so hopefully it works again!"
1,"This polish very sheer. The end result is lovely and and clean looking, but it will take you three or more coats to get a good end result."
1,"The pigment gel is ok.  I read the reviews beofre I purchased and it was very true to the description.  I applied to the dark spots on my face and it seems like it burned my skin.  It left a dark mark, but when it peeled off the skin underneath was nice and smoth with no discoloration.  This bottle will last me a long time."
1,"Love this hot brush curling iron.  The brush is made of plastic so it grabs your hair -not like the boar or natural bristle brushes.  Also, it heats up very quickly - you don't have to wait longer than 2 minutes tops."
1,"This is the only body wash we use in this house.  All four females LOVE IT!  It is great on even the most sensitive skin among us.  It is gentle but leaves us feeling clean and our skin is so soft.  I wouldn't even want to try anything else.  As far as the scent, well, there really isn't a scent in this product.  The other varieties from Aveeno (with fragrance) I have not liked.  So I use this one and then after I shower I use Bath and Body Works Cucumber Melon lotion for a nice light scent on the skin.  I really don't think you can find anything better, whether you have sensitive skin or not."
1,"It's a Witch Hazel!!!  With three teen girls, this helps their skin clear.  It is much cheaper than those toners, and much more effective."
1,This shampoo is great! I was using another shampoo on my newborn for a few weeks and when I started noticing a tiny bit of flakiness on her scalp I switched to this shampoo and it cleared right up!!
0,"I purchased this facial moisturizer recently, as well as farther back a year or so. Both times I have ended up returning it, mind you I didn't purchase this on Amazon, but rather stores in-person at stores like Walmart and Target. This moisturizer says it is hypo-allergenic although I don't buy it. I am allergic to basically everything and rely on mainly baby products. I have very fair, sensitive skin and acne. I do not find this moisturizes, but rather burns one's skin horribly. After using the moisturizer, I had eroded, scabby sores all over my face. I think it made my skin much worse, although I am not supposed to be allergic to any of the ingredients. Also, for you fellow fair-skinned folks, it makes your skin look very red and ruddy in a bad way. Do not buy this, you will regret it, or at least I did."
1,I have very thick hair. I used this and it worked but not as good as I  had hoped it would. It was very cheap so I can't really complain much.
1,"I'm becoming obsessed with hair products so now I always like to have something in my hair even when I'm not styling it. I love this product because it's a spray, and it's quick to use. It doesn't leave my hands sticky, and I can put it in my hair as soon as I get out of the shower. I use it before I use other hair products too. Plus, it smells really good!I mostly love it because it's a spray and not a cream. It's cheap, and I will definitely be buying this again when I run out."
1,"I have no idea how this stuff works, but it's amazing. If you have dead skin it somehow clings to it so you can rub it off. I definitely don't think it's a gimmick as if there's no spot where there is dead skin, the product does not activate at all. This product is the only thing I've found that actively removes all the blackheads from my face. The only downside is the price. It's pretty expensive for the small quantity you get, especially if you want to use it all over and not just your face."
1,"My Food Coop features environmental conscious products, and I am drawn to them. We had a day where we could try products and speakers gave us the pros and cons of cleaning products, green and non-green. Mrs. Meyers hand soap won accolades from all participants.I was particularly drawn to Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Lavender Liquid Hand Soap. The aroma and scent is very light. It contains a recipe of aloe vera gel, olive oil and a unique blend of natural essential oils to create a  non-drying, yet softening cleaner for busy hands. And, the real plus is that it works. It feels good, non drying. I keep it in my kitchen and bathrooms.It may be more expensive than other liquid soaps but I love the scent and how well it works! It cleans effectively without stripping my hands. I even use it in the shower from time to time. All of the scents are beautiful and smell more natural and less chemical than other products.  I can't stand anything too strong.  Mrs. Meyers products have a scent that is light and fresh smelling without being cloying or overwhelming.  The hand soaps do a thorough job of cleaning, lather nice, and give my bathroom a fresh scent.  I'm very environmentally conscious, so I'm always looking for products that are lighter on the earth.  I particularly like the fact that her products are biodegradable and cruelty free.Recommended. prisrob 03-07-14"
1,"Although it is a gentle cleanser, I did not see any difference in my pores.  I would probably not purchase it again."
1,Received this product in excellent time and great condition.  My skin feels smooth and hydrated and so far I'm glad I purchased this product.
1,"I love Helen of Troy Professional Brush Irons.  In fact, I have one in almost every size; I use the size most appropriate for my then current hair style.  However, my favorite and most used model is the Helen of Troy Super Mega 1-1/2"" Professional Brush Iron.  It helps tame the frizzies when my hairstyle is a smooth one and is ideal for attaining just the right curve when my hair is styled in a modified bob.I have been using this particular model for almost 20 years.  The plastic on my first one became brittle from the heat and a number of bristles broke off.  I am now replacing my second Helen of Troy Super Mega 1-1/2"" Professional Brush Iron since the top has cracked and is in danger of coming apart.Through all those years and almost daily use, I have never had this brand and model of brush fail to heat up.  I particularly like the fact that the heat is not so intense that it will damage your hair, even when used daily.  A word of caution: the metal does get hot enough to burn your ear's top if you happen to accidently rest it there.  I do plug the brush in and turn it on high when I get in the shower.  It probably heats for 20 minutes during my shower and while I dry my hair. I have found that plugging it in for only a few minutes does not allow the brush to get hot enough to do what I want it to do.  I always unplug the brush when I am done using it.If you are looking for a well made, long lasting styling tool you may want to consider the Helen of Troy Super Mega 1-1/2"" Professional Brush Iron.  I've used this product for many years in the past and will continue to do so in the future."
1,I am trying to get rid of celluite on my legs and thighs...I know that it will take some time because it has been on my legs for many years.  I  love the way it smells and I just might have a chance to get rid of celluite.  It is easy to rub in and it does not stay oily when you rub it in really well. I do like this product.
1,This soap has amazing scent. It does suds up and leave hands clean. But I love it because this soap truly non toxic.
1,"What can I say, I don't use it but my lovely bride likes it.  From my point of view she doesn't need it but I try and go with the flow.  Price is better on Amazon than anyplace else I have found, up to and including eBay."
1,"RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream has actually helped my pores look smaller, which has been almost impossible with the other products I've used.  I think I'm going to like this very much!"
1,This lip moisturizer is GREAT.  It does not have any flavor and it makes my lips so soft and prevents them from cracking.  I highly recommend this product.
1,"I used to use all kinds of foundation and concealers, but I've never gone back since switching to Bare Minerals, and I probably never will. I have oily, acne-prone and scarred skin, and the combination of the Bare Escentuals primer, foundation, and tinted mineral veil hide most of my blemishes (with the exception of only my darkest scars), and my skin remains fresh looking and oil-free for the entire day. The quality of my skin has definitely improved with daily use as well. I highly recommend."
1,"Being an adult and using this in a pinch,it works.  Nice slip and nice smell, if you're a apple lover!"
1,"Many glycerine soaps melt away, this one really does last. Glycerine soap tends to rinse clean and is nice and soft on the skin. I know a lot of guys who prefer this soap over many other kinds. The vitamin e seems to keep the skin softer than most soaps."
1,"I hear all the hype about Orgasm...I wasn't impressed. The color doesn't work for me at all. I have a caramel complexion. However, Deep Throat is AMAZING! This is my go to color. I use it year round and have recieved compliments on it as well. I am going to venture out and try Desire, Taj Mahal, and Exhibit A next. I will be back to let you know how those worked for me as well. Great Stuff! Def. one of my favorite Blushes!"
1,"I have used these for years now. These are my absolute favorite!!! The pad is so refreshing and exfoliating, but not to harsh."
1,"I like it because it feels like its actually cleaning my face by scrubbing it. However, it did make my face feel a little dry and not as bright and I don't even use it that much (once a night) and I don't have any skin allergies."
1,The first thing I noticed about this moisturizer is how smoothly my foundation went on after using it.  (I used to feel as if my moisturizer and face makeup were too much for my 48 year old face.)  I'm looking forward to the possible fading of age spots in the future with continued use.The price is better than Wal-Mart's if you subscribe and it really is a convenience.  If you run low before you're due for a shipment you can adjust the delivery.  I also subscribed to the eye cream and night cream.
1,"The silver shatter is a good decoration to nails, but it doesn't shatter well.  I have used this twice and it just looks like silver polish over the base color.  Maybe it's because I put it on too thin.  The black shatter is so much better than the silver one.  Maybe I will use a thicker coat.  Hopefully that works."
1,"I have fine limp hair AND I am allergic to that toxic waste site leftovers that they label as ""fragrance."" With this shampoo I get gentile cleaning that leaves my hair healthy and doesn't send me into respiratory arrest."
1,"I first started using tea tree oil about 5 years ago, and my mother told me that Desert Essences has been around since she was young and was the most reliable brand.Therein I found the solution to many skin issues I had been experiencing.Acne: tea tree oil is great for people who suffer from acne, it is a natural antibacterial so your pores absorb the bacteria killing goodness and it won't dry out your skin. I apply a generous amount multiple times a day to blemishes and they're usually gone in a day.Athlete's Foot: tea tree oil is also an anti fungal and can be applied to athletes foot and any irritation in the toe nails (I know from experience)Dandruff: if you're experiencing dandruff you can add a little tea tree oil to your shampoo and it treats the cause (fungal I believe?) of the dandruff on the scalp.Pink eye: I don't recommend this for the faint of heart and DO NOT GET IT DIRECTLY IN YOUR EYES but if you ever have pink eye you can use a q-tip to apply a very small amount of tea tree oil to clean the crust from AROUND your eyes throughout the day but be very careful to not get it IN your eyes. It fumes made my eyes water a little but I found it to be very effective.Etc: whenever I experience any sort of irritation or abnormalities in my skin I immediately reach for my tea tree oil. The smell is strong at first but you get used to it pretty quickly and when you see how much it helps your skin you'll learn to ignore it."
1,"I have been wearing this scent off and on since high school. It is still and will always be one of my all time favorites. It has a light crisp scent that is very unique. It is not overpowering or heavy. It truly reminds me of the ocean with hints of lily.I don't pick up any fruity notes; I would say it is closer to a floral scent. This is certainly a summer or spring time scent. Very refreshing. I read a review of the perfume not lasting long enough.Here are some tips when applying perfume;1. Moisturize your skin while damp, this will help the perfume stay longer2. Allow Moisturizer to absorb and dry3. Before dressing, spritz on each wrist, behind the ear, behind the knee and/ or at your elbow. These are pulse points where the natural heat of the skin slowly releases the ingredients in the perfume4. Do NOT rub wrists together after you spray, this will break down the ingredients in the perfumeIf you follow these steps your scent will stay on all day long."
1,"this rosewater is lovely! im shocked there is negative reviews! if you dont like the smell of wild roses- dont buy it! this is a very floral-y sent. smells just like ""fresh cut roses"" Yankee candle. for me i love it. i use it as a body spray and got so many complements. also works great to set my makeup. definitely recommend."
0,"Don't bother! What a waste of time. On the side of the box it states what color your hair will turn out based on the color of your hair. My hair is dark brown/ black.  The turnout color would be a bright intense red, exactly what I wanted. What color did my hair come out? Dark brown/ black with a hint of red in the sunlight. Nothing like it states on the side of the box.  I pursed this product over another based on the color chart and spent extra to get it.  Won't ever buy from L'Oreal again!"
1,"Like Coriana I've had a less than positive experience with Pro-Gest.  I don't blame the cream itself, but my own stupidity for believing all the hype on the Internet about an automatic need for progesterone.  I'm 63, have never had a serious problem with menopause and never used HRT of any sort before trying Pro-Gest 6 months ago.  I was looking for a natural solution to occasional fluid retention and bloating and found Dr. Lee's books and the term ""estrogen dominance"" on so many websites.  To make a long story short, I weighed 120 lbs before starting Pro-Gest and now weigh 125 lbs with no change in diet or exercise.  I also cut out parabens, caffeine, etc as suggested by several progesterone cream promoters (as these things can aggravate estrogen dominance brought on by ""awakening estrogen receptors""). I quit using the cream one week ago with no negative side effects and am hoping the 5 extra pounds are just fluid retention that will go away with time.  Be warned: this stuff can cause weight-gain!  And do post-menopausal women NEED progesterone since they are done having kids?  If you feel okay without progesterone cream, please think twice before using it (unless you are trying to gain a few pounds of course!).Update: For progesterone users struggling with weight-gain -- try taking Indol-3-carbinol with flax lignans.  I'm using the NOW brand purchased from Amazon. This stuff blocks the ""bad"" estrogens causing many of those undesired side effects and replaces it with ""good"" milder estrogens.  Helps get rid of that excess fluid."
1,Sand of a Beach is a shimmery neutral that I love to use.  I was lucky to find it from an Amazon provider.  It is the perfect color for almost any time of year and for any occasion.  It arrived carefully packaged and a couple of days earlier than promised!  I would not hesitate to purchase from this provider again.
1,"This has helped with my eczema, but the strong smell is difficult for me to handle.  I am very sensitive to fragrances and odors."
1,"The smell is nice and pretty true lemon, somewhere between juice and rind. However, I find myself having to use more of it than my other EOs to get a good smell. So I think over time it might not be worth it."
1,"I also use NOW coconut, rosehip seed, jojoba, grapeseed, & sweet almond oils (probably missing a few).  This product meets my expectations.  I have not tried it on food (I use coconut and olive oils for that) but it is great for skin and hair.  I use it alternately with the aforementioned oils."
1,I am on accutane and can't have anything harsh on my skin.  This is one of the few products I found that wouldn't strip my skin of oils and wasn't fragranced.  It still cleanses and works great.  I will continue to buy.
0,I'm asian but my hair is still not very thick.  This curling iron doesn't work at all.  No curls whatsoever.
1,"i love this mascara, the brush and consistency work perfectly together to give a feathery fan of darkened lashes without looking like you obviously have mascara on, which when working in a professional setting is really important.  what i love most is i have to be a huge lash comb fiend with most mascaras to avoid the awful spikes look or worse, clumps. this mascara does neither, i don't have to comb at all and i'm always in a rush so saving a another tool and step is great.  probably not intense enough for night looks, but for day to day this is perfect."
1,"The lavender body wash smells so good and lathers up so rich that I call it my ""affordable luxury"".  I truly feel pampered each time I use it. The bottle is big and lasts a long time.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I feel it could be a tad more moisturizing.  It's not drying by any means, but I don't feel like I can skip my post-bath lotion application either."
1,This hair dryer was EXACTLY what I was looking for!! I needed a wide mouth dryer for when I straighten my bangs and this one is perfect. I'm actually thinking about buying like 6 more in case they stop making them. lol  I straighten and then feather my bangs (shut up don't make fun  -the 80's will never go out of style) and this hair dryer works perfectly!! Buy with confidence!! -hot 80's hair chic  :)
1,It's a good mascara. I usually don't get waterproof mascaras because they make the lashes really stiff but this is incredible because the lashes are still soft.These hold the curls really well but don't make the lashes voluminous or longer.Feel free to ask any questions!
1,The never fail good old soft and full still thickens and darkensNs my lashes better than any other mascara I've used.
1,"One of the things that drew me to this cleanser is that it claims to even out skin tone. I have been consistently using this for a couple of weeks now and I do have to say that I notice a difference in my skin tone, it looks brighter and whiter!  That being said, I wouldn't say that this fades dark marks or any major hyper pigmentation.  Another claim that this product makes is that it prevents breakouts which is totally true, I haven't seen an acne breakout since before I started using this product.  However, I do have some persistent acne that was there before I started using this product and this cleanser has not made those disappear; although I do feel that this product is gentle and helps soothe my existing breakouts.  The product is fragrance-free (chemically wise) however it does have a light natural scent that, almost like soy (go figure...) It also has a really nice lather that remains potent while you are massaging your face.  I have oily acne prone skin and I liked how this cleanser has a foam consistency as the foam gets rid of any excess oil without over drying your skin.  I like how this product is available at any major drugstores and that the price is not insanely high for such a good product.  Overall, this product isn't the holy grail of cleansers but it does the job quite well :)"
1,"Awfully reasonably priced, this mascara is almost perfect.  I read the reviews before ordering it.  Some reviewers felt it clumped; that problem was easilyapproachable by following the package instructions to apply second and later coats before the previous coats dried.  I also poled my Facebook Friends; they liked this product.  Thirdly, the results in the mirror were excellent, EXCEPT . . . and this problem I have not yet solved--and therefore will probably go back to my more expensive previous brand.  It is very, very hard to apply this mascara without getting bits of it on your skin where you don't want it.  Cleaning those mars up causes smudging--a mite too smouldering a look for me."
1,"I've been using this lip color for many years. I like the raspberry shade of pink, the ease of application, the long-lasting color that rarely needs a touch-up. It stays &#34;put&#34; and doesn't run into those lip creases we develop as we age.  My only complaint would be the frequency with which I have to buy the tubes.  Using daily, the color side of the tube honestly doesn't last more than 30-40 days for me.  I always end up with the clear gloss side being more than half full when the color side is empty.  I think more lip color could be gotten from the tube if the applicator was as long as the tube of color.  I always think there is more product at the bottom that I just can't get to with the provided applicator."
1,"I love white nail polish but find most brands sell whites that are too sheer and require a thousand coats before they start to look white.  This essie color is opaque and 2-3 coats gets a great, crisp white."
0,Got 2 OPI nail polishes. It stays one single day. American quality sux sux sux sux sux. Dont waste your money. European rules.
1,"The one complaint I have about this product is that I think ""Chihuahua"" is a very odd name for a lip gloss shade. However, my criticism ends there. I generally hate lips gloss in general because most products are sticky, never stay in place, and have a weird smell to them. NARS lip gloss is PERFECT. No stickiness, no smell, and it STAYS PUT! For a long time, in fact! The gloss comes in a bunch of beautiful colors that look great on their own or over a lipstick. I will definitely buy this again and plan on trying some other shades as well. Love it, love it, love it!"
1,"I've used this for several years now, probably bordering 6 years. The formula hasn't changed and if it did, I have felt no difference. For the price, this is amazing stuff. You can almost feel the crap being taken out of your pores. When you first apply it, there's a nice tingly, non-painful minty feeling.I use this as both a cleanser and a mask. Works fine either way. My only suggestion is that they find some way for the mask to roll off smoother. I would pay double for that. Right now, using it as a mask and washing it off is a pain."
1,"I haven't been a big fan of Prada's fragrances over the years but absolutely fell in love with the sweetness and candy-like scent of this perfume! This smells like a sweet, decadent caramel with tones of vanilla and I'm not sure what else, but it smells great! Although, I must say that this seller is asking for WAY too high a price for this bottle! You could get the 2.7 oz bottle for around the same price at Neiman Marcus (the 1.7 oz for around $80 if you prefer a smaller bottle)!"
1,"Thus far I have been using this product for about two weeks, and I have to say that it does what it says it will.  I was starting to get laugh lines around my mouth, and one of the laugh lines has all but disappeared and the other one is greatly reduced.  I don't know what's in this product, but there is something in it that's magical.My only problem with this product is that it does leave a silky residue that I can feel on my face. I have also used Origins White Tea Skin Guardian, which is a similar serum, and it does not feel this way...of course Origins is double the price, so I suppose you get what you pay for.In all, this product is worth buying.Update:  I understand that Olay tests on animals...if that is not a problem for you, then try this product; otherwise, I would move on...check out [...] for a list of companies that do not use animal testing in their beauty products. Alba Organics, Mychelle, Dr. Hauschka, Origins, and Kiss My Face are companies that come immediately to mind."
1,I really like this condition it makes my 3a-3b hair soft and manageable. My daughters like it also I have not tryied the shampoo yet. but will soon.
1,This product helped with hyper pigmentation from acne. It is not a overnight cure but at the end of the bottle you will see results. At first I had a lot of peeling and my face needed to get acclimated. Keep in mind I am not one to give a review right away. I sit on a product for a long time before I even think of reviewing it.
1,Use it in the morning after cleaning my face.  I use strictly RoC products and love the results.  Highly recommend them.
1,"I read Waterproof Eye Makeup Remover and thought &#34;Hey, I can finally used something other than baby oil, or other house-hold oils,&#34; thinking that it wasn't an oil bases remover. When it arrived I find out that this product is essentially just unscented mineral oil. It works and I'll use it until it's gone but I'll go back to using coconut oil when it's gone. If, like me, your use an unscented oil for moisturizing (I use coconut oil) then make it work double duty as a makeup remover as well and save a couple bucks and cut down on counter/makeup drawer clutter."
1,"I wasn't sure what to expect from a parsley fragrance, but it is fresh and wonderful smelling. I love Mrs. Meyer's products and this was a really good deal for 2 bottles at less than $8!!"
1,"They are quick,and easy. The steamer heats so fast, and cools at the same rate. The curls come out beautiful you do have to let them set a while thought, or you will jsut have curly ends. The only thing I wish is there were more rollers in a set, but you can always order more :). Very pleased with my purchase!"
1,"This moisturizer is PERFECT for me during the summer/spring/fall! It is not oily at all, has spf in it, and is very moisturizing! It doesn't make your skin or hands greasy, which is great for me, as I have oily skin. However, in the winter, my skin does tend to dry out and I do find that I need something a bit heavier, so I use the night cream. For most days though, this is perfect!"
1,"This is the first winter of my life that I have had my skin dry up so fast like it has been. I concocted a mixture of Shea butter, coconut oil, cocoa butter oil, vitamin e oil and have been putting it on my skin just for my skin to suck it in and be dry and itchy in about 2 hours. Yesterday, I bought this product, along with the matching body wash. No dryness, no itching.  I slept without scratching all freaking night for the first night in a month or so. What a relief! This is my new wintertime lotion."
1,I tried this to use in conjunction with my other ROC products and to follow the ROC serum.  I feel that it provides only a very mild moisture that is not enough for very dry skin but then I live in a dry desert area.  I need to follow it up with Argan oil to achieve the moisturization that I need prior to applying foundation.  Wish that I could give a higher review as I love all my other ROC products.
0,This does provide a good heavy coverage but it makes my under eyes look very crepey & old.... I'm only in in my 40's but this makes my eyes look ancient....
1,"The Aquis Microfiber Hair Towel is very absorbant and soaks up water in a jiffy.  The towel is big enough to wrap around very long hair and is shaped longer lengthwise to make a turbin if desired.  Hair dries much quicker with the use of this towel.  I see only one drawback, and that is the towel is sort of smooth and a little bit slippery, which takes some practice to get it to stay on your head.  This is the only towel I reach for now after washing my hair and makes for less drying time with the hair dryer. Worth the price and a good investment for those of us with longer hair."
1,Queen helene products are very good! they have been around for at least 30 years and these days with so much competition and consumers trying to get the most for their money it shows how good of a product this is .... skin care fads come and go just like everything else but the really great ones stick around...this  is a great product !!! if you are tired of wasting your money! give it a try ! if you like mint there is a mint julep also!!!
1,"I bought these because I've been looking for a new curlers set since the last two I've purchased either wouldn't get hot enough or were too cheap and wouldn't stay in my hair. I like that the curlers have a foam base so they form around your hair perfectly. It's a bit different to have to heat each curler individually before use, and the learning curve on it seems to be a little bigger than I anticipated. However, it does heat the curlers very hot and quite quickly. In the time it takes me to figure out how I want a curler in my hair, the next one is ready to go, so I it really doesn't even affect anything. In the photo you will notice the base piece. It works by filling the inside of the base with water, about half way, and then placing one curler on the top for steam to make the foam curler hot. Then you remove the foam curler, use it as you like to create the curly look you're going for. I suggest putting a new one on the steam base prior to putting the hot curler in your hair, so by time you're done the new curler is ready to go. The set comes with a nice plastic bag with handles to store all the pieces of the product in.My only real issue is the clips that they curlers come with. When I use them on my top layer of hair, I notice that my hair will get a flat ""crimp"" in it at the base of the curl and I'm not a fan of how that looks. To fix that I've been using my own clips on my top layer of curls. Thus, now my only issue is just practicing and perfecting my use of them. I've read other reviews where people wore the foam curlers to bed, I have no idea how they do that because even though they're foam, they have hard plastic circular ends that I feel would be uncomfortable to lay your head down on... then again mom always said pain is beauty."
1,"Light weight, non damaging and the perfect blow out brush. I will never use any other brush again, this is perfect!"
1,"I used to use this entire line, and it's like a cruelty-free, vegan ProActive, perfect for my oily teen skin!"
1,"Around 30, I started getting frown lines while still having pimples (yay!). I started using Olay Total Effects nightly for my combination skin (stork bites around nose, too). What a difference! It absorbs perfectly and leaves no film, and there's no adjustment period where your skin breaks out. Helps fine lines APPEAR LESS (not sure it can get rid of them) and balances skin. You don't need much so that helps the $ a bit. I don't use it under makeup because I use mineral powder only and it gets in its way if i don't wait 15 minutes (time I don't have in the morning, but you might!).Lately I found that soap dried my skin too much so I grabbed some Olay Daily Wash too - perfect. No dry skin, redness gone, and no breakouts at all. Pretty affordable too (compared to the moisturizer). Tone is overall evened out. Skin's just a bit brighter.If you have average to sensitive skin with no major issues to contend with, Olay products are a perfect, SIMPLE solution to maintain healthy skin. It has never required an adjustment period for me, spreads well, and never leaves a film. They interact well with each other, too.  No overnight miracles but overnight RELIEF with long-term improvement. Strongly recommend. Since it lets you keep it simple, it remains affordable enough and definitely available anywhere."
1,"Olay Regenerist products have been dependable for years. Just started using the Deep Hydration Cream. Love it and just purchased 2nd bottle. Love the cream, love the dispenser, but don't love how little cream is in the jar."
1,Product is GREAT!!! Use it almost daily and I have shoulder length hair. Dries my hair faster than my normal blow dryer and gives tons of volume.
1,"I use as a quick face wash that I keep on my nightstand for lazy nights. It's such a gentle toner and the fragrance is lovely. It cleans well (I can see the makeup and dirt on my cotton pad) and my skin does feel tighter and refreshed, but not dry. So glad I found this."
1,"I used to spend a fortune on salon brand shampoos and conditioners, thinking they were much better for my hair than the ""grocery store"" brands. Then when traveling and not being able to find my conditioner in an ""under 4 oz."" size that I could carry on the plane I decided to wait until I reached my destination to buy some. I bought this one because I like the name brand that it is comparable to, but also because it was cheap and I wouldn't feel bad about leaving a good portion of it behind at the end of the trip. (I gave the remaining conditioner to the person at the hotel front desk).I was so surprised to find that this conditioner left my fine, flyaway hair just as soft and manageable as the more expensive brand. My hair is a tangled mess after I wash it and I have to use a conditioner.  It also keeps away dryness.  I couldn't tell the difference between this conditioner and my much more expensive salon brand! Still, I thought maybe it was just the difference in water or the weather at the place I was staying on the trip. I bought the shampoo again at home when I ran out of my salon brand and found that it performed just as well with the local water, weather, etc. That was 4 years ago and I have been using Suave shampoos and conditioners ever since. I haven't found a single one that I don't like and I've saved a bundle on shampoos and conditioners. Two thumbs up for this product!"
1,"Thank you Earth Science for another natural product I adore!I just purchased this facial cleanser earlier today, and like the other Earth Science products I have bought, I am very pleased with it.Gentle, lathers quickly so only a small amount is needed, very affordable, smells great, and leaves my skin feeling clean and healthy. No tightness at all, no irritation, and no residue! I dont think you can go wrong with this cleanser, its awesome for my acne prone/sensitive skin. It also doesnt dry it out and thats wonderful!Buy it!"
1,"Suave Naturals Shampoo, Daily Clarifying 12ozClears all of the chlorine & gook from products out of your hair.. love it"
1,This is one of the very best astrigent acne fighting pads that I have found yet! Very fadt shipping due to prime. Thank you!
1,"This is a beautiful perfume! Nice, clean scent! Perfect for day or night and never gets old. I ordered this perfume (and this was the best price offered), and it came with a lotion too! That was a nice unexpected surprise! :)"
1,"This brush packs a wallop! It is so difficult to find a great hairbrush with the pic for parting the hair on the end of the handle. I have looked at Beauty Supply stores to no avail and was not expecting much ordering this brush online without touching it or seeing it up close, but boy was I pleasantly surprised. The 2 inch barrel is perfect for my shoulder-length hair. I love the pic on the end to part my hair while blowdrying...which was initially my main consideration as I can find basic round brushes anywhere but not with the pic. BTW the pic can also be used to remove hair between the bristles as well. It smooths my wavy hair easily without it getting caught on the rubber handle which has the perfect grip. The bristles are the perfect length...they are neither too short or too long and I don't feel that it is pulling my hair too much. You will not be disappointed if you purchase this brush. I like it so much I am ordering a back-up."
1,"FORMULA: milky, lathers easily, gentle, leaves your skin hydrated and not feeling dry/tight.I'm admittedly lazy about washing my face at night--I don't like using a makeup remover AND using a separate cleanser afterwards--that's why I don't like cleansers that can't be used around the eyes.This cleanser removes all my makeup without having to scrub hard, and I wear waterproof eyeliners. One of the best aspects about this cleanser is that it doesn't sting my eyes at all. It's gentle on skin and doesn't dry it out afterwards--which is saying a lot for me, as I have sensitive dry skin. I can't think of a single bad thing about it, it's my new 'holy grail' cleanser :)."
1,"I bought this because it has soy in it and I know soy helps to even the skin tone. I thought the salicylic acid it contains would help to keep my skin clear as well. But this made my already oily skin appear to be greasy. By mid day if I ran my hand over my face I could see the oil on my hand as well. There is also only 0.5% salicylic acid which really does nothing to control chronic acne.The good points are that the pads are nice and large and it smells nice and lathers up nicely. In fact I continued to use it b/c I liked the way the lather felt on my face, but it just got to be too oily for me so I stopped. If you have dry skin, I recommend it, but I do not recommend it for people who have oily skin and chronic or severe acne."
1,"I'm not sure if it's because I'm used to foam, but this product doesn't do it for me. I was very disappointed. I should state however that I have a very clear youthful complexion with combination skin.  I think this would work well for those with dry skin because it feels a little too heavy after washing with mine.  It does feel silky but like I said for someone with combination skin it might be too greasy/heavy. I feel like I'm wearing makeup. I'm certain that if my skin was dry I would love it though."
1,This serum works so well on my skin. I highly recommend this product for anyone who has fine lines or would like to prevent them.
1,"This is a light pink color. 2 coats are sufficient for french manicure. As the polish is translucent, the pink color would not be visible unless you apply about 3 coats. But this made it a very weird pink, so I am sticking to 2 coats.It goes really well with Essie Marshmallow for french manicure."
1,"I feel like this keeps my face smooth and it doesn't ever cause me breakouts.  I am in my thirties and have this on subscribe and save because I like it so much.  It is a good price here, and Olay even does rebates sometimes if you buy $50 of their products."
1,"This mirror is huge, but feels flimsy, as though it might fall out of the plastic covering if I shake it too much. It's good for the price, but I wouldn't use this as my only mirror."
1,"This is a dark gray/green which leans more gray or green depending on the lighting you're standing in.Either way, it's a gorgeous color that, I think, can be worn by all skin tones."
1,Great seller. Great product. I love this soap for my face; it cleared up all all all all all my acne within 2 weeks.
1,"There are no brands that are even close to being as good as this adhesive. I've tried Revlon's adhesive, and it didn't hold the eyelashes on at all. Afterward, I was really discouraged and skeptical about getting new adhesive, but all it took was one try and I fell in love. I will never buy any other adhesive."
1,"This has become one of my favorite creams.  I love the soft silky feel on my face, and the lightly perfumed scent.  I try to use it sparingly so that I don't run out.  My only complaint is that I wish it came in a larger size.  Would definitely buy again."
1,"Suave is good value for a quality product. When I use the strawberry shampoo together with Suave strawberry conditioner, my hair smells luscious, and people tell me so. I try other brands every now and then, but I always go back to Suave."
0,"I have to wonder about all the 5 start reviews?  My experience is:1. at bedtime-wash my face with facial cleanser2. apply them exactly as described on the package and website3. they barely stick on after spraying them with water4. go to sleep, wake up in a few hours, they are all aready came off5. in the morning pick up all the unstuck ""frownies"" and put them in the trash6. look in the mirror and see absolutley no difference whatsoever.Dont waste your time or money"
1,"This is a nice spray perfume.  The scent stays on longer that others.  My husband liked it, too.My teenage daughter snuck some when I wasn't looking. I liked the price, too."
1,"I wash my hands a lot (kids, chores, cleaning, etc) and I have naturally dry skin anyway, so during the winter, my cuticles and fingertips will often crack from being so dry. This product works wonders, lasts through handwashing, smells good (no chemical smell) and uses natural ingredients. I'm very sensitive to heavy perfumes, and this salve has a pleasant smell like natural honey-beeswax.If you have cracked hands, give this one a try. I find that it works even better than vaseline."
1,"I  use light, delicate nail colors & prefer natural tan tones with a hint of peach or pink.  It's becoming increasingly difficult to find the shades I prefer especially colors that have the right amount of pearl in them. In the container, O.P.I. Hawaiian Orchid. looks like the exact color I want.  It looks like pink, with a hint of tan, maybe a light mauve, and has a slight shimmery iridescence to it...no pearl & not exactly a matte finish either. However, when I apply it, it is a very, very sheer pink, looks like it has a matte finish with a tiny bit of  iridescence. I apply at least 3 coats to get the coverage I prefer. I like the fact that there's no pearl in it, but wish the iridescence showed up more than it does. However, the pink is a nice shade, not bright, but an elegant, medium pink color with no pearl in it.  I always useNail Life Revitalizer Treatment Original Formulaas both an undercoat & overcoat."
0,"I can't seem to get over the feeling of washing my face with Tang.  I was hoping for a cleaner citrus smell.  I did continue to use the product to see if I could sense the benefits of the brightening, renewal, and  ascorbic acid anti aging properties.  And I'm sorry to say, I haven't noticed a difference in a month of using this product.  I will not be purchasing again."
1,I like the Neutrogena hand cream because the consistency is slightly different from a regular body lotion.  It seems to last a bit longer.  The size of these is convenient as well.
1,"My two-year old toddler has suffered from bad scalp eczema for most of her life, with scaly itchy lesions that she would scratch to the point of bleeding. I've tried all baby shampoos on the market (Johnson and Johnson, Aveeno, California Baby, Mustela) and none helped.A few months ago I discovered thatDove Bar Soap, Sensitive Skin Unscented, 4 Ounce, 16 Counthad been the main cause of redness and intense itching on her skin, which doctors thought was atypical eczema. After discontinuing Dove her skin has mostly cleared up and she no longer itches.I wondered if the detergent (surfuctant) base in most baby shampoos could be triggering a similar response. I knew dandruff shampoos were sometimes recommended for cradle cap in babies, so I tried a small amount (quarter size) ofNeutrogena T/Sal Shampoo, Scalp Build-up Control, 4.5 fl ozon her, left it on for five minutes, rinsed well and reapplied, leaving it on for another five minutes. I thought her curly hair would be a dry frizzy mess but was surprised when it dried and it was very soft and wavy; a dime size dab ofAveeno Baby Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream, 5 Ounceworked through her hair and scalp, a spray of water and some scrunching is all that's needed to form ringlets that hold all day. Her scalp cleared up in less than a week, and although she isn't cured - it comes back if I don't use it on her -  I'm glad to finally have found a solution.I use T-Sal once or twice a week on her, if any scales reappear - otherwise, I useBella B Bee Gone Cradle Cap Baby Shampoo 8 Oz. This shampoo is aloe based, hypoallergenic and paraben free, with a light fragrance that hasn't caused any issues. Both shampoos have worked well on my other children who sometimes get cradle cap as well.On my end, I am sensitive to fragrances and my hair reacts terribly to strong sulfuctants and silicones found in ""hydrating"" shampoos, causing a huge amount of frizz, dryness, build up and breakage. Before trying T-Sal on my children, I tried it on my wavy hair. I was also surprised to see how well T-Sal cleaned and how soft and light feeling my hair dried afterwards. I've also noticed it helps my hand eczema (from using strong detergents such asDial 1423982 Purex Ultra Free and Clear Concentrated Liquid Detergent, 100oz Bottle, (Pack of 4)), if I leave the shampoo on my hands as long as I do on my hair.I now use T-Sal to help remove product build up and alternate withDHS Clear Shampoo 16 ozandDHS Conditioning Rinse with Panthenol, Fragrance Free 8 fl oz (236 ml), both very mild no-frills products that work really well.The only thing I don't like is the small size. I've bought a large size T-Gel to see if it's more cost effective and will report back after I try it."
1,"Now, I must admit my use of this is a bit unconventional. I happened to see my Doc one day about my acne issues (I'm 26 and HAD bad cystic acne), and she had asked me if I was using a retinol product, and I told her no. And so I got to thinking and looking into them. I went with Philosophy because of their reputation and how gentle this product is supposed to be. Anyhow, I got it home and (I don't remember when it started), but my cystic acne break outs started to decrease, then started to disappear. It didn't even occur to me that it was this product until there were a few nights that I was too lazy to put it on and I broke out the next day. This stuff is amazing. Now, do I still get breakouts? Yes, but they are not the deep, painful ones and there are not as many. If you have had cystic acne and know the pain associated with it, you know how much of a miracle it is to have it gone. I should also note that I am allergic to benzoyl peroxide - and this stuff does nothing adverse to my skin - doesn't even dry it out.That being said, I love the fact that I am also getting the anti aging benefits - two products in one! I would recommend anyone suffering from acne to give it a try, although I know it isn't likely to work for other people, it did for me, so I think it's definitely worth a try.I'm only 26, so I don't have any lines or wrinkles to really give an opinion on the anti-aging benefits. But any retinol product is proven to benefit aging skin, so I'm sure it's there. While it might not be a high enough dosage for some, it is gentle enough to use every night and not cause ill-effects, so you kind of have to weigh your options with that.And that will do it for my long winded review. While not all Philosophy products are hits - this one definitely is!--------------------------------------Update 6/21/14:I felt compelled to write an update as I feel, recently, that I've seen new benefits. Let me explain:I recently had a child, and when preggo, retinol products are a huge no-no. So I wasn't able to use this for several months. I just started using it again, thinking maybe I wouldn't need it (my boy gave me amazing skin! so weird!). But boy was I wrong! It has curbed the breakouts again, and it has made the pigmentation fade so much faster too. But, the real eye-opener for me was the exfoliation. I never knew how good this product was at exfoliating my skin.My post-partum skin wasn't 'dry', but I'd get a build up of dead skin (you know how you can just feel it?) really bad, and even though I used the microdelivery exfoliation wash religiously every morning, it wasn't even making a dent in the dead-skin layer, no matter how long/hard I scrubbed.I started using this again at night, and in the morning my skin is soooo amazingly smooth...no dead skin feel at all. It's like I did a peel. I'm amazed. I think it's just one effect I never really noticed before. But now I can't go a day without it because my skin feels flaky and gross if I do. I just wanted to mention it if someone is looking for some help with exfoliation."
0,"I used this product for a week, my skin ended up extremely dry and burning. It took a good week for my skin to return to normal. I would not recommend this to people that have sensative skin"
1,"Firstly, thanks to the company because my product arrived on-time and was even larger than I'd expected- what a great value. The dropper spout sadly does not stay in, as some of the other reviewers noted. If it weren't for that, this would make it a 5-star product. That being said, it smells fantastic; kind of like Pledge but better because it's natural and chemical-free. I like that I can spray it all over my home and not worry about carcinogens and bad stuff.I bought this because I had read online that spiders detest lemon. So I scoured Google for a good recipe and mixed about a teaspoon's worth of this with a few drops of Dawn in a spray bottle, filling the rest with water. Next, I sprayed behind every piece of furniture, door jams, vents, windowsills, electrical outlets, baseboards etc. I kid you not, the very next day I found 3 spiders! (EUW!) It must have forced them out of hiding!!! I used it again and the same thing happened. So I am continuing to use it and am finding less of the nasty bugger around..which truly gives me a good night's sleep! I am definitely re-purchasing this when I run out."
1,"I love that they offer this product in a bulky refill size.  Of course, you could use the product just as it is, but I like to refill my small pump bottles with it.This face wash contains tea tree oil, which is a natural antibacterial that is excellent at clearing up acne.  It also contains other all natural ingredients that work great together.  I love how clean this leaves my face, and yet it doesn't not strip it.  I have very oily skin and am prone to break outs, my skin is practically pimple free now.  I've used proactiv in the past and in my opinion this stuff is better, and yet costs significantly less.Best of all, I like that this product does not contain any potentially cancer causing ingredients such as: propylenes, parabens and sulfates.  I think that ridding my skin of those chemicals has done a lot to keep it in balance.  I highly recommend this product!"
1,"I love the smell of the Neutrogena Body Oil. I put it in a small spray bottle & keep it in the shower, once dried off I spray iton & there is no need for more body lotion."
0,"You sent me the wrong shampoo.  You sent the Naturals shampoo  come on Amazon, get with it.  All my orders lately have problems."
0,"I bought this to get rid of the crow's feet and fine lines under my eyes.  I've used this now for about three months with absolutely no improvement whatsoever.  It is pleasant to use and doesn't irritate my eyes, but just didn't do a thing for me."
1,"The scent is so well done, I could smell it while it's in the wrapper! It should be a room fragrance as well until you're ready to wash with it lol....I had the lavendar and jasmine and it's the first time I've ever seen  a CLEAR NATURAL SOAP. I thought that was fascinating. The scents are awesome and my fiance used the lavender soap for his dry skin since he tends to get rashes when he scratches himself. and he says he likes it so far. Worth the cheap price so give it a shot!"
1,"The seller of this white musk sent the product well within the predicted time and so I was able to use it immediately. Something to keep in mind is that this oil is very very strong so do not apply it to your neck area unless you want a whiff every time you turn your head. I like the applicator since you can decide where to apply the oil: under the knees, on the wrists etc. and it being a slim bottle, you can tuck it away in any personal case. I really like the Egyptian goddess more but this oil will be kept in my cosmetic case for when I travel."
1,"One warning: This lipstick requires you to have smooth lips to begin with.  Because it is so deeply pigmented, if you apply it over chapped lips it will look lumpy and uneven.  It turns a bright pink on me and I apply a bit of clear gloss over it as the day progresses. It is an enjoyable lipstick that I wear several times a week.  A tube will probably last five years because not that much is needed for lovely color."
1,"This is such a great moisturizer! As I'm writing this, I am on my 5th jar of this moisturizer. To be honest it doesn't smell the best and it can burn your eyes. I experience some eye burning occasionally, but it doesn't last long. To me, it is all worth it. Hope in a Jar leaves my skin very soft and VERY moisturized. I have oily skin, but it is also very dry if I don't use the right moisturizer. This is the only moisturizer I use at night. I have tried lots of others, but none have given me deep moisture like this one."
0,"try it for a few nights , first it would not stick i used the hydrator spray and still would not stick, and the ones that did got hard lol"
1,"A couple of years ago I had a serious back surgery and was not allowed to take showers for a number of weeks. Taking showers is a problem because the water can get on the scar and increase a risk of infection. I was miserable not being able to take showers until someone told me about No-rinse Shampoo and No Rinse Body Bath.  You put a bit of Body Rinse on the sponge and wipe the body.  Sponge baths with it work much better than a damp cloth (plain or soaped up).  With the shampooNo Rinse Shampooyou put it on your head, rub into the scalp and hair, and then dry off with a towel.  It is not as a good as washing your hair in the shower, but there was huge visible difference and it made me feel cleaner.Small things make a big difference when you are hospitalized/recovering from surgery. No-rinse body bath and shampoo removed one of the things that was making me feel bad and I am so pleased someone told me about them.Ali Julia review"
1,"It you have medium to long hair this is the brush to blow dry your hair,! You will finish fast!!"
1,"I purchased this item a month ago when I got facial acne which I hasn't been getting for a while. I started with Ole Henriksen blemish serum (costs $45!), which didn't do anything on my acne after 3 weeks of use. I had to search online, and eventually found this magical mask. I have combination skin and I used it as a spot treatment overnight. My acne retreated after only a few days of use. I also used it as a mask once a week. My face is clean and acne free now. This product is so effective plus great price! Who says you need to pay more to get the job done?! Very happy with it! I wish I had known about it in the first place!"
1,"This is a great product.  I am trying to grow my hair out and recently started using the Redken Extreme shampoo and conditioner at the recommendation of my hair dresser.  I like them so much that I bought this leave-in conditioner as well.  At the suggestion of another reviewer, I put in on the middle to the ends of my hair just before bed.  I have been using it for about two weeks now and can definitely tell a difference.  My hair feels heavier and softer, and looks shinier.  Great buy."
1,This is my most favorite perfume ever. It has a distinct sent that is very hard to explain. I have been looking for this forever and so glad it was on here!!!
1,I have had Caruso hair curler set for over a decade.  I have been very pleased with the product.  My hair is hard to curl and it does a wonderful job curling my hair without burning/drying out my hair.Needed to replaced some of the curlers because they were over a decade old and were starting to disintegrate.  They did last a long time and I  purchased them again.
1,"I love the fresh feeling after putting this on- I feel very clean and my skin feels soft and smells lovely.I only wish the packaging were prettier. Next to my asian beauty products, this bottle is sort of an eye-sore. But the quality is what counts and it does a great job!"
1,"This cleanser is one of the best I have ever tried. It is light, foaming, fragance-free, gentle, leaves no residue, and doesn't dry out my skin. It is perfect for sensitive skin that tends to be combination or oily. There are so few cleansers targeted for this skin type, so I am very glad to have found this one after trying over 40 cleansers (ranging from drugstore to luxury-priced ones over $50). Definitely the one thing I have kept in my skincare routine all this time. I HIGHLY recommend it."
1,Smells awesome and it does not make your hair oily. My husband and I love it. We both use it.
1,Nars is really a great brand.  I buy all the neutral colors
1,My daughters use this and the conditioner to match. They are 5 & 6 years old. They love the strawberry smell! I love that it gets their hair squeaky clean! The bathroom always smells great when they are done too~like fresh mountain strawberries!This product is very inexpensive and works like a charm!
1,"OPI is a quality nail polish I've been using for years.  It doesn't chip quickly, it covers smoothly.  They have so many colors, something to look good on everyone.  You get a lot of polish for the money!"
1,"I have tried a number of different 3 in 1 body washes from Philosophy and they are all great but this is my favorite.  This smells so sweet and so good that I have been tempted to taste it.  It doesn't take much of it to get a thick, rich lather.  Try it and see for yourself.  This is the good stuff!"
1,Works absolutely perfectly on wet hair. I don't feel pulls or tangles when using it until most combs. I have been completely happy with it so far. I do worry a little about it being easy to break.
1,"When I purchased this brush and used it for the first time, I thought it was the best brush I had used.  It is perfect for applying shadow as well as for applying eye shadow. I used it for a month and had washed it several times, when the bristles started shedding.  Many of the brushes from BareMinerals shed and shred, and I do not use them. However, I liked this brush so much I continued to use it until there were not enough bristles left.A brush that sheds is of no yes to anyone, no one. I do not purchase brushes from BareMinerals any longer, neither should you.Not Recommended. prisrob 10-23-13"
1,"Thoroughly Clean Face Wash gets my face clean, smells nice, and has natural ingredients.  It does tend to burn my eyes, which is odd since obviously I close my eyes tight when I wash my face."
1,"I mostly bought this because I was looking for a shower gel that had a bottle with a pump.The smells is good. I would not say it smells very mango-like, but I can smell the honey. The gel has an opalescent look to it and rinses cleanly. Because the gel is made without sulfates, it does not lather a lot, but that does not stop me from using it as a shave gel!"
0,"This shampoo works pretty good and smells great, but it does not have much lather.  I have been using the L'Oreal sulfate free shampoo and it is much richer and has a great thick lather.  I won't be buying this product again.  I prefer Alba shampoo for natural products."
1,"I love this soap.  I like Lush's Karma fragrance (orange and patchouli), but this is my absolute favorite version of this fragrance.  The soap is amber-colored glycerin, and leaves behind the most intoxicating Karma smell.  It's particularly effective when used as a hand soap- the scent literally lingers for hours afterwards."
1,"I've been using this product for over a year and it always works for me.  Even if I skip my morning shower, I never have underarm odor, and I'm one of those self-conscious women who discreetly lifts and sniffs. lolI admit that I do not perspire very much, even though I live in muggy Southwest Florida, but I will start to smell if I don't use a good deodorant. I needed a couple of add-on items to get free shipping, and Amazon's price is the same as my local Walmart, so now I won't run out for a long time.  By the way, it's really fragrance free and the gel formula is gentle."
1,If you are looking for a white polish that stays well then this would be a good buy. It works great for french tips and designs.
1,"Don't need the ""home health"" label but it is reassuring at least.  A good value for the money.  I am using it for a home remedy on my lawn.  AFter trapping the existing moles, so far none have come in so who knows?  maybe it does have some mole repellent value!"
1,"I like this colour a lot in the pic. It's exactly the same colour as my skin, so it looks a little funny. I like it though."
1,I have been using about a year and love it. My skin is on the dry side and I am in my sixties........but skin does not show signs of age since I began using this cream! I recommend highly.
1,"I really wanted to love this, but it's just not what I was hoping for. I have oily but not particularly acne prone skin, and I'm pretty lazy about caring for it (wash with an apricot scrub in the shower, use a toner in the mornings, and dab on lotion as needed).I was hoping that this would control the oil and leave me with soft, smooth skin. It definitely helps on the oil. After letting it dry on my face for about 10 minutes and rinsing off, my skin is completely oil free without being tight or irritated. However, it does nothing to the texture of my skin and doesn't moisturize at all. It is a clay mask, and clays are known for being drying, so that's not a complete surprise. It manages to leave my sensitive skin clean and happy - no redness or peeling at all, unlike many products for oily skin that leave you feeling itchy and tight. I would 100% recommend this for troublesome, oily skin, but do plan on moisturizing separately - it can't do both."
1,"I love this bronzer. I've tried everything from Bare Minerals, to Sephora, to Cover Girl and this by far is my favorite. It looks dark in the photo but it goes on fairly light and looks natural. I have fair-to-olive skin and I use this to help bronze and give my skin that natural glow. A little bit goes a long way so this product will last."
1,"I use this cleanser and tend to recommend it.I have used many,many fancy and store bought brands and the Neutrogena CPM seems to help keep my break outs to a minimum. I am not saying it is the best, but I know two other good friends who see the same results I do. It just works for us. Unfortunately stress, diet and hormones have a significant affect on my acne, which can be anything from mild to severe.Basically, if I use this in conjunction with a very mild cleanser my skin looks clear. I have also noticed, if I wash in circles for 30 sec to a full minute and rinse well, my skin looks very clean and almost radiant. And it feels soft from the tiny, tiny exfoliation beads.The mask is too drying, but as a cleanser, I prefer it to proactiv. And frankly the acne market is worth billions, so I tend to use affordable products if I can, that work.EDIT: October 2012I had to stop using this product. My skin is older and more sensitive and prefers natural cleansers. I will use this maybe, once a month or after a long hot summer day. But sadly, it dries me out horribly now and irritates my skin which it never used to. I have heard some people say you can develop sensitivity to b peroxide. It is a very hash chemical, so that makes sense."
1,"I love Mrs. Meyers products.  I am a very, very sensory woman.  I am very affected by the way things smell.  I use candles, scentsy, scented organic body butters and sprays, etc.  And dish soap is no exception!!!  I use this scent of dishsoap for during the day.  It has a fresh and herbal scent.  I use the lavender for the evening time, due to its spicy yet calming scent (not entirely lavender).  I use honeysuckle on the weekends for its brightening, delectable scent.  I use the Rhubarb all purpose cleaner spray to spray down my kitchen.  I use the apple scent for my hand soap in the kitchen. It gives me the boost I need to enjoy my cleaning.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE using all the scents for different purposes and when my friends come over they can't get enough of them, either, and want to know what it is.  I buy them from Amazon in bulk and send them home with my friends for their own pleasure.  With Mrs. Meyers and my JesseSteele vintage apron and gloves, I feel like a smart and sassy domesticated goddess."
1,"I can't find this is ANY stores.  Neutrogena makes something similar in a pump, but I hear that it's pretty harsh on the skin.  I got this due to rave reviews -- and Thank You Amazon for carrying it --- and I absolutely love it.  I wear it almost nightly under my moisturizer.  My skin is smoother and appears fresher in the morning.  It did make my nose peel a little bit, but that's when I take a night off.  I really like this and hopefully can continue to buy this."
1,"I used this product only for my eyelashes.This product does do what it claims. I apply every night before I sleep. My eyelashes were noticeably fuller and longer in about 2-3 weeks. I had more eyelashes too. However, if you want significantly longer lashes or dramatically fuller lashes, you will be disappointed. This is not a miracle product."
0,"My hair looks clumpy and unclean. My scalp is itchy. My hair looks horrible, as though I hadn't showered at all. Please avoid this product."

1,"I ordered this for my 3 year old because he was biting his fingernails and it worked to make him stop. I asked him why he was biting his nails any more and he told me &#34;They taste nasty because I have sanitizer on them, and it wont come off when I was my hand.&#34; So he believes it is sanitizer on his hands that causes his nails to taste funny so he stopped biting them. I am glad he did and this product work very well."
1,"I use to use this products some years ago and it worked great. Don't know why I stop using it. I went to another product that was more expensive. However I went back to this product a week ago. I purchased it from Walmart for 3.00 a tube.It has worked great I use this scrub to clean my face, neck, body and my feet. This worked better than the scrub item that I had for my feet. I am telling you soak your feet and use this with a pumice stone and you will be amazed. I use Cetaphil lotion as the moisturizer  for my face, body and feet.  I am loving this inexpensive new regimen. I am telling you it works. My body looks so refreshed with all the dead skin gone. I even have got compliments on my skin in less than a week....I am going to buy the six tubes on Amazon because it will save me a couple of dollars from Walmart price.I am purchasing this not because it is inexpensive but I am purchasing it because it works......"
1,"To be honest it isn't a great lipgloss. It doesn't last too long. That said, I do like it and the color is nice. But, for the price it should be a little thicker and have better staying power. Its a decent gloss. Its not cheap. So you may be happier with a different brand for the price."
1,"Nice white jelly! I think some white polishes are to opaque looking (they remind me of whiteout :p ) but Marshmallow has a nice, squishy not-quite-opaque quality. Formula is a *little* tricky, but definitely not unmanageable."
0,"I am a long time user of Henna products. I wanted to try this one to hopefully get a redder tone and I mean an ""apple red"" shade. I usually use the Harvest Moon Red Henna Hair Dye 100 Grams, but wanted to try this brand, hoping for a different red.My natural hair color is medium brown, but since I've been using henna for a while, my hair was a light red (and I mean RED, not copper). Since it was time for a new dye application, I thought I'd give this brand a try. I certainly should not have done it.The directions say to use boiling water when making the paste. You can also try Red Zinger tea instead of water, to make it a deeper red. I didn't try that, I used boiling water. You can use the paste on clean dry or damp hair.My hair came out a light to medium copper. Last time I checked, copper is NOT red. Yes, I know... I'll be told that my hair color was already red and that's why it came out copper. NOT SO! I have been using henna for so long, that I've never had a brand change my red hair color. EVER!Extremely disappointing in the results. I had hoped for a deeper red, instead a got an almost dark strawberry color, which is a miracle (and not a good one) considering my hair was red in the first place.If you're looking for a true red for your hair, this brand is not it. I will stick with Harvest Moon."
1,.... but I love it.  Right size barrel and the plastic prongs do not get caught up in my fine hair.  I cannot use the brushes with the brush like prongs.
1,"It came very quickly  and in great condition.  Thank you so much, I would so order from you once again! Such a pretty grey.  A great nail polish for any nail polish enthusiast!"
1,"Aside from my standard Olay ORIGINAL moisturizer which I use faithfully every day -- this seems to be the ONLY other product that helps the &#34;vertical&#34; lines that are appearing on the top of my eyelids.  I'm 67 and have tried a lot of products - found most to be rather useless for the money except for the Olay ORIGINAL mositurizer which I have used all my life and now this.  Nice touch before bed as well.  Smell is faint but good.  Very creamy.  Use just a tiny dab -- and the pump is nice in that it only puts out a very small amount - just what you need for the small eye space -- so no waste of product.I have also tried the facial cream from Avalon Organics Vit C  - like it, but this Revitalizing Eye Creme is the one that makes a visible difference on my lines above my eye with repeated daily use."
1,I will buy it again.  This stuff works.  I have horrible hands and this stuff didn't disappoint me.  I love it and will buy again
1,"It is ok especially in this cold climate, i rub it on my elbows and it makes them soft and darkness on my elbows are pretty hard to remove, but it makes it look a bit cool, hope to see more progress."
0,I was looking for a micro-fine powder to use to set my makeup.  This looked cakey on my dry skin.  I much prefer the Laura Mercier setting powder or even the $5 Elf HD powder.
1,"Can't say much about this brush but it's a satisfying buy. Nice to use for everyday, but not for blowdrying and it's not harsh to your scalp at all.Recommended item for your shelf!"
0,"I bought this product and thought nothing of the price for if it worked, it would have been worth it.  I was very disappointed.  It was just a gimmick.  However, I found amazing results by taking biotin, folic acid, and bio-sil 3x's a day.  Don't waste your money on something that doesn't work."
1,This smelled very sweet and is not a bad smell. But I bought it for the vanilla and musk neither of which I can smell. It does last a while and the packaging was good and came quickly. Just much to sweet for musk.
1,"This is a fabulous scent! I have read the negative reviews from other seller's reviews about this particular oil and I recommend curious buyers pay attention to the positive feedback, and buy it from this seller. Ladies, you cannot douse yourselves in this oil. A little goes along way. Its a subtle scent that strengthen over time with your body heat.So women who need immediate gratification of an over bearing scent with hope it lasts throughout the day, this scent is not for you.. This a scent for controlled women who like to tease men with an alluring essence, and can walk away from their stimulated inquisitiveness.Think this is an overrated review??? Try it"
1,"I was using the Peppermint one, but they were out so I got the original formula here.  And while it doesn't smell as good, it does work as well.  I still can't believe that, looking at the ingredient list, this can clean my hair.  But somehow a bunch of OIL cleans my hair.  It's MAGIC I tell you!  Not surprisingly it conditions well.  I also feel really good about sending those suds into our water system (versus commercial shampoos.)"
1,EVERYTHING I EVER BOUGHT FROM NUTROGENA IS FIRST QUALITY AND RIGHT ON THE DOT FOR WHAT I EXPECTED.
1,"this is one of my all time favorite products. It really evens out your skin tone and makes your skin glow! I use it at night before I go to bed and when I go to apply my makeup in the morning after my shower you can really see how even this stuff has made my skin appear. I'm 34 with no wrinkles and a few fine lines and I guess I had uneven skin tone because this stuff will make your skin looking absolutely amazing! fast absorbent, no smell - great results!"
1,I have always purchased Spornette brushes if I have the option. This one is well madeand the bristles and the size of this brush are great for using with a blow druer.
1,"This brush iron is just okay. It does have nice long teeth to grab the hair. I do not like the position of the off and on switch, I'm constantly turning it off while using it. Because of this I had to put duct tape around the switch and keep it in the high position.  I just unplug when done without using the switch to turn it off.  It does not get hot enough for me to see a difference in my hair. I wish it could have been better. I did keep it though."
1,I did not purchase Borrowed & Blue for a wedding but more of a calm fall color. It looks great after two coats. I usually wear Cult -wicked fast top coat or CND super shiney and it looks great.
1,"It seems more watered down than I remember.  It does work.  It does take time, and I found it easier if I soak my feet first.  You have to really shake the bottle up, which seems to help, and I mean really shake it up.  But, it is still more watered down than I remember.It will take all the calluses off your feet and even between your toes, which is really hard to get to with anything else.  It is very messy so be sure to be somewhere you don't mind your skin coming off.  I sit on the edge of the tub.Because it is a little watered down now, it does seem to take much longer.  So, it is better to just do a little bit at a time, instead of trying to do it all at once.The good thing about this, is that it doesn't hurt your skin like the files do.  I find that when I use files instead that it just comes back a lot quicker.This keeps your feet nice a lot longer.Be sure to read the instructions.  This is not a moisturizer.  You have to keep rubbing this into your skin on your feet.  The more you rub, the dead skin will just roll right off."
1,"Having used some of the more expensive products in my day, I have to say that Olay does a great job at keeping up with the competition while at the same time offering their products at affordable prices. I had originally been using a Vichy serum that had been working wonderfully, but the price was becoming far too steep to afford (over 40$!) - so I decided to give Olay Regenerist a try. Some things I've noticed since using it over the past year-1. Keeps my skin soft, but supple and tight.2. Feels velvety smooth on my skin, and makes it feel clean and light-weight.3. Some wrinkles forming along my brow have completely disappeared.4. My skin looks and feels awesome!Overall, you just can't argue with real results, and when the price is right, you've got nothing to lose here  - Highly recommended, give it a try and you'll love it!"
1,"I must admit, I was a little concerned about this face wash (it came with the anti-wrinkle kit including the eye cream and day creme). I really didn't want the wash because it isn't fragrance free and I was worried it would sting or dry my sensitive skin out.I was pleasantly surprised! Not only did it NOT even irritate my eyes, I can get it all around my eyes and wherever to get eye make-up off, plus anything else on my face (powders, cremes, blush, pollution, etc.) and NO stinging or drying at all.What a great multi-purpose product at an amazingly low price. I had bought the rather expensive Peter Thomas Roth daily cleanser, which was gentle but so $$$ and could not be purchased near me conveniently without paying full price. I loved it, but knew it wasn't practical.Bottom line? Found my happy solution in Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser!"
1,"I love this color, the polish itself is great quality like other Opi products, this color is really pretty, from a distance it looks fairly dark but it has hints of purple, blue, red depending on how the light hits it.  Fun color, give it a try!"
1,This is a nice curling iron. It has different settings but I only use one or two.  It works great. Nice choice.
1,There aren't a lot of hard hat hair dryers around any more. This one is not too expensive and gets the job done. My only complaint about it is the plastic smell which was overpowering the first few times I used it. I'm happy to say that did subside. Would buy again.
1,Great price for a great product.  I use it for natural cleaning and remedies. A few drops in my brown sugar and honey face scrub. Love it. Smells good.
1,Makes my face feel moisturized and very soft after washing it. Would recommend if you're in need of a good moisturizer!
1,I always have liked Tommy Hilfiger products.  I have used this cologne for over 2 years for my casual everyday situations.
1,THIS TONER WAS RECOMENDED TO ME BY A PLASTIC SURGEON!!! I HAVE USED IT EVER SINCE MY FULL FACE LASER TREATMENT!!
1,"In their home fragrance line, L'Occitane en Provence offers an Amber Solid cube that is lush with amber, vanilla, myrrh, and other notes.  So appealing is this scent to me that I took to wearing it--grating it with a Microplane and dabbing it on with a cosmetic brush.  An expert in wearable fragrance warned me that my obsession with this amber might result in some skin breakout and took it upon herself to find me a substitute that was safe and cloned the scent that I liked so much.She found it!`Amber Butter' by Auric Blends produces almost the same aromatic blend albeit in a wearable format that comes in an intriguing little carved pot that looks great on your vanity.  Sliding your finger across the top of the butter and anointing your throat, earlobes or wrists will swathe you in a sweet amber cloud that will stay with you until you bathe.Please note that as I am unaware of the actual ingredients that formulate the composition of Amber Butter, I can only say that the aroma is similar to that of L'Occitane's Amber Solid.There are two negatives.  Given he softer consistency of this solid perfume when compared to other solid scents, it seems as if Amber Butter will not last very long given the small amount in the pot and the quantity that your finger will pick up if you are not careful.  Additionally, be aware that as the cap doesn't secure tightly, I would not recommend this solid for travel in one's purse.Bottom line?  Auric Blends ""Amber Butter"" is a lovely amber scented solid that will please lovers of amber and especially those who enjoy L'Occitane's Amber Solid Home Fragrance cubes.  Highly Recommended.  Please note the small yet lovely packaging.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc"""
1,"While I do really like using this product, I find that it tends to be on the more expensive side. It works fairly well for me, but I have better results from Origins and their products aren't that much more expensive. While this product will work if I'm in a pinch, I'd rather shell out a little more cash for the Origins brand moisturizer and get some more bang for my buck!"
1,Love it
1,Love the minty scent and it really cleans my scalp! I have seborrheic dermatitis and this helps calm the uncomfortable feeling! Feels very fresh! Love love love it!!!!
1,"I recently purchased this curling iron at a mega-discount store while shopping for groceries. It was an impulse purchase. My usual pattern is to first check out reviews before I buy many new items. In that particular case, I am very, very glad that I did not check out the reviews first, because they would have prevented me from making this purchase! I'll never understand all the negative reviews here. Perhaps Revlon has updated this curling iron, and worked out all the bugs that reviewers are talking about.However, my experience is that this is a great product. First of all, it heats up immediately. It has a GREAT hold on the hair, so that it does not slip out of the iron as you work with it. That is a huge bonus for me. It helped me do my hair in half the time.If I am not doing anything special, I look for the easiest ways to do my hair without finishing up looking unkempt. With the Revlon Perfect Heat Professional Styling Iron, I was able to fluff-dry my hair (without the pulling of a styling brush) and finish off by taking several sections with the iron, letting them cool, and PRESTO -- my hair was done. I used a head band, back-combed the crown a bit and my hair fell into jumbo curls and waves without a too-poofy look.You can't ask for better than this."
1,"Only one roller changes the color dot to show when heated and you have to heat the outer clips individually on the three spaces provided at the far right. So, if you need to use a particular size again that isn't the one with the dot, there's no way to tell if it's heated or not. Then you have to wait for one of the three clips to heat as well. It is weird!  It seemed to take a long time to heat up, though I didn't time it.This is an ok set, but I sure wouldn't rave about it. If not for the hassle, I'd return it.I just ordered another set that looks like the one I used to have with the U-shaped clips (BaByliss Pro) and hopefully it will be what I'm thinking it is."
1,"Just as my headline says, I do like this lotion but it does have a flowery smell like gardenia or tuberose so my hubby and son won't use it. I would have preferred a more unisex scent (citrus or lavender)."
1,"As a retired hairdresser I have some training in skin care and the Alpha Hydrox line is effective and modestly priced. It works better than the designer products at triple the price. Don't waste your time or money on any product with less than 8% glycolic acid, and don't be suckered into buying brands that promise more than 14%. The FDA mandates no more than 14%, and those products that claim higher concentrations are ""fudging"" their formulations. One thing to remember? When you try a new product give it 6 weeks of use before deciding whether or not it works for you. It takes 6 weeks for skin cells to go through their ""life"" cycle. It's only after a full cycle that you will see full and true results. I love this whole line of skin care and have been using it for several years. I just turned 50, and people are constantly asking what skin care products I use. You simply cannot beat the Alpha Hydrox line for effectivness and cost!"
1,"I love the smell of this lotion and a little goes a long way. However, it is more on the watery side than creamy so it does not do the best job at holding in moisture all day. It's a product you'd have to keep reapplying.Even with its shortfalls, I'm going to continue to purchase this lotion until I find something better because the company does not test on animals and I love that."
1,use it morning and night and it leaves the skin feeling clean and soft.  You can put your makeup on over it with no residue.
1,"Shipping was fast but when I got the bottle, the safety seal was broken so it was oily in the bag. When I finally got around to using it, it was like my previous castor oil, with the same consistency and smell, My problem is the bottle is a screw off top so pouring it out can be tricky and you can accidentally pour too much. I wish I had kept my old bottle so I could fill it with this oil and easily pour it out."
1,This is the only face lotion I will use. It's not overly greasy and it has actually helped decrease my acne if I use it in the morning and before bed.
1,I love Bare Escentuals/Minerals....been using all their products since they first came out.  I use Faux Mink to fill in my eye brows and shade under my eyes. Goes on flawlessly and stays on beautifully.Excellent!  5 STARS!!!
0,Great grey/black if that's what you're looking for but I thought it was going to be more of a navy.  My bad.
1,hope they would come up with products like this. gentle but very effective. i am a fan! i will definitely refill!
0,"I bought a similar type of dispenser back in 1995, when I was outfitting my new apartment. Perhaps that was the Dispenser Classic I. That one lasted 11 years without a problem and I threw it out only because it looked old and I was moving. Flash forward to 2011. I decided to buy one for my condo. A day or two after I put in the bottles, I noticed shampoo from the dispenser dripping onto the faucet. It turns out that one of the bottles had a hairline crack in it. It was tiny but enough to cause a serious leak. I examined the bottles closely and realized how thin and cheap the plastic containers really are. Unbelievable. Now I have to decide whether to use Crazy Glue or go through the hassle of emptying the two other containers and sending the whole thing back to Amazon for a refund. If this is the Classic III, I wonder how bad IV will be. I'd be hesitate to order this again."
1,"I got a sample of this at Sephora, and I do like the product a lot. It applies nicely and feels good, too, but at $25, I'm not too sure I'd buy it. I bought mineral powder makeup by Loreal for about $10 and am just as happy with that and the price is much better. But the coverage is nice and it does feel good on the skin. It's just a matter of how much you want to spend, but if I find something just as good at a lower price, I'm all for buying cheaper and using the savings for savings or more makeup."
0,The reviews made me think my scalp would tingle and my hair would smell like peppermint.  Nothing like that happen.  Just plain ordinary shampoo with no mint scent at all.  Total blah.
1,"I LOVE this hand soap.  It is spendy, but considering it makes me smile every time I wash my hands, I'd say it's more than worth the money.  (I do bring out the cheap stuff when the grandkids are here -- I don't think they've developed the discernment to appreciate the finer soaps in life.  lol!)'"
1,"I have used L'Oreal for years, it has always worked well for me. I would recommend this product to anyone old enough to remember why Marsha was goovy."
1,"With my dry skin, moisturizers are very important.  Moisturizing my face after showering is very important.  This light, silky moisturizer stays with me through the day.  The sun protection is very important to me.  I don't know how I'd manage without my Olay products."
1,"Just the right shade when I go to church or any place I go out.  I do not get out, except for church mainly."
1,I've been losing hair for some time and I'm pretty sure the reason is all the blow drying and product I use to &#34;protect&#34; my hair from the heat process.I found this towel on Amazon by accident and figured I have nothing to lose...but more hair...so I bought it.I had to re-dampen sections of my hair to apply mousse cause it was almost completely dry after having it wrapped for about 5 minutes.I can see this towel coming with me on all my vacations!
1,"I really like the whole idea of bar shampoo, but JR Liggett just wasn't for me...which is why I'm now trying out another brand. Here's why:-The reason why I wanted bought this shampoo in the first place is because I have very sensitive skin and, as of recently, a bad case of contact dermatitis. I figured that the natural ingredients would help soothe my skin, but nothing really happened...-I bought this shampoo for $5.09 (including tax) at a local whole foods store...so it may be wise to shop around before buying from Amazon. I also saw probably 3 other brands of bar shampoo that I'm now going to try (I had no idea there was a market for this stuff!).-I am a Caucasian with extremely thick, long hair. I don't really have an issue with body or volume so I can't exactly comment as to how well this shampoo did for those two things. My hair gets oily pretty fast, so I shampoo daily. I HATE conditioner...so I seldom use it. Which is why I I considered buying this shampoo, as it says most people don't need conditioner after using it and it helps with static in hair...FYI, my hair got super dry and was really static-y after using. :(-I also noticed some sort of a build up after a week or so (weird, considering I live in the beautiful Pacific Northwest and our water is some of the softest in the country!) which is why I started bringing a comb in the shower with me. It makes it so much easier to rinse out and evenly distribute the shampoo...and it make brushing my hair afterwards a more pleasurable task.-Something that is very annoying is how much longer my hair takes to dry when using this shampoo. I can have a towel wrapped around my head for 30 minutes and then as soon as I take it off, my shirt will be drenched..so I find myself towel drying my hair and then blow drying it every day, because if I leave it be it will take hours to dry.-Even though I take the shampoo out of the shower to air try every day, it is a huge blob of jelly. -_- I've only used it probably for 3 1/2 weeks also...It's probably because of how much hair I have, but still...Take all of my complaints with a grain of salt. I'm a picky person, but I do think that $5.09 was a reasonable price and I did get my moneys worth. I'm just going to be trying out some different brands now.Who knows, I may come back to JR Liggett's in the future...but as for now, I'm okay with trying a few new ones. :)"
1,Just the scent and lotion I've been looking for. Ecco Bella Vanilla is amazingly creamy and luxurious. It's gourmet lotion! I absolutely love the feel of it on my skin. It's not greasy yet it delivers fabulous moisture to dry skin. The vanilla smells heavenly. It's subtle and natural but you won't be able to stop smelling your own arms because the scent is SO intoxicating. It DOES NOT leave you smelling like a cupcake. It's a sexy vanilla scent. I will purchase more before this runs completely out.
1,"legendary universal household cleaner from 1960's till this day's. no chemicals,pleasant odor,allergy free,environmentally friendly. love it love love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,I used this shampoo three time and despise the way it makes my hair feel while im washing it and after luckily im a huge believer in conditioners.....the only thing I like is the smell is ok and imy hair felt cleansed
1,I live in dry desert climate and use this everyday on clean soaking wet hair. I scrunch out excess water and scrunch in Aussie volumizing mousse. This combo is better than any high end products I've tried and I try everything.
1,"I bought this product a while ago, and I was so happy with the outcome. After a couple weeks of using it my scalp was no longer itchy (at all) and the flakes went away. It also has a very nice scent. Although it does leave my hair a bit dry, you just need to use a good conditioner and you're all set. I ran out and I had some head & shoulders stored so I used that. Head & Shoulders really sucks compared to the Jason brand. Once my Head & Shoulders is all gone I am going to go back to Jason and stick with it! It works so great."
1,"This moisturizer leave my skin soft and well hydrated. My pores are also noticeably smaller and little acne flair ups have subsided. I didn't have any adverse reactions and my skin is pretty sensitive. The only flaw is I have to layer a higher SPF over it, but I don't really mind."
1,"Helps with my breakouts!!! But not as a daily regimen!!! As it did tighten my skin and gave me dry skin around my mouth when I used it twice daily for a 3 days straight! However using this every other day with the body shop tea tree oil foaming cleanser and the aveeno daily detoxifying scrub, has worked wonders for my acne prone skin!When my acne is at its peak I use the aveeno clear foaming cleanser, the next day I use the aveeno daily detoxifying scrub and the day after the body shop tea tree oil foaming cleanser. I normally just wash my face in the shower with neutrogena ultra gentle daily cleanser every other day.I wear makeup 4 days out of the week for work and wash it off with this or the body shop tea tree oil foaming as soon as I get home. My skin has been flawless and would recommend my combination of products for anyone who has combo/sensitive skin."
1,"Wow. I thought prell rocked it. I now have a new favorite. Why? It cleans thoroughly, leaves skin clear, removes the ick from hair and has a neutral fragrance that works with any suave conditioner. Also doubles as a body wash. The price in stores is about two dollars. I hope they never stop making this. Too many shampoos are filled with oil and silicone. This relieves my hair of the heaviness some products create. It's a steal."
1,"A cheap eye makeup remover that works. If you find that your mascara does not go on as well every day, then maybe all the mascara was not removed. This works at night and leaves a little oil around your eyes that washes off without any problems."
1,"I have tried this product many times before, but for some reason this time around it has been making my eyelashes fall off every time I use it to remove my mascara. I am thinking of just tossing it and using something different even though it's still brand new."
1,tHE ROSE WATER REALLY SMELLS VERY GOOD AND ALSO GOOD ON SKIN WHEN MISED WITH MULTHANA MUTTI AND IT WAS SUITABLE FOR MY SKIN TOO.
0,"I just bought this about a week ago.  It's a strange color.  I really couldn't descibe it.  The color grew on me after a day or so and I kind of liked it.  The picture kind of looks like a pink color, but it isn't.  What I didn't like was how watery the polish was.  I made a mess trying to paint my nails.  I hope that not all OPI polishes are like this one.  I'm usually an Essie girl and I think I might just stay with what works for me."
1,I love this brush.  It is really easy to use and gives a nice wave and body to the hair.  Would highly recommend!
1,"This cleanser is gentle on sensitive skin, economical, and a little goes a long way. A four-ounce bottle can last you for a week if you use it once a day."
1,Holy smokes! This soap is magnificent. Talk about lather! Smells like reality too. I recommend it highly for the shampooing of long beards. I'll never go back... Can't even remember what I'd go back to...
1,Very good toner for your skin. This bottle will last awhile. It has a rose scent which is not the most pleasant but very reasonable.
1,"I really like this shade, but I find that he coverage is rather inconsistent.  I have applied two coats to my nails, and the color is sort of splotchy.  When I was touching up my nails, I added a 3rd coat, and it seemed to make the color really pop.  I would recommend applying 3 light coats and you will get the full richness of this incredible red.  I think this is my new favorite color.  It's glamourous and also bright and feminine.  It is a bold red, but nor orange or gothy.  I really like the way it looks on my skin tone."
1,"Before I moved to my current home, I had very hard water.  This product seriously didn't work well at all back then.  It felt like it just stuck to my hair - leaving a gummy residue that wouldn't rinse out.  I was seriously bummed out about it, but I luckily didn't toss it out.I decided to try it again in my new home that has soft water.  When used with soft water - it is wonderful.  It cleans and leaves my hair softer than it's ever been with commercial shampoos and conditioners.  I have hair that is fine and somewhat curly.  It doesn't leave hair a tangled mess or anything, but I still found it helpful to comb my hair before washing it - especially when my hair was still long.  I wash my hair every other day and one of these bars lasts for around 2 months."
1,I love this BIG HUGE bottle of Castor oil. I use it for all of my home beauty treatments. Get yours.
1,"First of all, my skin type is oily in the T-zones.  I had large blackheads and whiteheads on my nose which made my pores stand out even more.  Although the size of your pores are genetic and not much can be done about it, the jojoba oil has made the blackheads and whiteheads smaller in less than a week of applying once in the morning and once before bed.  I seriously can't believe it works so well.I feel like the jojoba oil is absorbing into my skin fairly well but if I touch or rub my nose, I can feel the oil.  Strangely, the jojoba doesn't make my face all shiny.  It's odorless and a little amount goes far.  I will continue to use it because it works!You can buy this same product at Whole Foods (for the same price).  There was another brand that was selling for double because it was certified organic.  I might invest in that one in the future now that I know it works for my skin."
1,"I have used this product now for 6 months and I gotta give it my full Diva endorsement! Two snaps up, a spin, and a wink! I use it with sugar to gently clean and exfoliate my face, neck, and upper chest. Works like a charm."
1,Doesn't go on very smoothly.  It is hard to get a nice concentration of color.  Would not buy again. Disappointed.
1,"I loved this gel from the day it debuted many years ago. Thankfully, the scent is the same, rather like Neutrogena soap. The pump is nice on the tub ledge and the gel works great in the shower, too. It rinses clean in any water, hard or soft. I like to follow it up with the Neutrogena sesame oil for the body. Great stuff."
0,"I have a lot of redness on my face, so I thought I would try this concealer.  It is so hard and dry that you pull your skin applying it, especially around the tender eye area.  It needs to be a bit creamer to be able to spread.  Maybe I got an old one??  Anyway, won't bother to buy this again."
1,"My husband and I both love this soap. If you think it's just for men, think again. The scent is very clean and the soap suds up really well. If you are looking for a new soap to use, then this one is worth a try!"
0,"I tested this product on my arms for a week.  It dried sticky, and this caused me to be very itchy.  I ended up stratching up my arms, but after I stopped using this product, my arms started to clear back up.  But, still have some scarring.  I think I will go back to the original Eucerin that dried clear, and didn't leave any residue."
1,Works just as well as expected.  My hair is really thin but but this still works out just fine for my use.
1,Got it way before estimated time  this product is what I needed will tell  you all later how it's been doing. my face is quite red allot of the time.Update: Makes my face feel good and soft take care of the red. Good price too.
1,"ALL I could've hoped for in a genuine peel-off mask. I've looked for years for another peel-off mask that other beauty lines discontinued. Left my face feeling silky soft and I know this type of peel-mask with have my complexion clear, glowing and mar-free from old scratches & pimple scars from the past by using it once a week. Love it!"
1,I don't have to waster my time to typing .every body know it is great Value.Is nice toner I've never had .American Love Thayer
1,Nice and hot rollers- I've had it for a few years and its still going strong. Nice bug curls or small.
1,I purchased all 3 products in this line and like this one the best.  It does what it claims to do and the price is great!
1,"This is my favorite face moisturizer and I would recommend it for daily use. I have tried other face moisturizers and they are either too expensive or hard to find again or don't work well or at all. I usually sunburn with even a small amount of exposure but this product is just the right texture, easy to use and a good base for my skin."
0,"For having a bunch of promises about how well it'll work, this bottle is only about a two-week supply, and it makes no difference in anything--sweat, breath, etc. Save your money and just use perfume and lots of soap and mints!"
1,Too bad it does not have the ingredients to protect you from the range of damaging UVA rays. It is otherwise a good lotion in terms of application and smell. I ended up using it as a night time lotion.
0,Don't buy this stuff.  It is smelly and does nothing it says it should do to help.  A real joke.
0,It doesn't set my dermablend foundation at all. I'm a dermablend lover but this is a definite dud. I wouldn't buy again. The only thing it really does is temporarily matte my face.
1,"Its a peel off mask, I thought its suppose to peel off at least some gunk in my pore. Zip, Nada, none. And the smell is super strong if you put some on the bridge of your nose. But the good side is it leaves your skin smooth. I guess it does some good."
1,"My skin was dry with the winter, felt rough and looked washed out.  I wanted something to renew it so bought this to ""regenerate"" it during the day.  I'd read a dermatologist say that the big companies (like Olay) have great products for the $$$ because they are so big and do so much research.  You don't have to pay boutique prices for a boutique skin care item, because the big companies have great products.  They wouldn't sell so much if the products weren't good.  I put this on daily, and then got Olay Regenerist Night Resurfacing Elixir to wear at night.  When I work at home during the day, I put this product on during the day and let it go to work.  My skin was notably softer, smoother, less dry, and healthier looking within a few days.  It removed some of the dead skin cells I believe and looks younger. I'm going to order some of Olay's eye care items, as I was so pleased with this."
1,Does what it says it will. Be aware the spot may darken a bit before getting lighter  especially because it peels the skin. if you pick it off it will be raw and upon reapplication it will sting and I think this is the reason for the darkening so be careful.  I was going to stop using it after the initial darken but it eventually faded the dark spot. much more effective than the drugstore brands.
0,"I got this brush cause some reviews said it was a very soft brush. Bristles feel rough against the face. The description makes this brush sound better than it actually is. I have found brushes a ton softer than this onr, so I don't recommend it."
1,For days I want to wear something earthy yet feminine...this is it.  It lasts and only a bit it needed.  It's strong enough that I get lots of compliments but soft enough it's not cloying or obnoxious.  For the summer I will add a bit of my vanilla to make it more sunny.
1,"We've been using BareMineral products for several years now, we love most of them.  Looking forward to the new 'liquid' foundation they've created."
0,"This foundation made me break out and caused itching. When I stopped using it, my skin cleared, and when I started using it again, back came the little pimples and itching.After doing some research, I discovered this is one of the mineral foundations that contains Bismuth Oxychloride, which is not good for sensitive skin. It can actually make tiny microscopic tears in your skin, and those wounds can lead to cystic acne if they get infected, so it's really bad for anyone's skin.  But use it at your own risk.  Also, another ingredient, carmine, is in some of their blushes and eye shadows.  Carmine is ground up beetles. I am not making this up.  There are other products on the market which uses this ingredient too, not just Bare Minerals.  I recently switched to another mineral make up which has no harmful ingredients and doesn't clog pores. I won't mention it here for fear of being accused of working for them, but if you search the web, you'll find much better mineral foundations than Bare Minerals."
0,"It made my hair feel built up after first shower. Plus, this is super watery and not conditioning at all. Never again. I handed the stuff over to a guy friend. :s"
1,"First, let me say that I adore this lotion, in addition to the Tuscan Honey, I also have it in Vanilla and Mago Beach II.This review is strictly for the Tuscan Honey fragrance - which isn't my favorite scent.The Tuscan Honey has sweet honey undertones, buried beneath a strange, perfume that is heavy and un-appealing.The lotion itself absorbs quickly, but it does leave a powdery  feel in its wake."
0,This is terrible. I didn't like the out come at all. It does not heat up enough. Noting special. The roller is only 5 so i ordered more 5 roller. But the problem is it's not good result.
1,I have long hair & I curl the ends everyday for work. This curling iron is the perfect size & price!
1,I do not mind the smell at all!  That is definitely a personal preference.In reading the negative reviews it sounds like people are either putting TOO much water or none at all.The best way to test this is to wet it then rub it on your hand to see how opaque or translucent it will be with the amount of water you are putting on it.This works great for me!
1,"I've tried many different moisturizers.  I've been looking for something that helps with the fine lines, but doesn't make my face greasy or clog my pores.  I love this moisturizer!  It feels like velvet, absorbs quickly, and doesn't cause my face to break out.  The description says it's unscented, but it does have a very, very light fragrance.  It's not perfumey, just fresh and clean.  I'm on my second bottle and I can absolutely see a difference in the texture of my skin."
1,"As a gift it is a great product.Women love the smell of it and comes like on the picture but has a spray inside the box if you wish to install it, feel free."
1,"LOve the way it seals it up, no smell and you can use it for up to 12 hours at a time. However, getting it in place can be tricky and removal is best done in the shower. Actually insertion might be best done in the shower where you can squat down and get it in there correctly then wash off any mess left behind. Feels clean and comfortable when properly placed, you forget it is even there. Make sure to change every twelve hours though. Recommended."
1,"I tried this product because I wanted to try a new look for summer.This product pretty much worked like it said it would -I'd say that this lightened my hair about 2 shades (it says up to 3 on the box), although it ended up with a pinkish tone to it. No problem, though -as long as it's not rusty I'm OK with that.I have medium-dark hair though (I'm half Japanese, half white). My hair is more on the Asian side, very straight and thick.This is a ""cool tone"" color that says it will minimize orange/reddish tones, and it looks good. It's not exactly what it looks like on the cover picture (and unfortunately I didn't end up with that Gorgeous Creature's face, either).I have grays here and there, and it didn't really cover them at all. Not that I expected a lightening product to, but I thought I'd just note that here. I'm not really sure if this is a color dye, a bleach, or both...I didn't expect it to cover completely but since my hair is lighter, they're less noticeable.The directions state that the user should apply it on the main part of the hair and the ends first, wait 20 min. and then apply it to the roots and wait 10 min. This was a little confusing to me, as there is no way that the user can completely avoid the roots when applying. I did my best though and it worked out for me. The conditioning stuff that is put on at the end needs to be applied every week afterwards and they say not to shampoo the next day after using it to retain the color.It was really easy to use and fast.Too bad I have to color my hair every 3 weeks b/c it grows fast...this stuff retails for $10 in most stores but it's still cheaper than a couple of trips to the salon."
0,"This product didn't say whether it could or could not be used on the face, however, I chose to use it on the face because the active ingredient was Glycolic-AHA. It broke me out on the forehead and scattered acne on my cheeks and jawline. I recommend acne.org's AHA lotion. I've been using ACNE.ORG's skin line for a year and they have an AHA lotion along with acne care and it works amazingly. I actually had to go back to it and it cleared my acne up again."
0,"I purchased this to use as a bubble bath and I should have looked at the size, I thought it was larger.  I found this same item in the department store for less than half the price.  Smells good just feel I overpaid for it."
0,"I was so very disappointed with my purchase of the Avalon Thickening shampoo and conditioner. I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. It started looking very dull. They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. You might think because it says, 'oil' that it might add to your hair's shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. This product only damaged my hair. Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can't imagine what it might do to yours. Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? I honestly wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows Avalon out of the water. In just one shampoo my hair regained it's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair. I can't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident. They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT. You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. I'm now quite confident in what I'm using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. I'd pay 5x what I'm paying for it now, I love it so much. And their treatment spray is oil based. I use the system twice a day and I'm shocked at how long it is lasting. It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT. By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. Once a day just never cut it for me. Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. I use it during the day too if I'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)"
1,"The photo makes this polish appear to be a dark brown. However, it is more of a dark purple/brown/reddish color. I bought this thinking that it was a chocolate color, but it isn't. Although it isn't the color I expected, Essie never fails to impress me. Great consistency and long lasting."
0,"the size sucked, the product did not show me any improvement annd i HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR OVER THREE WEEKS NOW."
1,"I guess it works.  I don't really know how to tell if the item is working or not, but since I keep buying it it most be doing something (smile)"
1,"I use this as a shaving cream, not as a hair conditioner. I've tried it on my hair and it left it sticky waxy rough and dry all at the same time. On my skin, however, for shaving, its divine. Smells SO good and I never nick myself when I use it. Doesn't clog up my razor either. Its much cheaper than the fancy shaving &#34;cremes&#34; out there and I think it works even better. Afterwards my legs feel super smooth and smell great."
1,I just received this blush brush. Its really soft on the skin so its perfect for powder which is what I'll be using it for. Very excited that they threw in a free Kabuki brush as well!!
1,The cream sinks in well enough but really dont see any changes in my skin after using for 2 weeks. I have KP so was trying to get rid of but think I will stick to peels and shea butter.UPDATE: I continued with the cream just to use it up and my KP on my arms is noticeably improved. Put it on after shower and it soaks right in! I will keep using and buy again! Good stuff!!!
0,"This would've been pretty good (I liked the pointed applicator better than other brushes I have tried), but it stings my eyelids terribly. Do not use if you have sensitive skin."
1,"I have a drawer full of partially used hand creams. This is because I can never find one that does a good job but doesn't leave my hands feeling greasy. While staying at a friend's house, she had this hand cream and I was astonished at how well it worked. I went home and ordered some for myself."
1,"I got hooked on this toner a couple years ago, and haven't turned back. Let me start by saying that I have very difficult combination skin. Some areas (specifically my ""T"" zone), are very oily and acne prone, while other patches of my skin are extra dry.I have tried several kinds of face lotion, and was hooked on Eucerin for quite some time, and this would only sit on top of my skin. Even though most face lotions are non-comedogenic, (won't clog pores), I still get acne on my ""T"" zone. With this toner, NONE. Not a single breakout whatsoever!I have noticed that this toner helps to keep my skin tone even, and pores small-- However the main reason I use it is for its great moisturization. This is totally different from face lotions in that this is very light, and penetrates your skin like lotion simply cannot.That being said, the rose petal version of this toner smells a little aggressive. Personally, I prefer the scent cucumber version of this same toner. The rose petal kind of makes my face smell like I shoved my head in an old lady's purse... But it works when I can't find the cucumber kind."
1,"I bought this hair dryer after seeing a recommendation in a fashion magazine.  It doesn't disappoint.  It dried my very long hair in just a few minutes (compared with five for my older dryer) and the diffuser gives great volume and lift.  Highly recommend.  Buy this model instead of the more expensive salon models, and spend the extra $$ on more shampoo."
1,"If you haven't tried a glycerine creme before, it's important to know that it is not quite like a lotion. Glycerine is a colorless, odorless fat that makes an ideal base for food, skin products, and other items. It's even found in wine and beer. It helps give a bit of ""body"" to a product without affecting how it tastes or smells.For skin care, glycerine in essence coats the skin with a layer of thickish oil, so that moisture is kept in. It also means your hands remain a bit sticky for a short while afterwards. Glycerine is often used for hands and feet, where a soft sock or mitten is put on afterwards to keep the glycerine from rubbing off. If I can wait the five or ten minutes, I simply put it on and wait for it to absorb in. I *love* the way my hands feel after I use this,The Camille Beckman white tub of glycerine has a nice, light pink color and soft rose aroma. It has a cool rosebud on top too :). The tub is easy to scoop the glycerine out of, and the cream goes on smoothly. It does remain sticky immediately after you put it on, but as I mentioned, this is normal. I use this on my feet when I'm relaxing, putting clean socks on over the glycerine and letting it soak in. I love putting it on my hands. In fact there are times that I'll be typing away, and my fingers will feel a little rough, and I'll go get some cream to put on. It's like my fingers crave the lotion :) It's definitely much better for my hands than pretty much any other lotions I've tried.The only downside here is that it's a bit expensive, and it's not found in most grocery stores. So you need a specialty shop near you that carries it, or you have to order it from the web."
1,I'm about half way through the jar. I've noticed an improvement in moisture and softness as well as a slight improvement to my laugh lines under my eyes and around my mouth. I don't know if this is a typical result.  I'm happy so far - let's see what the rest of the jar holds in store! I'm also so pleased that Amazon offers this product at such a great price with Subscribe and Save along with my Amazon Prime membership!
1,This mascara is perfect for daytime. It never clumps until it's old and time to throw out. I like that it's really washable.
0,I was very dissatisfied with this product.  It made my pores appear larger than normal and it was too pink.  I will never buy make-up online again.
1,"I have been using Obagi foaming gel for years and is, by far, the best face cleanser on the market.  It does not dry out your face, but it removes every bit of make-up.  I have tried other brands, but when you follow with a toner, the cotton pad always ends up looking like I never washed my face first.  This product removes all traces of make-up and never dry out your skin.  As long as I use this product daily - I have less break-outs and no dry patches."
1,"I use this for cuts, soap crafting, cleaning, to make feet spray, and as a facial astringent.  The product is 100% tea tree oil and a quality product."
1,"As a young woman who has lost a lot of hair due to thyroid problems, I have tried a few products with mixed success.  This product isn't even marketed towards hair loss but I gave it a try...and it actually works!  I started with the extra strength shampoo but switched to regular (less stinky, still effective).  My hair loss stopped completely and even started growing back!  The shampoo does smell awful, but it works!  I just rinse really well and use a lot of shampoo.  It leaves my hair soft, clean, and shiny.  I will definitely keep using this product!"
1,"I recently purchased the #25 hand cream and loved it. I wasn't sure how this would smell, or feel, or work. I googled all the Beckman fragrances. This had notes of others I usually enjoy. I was not disappointed. This is creamy without being in a jar (the pump keeps it from getting under my nails), it is very moisturizing,  and the smell isn't too overbearing. I am very happy. For the price, 16oz should last a long time. I will be buying again and trying more fragrance options."
1,"It smoothed my skin and left a nice non-glittery summer glow, but when washing it off there was a LOT of pigment on the cloth - which leads me to consider this more of a light makeup than a moisturizer.Update - it definitely leaves shimmeriness on my hands, not terrible, didn't notice until wearing it in the sun.  I used this as my sunscreen on a trip to the beach and it worked well!"
0,"Product dried out my hair. I was disappointed since this is organic. I expected it to be better. But, Pantene works better than this and does not dry my hair out. Smell was ok. It was not overwhelming, but it did not smell great either. It did make my hair look thicker, but dried out."
1,"I used this as a base coat and top coat.  my nail polish has not chipped; however, my nails don't feel too much stronger.  I've only used one time, though."
0,"Alpha Hydrox might as well close it's doors.  I don't know what happened because twenty years ago they had amazing products for a cheap price.  Now they cost twice what they did then, understandable with inflation, but don't work worth a darn.  Yet another epic fail.  I am so disappointed in this product line.  I purchased several different products a few months ago and after finishing the bottles am still convinced they are absolute garbage.  They do not do what they claim but if you just want a lotion...here you go.  They are just like any other plain old lotion."
1,"I use this to cover up my red marks left after minor breakouts.  It really does make it possible to cover up the red marks.  I have very pale skin, and this green stick works great.  Awesome product!"
1,"I have had this OPI color before in the past and loved it.  I ran out and am waiting for 2 more bottles to come.  It is a very pretty medium purple creme.  I love it and get numerous compliments when I wear it.  If you are a purple lover like me, I know you will like this color."
1,"This is the only mascara that NEVER EVER leaves you with raccoon eyes.  AND all it takes is warm water on a cotton pad or facial sponge and a little pressure and the &#34;tubes&#34; slide off - no harsh eye make-up remover is ever necessary.  I have been using this mascara for years and my lashes are healthier (no more breakage) and used with the conditioner that Blinc sells, my lashes are also fuller.  Although advertised as &#34;waterproof&#34;  - beware, warm water and pressure take the mascara off, so if you go to the theatre and watch a tear jerker - be careful-- a tissue to wipe your eyes and you could be saying goodbye to your mascara!!  Along with wiping the tears - you are probably going to wipe off the mascara too!  Oh- well - nothing is perfect, but for everyday wear this mascara beats everything on the market for 100% eliminating raccoon eyes - and if you are planning on going to a movie that will make you cry - just take a tube with you and reapply once the tears are done!  (LOL)"
1,"I really like this product. They offer several shades and it has an SPF in it. A hugeplus...NO SPARKLE like a lot of the other powders have. It softens and blurs lines too.The only problem, I'm having a harder time finding it in the stores. Now, I'll be gettingit online if I can't find it there."
1,"I have very thick, coarse hair and was tired of wrapping my head with the standard cotton towel at home. Plus, the towels were always rough on my hair and would get soggy immediately. I purchased this towel to put less stress on my hair follicles and to improve the drying time.I was very excited that I was able to wrap all of my hair in the towel (about arm-pit length, 4b/4c, coarse) and it stayed put. No problems there at all. However, I noticed that the towel started to get really soggy after about 30 mins. I had to take it off and squeeze it out.I think this is mainly because my hair type holds onto water much more than others and because the towel is pretty small. So, the next time, I just made sure that I squeezed as much excess water out of my hair as possible before wrapping and it was not as bad.I really like the towel but it is definitely not totally equipped to handle all hair types."
1,"I decided that as I am getting older, (age 42) I want something very gentle to cleanse my face, and I found it in this little bar of basis.  I read reviews about the bad smell, but I don't smell much of anything when the bar is wet or when it is dry.  I have been using for about 2 weeks and had had no adverse reactions on my combination skin, and actually the dryness on my forehead is much better, but maybe that's due to the warmer weather, I don't know.  I do know that I will be buying this again.  It's simple and perfect and I love that it has chamomile in it.  I see they have a vitamin bar as well maybe I'll try too."
1,"It hasn't made much of a difference for my face after using it for a few weeks. I mean, my face has always been pretty clear aside from a few blackheads. I love it, but not sure if it's really worth the price. It's a great daily face wash, doesn't dry out skin, and very smooth. Smells fresh too, like lemongrass kind of. I use it twice a day."
1,What more could you ask for thick creamy and really clears up my skin. Didn't dry me out and smells neutral.
1,"For years I had used just about any brand of deodorant and they worked fine.  Then a few years ago, I started getting an underarm rash, no matter what brand I used.  Read about ALMAY being hypoallergenic, and decided to try.  No more rash.  Have been using it ever since."
1,"This is a great color for a smoky eye that is not ""too much."" Totally appropriate to wear to work every day."
1,"A friend turned me onto this.  WOW, what a difference it makes!  My scalp tends to get flaky, but now that I use this, I notice that I can go longer between hair washings and there's no flakes.  It feels great, too."
1,"The soap smells pretty good if your idea of ""pretty good smells"" includes ""lumber yard"". But this stuff is fantastic for a variety of skin conditions, my dermatologist recommends it. You do get used to the odor after a bit, and once you've used it the lingering scent is not bad enough to freak out your co workers or cause false bomb alerts at airports. Leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed."
1,"I have very dry, thick, coarse, curly hair. Was skeptical about this product because of the cheap price, but I had used Aussie products years ago, and thought I'd try it. LOVED IT!Pros:Nice Scent. Light, and freshLeaves my hair shiny and softDe-tanglesInexpensivePrevents the ""frizzies""Not heavy, greasy, or waxyRefreshes my curlsAs a side note, I use this product first, after towel drying. I then also use a conditioning balm, and sometimes a bit of gel. I find that I can ""refresh"" my curls the second day after shampooing with this product and it looks great. No bed head!"
1,OK! So first a little Skeptical about this. But wow! I have some old sticky Nu Bra that the adhesive wore out due to time and washing.. and I thought that this might help keep em on! Well It DID!! Wonderfully I may add!! Very useful indeed.
1,"This lipstick has long lasting staying power.  I loved that and the fact that it left my lips moisturized.  But, the color turns out a bit too bright  on me.  It looks best after a long day but dislike it right when it is put on.  If you like bright, bold lipstick, this is for you..."
1,"I have not used liquid foundation in years, because as I have aged, I feel that it settles into the lines around my mouth and nose.  I usually use powder foundation, but it can look heavy on me.  I went to white rabbit beauty's website, where they let you order generous foundation samples for a buck and a half and lipstick samples for a dollar.  I ordered this foundation in the soft beige color.  I am pale, but not ivory. I have a lot of red/ruddiness to my skin, burn easily, and I don't like any foundations with yellow tones.  So, the sample came (with enough for a week of applications!).  I put on a thin layer of moisturizer first, and let that sink in.  I applied with my finger, because foundation brushes sometimes leave brush marks. A little goes a long way, so build your coverage in thin layers. I have found that if you blend out AND in, the coverage is better.  What I mean by that is, usually with a liquid foundation you apply it and blend out.  I have large pores, and blend both ways, which provides better coverage for me.  I have a few old red scars on one cheek from acne, and this foundation provided good coverage without being thick or gunky.  They are still noticeable, but only if you look closely.  It gives me a much more luminous look than my usual matte powder foundation. My daughter commented that I looked so much younger and brighter, like I wasn't really wearing a lot of makeup.  It is definitely brightening, which I love.  I would probably apply a touch of powder to my t zone, just to tone it down a bit.  The ingredients in this foundation are much cleaner than most that you will find in a drugstore or department store, I have listed them below.  There is no yellow to this soft beige color, and I am still a bit pink which is something that is usually covered when I use powder foundation.  Its not really a deal breaker, it's very minimal.  It doesn't feel dry or tight and doesn't settle into my fine lines.  I like it by itself, but you could touch up the t zone with a bit of powder if you wanted to.  It wears fine over a normal work day AND an hour workout (youtube Tiffany Rothe-awesome workouts).  I always shower and wash my face (Dr Bronners liquid castile peppermint, its great for acne) after I work out, but this time I really wanted to see how well it wore during and after the workout-6 hours later it still looks great! There is none of that 'melting' that you will get with some foundations, where they start to slide off your face.  It actually looks so natural, I am converted. I never thought I would go back to liquid foundation, but this did it for me. The best way to try it is to buy the samples, in the colors that you want to try. You can also blend two colors together on your own, to get the best color for you.  I love it for winter wear, because my skin is dryer and can get flaky with powder foundation.

1,"Er ... this is $6.75 for One Bottle?  I can get it for $1.75 in dollar and discount stores.  I like and use this product, but $6.75 is insane, it's Suave, for heaven's sake."
0,Trying it on face but still has perfume added to it so it's a no go for me. It didn't do anything but make face sticky.
1,"On the forefront with organic anti-aging products, Jason offers Tea Time Creme made with 70% Certified Organic Ingredients.

1,"I have nothing negative to say about this body wash. It lathers fantastically and feels great when you get out of the shower. I am a dude and I use this, and i'm happy as heck about it."
0,Got a very bad rush from it. I might have very sensitive skin.Used it two days and I started noticing my face was itching and a small swelling near my cheeks. I thought it was something I ate or just a bad day.I continued using face wash for 3 days and rash wouldn't go away. I stopped using it and notice rash disappeared. This is just my experience.I was worried that since is a care product I wouldn't be able to return it and that I was stuck with the face wash but Thanks to the great customer service of Amazon I was able to get a refund and dispose of the face wash.
1,"I bought a couple other Aveeno products and have been very happy with them so I decided to give this a try. I've only used it a couple of times, but it feels thinner than I expected, especially for a night cream. It burned a little upon application and my face was a bit red, but that quickly went away. I didn't notice a difference the following day as I did with the other Aveeno products, but I'll keep using it and see if it makes a difference. The smell is pleasant, it arrived quickly, and the price was comparable to my local drugstore.***UPDATE - Now that cooler weather has arrived, I've started using this night cream more regularly and I must say that I'm glad that I have. I wake up and my skin feels so soft. I do slather quite a bit on and allow it to absorb into my skin, but it doesn't feel greasy at all and unlike some moisturizers it absorbs quickly. I've gotten used to the scent, especially since it fades pretty fast. I'm definitely seeing a difference in my skin with the Aveeno regimen and will continue to use these products. I can't ever see paying department store prices for face lotions now that I've found this line. Try it - you won't be disappointed!"
1,I bought this because I have heard great reviews on it and I use it before bed after cleaning my face.  Like with most face products though I never know if it works but it hasn't had a harmful effect on it.
1,"This product smells amazing. I am very happy with it.  It doesn't leave an oily feel behind, and it moisturizes great  would recommend."
1,The smell of this is heavenly and our hands are squeaky clean.  Have it in every bathroom of our home.
1,"I don't have any particular scars but I wanted my skin tone to even out so I didn't have to bother with makeup. This stuff doesn't smell great nor is the texture wonderful but I do like the way my skin looks. I usually wear it at night and in the morning I use a Vita C lotion (which smells and feels great) and a simple face lotion with sunscreen. This doesn't make me break out and isn't drying. I am a lucky adult with acne so some lotions are trouble. I also have the skin tone evening face mask by palmers, which I notice more impact from than the face cream. My skin always looks fantastic after I use it."
1,"This is the best foundation I have ever used.  It is easy to apply, completely covers and evens the skin tone, and stays on all day without clumping up.  Like the other reviewers, I appreciate that it dries matte.  I tried it because I have lupus and live at a high altitude, so I need extra UV protection.  So far so good.  The ability to lighten and darken the tone is great, although I do wish there were a way to add cooler/pink tones, since it is a tad yellowish.  That being said, I get lots of compliments about my skin when I wear this and, hey, I feel pretty!"
1,"I had hoped for a miracle for wet, tangly, hair, but this comb is really only slightly better than a standard straight-edge.  That said, I do like the tortoise look, and it is easy to hold and a good size."
1,Nice color not bright white. Good seller polish shipped quickly. The price was reasonable and Essie makes great products so this is a must have in your nail polish collection.
1,I love this product.  I have super sensitive skin and this lotion does not irritate  like most other lotions will.
1,"The smell of these beads are AMAZING! After a bath, my body feels super soft. The only thing is that I have to use A LOT in order to get the full effect of amazingness. Overall, great product!"
1,"Because Miracote is the new HG of my nail arsenal. I purchased this after seeing a good review and one ok review of it somewhere online, I wish I knew where to find the girl who wrote the good review because she changed the way I do my nails FOREVER! I can literally lay down for bed 5-10 minutes after painting my nails and sealing them with this top coat and wake up without hair or sheet lines. What?! Too god to be true right? NOPE! I've used SV in the past and although I do like it, the smell is much stronger than Miracote's and SV has a tendency of shrinking my polish. I haven't noticed shrinking with this one and so it will be my go to until I find another product better than this one. Which I doubt I will! I would and have recommended this product to anyone and everyone."
1,"I am crazy about the smell of this Olay Total Effects 7-in-1. It is a wonderful soothing and unique smell. That alone has made me very happy. But for some reason, I was sure that a daily moisturizer would have SOME SPF. This one has none. I had another bottle of what I thought is exactly this brand and it has SPF and in fact, that's why I ordered this, because I am out of the other one. Anyway, now I use it as a moisturizer only if I'm home most of the day and away from sunlight or before bed. I do not use this when I go out even though it would do nicely under makeup simply because it doesn't have SPF, ladies, and you want that sunscreen protection.Now the moisturizer itself is rich, creamy, feels absolutely wonderful on face and neck, and did I mention, it smells wonderful?I've been using Olay products after my esthetician friend told me that it is still one of the best and most researched brands on the market, and ironically, one of the most affordable ones. I have normal skin, but a very sensitive skin too and it works fine on my face. I've enjoyed it so much over the years and this one is among one of my favorites now. (Even without the SPF)!. Good luck and hope this helped. Take good care of your skin!"
1,I have short hair so I need a small roller brush.  I have one that I use at home & I've been taking back & forth to the gym.  I couldn't find anything like this in the local stores.  It arrived and is perfect.  I now have my older one in the toiletry case I keep in my gym bag.
0,"It's whatever.Been using the whole month but see no difference, maybe it's just me?Anyways, it shouldn't take more than 2 weeks to clear up your acne and maybe 2 months to completely rid of the scars. The pills didn't do much as far as I can see, but the cream helped a bit. But you have to mix it with moisturizer or you get SO DRY!And don't even think about putting make-up on over it because you'll get cakey as as a burnt biscuit.idk, guess some ppl had success? It's cheap so you have a 50-50 chance of it working, it may be worth a shot. but didn't work for me =/"
1,"I looked around for quite a bit as I wasn't sure which brush to buy and based on the rating system for this one I decided to give it a try.Over-all:Great quality; not too small; great service/delivery; it doesn't pull on my hair/wigs, and I love how it help to keep the curls. I too concur this is a good product for the cost.This Review has been brought to you by 'Awakened1'.** See all my reviews:http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34AZ5B6CCBLPN/ref=cm_cr_pr_auth_rev?ie=UTF8&sort;_by=MostRecentReview"
1,"After watching too many Philosohy promos on a popular shopping network, I finally decided to try some of their products. This was jus so so. Pretty color, which I can do by adding mica to any clear shower gel. Smell was nice, but doesn't last past the point of drying off. Small amount for the money. Did NOT leave my skin feeling moisturized. My Tone body wash leaves a much nicer feel, for a much nicer price."
1,"Item works great, smells great, its a cream so i will not know if it works until some time, but so far i love it"
1,"First of all, I'm 51, so I'm not a 25 year-old who has no real wrinkles or skin issues such as unevenness and sun damage. I've got it all, plus super sensitive skin. I've been using this product during the day and even sometimes at night for a few weeks now with no irritation and great results. Some of my friends had mentioned another product that might be even better, so I briefly switched to RoC's Deep Wrinkle line. OMG. I only lasted two days using it because of the perfumes and the general heaviness/oiliness I experienced, not to mention it made my eyes water (and I didn't even put any around my eyes). I took those products back, needless to say. The grass is always greener--not.Neutrogena Healthy Skin is a great line in general. I now use the eye cream and the night creme as well as the day creme. I will stick with this line and not stray again. It goes on silky, no oily feel, no harsh perfumes, and no skin or eye irritation (and I use it around my eyes). I wake up looking a little brighter every day. Deeper smile lines and brow furrows are softening more and more, skin is more even and sun damage is lightening up. :)Love the line. Works for me.UPDATE APRIL 12, 2014 (I am now 52.5, fyi)Well, I have to admit, I've been lax about using my little best buddy face cream since I wrote my original review...To my dismay, at my skin check, my dermatologist asked me ""What are you doing differently since I saw you 6 months ago? Your skin looks more uneven, and I think you may even need a special cream for some developing actinic keratosis."" (common rough patches from UV exposure that can lead to skin cancer). I freaked out a bit and thought immediately that about six months ago, I stopped using this cream...damn. I had moved and disrupted my routine, blah, blah, blah and thought that a couple of days wouldn't hurt me. Well, a couple of days turned into months...She told me that I could either go the prescription route that stings like an SOB and makes your face all red and weird for days....or I could go back to using the Neutrogena and STICK WITH IT. I think I'll do the Neutrogena...live and learn, my friends."
1,"I like this one, but prefer my Denman.  I gave this one to my son, who has an afro and he was really excited at how easily he could comb through his hair after it was freshly washed."
1,This polish is worth buying the colors are great. And after one week youre nails still look good.a w orth it purchase.
1,I like new improved L'Oreal Superior Preference 6A Light Ash Brown.It feels lightweight and carefree when I colored my hair.T. M.
1,"Fairly new to BareMinerals but this was my 2nd foundation pack. It was a great value for the amazing coverage you get :) Will continue to use, by far the best foundation on the market."
1,"I love Essie polishes. The only ones I have trouble with are the whites and off-whites. But I was able to save those for now with some Orly thinner. I have not had the chance to try this polish on my nails but I swatched it on a plastic coated paper plate. (I know, kinda cheap) This polish is absolutely beautiful! I can't wait to wear it. In the bottle and on the swatch the color is exactly as pictured on Amazon. Love, love, love it! I will write more when I am able to wear it."
0,Didn't seem to help anything. Used in my hair dye shampoo and conditioner an didn't notice a difference. I wouldn't waste my $ just buy a toner or toning shampoo.
1,"Does a great job of brightening up complexion.  I use the mask once a week to rid my face of dead skin, tighten pores and clear up any blemishes.  The cool mint is refreshing and rejuvenating.  Love this stuff."
1,I have used this product for awhile. It doesn't smell nearly as strongly as other permanent hair coloring products I've tried.  The trade off is that you have to leave it in for much longer.  It actually seems to cover gray hairs better than more mainstream products I've tried.
1,"This is hands down my favorite moisturizer. It's worth every cent. It feels great, lasts all day, and no more dry skin."
1,I have really really really really dry skin.  I cannot emphasize how dry my skin is.  I also have sensitive skin and have been recently transitioning to national products.  I picked this up at a local health food store and I am fairly impressed. It did a fairly good job at removing my makeup but I still used a bit of coconut oil to remove the rest of my waterproof eyeliner. (to be fair i have not met a cleanser yet that can remove it all)  It was very gentle and moisturizing on my skin.  I did not like the scent it smelled kind of like plastic but it's not enough to put me off.  I will continue to use this and would buy again.
0,it's okay i bought this off of a youtube review lets just say not everyone has the same skin type
1,"I've used this color for the past 15 years, and I've enjoyed the texture, quality, and color every time.  Difficult to find, often sold out, and there is a good reason for that.  It is a great neutral shade that goes on lighter on than the tube photo shows, which is more of a medium color.  Not too dark, not to light.  My friends use this and we are mature women with mature skin.  Back in the day when I used to still tan, it also looked great, but it also does well with fair to medium skin tones.  I no longer tan my face, and this gives my pale lips lots of color without washing out my white with freckles face! I find the color is flattering with most everything I wear except orange and warm reds, which is not in my wardrobe.My colors is considered to be between Summer and Winter (Color Me Beautiful book)and that basically means I usually wear the cool colors, not the warm ones. I don't find it to be super long lasting, but I actually prefer that. It feels great on my lips, and I don't mind reapplying it after eating.  Taste is nothing special.  I don't notice any lipstick taste unless I'm using a flavored fruit type of lip balm, so not sure what other reviewers were expecting it to taste like. Hope that helps someone decide which colors they want.  One other add: I bought this on a subscription delivery schedule, but I noticed that it has increased to over $2 more than last month. That was disappointing. I'll be keeping an eye on that before I order it again."
1,The best of its kind on the market. Love the single packets. Correct dosing that way. Really helped with the yucky hot flashes and exhaustion! Saved my sanity. Smells better than a lot of the other ones on the market.
1,"I had been looking for heated rollers for some time and decided to go with these based on reviews and also the fact that I begin each morning at the gym so figured as these were  &#34;Travel&#34; they could go with me so I could alternate from my usual straightened hair look!Then they arrived and first thing...they are travel mainly  due to dual voltage not size! So great if you travel outside the US and need this function - but not great if like me you travel in the US for business / or need to take to the gym as this set is by no means compact! Yes, there are ladies who bring a roller suitcase to my gym rather than a gym bag but as I have no plans to join their ranks anytime soon so this large, bulky set is not great for those who need a compact set for on the go.Second, they barely heat up and certainly not in the advertised &#34;2 quick minutes&#34;. After 10 minutes they were a medium / luke warm and got no warmer so I gave them a bash! Now the size is actually pretty good and even though I have quite long hair, the number of rollers was suffice for what I needed which was root volume not a head full of tight curls (which this set will not do). I let them cool and actually got a soft wave and nice volume....for all of about 30 minutes!! Maybe not even that! They were simply not warm enough to be effective.I sent them back (Thanks Amazon for a great retune policy) and replaced with a more traditional set which I do like : Conair Compact Hairsetter, Blue which are about the same set in terms of the set...but more rollers that do warm up!"
1,"My boyfriend and I both have very fair skin that's prone to redness. Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moist is a little too orange and shiny on its own. But mixed with Eucerin Redness Relief moisturizer, it's the perfect moisturizer to cover up small imperfections, reduce redness, and provide a natural-looking tone. By itself on my boyfriend, it looks like he's wearing some sort of shimmery makeup. But mixed with the Eucerin Redness Relief (which is green in color), it looks very neutral and natural. I also love the SPF 30!"
1,"A friend and I both bought the light/fairly light bareMinerals kit which includes this foundation. We both have sensitive skin prone to redness. I loved the feel and application of Bare Escentuals. Once you get the hang of it, it is so easy to apply. The look and coverage was fantastic for the overwhelming weightlessness of the minerals.After a few hours of wearing the minerals, though, both of us had crazy itchiness on our faces. After a day or two of wearing it, my skin got really red. I looked up some reviews online and I guess this is a common reaction for people with highly sensitive skin due to an ingredient, bismuth oxide. So please test this before buying it.If you do not normally have sensitive skin, ENJOY, because it does provide great flawless coverage.  --JRD"
1,"Okay, I'll admit that I'm not extremely good at curling my hair for some reason. I can't tell if it's just lack of talent on my part, or if my hair just won't have any of it. Anyway, with this curling iron my hair actually holds a curl, and holds it well. They don't look perfect - which may be my fault - but I've tried a few curling irons and so far I've seen the best result come from this one."
1,"i have four bottles... one upstairs and one downstairs, one in car and one at work. i love this stuff. cleans and refreshes and no string. more hydreated skin too!"
1,I love love love this! Its thick and rich without being oily. Having combo skin everything is hit or miss when it comes to face items. This is stellar and beyond what I expected. I have fine laugh lines and after only 3 days I see them smoothing out already... Just awesome!
0,"Initially this smelled good, when I dabbed a bit on my wrist. The scent was light and faint, not at all overpowering, in fact it was almost unnoticeable. I put my wrist to my nose several times throughout the day and could smell almost nothing. The next day I rolled more oil on and still, no real smell. I have no idea why. Maybe it's me. I won't repurchase."
0,"These smell like rubbing alcohol, and nothing else. It stings slightly as I use the towelette on my face. I am afraid to use these near my eyes to remove my eye makeup. I will not buy again. These wipes leave my skin too dry. And the makeup still seems hard to remove with these wipes.I like the neutrogena hydrating towelettes much better! They seem better for sensitive skin."
1,"First know that these products come in pretty small bottles. Also, I'm a diehard OPI Nail Envy fan and have been for years. When I was out of my Nail Envy a little while ago my mother actually gifted me a bottle of her Nailtiques. So, I was actually able to try this product for myself. For me, it worked about as well as Nail Envy. It's not a large bottle so I didn't use if for very long. But I didn't notice it to work any better for me in that time than Nail Envy.I started using Nail Envy after my second pregnancy, and it was the only thing that worked for me. My nails grow just fine on their own, but began to break very easily after my youngest was born. Nailtiques is the *only* other product I've tried that's comparable to Nail Envy.However, if you ask my mother she'll say that this product is actually better than OPI. I'm not convinced that she really used the Nail Envy as directed, and religiously for at least 2 weeks straight lol. She says she did, but in any event it didn't help her. All of my life, my mother's nails have been short. She blames me for ""stealing her protein"" as she was never able to grow her nails long again after having me. Fast forward to now, and she has CLAWS.Her nails are just entirely too long now, but she won't file them down as she's having fun. It's the first time she's had long nails in 3 decades and she's loving it. So, if you didn't like OPI's Nail Envy, definitely try this product. While Nailiques is lower in price in the stores, it's also smaller in size. While the directions call for only one coat, I still feel the need to apply two, as it paints on rather thinly. By comparison, Nail Envy is thick enough with only one coat, but calls for two for the initial application. Even then I still feel the OPI bottles last longer.Please note that while the directions in both brands now state that you can apply over nail color after initial application, I would strongly recommend that you stay away from nail color for two weeks when you're first starting out. Just stick to the nail strengthener and reapplications till you notice some improvement.Also, be sure to file/cut/buff any cracks or splits that are already in your nails. This product will not mend damage that has already occurred."
1,"This hand cream is too thick and doesn't absorb fast or properly. It does a pretty good job at keeping your hands from cracking, it's just too hard to apply. I usually use this with some moisturizing gloves at night so it can absorb into my skin better. It's just okay."
0,"Just for background information: I have very fair, sensitive skin. I've been using the Aveeno Ultra Calming moisturizer for several years, and while I like it since it doesn't break me out, it doesn't provide the extra bit of moisture that my skin sometimes requires.  This past summer, I used the tinted Positively Radiant moisturizer, and I was satisfied with it - it provided a nice amount of tint and moisture, and for the first time ever, I even got compliments on my skin. So, when the skin on my cheeks started to get quite dry a few weeks ago, I researched a multitude of products, and after reading review after review, I decided to give this product a try since I'd had luck with Aveeno in the past (I also had a coupon, which didn't hurt, either). I used a very small amount when I first got the moisturizer home, and it seemed okay - there was a smell that was a little strong, but it eventually went away, and my skin looked dewier and healthier.  About an hour later, I began to notice a bit of itching on my face, but it would come and go and wasn't all that intense, and I figured that it was just the dry skin rearing its head again.The next day, I used a small amount of the moisturizer again, and in short order, the itching returned, and grew progressively worse during the day. Unfortunately, since I was at work, I didn't have the means available to wash my face or anything, so I had to basically suffer for several hours. Meanwhile, I started to notice that a small amount of redness had begun to appear through my foundation.  I wasn't overly worried; as soon as I got home, I washed everything off my face, and apart from some residual redness, everything seemed relatively okay. By the next morning, though, things were decidedly not okay. When I woke up, my face was bright red and itching unbearably. I tried using cool water to rinse my face, in the hopes that it would alleviate some of the itching, but once the water hit my skin, my face started burning.That was yesterday morning, and even as I type this, my face is incredibly red, itchy, burning, and peeling. To make matters worse, my skin has broken out from forehead to chin in innumerable bumps.  Given my past positive experiences with Aveeno products, I certainly did not expect this to happen, but this moisturizer has burned my skin like nothing else I've ever used.This product has myriad positive reviews on many different websites - I think that, if your skin isn't of the sensitive variety, this product might work very well for you.  However, I have to caution anyone who has even the slightest bit of skin sensitivity against using this moisturizer. Whether it's the amount of SPF, the fragrance, one of the other ingredients, or a combination of any of these factors, this product has given me the worst experience I've ever had with a face product."
1,"I have very dry, very oily skin... not sure how oily and dry exist at the same time but it does and it exists on my face. I've tried creams, face washes and it seems they are only temporary solutions - sooner or later the signs of dry skin appear and it drives me nuts! I've never had a facial nor have I ever been to a spa, I hate trying new things I don't know the first thing about so I decided to opt for an &#34;at home&#34; solution. The directions on this bottle say to use it once every few days or as needed so I decided the first week of use should be an &#34;every day&#34; type deal and I wasn't disappointed. After 7 days of every-day use my skin was more hydrated looking and felt a heckofalot smoother. My hunny commented that the redness in my face (from dry skin) had subsided and it was a miracle! I did leave the mask on a lot longer than instructed, the bottle says to leave it on 10 minutes or until dry...I tend to leave it on a good half hour.It's a bit difficult to put on and can be messy. First day I had it I tried to use my fingers but it went on too thick an started to drip off my face, I looked like my face was melting off. The second day I got wise and used a makeup sponge to try and apply the thick, gooey paste and that worked much better. Still got some on my hands and what not but overall MUCH tidier and easier ti spread it out thinly.You do NOT need to apply this product generously - seriously, spread it very, very thin and you will see when it dries that it's plenty strong enough to peel in one piece.The peeling process is by far the coolest part lol. I start by stretching my face by making all sorts of grimaces - that is usually enough to loosen it around the edges making it easier to grab and peel. It's pretty strong and stretchy so if you've given it enough time to dry. It peels pretty cleanly off skin but small hairs tend to get stuck and pieces of the mask will be a headache to get off. Sometimes even after a shower little pieces of the mask are stuck in my hairline.Overall I am pleased with this product and I will keep using it. You can't go wrong."
1,"This is a good leave-in conditioner.  The scent is great.  I just wish it was a tad bit thicker because it's very watery and runny and I prefer leave-ins that have a silkier, thicker feel.  But I would definitely buy again."
0,"I would LOVE to have received the pictured product, which I ordered. INSTEAD, I was sent the Helioplex &#34;new&#34; product - which is NOT the one pictured. Amazon STILL has not corrected this problem which I called to their attention numerous times when I returned the product that was delivered to me.Again - the PICTURED product is NOT the product that is offered for sale."
1,"These are great headbands if you are able to put them in and let them be. If you will need to adjust them, however, then be prepared to restyle entirely. The combs create a nice strong grip, and the earpieces are off-set for a comfortable fit."
1,"I am in my early 50s, Philosophy products are wonderful.  I haved been using the Help Me Retinol Treatment at night for about a year now.  It really does help in all the areas that I wanted to see results. I had a small brown aging spot on my cheeck that is gone now, fine lines have disappeared and my neck tone is firmer.  I am very faithful about using it every night.  Philosophy products are of high quality and I feel that comfortable applying them to my skin."
1,"I'm a cashier at Rite aid, and this guy came to my check stand and bought 2 of the Eucerin Q10 cremes. I asked him if it worked well, and his answer was pretty much ""it's amazing and only rite aid sells it!""So since it was buy one get the second one 50 % off I decided to get the Q10 and the night creme.I get very dry skin, def when the whether is cold. It gets peely and red and it's awful to deal with. Also, I tend to break out with this whether. I opened the container and I was happy that is was truly fragrance free (my skin will break out with fragrances). The yellow color is from all the natural ingredients, it's not bad at all. It's a thicker cream, but when I apply it in the morning I can put make up over it and work all day and everything is good! My dry, red skin is gone too. This creme is amazing. :)"
0,"I purchased my first jar on special at Whole Foods. It was a great price and a nice sized jar. However, the product is not good for my skin. I've been using it for a month and, in the last few weeks, I've had a horrible rash that burns like my face is on fire. I could not figure out what it was until I used some of the moisturizer tonight (to soothe the rash.  After a minute or so, my face started to break out in a bright red rash and my skin was on fire.  I immediately washed it off and applied an ice pack.  It still is inflamed but not stinging anymore.  After research, I realized that it contains sodium hydroxide (or lye) which is extremely caustic.  I don't know what the manufacturers were thinking!"
1,"Yes, you read that right. Mends menopausal hair. You know...hair so dry you can light a match on one strand. I leave this in for at least 20 minutes while I shower. My hair is so baby soft and silky!!!! This is one of those products I refuse to live without."
0,The wand is short and the mascara seems too thick.  I guess that's why it's &#34;thickening&#34;.  Will go back to Maybelline Great Lash next time.
1,"I bought this based on Truth in Aging  reviews for Reviva Labs products. While I am not displeased, I am not overly impressed.  It goes on smoothly and absorbs well, but slowly.  I do think that my dark circles improved  and it feels good and cooling on my eyes. So far, this is the only brand I have used so I can't say how it compares other brands."
1,"nice color, coats real well. A little to thin for stamping but great for other designs with silver. easy application and no mess"
1,"Love, love, love this conditioner. It helps my hair to be manageable, and soft at the same time. My mom and sister uses this conditioner as well ... With superb results of course."
0,"These recent reviews are correct.I never tried the past formula but this one is no good.I didn't care for it the first couple times I tried it, but I had to give this another shot because my usual moisturizer ran out.  I was slow in picking that one up because it's $15 (pretty pricey but oh so worth it).  I should have just broke the bank because this stuff broke my face.I was wondering why I was breaking out more than usual.  I typically break out along my lower cheeks, but it was spreading to my temples and forehead.I just bought my usual moisturizer yesterday, and I already see an improvement overnight.  It's gonna take a couple weeks to get rid of the mess this caused, I'm sure.Seriously, try to look for a more natural product.  Don't waste your time & money on this.On a good note for Purpose, I do use their gentle cleansing wash which is A-OK!"
1,"I liked this product as it worked at the time, but it contains alcohol and I don't like to put alcohol on my face"
1,"Weirdly, the comment I get the most when I wear this is, &#34;Your eyelashes are so long! Do you wear mascara?&#34; I don't think it's super lengthening; it's more about the natural color (for my auburn hair and green/hazel eyes, anyway) and the fullness they give. It looks very natural. Definitely worth the price!!"
1,"I needed a lash adhesive that actually worked, and this was recommended to me.I was fighting with an inferior glue and trying to get my lashes to stick all day.  I was losing!I ordered this product, which came in 2 days, and tried it before a Christmas party I was attending.  I brought it along, just in case the lashes started lifting on me like usual.  I never had to use it!  The Duo adhesive holds perfectly, and the white glue color does dry completely clear.I love this product and highly recommend it to keep your lashes on all day long with no lifting of the corners, or glue showing on your eyes."
1,"It is not easy for me to find make up that I like, especially blush.  My skin is fair with warm undertones, which means that most of the blushes out there are either too dark for me and/or don't go with my skin tone.  Often, they make me look like a clown.  Recently, I have come to prefer cream blushes, but the product I was using didn't have enough tint - and, didn't really go with my skin tone anyway.On my most recent search for a blush, I found the NARS Multiple.  I did a comprehensive search to try to figure out which shade(s) would work with my skin tone and actually found a blog post that identified Portofino and South Beach as possibilities.  I decided to try Portofino first.I really, really like it.  The shade goes with my skin tone.  I put a little on my cheek, distribute it with my fingertips, and then blend it in with a flat kabuki brush and it looks dewy and natural and really good.  Finally, I'm 50 and it took this long to find a blush I really, really like.Note:  I use this brush - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F008GFQ/ref=oh_details_o07_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1"
1,Make my skin feels refreshing and clean.  I have sensitive skin but this product does not bother me at all
1,"This cream felt really good on my face, but after using if for a few weeks I really didn't notice any improvement in my skin texture or tone."
1,"I like this product, but it really does turn your hair a reddish tone which is exactly what I try to avoid.I have like dirty blonde hair and didn't have much of a reddish tone in my hair but now I do a little after using this product.If you don't mind that it's great!"
1,You have to use a ton of this product to get it through your hair.  Aubrey Organics makes a glycerin protein conditioner that is just as good but at a way better value.  FYI be sure to use a hydrating mask after any protein treatment.
1,"This is gentle on my face, yet it cleans it very well.  I have been using this with the Alpha Hydroxy lotion, and I have seen positive results on my skin.  I recommend this cleaner.  It does the job."
1,"I started a new skin regimen recently, retinol cream, AHA 8% cream and this Olay Regenerist Daily Serum, and I'm amazed that I can see a difference already, in a week. My skin is smoother and healthier looking and even a little tighter, altho there is not yet a huge difference in that department. Still, I recommend this as part of your skin care regimen because it seems to give the others a boost. I useOlay Complete All Day UV Moisturizer, SPF 15, Sensitive Skin, 6 Ounce (Pack of 2)every day, as well."
0,"I like bay rum generally, and think that the regular Clubman aftershave and talc smell nice, so thought I'd give this a try.  I couldn't even bring myself to put it on--when I opened the bottle, my first impression was that it smelled like a skunk!Now, that sounds like I'm being dramatic--but no, this actually smells like skunk spray.  I tried sniffing it again several times to be sure I wasn't just crazy, but it really smells nasty.  If you want bay rum, spend more and go forRoyall Bay Rhum All Purpose Cologne Splash, 8 Ounce, or some other brand.  If you are looking for something cheap that has a classic, old-fashioned barbershop smell, go for the regular Clubman aftershave (Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion, 6 Ounce), or the extremely classicClubman Jeris Osage Rub, 14 Fluid Ounce, orMaster Well Comb Spice After Shave Lotion 15 oz.  Don't bother with this one.IF I can bring myself to actually put this on sometime, maybe it will wear differently, and I'll edit this review.  But I would only try that if I'm not going to be around anyone for a few hours, before taking a shower!"
1,I bought this to try to tame the frizzy side hairs near my temples and ears that stick out when I wear my hair up.  It doesn't do the job that I needed it to do. The fragrance is okay but not as fresh as I would have liked.
1,"I didn't see any improvements in my frown lines. If I keep it on overnight, temporarily the lines don't show up.No permanents effects."
1,"Use before or after moisturizer, and in a week or 2 you will see a difference. I'm 37 and pass lying that I'm 25 lol. Follow up with oil of Olay purple night cream. You'd be surprised"
1,"We had a very similar (if not identical) mirror that I had for years.  Recently my husband dropped it and the mirror shattered, so I was in the market for a new one.This looked very similar to what I had and the price was right so I gave it a try.  I'm pretty sure it was the exact mirror I replaced.I've always been happy with it.  I don't use it too often but when I do need it I'm glad I have it.  I haven't had it that long to comment on the durability but for a few bucks, I'm currently completely satisfied."
1,"I will buy this again on Amazon when I run out. unscented, creamy and rinses off completely. A reasonable price for 3 bars."
0,"I was looking for a natural toner to replace my favourite Humphries - I saw that there were many good reviews for this one and considered buying it until I looked at the ingredients.It contains Butylene Glycol & Methylparaben which have been flagged by the skincare website as damaging and carcinogenic to skin cells.I am sorry, but this is just not natural enough for me."
0,"2% Hydroquinone is the active ingredient and you can get products with this much Hydroquinone at CVS, Walmart or Walgreens.  Of course for fraction of the price.  Not to mention, it leaves a orange tint on your skin, which you will be able to see if you are using it alone.  Will not buy again."
0,"I hate this stuff! It didn't do anything to help my acne. All it did was make my skin so painfully sensitive all over! I wish I could get a refund. I used it for a good week. I have hormonal acne, and this had no impact on it. It was as if I'd put nothing at all on (aside from the horrible dryness and burning)."
0,"I'm not a big fan of this body wash.  It is supposed to smell like Honey Mango, but I smell a lot of floral hints.  I won't buy this again."
1,It sometimes tough to find a good face lotion that protects you from the sun. I use this as a daytime lotion and it gets the job done!
1,It's really thin so it's easy to create a translucent silver layer which I love. I tried to draw with the polish using tapes but it leaked everywhere. The color is gorgeous though.
1,EEEK!  Again Bare Minerals changes their color names.  I was using Dusk so I had to make a guess and I thought Glory appeared close (cant always tell on-line)I received it and I feel I've done well.  I love this product and don't want to give it up.  Light and doesnt feel like makeup.Thank you!MEF
1,I think most of these adhesives have a smell to them.I would apply a small amount to the skin on your hand just to make sure you don't have any allergy to it before applying it to your eyelids. It dries black like everyone says. Anyways it works like it's supposed to.
1,This crayon is mainly for roots.  I tried it all over my hair and it didn't do well.  The dark brown is just right and seems to be not really dark but more medium.
1,"Out of nowhere, I started to develop adult acne. I mainly break out twice a month. So whenever the redness and marks would start to go away, new acne would pop up. So I always had new pimples and old marks. I was so frustrated. I used the top acne lines out there and they almost seemed to make it worse. So I tried this product. I would cleanse my face, apply this to the effected areas and then use a moisturizer. This has worked better for me than the well-known acne treatments. And the best part is that it's inexpensive."
1,I have been using this lotion for over a month now and I really like it.  I researched new lotions online and this came up as dermatologist recommended so I took a chance and ordered it.  It is perfect for moisturizing before putting on make-up because it does not leave the skin oily or greasy.  I have sensitive skin and it seems to be perfect for me.
1,Bought this for my husband since he works as an electrician his hand are always dry and sometimes split this repaired his handswithin a week of using this at night i even use this myself and have noticed how much softer my hands are.
1,"It works great on straightening my hair, but the thing is, you'll have to use it with some kind of heat protectant, or it will really damage or burn your hair. I use it with the Sedu Smoothing Spray thingy. It works great with this. Other than that, my hair stays straight for the rest of the day until I shower. Really good. Large surface allows me to iron my hair out quicker.Love this product. I have it 4 stars because it will burn your hair unless you use a heat protectant. but it isn't that much work. Much cheaper than the Sedu Flat iron."
1,"This is such a great product, it really helped my brother stop biting his nails which was a great accomplishment! I recommend this product."
1,"I have had several of these of different brands, styles, features and prices and this one is by far the best. I owned one of these years ago and used it for years until it finally gave out. I replaced that one with a different brand. And then another and another but never got the same results. None of them ever had enough power to actually dry my hair. All of them touted fancy features and promised amazing results in the most easy to use design but they all ended up in my junk drawer.This one has 1200 watts of power. That's as much as a blow dryer because that's how much you need to dry your hair! If I wanted to use two appliances to dry and style my hair I'd blow dry it and then use a curling iron or flat iron. The whole point of these things is to take out the extra step and make it all happen in one. If a blow iron can't dry your hair you might as well be using a curling iron instead.But this one actually DOES do both. I just placed my order for this one and can't wait to get it. It's the exact same one I used to own and love except for the color.The only issue I had with my previous one was the seam in the plastic where the brush head connected to the base used to snag my hair out from time to time but I was able to fix that issue with a simple hair tie wrapped around to cover the seam.If you have thick, curly, frizzy, stubborn, resistant or even soft fine delicate hair, I highly recommend this styler. It's powerful enough for the toughest hair but with different heat settings it can be gentle enough for the most delicate baby hair. Use to fully dry and style or just to touch up, smooth and add extra body. Your hair will love it."
1,"Witch Hazel Pads recieved four stars because they are what I was looking for in an astrigent pad.They are convenient, affordable, made with natural ingredients with no harsh chemicals, and they do not have this overwhelming fruity smell like most other astrigents or facial cleansers.  The reason why I did not give this product the full five stars is because the pads would be better if they were slightly bigger.  Because of the size, sometimes I have to use more than one.  Also, I wish that this product was eligible for the free super savings, but it was not when I made the purchase.  Other than that, this is an overall good natural product."
1,"The rollers heat up very quickly and the carrier is light weight. I had expected the rollers to be larger since they are advertised as &#8220;jumbo&#8221; but they are basically like the large rollers from a standard set. I have too much hair for these rollers to actually be very useful, since they aren&#8217;t very large and there are only five of them, but the product works well."
1,"I'm a pale redhead and I have sensitive skin that loves moisture. I've always been a fan of Burt's Bees and wanted to give it a try. It works great. I love the smell, it smells to me like a carrot cake shot. It supplies my skin with a good amount of moisture but doesn't cause breakouts, or a rash. It has a thicker feeling than I was used to but my skin looks great and feels soft. This works great in the winter months. This contains a lot too. I know this product will last me a good while."
1,I have been using this with my Clarisonic face wash thing and I am happy so far.  It def exfoliates and seems to be okay on my skin.  I really liked the price so that is what made me purchase in the first place.  I will continue with it.  I would recommend this to anyone.
0,"I couldn't wait to get this eye pillow. I read the reviews and was hoping that the scent wasn't too overpowering. Well it came last night, I opened the box expecting a beautiful scent of lavender and I can BARELY smell the scent. I don't know if I just received one that was older or what, but when I used it last night the lavender was so faint that even holding it up to my nose didn't work. I love the fabric and it's very well made, just doesn't smell...is there something you can do?"
1,"This product is not sold in the stores anymore as far as I can tell.  I like it because the cream is not too strong, nor is it too gentle and the pills really work. I find I get less pimples, even during that time of the month, when I take them."
1,This antibacterial soap this great for my acne prone face and leaves no greasy film.  Very gentle and feels good.
0,"So i was pretty excited that i got this in the mail, but seriously.....i think its just the color of mine, i don't know, not good cover stick... Received it sticking to the top...so basically it was broken when i opened it because of the air mail looks very pasty...very white i shall say...im never buying this product ever.."
1,These buff pads are the best.  I tried a less $$ brand and No comparison.  I use them with a sugar scrub and it really makes a difference with my skin.  REALLY squeaky clean.
1,"I haven't been consistent in using this product so I can't really give a good review. I did however use it for the first two weeks in getting it in the mail, and I did notice my forehead wrinkles smoothing out some. I also cut smaller pieces and used it on the side of my eyes for (crowsfeet) and I didn't enjoy the pulling off of that area in the morning, it kinda hurt? But I will continue to use it on my forehead soon."
1,"First off, I do have slightly oily skin, so people with normal or dry skin would probably have a better time with this product.I got this pretty cheap, so for the price I can't complain much. I wanted to try it and now I have, and for me at least, it was just 'okay'.I found the cream a little too thick, and it felt a little greasy after use. It was okay for using at night, but I want a cream I can use before I put my makeup on too.However, I will say that it is indeed good for sensitive skin. I never experienced any redness or itchiness like with some products."
1,"First use of this particular product, but long time user of the Clean line.  Most recently used used the Triple Moisturzer from Neutrogena.  The hair comes out clean and soft. Can't ask for much more.So why four stars, not five - I only give to truly outstanding products five stars.  This is very good and recommended."
1,"I have sensitive/combination/dry/acne-prone skin, and I was looking for a miracle after experiencing my first intense breakout in years. I first purchased this in November to clear my skin and alleviate the acne-induced discolorations/texture issues, and, for two months, I used a pea-size amount on my face every night.  During that time, my skin got significantly clearer/brighter without any retinol-induced irritation.In January, I experimented with a prescription tretinoin cream with unsuccessful results.  After about a month and a half of daily use, I had to stop due to insistent patches of extreme dryness/flakiness around my mouth and chin and a major pimple that migrated to different locations on my face but refused to disappear.  I eventually returned to Help Me and all my issues disappeared.  About a month ago, I got complacent and stopped applying this.  After about a month, I realized that my skin was dull and not as clear as it had been.  I applied Help Me, and my skin immediately improved overnight.  I'm never straying from this again."
1,"I've been using Roc product with Retinol for years. This one I really love because it's the last thing I do at night, is put this on my face. I'm 62, and no one ever believes me. I have very few wrinkles, crow's feet, etc. if any. My face stays clear of any pimples as well, as I have Rosacia. Excellent buy when you can find it on Amazon."
1,"I am so happy I stumbled across this product! I have been using Neem oil for quite sometime, & was very impressed with the results! My skin was much clearer, the breakouts were less severe & frequent! Neem is not the best smelling, but it worked well and I was able to over look the smell. I found this wonderful cream with a nice vanilla scent to it masking the Neem smell. I really love this face cream!!! What's not to love really? 1. It works! (for a variety of skin conditions.) 2. It is 100 all natural and organic! 3. The price is great! 4. Leaves your skin nourished & hydrated! Give it a try and see the wonderful benefits of Neem for yourself!"
1,"This soap is pure, organic, lathers luxuriously, and is an excellent value in this size option--I have been using it for many years."
1,The Nail Tek Crystal File with case is the perfect way to transport your crystal file without damaging it.  Sometimes your nails snag and you are not at home.  I keep this product in my handbag.  I recommend it as the on the go file.
1,"Received this color as a gift for Christmas and I love it.  It's a great neutral gray, and I see the olive green hints in it too that another reviewer saw.  I guess color is subjective.  Looks so cute with my olive green cords and a dark top, especially next to purples.  It also lasts a really long time without chipping."
1,"These are very nice, a little too skinny on the top (I would prefer more cotton), but otherwise these are nice. They never band when I use them. I am sure if pressed significantly, they will bend, depends on the purpose of usage."
1,Dried out in ghe tube after three weeks I only used this item once and threw the tube away.
1,I have never used anything like this and decided to give this a try and I was so shocked on how it worked well with my skin. No longer will I go back to what I was using. This is the real deal.
1,"This is the best exfoliating cloth I've used yet. It's just the right amount of abrasiveness - it actually feels good! It's thin enough that you don't need to dump on a ton of soap, and you can get into small spaces. I love the fact it's long, because I don't have the flexibility to get my back thoroughly anymore. The only thing left to test is longevity of the product."
1,"If regular Tea Tree oil is too strong for your sensitive skin, you might enjoy using it in a more subtle form, like in this skin cr&egrave;me with vitamin E.There are many uses for this product and the ingredients are: Purified Water, Tea Tree Oil, Safflower oil, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Tocopherly Acetate (Vitamin E-3,000 I.U.), Glycerin, Allantoin, Panthenol, TEA, Aloe Vera Powder, Almond Oil, Avocado Oil, Sesame Seed Oil, Horesetail Extract, Citricidal, Phenoxyethanol.Tea Tree oil is an antibacterial, antifungal and antiseptic ingredient. You can use this cream all over your entire body or just use it for problem areas, blemishes, sunburn, skin dryness, rashes, dermatitis or even on babies for diaper rash.Since this product also contains avocado oil, you will also get the benefit of vitamins A and D. This oil is easily absorbed by the skin and is quite nourishing.I used this cr&egrave;me after a day in the sun and my skin felt very healed, smooth and soft. The Aloe Vera in this product is great for sunburn or skin irritations.~The Rebecca Review"
1,"Good stuff! Relaxing smell. Best liquid soap I have found so far. Will continue to buy. Love the smell! Gentle on skin, but works well."
1,"I think with things like cleansers you should not review for about a month. I am on my second bottle of this cleanser and I can say it is excellent. My face is clean without a lot of extra steps and is blemish free. This is the  only cleanser that I have ever had that cleans without drying and my face still feels clean. You will like this, and because you dont need a lot a bottle will last you a couple of months."
1,"I used this product over the last year after head laceration. My hair was slow to regrow but then I started using this product and within a month I started to get fuzz, then real hair. (hair grows in stages so you need to be patient.) It's liquidy and spills easily out of the dropper, so I just wish it were easier to apply. But no side effects for me otherwise. No redness or burning. Very pleased. I'm continuing to use it until my hair is grown back."
1,"Took this to Europe. Worked great both there and in US. My fine, shoulder length hair does not get tangled up in it. The heat settings give you great control and protection from burning the hair. And barrel the perfect size for me. Had a 1.5 inch-just didn't get enough curl."
0,"Just another rip-off as it does nothing good at all. I used it faithfully for weeks, both with a night cream as well, and take two showers or baths per day to keep everything clean and moisturized. I think people that say it works well, are those that see what they WANT to SEE and nothing more. The tiny, tiny little bit of good that happens if any, is the same that can be accomplished with any moisturizer, and not the expensive stuff that delivers nothing THE ONLY THING THAT DISAPPEARS HERE IS OUR CASH AND NOTHING MORE."
1,So clean. So kind to my parched winter skin. Love it. You can't beat Amazon's price and service. My local health food store charges three times more for this!
1,"I was a bit scared of getting the max instead of the gentle, b/c of the alcohol content but went ahead and got the max. These pads do what they claim and do not burn or dry out my skin. I've been using this along with the AHA/BHA acne clearing gel and my skin has been transformed. My skin is smooth and pores are smaller. I'm becoming a PTR fan. I ordered 2 more products and can't wait to receive them."
1,"Okay, I always use this stuff right before I blow dry/flat iron my hair and within a minute or so it strengthens my hair enough that I can comb through it while blow drying. I love it, and it smells great. Im going to have to buy another bottle soon, but really you don't need to be soaking your damp hair in this stuff. Just section your hair into 4-5 and spritz each section once or twice. Then gently massage it into your hair, and you're good to go.LOVE THIS STUFF!"
1,"A gentle, daily product that is non-drying and non greasy.  Very little has to be used, so the product goes a long way.  No soapy residue is left behind and it is fabulous for make-up removal.  The skin feels like it can breathe after use."
1,I have been using this foundation for years and absolutely love it.  I bought it at Amazon because their price is better than the stores!!!!!  I also sent one to my daughter in another state and she loves the coverage too.
1,"I have a big, beautiful round face.  Normal headbands give me the worst headache.  When I complained to a coworker, she told me about these.  Once I got them, I have not used anything but these.  It keeps the hair out of my face when I am working on the computer and trains the hair back."
1,This was recommended by a professional make up artist and it works well!  Really recommend it!  I have used it many times and it is prefect
1,I cut my cuticles -I know people would disagree on that.. but my cuticles are too dry and hard to maintain so I cut them. I read and watched reviews on this product and decided to buy one. It is a miracle. It lasts for hours -even when after washing my hands. It does make my nail polish look filmy but my cuticles look great. It smells pleasant -not too strong. I use it for my toes and heel! I think I will repurchase this as long as the company makes it. Very impressed... and my cuticles are happy again.
0,"I don't think my skin is overly sensitive or anything but this product caused my neck to start burning and itching, I had to wash the product off of my neck immediately.It also caused my face to break out, I gave it a few tries to see if my skin just needed to get used to it but my skin was not happy.For me this was a waste of money. It also has this chemical smell that even my fiance noticed after I put it on.I would not recommend this."
1,"I have mixed feelings about this oil.  First of all, only been using it for 2 weeks so jury's still out on whether this will effectively boost my hair growth. I have afro-textured hair (3c/4a) and am growing it out naturally with a goal of waist-length hair in the next 3 years.  I'll be looking to see if I can get more than the 1/2 inch of new hair growth each month.  If I do, this will be added to my arsenal of highly-prized oils.  I must say I'm not happy with the smell in general which is why I've given it only 4 stars.  It's not offensive, but it does make me a little concerned since I work in an office.  So far I've been applying this to my scalp at night and washing it out in the morning so it hasn't been a huge issue.  I am interested in seeing what happens in 90 degree weather when the humidity is 100 percent.  I love that it seems to calm my itchy scalp and doesn't clog my pores.  I use coconut oil regularly so I know how quickly it can melt from a solid state.  However, the Brahmi oil doesn't stay solid for more than a few minutes once I start dipping my finger in it.  It liquifies quickly so something to be aware of.  Other than the scent, I really love the performance of this product.  So I would definitely recommend it. The fact that it seems to sell out so quickly should tell you something.  I won't let this run out before I order more."
1,"I love all the colors that NARS offers, especially in their lipstick. I have this in Catfight and I love the color. It is extremely long-wearing and I rarely need to reapply during the day. Unfortunately, though, the lipstick is a bit difficult to apply because it's kind of dry, and it's also drying on the lips. I've also found that this lipstick doesn't last as long as other brands because it tends to harden in the tube. I've never finished an entire NARS lipstick without having it dry out on me first. There are better products out there."
1,"Great Hair dye...half the price.......Naturtint Permanent Hair Colorant, 7c Terracotta Blonde 5.45 Fl Oz (155 Ml)....at Whole Foods this is 10.00 more a box....This is one of the safer hair dyes......"
1,Great color- tried this at a nail salon and I liked it so much that I had to track it down for myself. I will be wearing this for Valentines Day!
1,"I started using this conditioner once a week but then up'd it to daily and have noticed a huge difference in the amount of shedding. It doesn't leave my hair sticky or leave build up. This leave in is definitely not for moisturizing but when your hair needs protein and strengthening, this is the one to go to. I also noticed that it helps reduce frizz on those humid summer days.Definite hair staple."
1,This really is the best blush. The shade of pink combined with the gold sparkles gives you a glowing beautiful feeling. I highly recommend it and I have tried hundreds of beauty products
1,"A tube of lipstick could have gotten lost between the cracks, but not at Amazon.  This was a new shade and I love it!  As all my otherorders from Amazon, it was packaged perfectly, arrived shortly after ordering, and the quality was the gold standard as always withRevlon Products.  I thank anyone who saw to it that my order was handled with tender, loving care.  I appreciate it!"
1,"rather soft bristles, too much for our taste and makes static, so we gave it to our Barbies and they are happy."
1,"well first let me tell you that I'm happy with the product, but it is definitely really cheap made. I have a professional hair dryer, it is quite big and thick and it barely holds it. I have to place something behind the stand so it doesn't fall off while i'm drying my hair.I place it is high as I can and I just brush with a paddle brush til my hair is completely dry and it looks like I just straighten my hair with a flat iron.Not in love with the quality but I love the idea of not burning my fingers while I blow dry my hair and I made it work. If you have a smaller dryer I don't see yourself having an issue."
1,"I love MAC cosmetics, and yes, they are much more expensive online than at the MAC counter, but I am so busy, that it is easier for me to order online.  With that said, I love NC35.  It is a great color and lasts all day long. You must however know which color matches your skin tone, or you will just be guessing, and wasting your money.  I recommend it."
1,Alittle leary it is awful runny. If it has hardeners id expect it to be alittle thicker. Im ok with it maybe as a topcoat.
1,"I got a much bigger looking bottle than the one shown, as others have stated. The thinner seems to work ok, but seems like I do need quite a bit of it to thin polish that has become a bit thick for use. It does thin and the polish works ok."
1,"Ive been using this since like the 6th grade (Im 26 now). I use it probably 1-2x a week and its amazing. It helps minimize pores and kill current pimples. Its very easy to use. I just put it on, go do the dishwasher or something and then take a shower and get it off. I take it off in the shower with water/soap and then follow it up with the mint julep facial scrub. When I get out of the shower my face is smooth, pores are reduced and my skin is glowing.The bottle lasts forever too!"
1,Works great for me!My skin looks like a baby skin :) Love it.
1,We only use this for occasional hair washing but use it daily as a replacement for soap in the shower.  No more soap scum and it works great to clean the body!  We always have many bottles in the house and refill a larger pump bottle from another shampoo is it's easy to use.  Just one or two squirts on a washcloth is enough for a shower.
1,I absolutely love this color! I have seen swatches of this online and it really is gorgeous! The wear time is amazing! I wore mie for about 4 days with no chipping! Perfect for the summer or fall in my opinion! Makes me look tan in the summer and winter! Definitely recommend this nail color!
1,I use this once a day in the night to help get all my pores clean from the day. This has a nice light scent and makes my face really soft. I recommend this scrub.
1,"I buy this product for my spouse, who favors it over the Aveeno Lotion Moisturizer. He says that this product stays on with his hydrocortisone cream.He says that the product keeps his hands from drying out and it doesn't easily wash off. Contrary to what I thought, it doesn't leave an oily residue. I prefer to buy it online, as not many local stores stock it. I received the product within the time promised and in excellent condition. I will continue to purchase this product as long as my spouse uses it. I recommend this moisturizing oil to anyone needing long-lasting skin moisture."
1,"This product worked for my itchy rash when nothing else touched it.  This product cleared up my itchy rash within 48 hours.  The product soothes the itchy, burning sensation and clears up the problem.  High Recommend!"
1,"I use witch hazel for everything from sun burns to mosquito bites and nothing you buy will work better. My daughter gets huge extremely itchy mosquito bites and I tried calamine lotion, anti itch cream, aspirin, everything. Finally I fell back on the old standard, witch hazel and it worked beautifully. I squirt some on a cotton ball and rub it on the itch for about 10 seconds. If the itch comes back, which it probably will in a few seconds, I rub it again and that usually does the trick. I keep the cotton ball next to her bed just in case but usually there is no need.The great this about this witch hazel is that it smells beautiful.You can of course buy the much cheaper kind at the drugstore but I like this for the lovely rose smell. Especially nice when I use it on my face."
1,THIS IS THE ONLY BLUSH I LOVE ITS EXTREMELY WELL MADE AND WORTH THE PRICE! THE COLORS ARE TRUE AND VIBRANT
1,"Growing up, my mama used to scrub me down with these bath cloths.I've been looking for it since then because I can't get the same level of clean with body brushes or bath puffs.It does a perfect job of exfoliating and removing dead skin and dirt."
1,"I never thought a brush like this could make my hair smoother. When I blow dry my hair straight, this brush makes it so much easier and quicker to dry and to keep smooth. Great purchase!"
1,I have tried others but this is simply the best and removing mascara. It's great for also removing MAC paint pot base for the eyes... and for cleaning the brush that comes with it.
1,"One of the best cosmetic purchase I have made in a couple of years. I also like the rest of Olay's Regenerist line. This serum applied after shower, keeps in the natural moisture on top of which I use the micro-sculpting creme. I like this serum better than other serums I have tried, and I think it works much better than these others, to the point where I am tossing out the others."
0,"I fully expected to like this.  It does make my skin softer, but it creates a sort of film on my skin that then will sort of get gritty and rub off if I rub my hands.  It's slightly waxy. It also seems to rub off on my clothing, which I can see if I'm wearing black or dark blue.  I wonder if it might actually be the ""oat kernel flour"" that does this? Colloidal oatmeal is a powder.  I'm not going to throw it out, but I'm not going to buy it again either. I bought this at a local drug store so I can't comment on what others have said about the product having been opened or used, except to say that I don't remember it being sealed in any way."
0,"I was not impressed with this product and gave it to my girlfriend.  I prefer to use a primer before applying my makeup and didn't notice any difference in lines, skin texture, etc."
1,"Some reviewers felt that the fragrance is not 100% consistent. At first, one of my bars smelled a little different, but it started smelling like sandalwood as I used it more. I absolutely love the fragrance! The soap is slightly drying to my skin. You can use an unscented or sandalwood lotion. Fabulous price! I keep the extras next to my bed, so I can smell them when I'm relaxing."
1,I love OPI.  I love OPI colors.  I wish they came out with great lipsticks as well.  Maybe not blue but other great colors.
1,"I love this lipstick for it's capability to suit for multiple occasions. I can wear it when I'm just out with some friends during the day, at work, or at night. It really adds a slight red-orange lightness to your lips, and it stays moist! (my lips tend to get dry after wearing lipstick for a few hours) It's really a great color - I recommend this to anyone looking for something casual yet classy."
1,Do not feel comfortable wearing this product.Maybe it is something you have to get used to but I keep pushing it back in the drawer.
1,The spooly could be a little better but that's what the spoolies are for in brush sets so no biggie.
1,"Maybelline hasn't failed me yet, and this mascara is no exception. I don't wear mascara every day, but when I do, this is the one I choose. I like to look as natural as possible, and this mascara does the trick. It's not incredibly black to the point where it's obvious I have it on. It keeps my lashes up and thickens them the right amount. It does not clump and best of all I still look natural."
1,"This brush is really good at helping me blow dry my hair straight & smooth with no frizzies. It doesn't add as much volume as I expected based on some of the other reviews, or as much as my 1"" brush does, but it works great for making my hair soft, smooth, & straight.  Would highly recommend again.Edit: Sometimes my hair gets caught up in the rubber part of the handle, I really don't like that."
1,I get very dry and chapped hand in fall and winter and this lotion was a miracle for my hands! I keep the bottle in my office and use it several times on daily basis. The tea tree scent is very refreshing and moisture gets locked in for hours leaving my hands smooth and soft. I will definitely continue buying this brand
1,"Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser is the gentlest facial cleanser I have been able to find.  I am highly allergic to several different soaps and preservatives, but Cetaphil doesn't cause me to break out, itch, or dry up.I'd suggest the liquid Cetaphil cleanser instead of their soap bar, as bars can cause one to have clogged pours (read: blackheads).The only downside is that it won't remove makeup very easily, so I only use it in the morning and use my trusty cold cream at night.This 4 oz side is perfect to throw in your gym bag or overnight suitcase."
1,This is a good cover cream.It covers all dark spots and makes your face to glow.It is a non oily cream.I will recommend it to a friend.
1,I bought this hair dryer because of the price. It dries my hair nicely. It claims to have ion technology but I think it is a gimmick. My hair dries frizzy with this hair dryer like it did with my previous one that was old and didn't have ion technology.
1,NARS products never disappoint.  You get exactly what you pay for. Great product.  Lots of pigment. A must for any makeup geek.
1,didn't tingle or burn for me but for the price it got the job done. went shopping yesterday at national wholesale liquidators and found this for half the price! score!!!
1,"I like the color, keeps my hair soft better than others. However, it does not last long. It does not do well on gray hairs either. However, it is good because it does not ruin my hair."
0,Heats up fast but does not curl and my hair curls easily with everything else. This product is a complete waste of money.
1,"I have had this hot brush for several months, used it 2 or 3 times @ week and have been very pleased with it. The instant hot feature is especially nice to have when I'm behind schedule. The only reason I did not give it a 5-star rating is that it doesn't have a stand -- although, this has not been a problem to date as the tines hold it up."
1,"Great color, for reds, stays a long time after repeated washings,  and of course, speedy delivery&#8230;will order this color again&#8230;thanks, KL"
1,"Best makeup ever.  Unfortunately, I can't find it anywhere anymore for less than $30.  If you're looking for a good replacement, you might want to try Covergirl Fresh Complexion Powder Foundation.  I used to buy it when this makeup was out of stock at my local store.  It provides similar coverage, though being quite pale (ivory), their lightest shade was a tad yellow on me, which is why I always preferred Maybelline."
0,I didnt see any difference when using this product =( i could get netter results from a drug store brand.  I would not recommend this product
1,i looked high and low for this color! i have a shellac that matches this perfect. so not only is it basically the same color but it also was half the price on here!
1,I like this a lot. It is like a mix of orange and red. Very feminine and flattering. It's brighter than in the picture. A nice spring or summer color. It would suit any skin tone.
1,I'm a huge fan of this base coat. I feel like I've tried every brand out there and this is the only one that I can get at least 5 days of flawless looking nails. It is the best!!
1,I use this combined with the Deep Wrinkle Serum and I have noticed a big great difference in my forehead lines and nose to mouth lines would recommend.
1,"Does a great job of moisturizing my dry skin. I use it every day. Has a great scent, too. Highly recommend it."
1,"Even as I'm getting older my skin still breaks out sometimes and regular facial moisturizers clog my pores. This product is perfect. Used as a toner with a cotton ball it cleans and refreshes without drying.  I also have some in a small spray bottle to mist on my face for a dewy look when my face is dry. Unlike water, this seems to replenish moisture rather than leach it. And with the rosewater its smell is heavenly."
1,These work!  They are better than any cream or pill or anything!  I have two deep lines between my eyes that make me look angry all the time.  I have been using these for 2 weeks and the lines are almost completely gone. I wear them to bed at night.
1,I love this color and I wear it everyday. It is the perfect shade of everyday pink that's not too mute to go unnoticed but not too pink to attract attention. It is perfect and polished. My go to color for an at home mani.
1,"I have curly hair (chemically treated) and I noticed absolutely no difference using this. What's it supposed to do exactly? I've used protein treatments before (the Babyface Protein) and it was really nice. This Aphogee though, just didn't seem to make much difference in the way my hair felt at all. I wanted it too, because the spray-on application is very convenient. Oh well. Maybe just not the right product for me."
1,"I love this product, for its SPF quality as well as the light coverage it provides.  It goes on smoothly and I use it every morning after I wash my face.  It blends seamlessly with my skin color and provides a good base for my makeup."
1,Love this comb. It detangles curly hair easily when you have conditioner in. I have natural curly hair and I love this comb. Just remember to start detangling at the ends of hair and work towards the roots ladies.
1,It is exactly what was described. Worked good in my hair. It did worked. It Stays a lot lot longer.
1,"I've been transitioning all of my household product to more environmentally friendly alternatives and tried this soap on a whim.  I was skeptical of how well it would actually work, and unsure of whether I'd like the smell due to some negative reviews.  It works great, and the smell is lovely: subtle, fresh, and not fake or chemical-y.I use this dish soap for scrubbing pots and pans, occasionally washing a dish that didnt make it into the dishwasher, or washing delicate dishes.  It cleans easily and cuts any grease.I also squirted some of this product into a spray bottle of water and sprayed it on my flowers and vegetable plants after noticing that they were being chewed away by pests.  It really seemed to curb the destruction for a week while I researched safe pest solutions.  I may continue to just use this soap, as it's eco-friendly but apparently not bug-friendly!Great value on subscribe and save, and per another reviewer, I am one of those crazy people who has cases of various Mrs Meyers products in my pantry... but you will save a lot more in the long run and not run out for many months!"
0,"Thin little brush, takes a few coats to do anything and by that time it's a little clumpy with no extension.  The best out there is Maybelline New York Illegal Length Fiber Extensions Washable Mascara - they really give you extension and no clumps.  Once in a while I will try something else or try a new product, but nothing comes close to Illegal Length in my opinion."
0,"The color is pretty, but no where near the color on the box.  It is a mahogany/red color.  Much deeper and quite red.  There is NO gold.  I am disappointed with how dark and how red the color is.  The grey covered very well (which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1).  I don't really like the formulation -- the gel colorant is quite drippy. I also like that it only takes 25 minutes to process.  I might try it again if I had confidence about the color choice."
1,"My wife is writing this review for me:  I have tried all different eye makeup removers, either they are greasy or don't remove enough eye makeup or leave mascara behind.  This Maybelline remover works so very well, removes all of my makeup, doesn't leave my eyes greasy or leave remnants of mascara behind.  It even removes waterproof mascara.  I used Lancome for a while, and honestly, this works better and is so much less expensive.  Everyone should at least try it before buying expensive brands."
1,Hello so I got my package just in time was extreamly excited because my mom told me about this product but then it sold out its didn't seal in stores no more after I married I found the same product was thrilled about but again this store does not seal it no more came across this site was like omg had to tell hubby buy it and he did and the reson I told hubby buy cause he seen how my face is durable to use no lies even ponds cream makeup remover as well do it job to you know
1,You may not get FCUK'd wearing this but it sure does smell good so I would recommend it even though it has a perverted name.
1,"My skin is extremely sensitive. It's as if I was carved out of rice paper and hives. I needed an exfoliator, Natalie Dee suggested some glycolic acid, so I bought it.I tried it every other day after getting used to it, and it is simply too much for my delicate, easily angered skin. I broke out like a pubescent teen. So, I've switched to once a week, tops, and for now, my demon skin slumbers.Be careful, sensitive ladies and gents, this stuff is pretty powerful."
1,This nail polish is a great color and goes on in just one coat.  I was happily suprised on the fact that it arrived so promptly.  The nail polish doesn't have a strong odor and dries quickly. Definitely would recommend this product.
1,"When I purchased this brush, I paid $5.87, a significant discount to the $22 price tag on the Bare Minerals website. I've had the brush since August and have washed it every other week using hand soap and have not had any problems with &#34;shedding.&#34; Then again, I don't really press hard when applying my make-up, so maybe it's a personal thing. I think that this brush works great for highlighting and contouring and due to the low price I've purchased one for my contouring powder and one for my shimmer highlight."
1,As I'm getting older I have been looking for a cleanser that will not dry my face out any more than it already is (I have some flaking on my face). I have tried every cleanser Olay offers and none worked. I used Neutrogena makeup remover wipes so I thought I'd try the cleanser as well and it worked! I use this cleanser the alcohol free toner after and Neutrogena moisturizer for combination skin and I have finally found my combo.
1,I have Mane Maxx extensions. This loop brush is a &#34;must have&#34; for smoothing and detangling without compromising the bonds.
1,"I bought Laguna and I have a light golden tan. It shows up on my skin but BARELY. It adds some warmth but I think next time I'll go for a bit of a darker shade like Casino to add some contours to my cheekbones and to better highlight the angles of my face. These Nars bronzers are great quality though, and they don't have that horrible orange pigment that a lot of the drug store brands have and even a few of the higher end stuff. Definitely worth a try and worth the money if you pick the right color. Even though Laguna is a little too close to my skin tone, I still wear it every day over moisturizer and concealer and paired with a little blush because I love the way the light bounces off of it and gives me nice glow."
1,"I fortunately grew out of the annoying pimple phase, but I still have combination skin with a T-zone that becomes oily by early afternoon. This product, in conjunction with the Olay Complete Daily Defense All Day Moisturizer with SPF 30, has FINALLY succeeded in minimizing my oiliness. I do still have dry areas, for which the moisturizer works well. I occasionally get a pimple, and I noticed that the frequency has decreased since I started using this cleanser.One star off for minor reasons: 1) I personally didn't mind this, but my fiance didn't like that the cleanser is so light and foamy. He prefers something more substantial in texture so that he knows he's really getting clean; and 2) after a while, the pump got sticky and lost its spring. Now, after pushing down, I have to manually lift up the nozzle so that I can pump again."
1,"I've purchased a number of curling irons over the years, at various prices. The Conair Satin Finish 1-Inch Ceramic Curling Iron is a tremendous bargain. The ceramic finish allows me to put some strategic curl in my hair after blowing dry, without having my hair be damaged by sticking to the surface and overheating. The clamp holds securely enough to work on thin sections without slipping.This iron offers great convenience of use, safety features, and even imparts a wonderful shine to your hair. You can pay more for an iron, but it will be hard to match all these features at this great price, and I will definitely buy a second one in a different size."
1,I've been using it for a week. I'm hoping that the cocoa butter will help with some of the hyper pigmentation under my neck. A little goes a long way so I'll be using this for a while. The product smells really good. Thumbs up on this product for sure.
1,"I use them every night for wrinkles in between brows. They really do work, little by little you'll notice wrinkle smooth out, still there but not as deep.TIP: Use the Frownies Rosewater Activator Spray with this. It helps to enhance the effectiveness.TIP 2: Results are gradual so give it more than a week. Everyone's skin is different.TIP 3: You have to use them every night, I stopped for a week and noticed wrinkle gradually coming back...so I never stopped since.Also for the past 4 weeks I've been applying a 'deep wrinkle' cream only in my wrinkle section (between brows)...I wait for cream to dry first then stick frownie. Not sure if it's the frownies alone or the combination of both but my wrinkle has completely smoothed out...almost gone. I'm very pleased with my results."
1,This is much better than the brush color touch ups.  It goes on smoothly and in the exact places  I want it to be.
0,"It's an ok brush. Does NOT cover everything. It's good for medium to light coverage. Switch to E.L.F brush people, it's much better! Trust me."
1,I read the rave reviews about using it for years through many generations and the benefits of using it. I am in my early 50's so I wanted to get rid of forehead wrinkles and facial lines. I think I got better results in Ponds. This rich cream may need to sit on the face at night but I don't do night creams-messy. It seems it blends in nicely with a little moderate rubbing but I just didn't notice much difference in my apperance. It's just ok with me not bad and not great.
0,"I don't know how this stuff is getting good ratings. I wore this product today for a few hours today. I noticed my face started itching, turning red and burning. It was odd. It didn't burn or irritate my skin when I first applied. It was fine for a few hours. It was a slow allergic reaction but it was a bad one. My face turned red. My neck and chest turned red. I had to take an antihistamine to calm the itching. It was awful. I thought this product would be the answer to my never ending search for a sensitive skin moisturizer with an SPF of 30. I was wrong. The product is very white. Chalky. It takes forever to sink in. It does seem to sort of flake off your face after a few hours like another reviewer mentioned. I have used other products that contained zinc and I did not have problems with them. I have dry skin. This product made my skin feel even drier when I was wearing it. I can wear banana boat sport on my face with no problems, but not Eucerin. Go figure. I did not purchase this product on amazon, but I felt the need to give a review because one reviewer suggested that people ignore the low ratings because we must have received a bad batch. I got mine a week ago at walmart so it's definitely not the same batch. It seems like this product is good for most, but it does irritate some people. If you don't have sensitive skin, try it. If you are like me and have hyper sensitive skin, stay far away from this product."
1,"Product arrived damaged. Other than that, a good item to add to my bathwater during my pregnancy to provide some moisture during a long soak. Not really effective as a standalone moisturizer, though. Light fragrance and non-greasy feel. Would purchase again, exclusively for use in bath or shower."
1,"Such a lovely color, and there wasn't a hint of red which is exactly what I wanted. The color is a silky looking chocolate color and looks amazing."
1,This was Rx'd for me many years ago.. for dry skin but has no irritating oils.. feels like a normal washed face wit out the dry tight.  Holds water based moisture all the books tell one to use.  Hard to find.  No other like it.
1,"We all know that when you buy a product, you shouldn't actually expect it to do what the ads claim it will do. At best, you can hope for a mildly effective effort on its part. Not with this sauna. After one use I was astonished at how smooth and glowing my face was, and kept touching my cheeks all day to feel how soft they were! The steam is just right--not too hot, yet effective--although I had to put my face down into the opening in order to really get the benefit. The microderm abrasion tool also works as advertised to scrub your skin without causing any pain, and the moisturizer pad did a great job of working moisturizer into my skin. And, as I said, afterward my skin looked better than it ever has, and my pores looked cleaner than they have in years. In fact, I had a professional facial at a good day spa not a year ago, and I don't remember having had results this good!I recommend this product to everyone, without hesitation!"
1,it's also good pack and ship. But product is not so good. Never buy again. Maybe tried another version of Maybelline's mascaras
1,"I've been eyeing this toner for a while because of all the good reviews and decided to buy it a few months back.This toner is very moisturizing for my face and doesn't irritate it at all! I have oily, acne-prone skin and I haven't broken out from using this yet.I don't, however, find it super refreshing on my face. Probably because it doesn't contain alcohol like the other toners I've used in the past. Other than that, I have absolutely no problems (:The seller shipped this to me fast and I very much appreciate that!I would recommend this to a friend"
1,"Like this face wash a lot, have bought it more than once. It's not too drying, and I like the natural ingredients. I also have the SPF 15 moisturizer and the night cream both of which I would also recommend."
1,"This has a nice gentle scrub. Nice smell, a bit citrusy. The little beads are effective but can probably use daily, I intend to use it a couple of times a week. So far no complaints."
1,"After reading all the hype about this, I decided to give it a try. If anything it is so cheap I wouldn't feel so bad if I didn't like it. It states that it will absorb excess oil, rinse away blackheads and helps minimize appearance of pores. As for the absorbing excess oil, it absolutely does that! After applying this for the first time, I went back onto my computer and waited for it to dry. When going back into the bathroom to take it off, I noticed that the mask took out oil from each one of my pores. You could actually see the little dots of the what it took out. Also, my blackheads which I have mostly on my nose and chin, were diminished by 80%! I was shocked to see that they were almost unnoticeable unless you were extremely close! Those suckers almost never go away for me, but now they are finally almost gone and only after one use!! Also, being blessed with big pores is also annoying. They were trapped with gunk inside and it was hard to get all of it out. After removing the mask the pores are almost invisible! I was shocked...and they were cleaned out! My skin looks more even, and just overall more healthy. Can I also tell you again that this is after ONE use? Incredible. Also, any active breakouts that I had before putting this on, are also almost gone, and I haven't had any new breakouts. This stuff is, excuse my language...the shit! Love this stuff, please go try it out!!"
1,"Unfortunately, this moisturizing cream isn't the best. It works wonderfully on my body, but it causes a horrible rash on my face. I'm still in the market for a product gentle enough to moisturize my face."
1,"I have sensitive skin that seems to be becoming more and more sensitive as time goes on. I've tried lots of different products claiming to be great for sensitive skin, but those claims don't usually hold true (they either make me break out or itchy or have scents, etc. in them that are irritating....or are for more mature skin) but this stuff does! It moisturizes without being greasy or causing irritation. I've been using it for about a year now and I've never had any problems with it. Usually lotions will cause me to break out in a purple patchy rash around my mouth, but this doesn't at all. It does need a few minutes to really absorb into the skin after applying it though (at least before starting to put on make up or whatever). Definitely recommend!"
1,"I just got this and started using it. Like others have said it may have come with a different label, but it still says Desert Essence, so hey maybe they redesigned it. Either way I really like how it goes on and absorbs into the skin. I also appreciate how it does not leave my hands greasy after I apply it on my body. This works out because I can rub the excess into my hands and nails for a nice moisturizer when my cuticles need a little refresher. When I first got it, it was pretty warm because it's hot out and it was in a mail truck all day. I smelled it then and I wasn't too pleased. But after it cooled down to room temperature and I used it, I was pleasantly surprised by the scent. It smells life coffee beans but it is very light. If you smell your skin after it has absorbed mostly it doesn't maintain the scent, which is perfect. I got this to use mainly during the summer. When I am in the pool my skin can dry out a bit from the chlorine. Lotion can get a little heavy afterwards but I find that this oil, as light as it is will make a perfect after swim moisturizer as well as putting it on before I tan. So far I am pleased with my purchase."
1,Great moisturizer for very dry skin areas. Probably wouldn't use on it my face though. Virtually odor free and very cheap too!
1,"I am very sensitive to chemicals, fragrances, and have lots of allergies to even natural products. Even though this does have petroleum products which I usually avoid, I have had no problems with this cream. It has no smell at all, and does not make my skin itch or burn. I love this cream better than anything I have ever used.  I can give this same review for Vanicream fragrance free soap as it is a great product too."
1,I have been using this for a couple weeks now and can already tell a difference in the look and feel of my skin. Highly recommend!
1,"I've been using this brand of mascara for years.  Sometimes branch out and try others, but this is the best."
1,"The 1/2&#34; barrel is perfect for styling short hair.  I also like the quick-heating features.  Small circumference curing irons are hard to find, and the fact that it was available so readily on Amazon was a major plus - no telephoning around or driving from place to place to determine it's availability. Because of Amazon's Prime Membership, it was delivered within 24 hours."
0,Scent is lovely but it last until you blow dry it or when your hair air dries.  Not worth the price I purchased it for the scent.
1,"These Alpha Hydrox products are terrific for mature skin.  If you do some research you'll see that this company is careful about the PH-balancing (they have quite a few products to choose from).If you've been practicing good skin care for a while, you'll be fine tolerating this.  If you've only been using soap & water, toner, basics like that, then this product will be potent and may aggravate your skin (uncomfortable).This, along with their resurfacing disks (STRONG!  14% so be careful) and then their AHA Souffle 12% Glycolic AHA are wonderful.  I don't think my skin would look this good (in my 50's) if I hadn't used these products for several years now.I've used the MD Forte line for several years before I discovered this.  I love MD Forte, but it's expensive.  This is as good (in my experience) and way less $$.I use the Souffle during day, and Night ResQ at night.  I try other products as well but this brand is my staple.  Would give more stars if I could.  (and no, I don't rep for this company).  Excellent value and results."
1,I also have the daytime version. I like the moisturizer plenty is it seems that I am not getting more wrinkles. That is about all I am asking. It does not irritate my skin.
1,It was a duplicate order I use it all of the timeI recommend it highly I have used for many years
1,"I absolutely love this stuff. They used to sell the 12% Alpha Hydrox cream at Walgreen's but they don't carry it anymore. I learned years ago when I first started using it that the best concentration for an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) is between 8% to 12% and the ideal pH is 3 to 4. You can use a pH test strip to check the pH. The Alpha Hydrox cream has a concentration of 10 and a pH of 4. The souffle works well too but the cream is cheaper and works exactly the same. I've tried other alpha hydroxy acids in the past with a higher concentration of AHA but the pH was too high to make it effective. The higher the pH, the greater the buffer and that reduces the strength of the AHA and renders it useless. I've been using this brand for years although I've occasionally tried others. I haven't found anything yet that does a better job for the price. It really does help keep the wrinkles away. I don't often reveal my age but when I do tell people I'm 55 years old, their jaws literally drop. Makes me feel great!"
1,"I saw this on Pinterest and for some reason it looked a bit more darker or brown toned.  It looked like the perfect fall red.  But when I received it, it looked a bit more pinky than I'd like.  I kept it but I think I'm going to mix it a bit.Update***  Just realized why it looked so different.  The person on Pinterest labeled it wrong.  The color I wanted is actually called ""In Stitches"".  Honestly, this color is just fine and I'll keep it.  I might lighten it up a little bit with a cream or taupe color, but it's growing on me.  It's very creamy and very raspberry, true to it's name."
1,I have been using rogain for a little while now because of some hair loss I experience and I feel like I am getting adequate results for the products price. I'm noticing new hair growth and I wish I would have used it sooner. But make sure you use it twice a day or it won't work. I'm going to use this product for a year and take some photos will up date in a few months.
1,"This is the only product from Olay I have ever had difficulty with.  I have sensitive, dry skin and I found this product somewhat agitating.  I think I will retry it once the weather changes to see if my skin can tolerate it more then."
1,I do love the smell of this and it does not have a strong greasy feeling like other products do.  It has improved my dry cuticles.  My only negative (and the reason that I did not give this product five stars) is that it is expensive for the quantity.  The container is on the small side.
1,This is the best foundation I've ever used.  Though I'm in my 50's I have oily skin and still break out sometimes.  I also have sensitive skin.  I know it seems counterintuitive to put dry powder on mature skin but it does not sit on top.  As with all makeup it's important to blend it and especially with this product to be careful not to use too much.  It will look like it's sitting on top your skin but give it a few minutes and somehow it blends and looks very natural.  My only complaint is I wish they made a color lighter than fair and that the SPF was higher than 15.  I live in Southern California and it would be nice to protect my skin more from the bright sun.  By the way Fair has no green/yellow tones in it.  It works best on ruddier skin.
1,"I bought this at wal-mart while i was out after reading many reviews on it and it really has made an improvement, i also think that for me its great because now that i have turned 20 my skin has become rather oily and this really helps balance my skin! I love it so far!"
1,"I found this product from good reviews here.  I use this on my face, I love that it is not watery, it absorbs well (may take 10 minutes), is fragrance free, alcohol free good for eczema .  safe for babies. I use it at night and under makeup.  So glad I found this product.  I will buy again.Dear Pharmceutical,Please please don't sell out ever to Johnson and Johnson  like SC Johnson Wax did with Aveeno years back and how the product was destroyed after!!  They will cheapen any product. You have something good, just market yourself more so the public will &#34;know&#34; it is great.Thank you!"
1,"I have black circles (genetically) and fine lines from age, this makes a big difference for me. It feels greasy when you first put it on, but after a few minutes you can't feel it at all."
1,"I remember these from my teen age years, marriage, raising my children and then they disappeared. The other day I was watching a program(Mirror, Mirror) where they featured top models and their beauty regimen. To my excited surprised I see one model using a Buf Puf. I ran to Google and found them being sold on Amazon and some other retail stores. Amazon was the least expensive and I purchased 6.How wonderful to feel that strong clean feeling when using the puff. It is better than any blemish control scrub on the market and leaves no grainy residue.. I could feel those dead skin cells sloughing off and after only one use my skin felt cleaner than after  any clay.mask I have removed. Needless to say I am thrilled and recommend them to anyone even with sensitive skin like i have.This is a facial in a sponge."
1,"I have used this dye for 8 months now. I basically do my roots about every month or so. I first used this with low expectations. I have naturally auburn hair so it is very difficult to lighten, more so then even black due to the placement of the red pigment directly in the middle of the hair shaft. You literally have to nearly destroy the hair to get a light result. despite this fact I am addicted to wearing bold colors in my hair like hot pink, blue and green. For those colors to look anywhere near the way I like I need a white result. This dye gave me a white result after 2 applications spaced 5 weeks apart. I first colored my hair pink. It was lovely. I get bored though and wanted to try blue. I thought I would end up with purple because I normally still have a slight tinge of the color as it fades to the blonde. I did my roots as normal but noticed on the parts that went beyond my roots that it removed the pink completely and took only a few minutes. I did the whole head again with about 15 minutes left in the max time it is supposed to stay on your hair and I had white hair after with no hints of pink. This had never happened with bleach before. This stuff is magic, I hope they never discontinue it. There is a bit of dryness, I will not lie. It is really nothing compared to the usual bleach one would normally have to use to lighten to this level."
1,"I've been using this once a week for 3 months. It's easy to use and only adds about 5 minutes to my morning on the day I use it. I don't follow the directions 100%. I have very long hair and have found that this works best for me:Heat up a mug of waterlet the tube sit in the hot water while I wash my face in the shower.Ring my hair out (literally)dump the water out of the mug and squeeze in the contents of the VO5 tubePush my hair down into the mugMy hair will absorb all of the hot oil. Then I run my fingers through for about a minute, maybe two. This works the product up the shaft of hair but leaves the focus on the bottom few inches.Then I rinse and wash my hair. I don't use conditioner on the hot oil day.My hair is a bit greasy that day. But very slight. I must wash it the next day. It helps with the little flyaways that I get, but it's temporary. If I used it twice a week it may work better, but it's a little pricey for me to use a box a week.I've noticed no difference in breakage or split ends."
1,"I use this oil in a spray bottle with a little water.  It is great for softening the skin and preventing wrinkles. Spray it on after showering and rub into the skin, you won't believe how soft your skin will feel!  It says it can be used in cooking, but I have only used it in place of lotion to soften the skin."
1,My son uses this on his eczema. He has tried others with this brand and this one works the best and on works best on damp skin.
1,"I live in an area where the water is hard, but aside from that, municipal water has trace amounts of all kinds of miscellaneous substances that just can't be filtered out, and that really don't do your skin any good. Since we don't drink water out of the tap here, why would you want it on your delicate facial skin?Well you have to use it to wash the face, but after cleansing, I spritz this on and let it set awhile before I put on any creams or serums. With my irritable rash prone skin, I find this process reduces redness. In the morning, I don't wash my face at all, but just spray this on (I have 'normal' not oily skin).I also like the fact that its not in a plastic container, therefore none of the plastic residues are leaching into the product."
1,"We have lots of these, 1 for each family member including our dog ^^  These feel good on the scalp and lets you get a deep clean.  Our dog loves these too so bath time for her is enjoyable too =)"
1,"Thought I would test this out with all of the good reviews it got.  Put it on my nails and the polish stayed on for about 3 days, but that's because I wash the dishes without gloves by that time.  I use my hands a lot; when I used my hands the way I do everyday, not a chip in sight.  Unfortunately, not base coat can survive dishpan soaked hands. You will have to use gloves (which I don't like) when washing dishes in order to keep your polish on."
0,"I will admit -- I do feel this product was helping reduce my acne. However, I developed a really nasty yeast infection about two weeks in (sorry to be gross but want to give an honest review) and I also noticed a weird stinging sensation in my lower abdomen. I did some online searching and noticed some people say they develop gastro issues with this product. I didn't add anything else new to my routine and haven't had a yeast infection in years. May be totally un-related but once I stopped the product, my stomach issues stopped. I think this is a good product, but for me, the side effects were not worth it."
1,I use this as an every day cleanser in the summer and off and on during the winter. The foam is a nice alternative to slippery cleansers. It works; I'm happy.
1,Someone told me about Castor Oil for dry skin. I had never heard of using it. Although this is not the old Castor Oil they used to force down kids' throats to cure everything. My Dad is 90 and the ends of his fingers have cracked so badly this yr. he was hurting. This helped like nothing else would. We bought gloves and he wore them at night after oiling up. I used it on my legs and feet. It is oily and not my favorite for the feeling but it works better than anything I have ever found. My legs woke me up itching. Great stuff.
1,Hard to tell if there are any results but goes on nicely.
1,"This cleanser has a wonderful scent.  It also took off my makeup wonderfully.My skin felt refreshed and clean and soft.  The texture was perfect - not sticky or gooey or greasy.It felt so good, I think I'll wash my face again with it - and not wait until tomorrow when there will be more makeup to remove!!!"
1,"I got Deep Throat! Better than Orgasm, in my opinion. Orgasm's a little more coral in tone, whereas Deep Throat gave one a very soft, natural pinkish blush. Made me look very nubile, and very much like a sweet young thing.The blush is also lasting, but will wash off in the shower. Feels more premium than MAC though. Everything I want in a blush! :D"
1,i have oily and acne prone skin.  this stuff is great.  it's the only glycolic acid cream i can use...i hope alpha hydrox never stops making this!
1,"Im just going to put it out there, and say that this is the best hair mask Ive used in a long time.  I have tried very expensive brands and they have nothing on the Triple Moisture Mask. I  have very corase hair that I consider to be type 4b, so I use a lot more that a dime size and I leave it on for at least 45 mins to and hour. I use the mask just like any of my deep condiditoner or hair mask. My hair feels so soft and tangle free after using this product.  This is diffenently one of my staple DC this is a product I can not be without.  I hope they never change the way this product is made. It may have some cones in it but it does my hair good :)"
1,"I fail to get the point why this comb is made in this way...it couldn't detangle my hair and it was rather fragile, I just leave it there and never use it"
1,"I love this color! It looks like I have pieces of metal on my fingers (which I wanted when I bought this). But it chips, even when you use top clear coat. It's kind of thin, so you have to use more which causes chipping."
0,"Great in concept, horrible in execution, try as I might I have not been able to get these to work and stay in place.I bought these to use outside in the sun (not in a tanning booth).  I thought that they would be a good compromise to help save my eyes from some of the UV rays as I was sunning.  Thus far, I have been unable to get these to stay on my face for more than a few seconds.  I don't know if there is any trick to them or not .... but for me, they do not work.  I wanted them to work because I liked the concept.  But they do not.Not recommended."
0,These gloves are terrible.  They are way too thin and come apart at the seams easily.  Terrible product!Spa Sister White Cotton Overnight Moisture Gloves
1,This has been in My beauty regimen since I can remember My Mother used it as well really leaves your skin soft and clean. Highly Recommend.
1,"Not as lightweight as package information indicates, but still feels more lightweight than other similar products. It's too rich for my combination skin, but works well for my tween daughter's dry skin."
1,These nail lacquers/nail polish are of superior quality. The colors are rich and offer a professional looking result at home.
1,I have tried so many products to just be totally disappointed. But this one does work. The lines under my eys are my problem area and this has helped to make them much less noticeable..Manufactures take note-- I am tired of the false claims and when I find something that actually works I will buy it. Most I have tried before do not work and should not be advertised as such.
0,This product is the MATTE version of BareMinerals Foundation and is a totally different color than the original Fairly Light...a bit confusing ..this one has way more yellow and did not match my skin tone.
1,"I have a slight pink undertone and this helps bring that out a bit.  I love this color, its not too much and a little goes a long way!"
1,"I overdid with salicylic acid, and my chin was super dry. I grab small bottle of this oil at Trader Joe`s, used 3 times today, and my skin came back to normal! Blemishes are less visible by far, and my skin is not dry. It`s amazing how fast that works! I was afraid of the smell, but it`s not bad (herbs and menthol). It`s also great with cuts and wounds. I was never interested in essential oils, but I googled the stuff and I`m gonna try the other ones too (like lavender for sleep and relaxation).Do not hesitate!Added later: please dilute this, because I use it in full strength few times a day and I burnt my skin, it was really red and patchy for few days. It all went away, but this is strong oil, and I highly recommend to dilute with water."
1,"I am 23/female, I have been using this product in conjunction with the deep pore shrink/start up face wash/and jojoba and mint face scrub.I have bad skin. Always have probably always will so I look for the best products to keep pimples and pores at bay as much as possible. I just found KMF this year and I love everything I have tried so far. This has become my main source of face and body washes and creams.I use this gel after my morning wash and before applying my makeup. It gives almost a protective layer on my skin before I put on my concealer and foundation which I like. I will sometimes use this at night after the jojoba and mint scrub to seal off my pores.I was loving this gel, for the first two weeks I was using it. It helped even out my skin tone which was a plus and it seemed to be helping prevent break outs. Week three I got a handful of pretty large cyst like pimples along my jaw line and neck. That being said I am also within my first year of using Mirena which is a hormonal birth control. So I don't know what to blame!!! I don't change my products often...once I find something that works I stick with it so the break out was caused either by this or my horomones and obviously I don't know which--hahaha.It's week four and my skin has calmed down a bit but I am still getting some pretty ugly bumps now a few on my cheekbones. I will try and update my review in a few more weeks and I hope I can keep using this if anything just to put on before my makeup because once it dries everything goes on so smoothly and it's hard to find acne gels that allow you to wear a smooth finish of makeup on top of it."
1,"This is a wonderful shampoo to prep your hair for other TFH products to follow.  The shampoo is light and rinses away easily, and though it itself won't really add any noticeable volume to your hair, it is the perfect canvas to start with.  It doesn't have an overpowering fragrance, nor is it totally odorless, it's just clean.  Even if you don't necessarily care about adding volume to your hairstyles, this is an excellent shampoo and a great value."
1,"This is an ok mask.  I love the smell.  I recommend Aztec mud though, which you can buy for $6 at Whole Foods."
1,"This is the most effective lip moisturizer I've found for dry, sensitive lips. I've had the same patch of dry, irritated skin on one lip for the two years. Other products would make it feel better, but it never went away. Blistex has a Cold & Allergy lipbalm that worked well but was very waxy. This product moisturizes and soothes, has no smell or taste whatsoever, and barely feels like there's anything there. These are the best results I've had."
0,"I used this all over my face before bed and woke up to redness and inflammation all around my eyes.  I called Eucerin and they said this product is not ""opthamologist tested"".  Well, I don't see why it is for sensitive skin and also DERMATOLOGIST RECOMMENDED if you shouldn't use it anywhere near the fine lines around your eyes--the reason many of us buy wrinkle creams."
1,"I have severe acne problems and am on a few different prescriptions for them. My doctor suggested that I use Cetaphil face wash daily but after looking in to it I saw a few nasty ingredients that I avoid in my skin products. (Parabens!) One of my girl friends is a licensed esthitician with an emphasis on natural products and she highly recommended this product to me. I've been using it for 5 years and absolutely love it! It is incredibly gentle and cleans your face without making it feel dry, tight, or &#34;stripped&#34; of it's natural oils but at the same time your skin will feel refreshed and &#34;clean&#34; because it's so moisturizing. Because of my Epidou prescription I'm prone to getting flaky scaly skin and this cleanser is the only one that will wash off my make up, grease, and dirt without exasperating the flakes or causing additional dryness.One thing to note:It's a &#34;creamy cleanser&#34; not a soap! This product does NOT lather. It feels almost like a watery lotion but rinses completely clean from your face. It will not bubble or give you suds but it cleans all the same."
1,"I have only been using this for a couple of days, so cannot speak to how it clears your complexion or not. However, I like it a great deal - it goes on smoothly, no burning or itching, and seems to protect your skin from the elements. It also smells very neutral, but nice."
0,"I have owned some hot tools products in the past, and it seems as though the quality has diminished over the years.Pros-This does get very hot-The controls are great-The barrel is smooth and I have not had an issue with it getting caught in my hair or my hair not sliding through it easily.- My hair does hold curl fairly well and this creates larger, waves that stay...for me, at least (if you want something for tighter curls, go with a 1 inch barrel)Cons- The purple ring above the cord is so cheap and broke shortly after I got it. This resulted in the whole wand coming apart and shocking me. I currently have it duct taped together and it's survived this way for close to a year now...although very annoying. I just didn't want to replace it so soon after buying it and am trying to make it last till it dies completely.- the stand is so cheap and doesn't work at all. I have a small bathroom with zero counter space. I set the curling iron on the stand on top of my toilet seat and the stand slid back, resulting in the toilet seat top getting burned (it's plastic). Not long after that, the stand popped off completely.While this gets hot and does create curls, I'm not expecting it to last terribly long judging from how cheaply the outside of the curling iron was made!"
0,"It makes the skin feel hydrated but i can't get it to sud enough, even after much rubbing of the bar onto my rough bath sponge, to  wash even just 1/4 of my body before the suds completely dissapearing. I know that glycerine bars don't sud like soap bars but this is rediculous!"
1,this stuff will last me forever its so loose that you don't need much for you face. i use the cap take the brush dip in powder that tap all the excess off in the cap and use whats in there for the rest of my face.
1,"Mrs. Meyer's geranium-scented products immediately put me in a good mood.  I love washing my hands with the geranium hand soap, cleaning around the kitchen or mopping the floor with the geranium-scented all-purpose cleanser, and doing dishes (or other cleaning) with the geranium-scented dish soap.  Other than a seasonal peppermint they had a few years back, I haven't found any other scents that I like quite as much.  The geranium scent is a little strong and not particularly manly, so I doubt it would have across-the-board appeal.  But I find it extremely clean, fresh, and unusual, a pleasant mix of floral and clean.  Although it costs a little more than I used to spend on hand soap, it really does make me smile every time I use it.  And that's worth a lot."
1,"Love, love, love this product.  everyone in the house uses it, the 12, 16 and 42 year olds. Its perfect for everyone!"
1,"Works as a nice shiny gloss alone, or under the aquarella polishes as a smooth base. I like it a lot!"
1,Carousel coral is a fun summer color.  It's more of pink coral rather than orangy coral.  Very flattering.  The consistency is thin but 2 coats give a solid opaque appearance.  Staying power is about the same as my other Essie polishes.
1,"I have purchased this product twice.It firms without flaking or getting scaly and works smoothly under makeup or foundation.Not a waste of money like so many even more expensive products, unscented, and hasn't caused any breakouts or irritation of my skin as many other products do.5 vehement stars.Woman / Vain / 30s barely."
1,"I'm 37 years old, and started getting pedicures for the first time in my life after surgery this year. I've had three pedicures so far in my life. I've honestly always worked so hard in my life whether it was earning multiple degrees in college or working long hours at all my workplaces. I've honestly never really splurged on myself, and after my surgery this year after enduring 18 years of chronic pain from a routine surgery gone bad (I'm pretty sure this won't be my last surgery. I'm still in pain, and not out of the woods yet.), I decided that life is short, and that I would reward myself and get my mind off of my chronic pain by getting manicures and pedicure treatments. When I was younger, I would paint my nails myself, and I still paint my nails by myself every two weeks. So, I have a long history with OPI nail polish. Anyways, I went to an amazing Aveda salon/spa to get my hair and nails done, and there was an ultra-nice/wonderful manicurist/pedicurist named Rose. She asked me to choose a shade for my nails and my feet. I chose La Paz-itively Hot and Senorita Rose-Alita for my nails and feet, respectively. Both of the shades were wonderful. And I told Rose that I chose Senorita Rose-Alita because rose is my birth flower, I'm a June baby. And that the nail polish merged both of our names together - Her, Rose and me, Lalita. Rose smiled and got a kick that I chose that shade and said that she would always remember me and that shade because it merged our names together. I will always love this Senorita Rose-Alita shade because Rose and I got along so well and chatted for the longest time. When I think of it, I end up getting along very well with any nail technician I meet, and end up chatting with them for a long time. Anyways, Rose did an amazing job on my nails and feet. Painting my nails and feet and buying jewelry are mostly the only female slurges I do for myself. I'm not really into wearing makeup, buying lots of clothes, shoes, bags, etc. My feminine splurges are nail polish, jewelry, and bath/spa products for bathing/cleansing/moisturizing. Out of the all the nail products, I think that OPI lasts the longest. Can you believe that this Senorita Rose-Alita shade has lasted for a month on my feet? That's how good Rose was with her pedicure treatment. I also bought the I'm not Really a Waitress and You Rock-apulco shades for my mother - she loves red shades. And I have the Clubbing Til Sunrise and Fiji Weejee Fawn shades as well. I have many more OPI shades but they're not listed on this seller's page. Anyways, this shade is cool. And you can't lose by purchasing an OPI nail polish. I've tried many color shades with OPI - yellow, orange, black, blue, green, gold, purple, etc. There's not a color that I won't try. OPI nail polishes really last long and they make great gifts. My mother, co-workers, and friends are pleased with the OPI nail polishes I bought them. Take my word, I've used OPI nail products for many years, and give this brand a try."
1,i bought it long time ago and i still have it . its very moisturizing and it dry fast i use for my body and feet
1,"Great base for makeup, fragrance-free and silky on the face. Why pay hundreds of $$$ when nothing can erase wrinkles?I'm hooked."
1,way way to oily  but does remove makeup even stubborn eyeliner pretty much feels like baby oil on a wipe
1,"I love this brand!!  It's so hard to find a hand/body lotion that moisturizes deep and doesn't leave you sticky or tacky.  I like the unscented better but that's a personal choice.  This scent is a bit strong for the first few minutes, but it calms down after you're dressed and ready to go.  LOVE THIS and the only other lotion that compares is Earth's Best.  That one doesn't come in bulk size though, so this one is more cost effective."
1,I really like the consistency. My skin has improved so much during the last two weeks. Good bargain price. Thank you.
1,"I love this blue! It is so pretty! Looks much better on. The picture really doesn't do any justice. It looks good with pretty much anything I have in my closet. It goes on thick, so you don't need more than one coat, but be sure to wipe one side of the brush on the opening , so it doesn't clump up"
1,"I love this oil so much, I use it for after showers, as a suntan lotion, as a night time moisturizer, I actually threw out all of my other lotions and this is the only one I use now. Love it!!"
0,"I very badly want to leave this product a good review, but in the interest of honesty, here goes...I bought this shampoo solely on the basis of excellent reviews. Many of the reviewers mentioned this product's ability to deal with their itchy and often oily scalp. This was my concern too. A huge benefit I noticed right away was that it made my hair (not my scalp) feel really really clean- it would even squeak when I would squeeze out the water, post-shower. So, I was excited about how well it worked and how quickly.But I noticed within a day of using it that I now had a problem I never had before: flakes! So many of them, and so disgustingly visible! Further, after a day of washing, my scalp got extremely oily- more so than it did before. Still, I've been using it and giving it a chance, at least until I am done with this entire (small) bottle.I am about half way through the bottle, washing my hair every other day, and have experienced the same results consistently. However, I will use it until the bottle is empty, and if results change, I will update this review. I am hoping the negative results are just an initial reaction to new treatment. If anyone else has had this reaction and wants to share any tips, I'm all ears!"
1,"I get this through the Amazon subscribe and save.like soem otehr items we get, this is not for me but my wife.having had to search for it with no success in a grocery store, and her not being able to find it at a drug store,Amazon came to the rescue.although I don't use it, she says this is one of the better goops out there.just to let you all know, the price she had to pay (when available) at a drug store was a lot more than we pay on Amazon."
1,I had noticable difference in just a week! I've been using it for a year now and it's an awesome product that absorbs well and leaves the skin soft and younger looking.
1,"This product is amzing.Apply my daily make up routine, nI lightly mist my face and the end result is amazing.It gives your skin a natural, dewey and youthful look.Almost flawless. I definitely recommend this for anyone who needs a spritz of freshness.As well as make up geeks. And you can't beat the price."
0,"Hope in a Jar is the product of marketing hype. This product smells like something out of a biologist's lab. It's also faintly yellow, and it reminded me of a chemistry experiment.When I put a huge blob on my cheek (before spreading it out), it left my eyes burning. Its smell and effects on my eyes make it difficult for me to believe in its goodness. At this price, people with sensitive skins are better off experimenting with brands such as Burt's Bees and Shiseido White Lucent (both tried and tested, in summer and winter. they worked)Skintype: Fair Asian, Normal - Dry skin in the US, combination in tropical Singapore"
1,"This stuff is super thick & moisturizes all day & night long.I'm mid 30's and don't have bad skin, yet wanted to keep moisture day & night in the summer heat.  This little jar does the trick well.  I use it under makeup during the day & alone at night.  It goes on smoothly, softens my skin & does not cause any breakouts.  So far, this is the right moisturizer for me."
1,"If you can handle the scent of this oil which is not bad once it settles, it is great to massage the scalp with. I like this for a pre-oil treatment before I wash my hair."
0,The packaging and delivery time were excellent. But it was not effective for my rashes. Other Aveeno product like skin relief ones has been a great product for their own purpose though and I have been using them for a few years.
1,"I really love NARS blushes and I always am searching for the perfect color. I currently own: Luster, Albatross, Torrid, Orgasm and Taj Mahal blushes. I gave torrid a try because I am an light olive skin complexion (NC20-NC30) and I thought it would look great on me. With the Orgasm blush I have to layer it on with a pretty heavy hand and I wanted something I could use less of, but same color wise.I will def say I was a bit disappointed with the color, but maybe that was just my expectations. I was hoping that it would be a lot more pigmented that the NARS Orgasm, but in the identical color range. Sadly, It isn't.The orgasm blush is a peachy pink with golden sheen. Almost like a blush and highlight in one. The Torrid blush is burnt reddened pink with golden micro glitter. Not overly glitter, but very different that the golden sheen that Orgasm gives you. These differences might be good for you if you were looking for blushes that were in a league of there own, but I am not. I find that this blush typically lasts about 6 good hours on me. Just for reference I have combo skin, meaning I have a oily T-zone and regular skin type on my cheeks. Not dry and not oily.If you are looking for a blush that would compliment both lighter skintones and darker skintones, get Torrid. Don't be afraid of the color or how pigmented it is. Get a stippling brush or a synthetic brush and grab a bit of color and blend. You can always go back and get more color, but if you add too much at one time, you will get the clown cheek effect. I have to add that this blushes lasts a very long time. I have had it for about 2 years now and still have yet to hit pan.Update:I would like to also add that since buying this, it has gone up by a dollar.UPDATE #2: I still own this product and I have to say I love it because its different than my other blushes. I originally was hoping it was similar to another blush I own, but I'm now glad it's not."

1,"That's is a  lovlely .help you clearing your face ,make it better ......used once a while .see how many people buy it .you will love it"
1,"This is my favorite color. I just ordered 2 more bottles so I have spares. I wanted something dark, but not Black. This is really pretty and is really pretty in the sunlight. I have had many compliments on this color.."
1,So disappointed with this perfume oil. You are paying for a bottle of oil with very little scent in it. This oil is so diluted and weak. It smells amazing in the bottle but once applied the scent is gone in a couple minutes. Auric needs to really increase the scent to oil ratio. Until then I would not purchase again sadly.
1,"This shampoo/ conditioner smells fantastic, and it washes out really easily, even in our sheltie's thick double coat. Our local dog park is covered in gravel, so our girl usually ends up getting bathed at least once a week. So far we haven't experienced any issues with dryness or itching, and we've been using it for about two and a half months.Even if the shampoo itself wasn't so great, the smell alone would be a selling point for me. It smells SO good. For at least three days after we give her a bath - even with rain - my boyfriend and I smell her constantly like one of those febreeze commercials. In fact, I've seriously considered using it on myself!"
1,"I got this 2 days ago in my mailbox and although I don't always write reviews unless I feel compelled to do so. But this product, more than compelled me to write a review! In one word this is - MAGIC! I am serious! No kidding! I have very fine, somewhat between straight and wavy hair (upto my back). Not very volumnous, but long and very fine strands. So I applied it after washing my hair, when they were about damp, and as soon as they dried, my hair was softer and smoother, with ZERO FLY AWAYs! I couldn't stop rolling my fingers in my hair and as if that were not enough, it's smell is sooo nice and pleasant that there's no reason you should not consider buying this!For this price, I think it's a veryyy good deal! If you're looking for a conditioner that would actually leave your hair feeling super nourished, moisturized, and suppppper soft, without being greasy at all, then be informed - THIS IS IT! I swear! Others just claim to meet those ends, but this product actually does what it says! I was kinda skeptical before purchasing this, but after ordering and trying it out myself, I recommend this - 200%! You wont regret your purchase :) :) Btw, my sister loved it sooo much herself, that I had to order one for her as well! :)"
1,"This is a wonderful eye make up remover. I use a small dap, sub and them wipe off with a cotton round. It takes off heavy eyeliner and mascara. Its slightly greasy so i always was my face afterwards with soap to take the oily residue off."
1,"I absolutely love this conditioner.  I've been using it for about 4 or 5 years now.  I have afro-textured 4a/4b, relaxed hair and this conditioner makes my hair feel like silk.  When I have lots of new growth, it melts the tangles away making detangling sooooo incredibly easy for me.  This product is a staple of mine."
1,"The price is better than stores, the product works well and lasts a reasonably long time (a month or so) without doing a lot of damage.  Adds some volume without ruining my hair.  Simple to use.  I haven't tried the other semi-permanent colorings but I'm very happy with this one. I don't have a lot of gray, not sure if it works well for that."
0,I used to buy this product at drugstores and was glad to find it again. BUT the teeth are falling out of mine - many on the bathroom floor with each use. It will soon be without teeth altogether and useless. Next time I'll pay more and hpoefully get a better product!!
1,"despite its maximum strength - the solution does not stink your face (since the company remove alcohol from its ingredients)and it is still very efffective.  we have used this product for over 25 years and that just about sums it up on how we feel about this product.  You need to try a smaller sample to make sure it is right for you and dont just take my word for it.Also, Amazon offers such a great value for money!  Packaging was just right as well."
1,"This is good, but no comparison to exfoliating towels from Asia. I just didn't find this abrasive enough, and it got soft pretty quickly. It's a lot cheaper though, so can't complain about that aspect. Good for washing your back!"
1,I fell in love with this color and i HAD to find it!When i finally got it i was so happy!HOWEVER the color is so much more lighter than you see.Even with 2 coats it looks like raspberries. but still cute!
1,"About the time my son turned four Johnson's baby shampoo - a household staple - began to fail us.  It wasn't getting his and his older sister's hair clean and so I set about to find a replacement.  Suave's Strawberry shampoo was it.This shampoo gets their hair clean and leaves it smelling nice.  In addition it works fine as a body wash, which means that I can clean the entirety of their sweaty, mud splattered little bodies with one product.  After using it for over a year, I can say that I've found no downside.  It doesn't dry out their skin or hair, and it's affordable.Four Stars.  Very Good Shampoo.  Smells nice and cleans well.  We use it as a body wash and it doesn't dry out or irritate my children's sensitive skin.Pam T~"
1,"I go back and forth between the Mandarin Magic and the B-5 Gel, because the Mandarin Magic does not provide as much hold as the B-5. I usually use the Mandarin Magic. I have fine wavy hair, and I have a lot of it, so I get a lot of tangles if I don't use something to control it. The Mandarin Magic is very good for everyday use. I let my hair airdry and when it's half dry, I put a dime-sized dollop on it. That's about enough for my shoulder length hair-it controls tangles and lifts the roots a little and I get incredible shine. I haven't really noticed the scent-it's very faint and fades away entirely by the time my hair is dry. Mandarin Magic gets its holding power from Gum Arabic and Gum Tragacanth, both of which are natural alternatives to synthetic polymers (such as PVP) found in most commercial hair products. It also contains Vitamin B-5 (Panthenol) which is a natural hair thickener. Finally, it contains the herbs Ginkgo Leaf, Ginseng Root, Chinese Magnolia Blossoms, Chinese Angelica, Chrysanthemum, Earth Smoke, Morus Root, and Mandarin Orange Peel. These herbs soothe and tone the scalp."
0,this is a cheap liner that even with endless amounts of primer and setting powder still bleeds. will not reorder very disapointed.
1,I have been using Cetaphil products for the last 15 years. These tubes are great to carry around and fit easily in my purse. The cream can be used on face or body. It is unscented and is very easy on my sensitive skin.
1,"I love that this cleanser smells nice and it works very well, just like Paula Begoun writes in her review of this product. It removes the most stubborn mascara I have ever owned (it's hard to wash off). I don't even have to use eye makeup remover afterwards! My skin sort of normal but it can get dry. So after I wash my face with this cleanser, my face feels a bit dry and I have to put some moisturizer on.....with Biore that I wrote review for before I didn't have to do that but Biore doesn't wash off my silly mascara very well :) choices choices. I think if you have skin on the oily side, this may work very well for you.Other than being a bit drying, it also takes a lot if this stuff to work. With some cleansers it takes 1 pump.....it takes 3-4 of this. Doesn't foam easily. I don't think I'd get this one again yet I'd give it 4 stars still."
1,Great product!
1,"I always used the sponges you can get at any store and never felt like they really did anything.  This sponge is great, my legs feel smooth after each use. Would recommend."
1,"I've had mixed success with the Philosophy bubble baths, but once you find a winner, it's worth holding on to. After trying Vanilla Birthday Cake & a host of others, my first winner was CINNAMON BUNS. Cinnamon Buns is luscious and luxurious, and perfect for winter.I wanted something new for summer. I tried Melon Daiquiri, Coconut Frosting and Mimosa, I finally found SENORITA MARGARITA. It's a winner for a summer bath. I especially like this in an epsom salt bath after a long day gardening. The bubbles are long-lasting and the fragrance is fresh yet relaxing.I have another winner. My new favorite is SENORITA MARGARITA. Smells like the real thing too. :)"
1,Mom loves i so I buy it for her as a primer.  I hate it because of the ingredients.  Parabens are known to cause wrinkles and even linked to cancer.  I don't get why people (including my mom) are not bothered by the ingredient.
1,My hot flashes are abating and I am sleeping better. I was glad to have given it a try. Some of the other progesterone creams gave me a headache. This one does not.
1,Elephantastic pink was the first color that got my attention from the India collection by OPI and I am so glad I bought it. It is a perfect bright pink. But with my skin being more tan it is hard to find one that isn't too much. Its a subtle brightness and the application is so smooth. This is the pink I have been wanting all summer and I am ecstatic that I now own it. You MUST get this color if you don't already have it!!!
1,This is a little thin and not for dry skin.  It's o.k. for a daily moisturizer but I would like one that is more emollient.
1,"This is a good nail lacquer, but I'm not so happy with the color.  It looks pretty terrible on my toes, but for someone who likes colors with a brownish cast, this will please them.  It's just a personal preference about the color, so I'm giving it a four star rating anyway--OPI does make a great nail lacquer."
1,"Excellent for french manicures. It's Essie brand, which is a good brand. For a minute all I bought was Essie brand."
1,"This color is kinda of a gray with purple undertones. As usual with OPI it goes on smoothly. This was just a little streaky. You need three coats for complete opacity. This was one of the fall colors recommended by Missjenfabulous. If you do not follow her she has great nail tutorials, recommendations and fabulous makeup tutorials. I would recommend following her if you don't already. Her website is polishandpearls.com. She also has a youtube channel and twitter. If you want a great fall color I would highly recommend this one."
1,This hair dryer is light weigh and stores all accessories inside the case. It works well except the hose is hard to attach to the bonnet
1,"I'm Black American with 3b/3c hair texture and It works awesome for my wash n go's. I usually put a leave in conditioner on my hair first, followed by a curling cream or jelly and then put this over it. My wash n go's last for about 3-4 days with this method and and when I say no frizz (I'm like queen frizz) I mean NO FRIZZ for like the first 2 days. by day three a little frizz starts to show (which is not bad b/c its time to wash your hair again anyway) but not in a bad way it just adds to the textured look. You can stretch the wash n go to 5 days if you put it up in a curly puff. you can smooth the ponytail down with the Aloe Vera Gelly and a nylon brush and your good!!! Hair will remain baby soft the entire time. I do want to say I do saturate my hair in all the products I mentioned thus it does take longer to dry (no heat, air dry) but its worth it and works like a charm."
1,"I bought this item as an impulse buy in the 'sample' bins while waiting in line at Sephora. I WOULD have bought it from Amazon except I didn't know it existed.I was attracted to the packaging, seeing it was Asian and knowing how superb some skin products can be from certain Asian countries, after a quick read of the ingredients and seeing nothing ominous, I added it to my cart.The label says you can use it anywhere even on the face (I wouldn't recommend that -- for me the menthol or camphor aspect is irritating), but it is THE MOST moisturizing product I have ever used on my hands! I couldn't believe how nice and soft and smooth they looked an hour or so after applying this stuff (which has a kind of vaseline like consistency - but NO petroleum by products in it!).So reasonable too for how effective it is!"
1,"Amazing! My hair is much lighter than it used to be, and in a very natural way! I only use it in the sun, because I didn't got the same efect by using it only with the blowdryer. But my hair looks like a natural blonde now!"
1,"I got this scent along with another scent and I am very glad I did. Love the scent of roses and anyone who is familiar with witch hazel knows that it doesn't smell so great, lol glad I decided to give this try. I use it as a toner and it removes any makeup left over from my face wash while keeping it hydrated. Now I'm interested in trying the aloe and lemon one....... Hmmmm will do so once I run out of these 2 bottles."
0,Really dry and can't get anything out of the tin box with finger. Don't know if I received an old batch or what...
1,"I love Aveeno Anti-Itch Concentrated Lotion!I'm super allergic person. So I need somethingthat's non-allergic. This one seems to work.I love it,Takako Masuda"
1,If you are thinking to use this as contour then don't bother.. The color may seem dark in the picture but when applying it you will have to put several layers ( more than 4) to get to that same shade. I would say it would work better as a blush but you will still have to apply it several times to get any color on your cheeks.
1,"Now I order it here, it's more cost effective.  I love this Creme!  I'm 59 years old and between this, my Argan Oil and Coco Butter my skin still shines.  People say I don't look anywhere near my age and this as part of my skin routine has helped.I don't know how to get long-winded about a skin creme, all that needs to be said is it works fabulously for me, I have normal to dry skin, I'm not really sensitive to things, and I do try to use as natural a product as I can find, and eat fresh, organic foods.  Skin also needs to be hydrated, so I drink a gallon of water a day if not more for my OVER ALL health.  Water helps many things, but it really does keep our faces and bodies looking and feeling younger. IMHO ;-)"
0,"I need something that really covers the grey. This product doesn't cover well enough for me, not crazy about the color for medium to darker browns."
1,"I almost bought a different scent, but when i noticed this one included 2 items at the same price that the other was listed just for one bottle i chose this one instead. I hadn't smelled the fragrance prior to purchasing online, but was happy with it. I started using one of those foaming soap pumps to save money. I just used a couple squirts of this soap mixed with some water and i'm happy it will last much longer that a normal bottle of hand soap. I've always been happy with this brand, so i didn't hesitate to buy online and would definitely buy again."
1,"I like this much better than cetaphil because you can use it on wet or dry skin so if you are getting in the shower you can wet your face, cleanse and rinse off.  I am also washing my hand with it that has eczema and it has gotten it under control along with an RX from my derm."
0,"This product provides a much too lightweight degree of stickiness, even on thin fabric. I'm sorry I wasted my money."
1,"When I used this for the first time, I did not experience any kind of awakening and there was no soft euphoric hum in the background. What can I say, this dryer is just okay. I experienced a couple of tangles when in use and the bristles are way to soft to style with. If I had to do over, I would purchase something else."
0,"Just as all the other reviewers have said, Fresh Farmacy's main ingredient is calamine lotion, which gives the bar its trademark color, texture, and mild scent.  It has pretty bits of dried lavender and flowers on top that aren't really functional but still look nice.I've had moderate acne since I was 12, and I love LUSH products, so I tried FF in hopes of finding a more ""natural"" blemish remedy.  Unfortunately, it wasn't the cure-all that most people make it out to be -- it simply didn't work for my greasy, sensitive, highly blemish-prone skin.  Every time I used FF, it left this weird pinkish-gray residue on my face that I had to exfoliate off with a washcloth.  I was also shocked to feel my skin just as greasy as before I washed it.  FF's scent is so nice and calming that I was really disappointed when it didn't get rid of my acne.  It made a negligible improvement in the acne on my forehead (i.e., eliminated 1-2 blemishes out of 20) but ended up drying out my cheeks and chin, which then exacerbated the acne in those spots.  I may as well have been washing my face with regular bar soap for all the improvement I saw! :(If your skin typically only responds to benzoyl peroxide (mine does), FF may not work for you.  I see that another reviewer didn't respond well to Proactiv, the active ingredient of which is benzoyl peroxide; FF worked great for her.  Just something to consider.  I'd say if you have super-sensitive skin, blotchiness, rosacea, or *mild* acne, FF would be great for you to try.  Otherwise, you might want to find a different cleanser -- those with more moderate/stubborn acne might try LUSH's Coalface."
1,"I have some what of an acne problem. They are not actually acnes but little bumps that sometimes turn into acne or otherwise sink back down. But during the last couple of months they would not go away so I would tend to scratch it off which is a really bad habit. I read a review of this product on another site and I thought why not. It's pretty strong so it sometimes burns your eyes and dries your skin but it does the job. It got rid of my bumps in no joke 4 days. There are still abit left but I'm going to leave my skin for a couple of days since my skins reallly dry now. I really recommend it, I'm really surprised it works."
1,For those of you that use Wen you will find this rose water as a good alternative when your favorite replenishing mist is sold out. Mix a few of your favorite essential oils and your hair will smell lovely.
1,I don't know what to feel about this product. It's okay I guess but I feel that it doesn't really work as good. So I'm neutral about this product.
1,"We bought two of these hairdryers for our kids because our regular hairdryer is a bit too bulky and heavy for them. Since they are still pretty young, this hairdryer is perfect for smaller hands, and has plenty of power to dry even long hair quickly. It's also very lightweight, which makes it great for travel. Lightweight, plenty of power, easy to hold. All in all, a good value for the money."
1,"Just what I expected from Maybelline! Nice color and length of lashes, and it's waterproof. Works just as well as some more expensive brands."
1,"It does what its suppose to do, except it is somewhat small for my head.  Heats for at least 20 min, and is comfortable, the price was right and I really can not think of anything that is wrong with it."
1,"Great product. Cleanses as promised, no harsh ingredients and the scrubber side is effective. I continue with subscribe & save and recommend highly."
1,"Have used this(and many other Philosophy products)for a long time, in all weather conditions with my skin type ranging from Normal in the summer to Dry in the winter and never found a better ""2 in 1"" skin cleanser.  Do yourself a favor, try the 8oz size, it only takes a bit and lasts quite a while.  You will be more conscious of the amount you use so it becomes more budget friendly. Although Philosophy products are not outrageously priced like many other Dept Store products that don't do near the job.  Also order from Sephora via Amazon as they usually have $50 or more is free shipping.  Other Philosophy facial products I cannot exist without: Philosophy Hope in a Jar for normal skin and in the winter time Philosophy Hope In A Jar Therapeutic Moisturizer For Dry Sensitive Skin.  philosophy | when hope is not enough | replenishing cream | facial moisturizing cream is a great nightime hydrating cream without feeling like you dipped your face in vat of Crisco."
1,"I bought this product 3 months back. I don't write reviews until i use it for sometime. So far i LOVE this product. I have a bald spot in the front. The spot is filling up with usage of this oil. It has made my hair THICK very THICK from fine and damaged. It needs to be used as directed. Unless its used like that you can see no results. I am indian my hair is black. My hair has never felt so soft, shiny and black before. Will definitely repurchase. In fact I am thinking of stocking up !"
1,"I am a male in my mid 20s that has been suffering from acne since my early teens. I started using the Acne.org regimen many years ago, and found that to be sufficient for the most part. Or, at the very least, I thought that my acne was just a fact of life and that The Regimen was the best I could do.About a year ago I bought this stuff and for some reason I never used it but once - maybe because it stung a little. But a month ago I had literally the worst acne flare-up I've had in years: something new every day, deep beneath the skin's surface, and it just wouldn't quit no matter what I did. I went searching online for more ideas, and to my surprise, found this on Acne.org's website with pretty unanimous acclaim (which is impressive since acne ""cures"" seem to be very hit-and-miss). Needless to say, I found my bottle and applied it to the affected areas over night. To my surprise, the very next morning things were looking up: the swollen areas of cystic acne looked somewhat ""deflated"", and places I could feel were about to erupt were no longer feeling that way. Over the next couple of days, the situation went from bad to nearly cured.Since then - about a month - I've had literally had my longest stretch of acne-free living that I can remember in years. I apply it to spots in the morning and leave it on all day, and apply it to my whole face at night. Of course, I always wear sunscreen now and have added a tiny bit of Jojoba oil to that to get totally moisturized and protected skin.I haven't even noticed but one or two little pimples try to pop up, and they literally seem to just fizzle and die after applying this stuff. Although all acne cures are likely to have different effects on different people, this has been such a miraculous change for me that I just have to recommend it. It's only $10, it lasts a good while, and it may have an incredible effect on your acne situation and your face's glow in general. In addition to being acne free, my scars also seem to be fading and my general skin tone is improved.10/10? I think so."
1,Love the scent of this dish soap! Good quality product.
1,"After reading all reviews here i was expecting something much better. First, the smell is so intense that it makes the eyes itchy after a few minutes. Second it does not get cold enough. The only pro is that is very soft. I bet you can get something better and cheaper than this one. just my opinion."
1,"Good Amber scent, smells REAL not fake, not as thick as the ones in small bottles, but you get a bigger bottle of this, and the price is good. I like this amber and will try other scents from this company because I am pleased with the way the Amber smells, and I am an Amber addict. I recommend this Amber!"
1,"I'm going to try a lighter shade. My hair has been colored L'oreal Excellence Medium Golden Brown for the past 14 years, ever since I decided at 40 that the white streak in my hair was no longer something I liked. Medium Golden Brown is a few shades lighter than my own hair color and has coppery highlights. Trying to choose something close to that I went with Golden Chestnut Brown ...honestly, I can't even imagine what dark chestnut brown looks like. My hair is intensely brown, deep dark one note chocolate brown. With Excellence, the gray always took the color a little lighter than the rest of my hair - making it appear I had highlights, that did not happen here. If you want to have all the gray completely covered, this will do it. But my hair looks flat...I'm not giving up on this brand, I want to stop using harsh chemicals on my hair, if I can. I'm just saying beware this is REALLY dark, really really dark. It is not ""golden"" in any form or fashion.UPDATE one month later:  though I'm not terribly happy with the color (I did order it again, though)I have to say that this is extremely kind to your hair. My hair is coarse and dry and this stuff is sooo gentle, this past month with this hair color and Clear shampoo and conditioner has been fantastic. Buy this stuff, it's excellent, just know that this color is very dark. I'll try a lighter shade next time."
1,"PROS:Face feels clean, but not tight.Doesn't overdry.Works great with the Clarisonic.A little goes a long way.Gentle on the skin.CONS:Doesn't completely remove waterproof mascara.Doesn't control my shine.Made me break out.Very pricey.BOTTOM LINE: I LOVE this product, but it's not for me. It is really expensive, made me break out and doesn't completely remove eye-makeup. HOWEVER, it is worth a try because you wouldn't believe how lovely it feels on your skin. My suggestion is to do what I did: buy the travel size, use it for a couple of weeks and see how it works for your skin type."
0,"I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I really don't see the results. I used it continuously for two months along with the love handler and the fatgirlsleep, and did notice a difference, but I've had far better results with seaweed soap and exfoliants. Give it a shot, but don't count on a miracle.Edit:Sorry, I did say both. What I meant was that I noticed that my skin was more moisturized (which plumps up the skin making cellulite softer), but I saw no real benefit that could not be achieved from any good body lotion or oil."
1,I bought this after reading the reviews and I am now in love! I have combination skin and I usually only breakout during that time of the month. I was always using salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide pimple creams at night (sex killer! lol) and my face used to have red areas even blemish spots (face picker).After using this every night my face is red-free and blemish spots are not as noticeable. It smells nice like natural roses and leaves my face soft and clean. I've only been using it like a month but noticed the different the first week. Just try it and see!
1,I have teenagers who are breaking out like crazy. This stuff seems to be the only thing that works fast and consistently on all there acne issues and they actually are willing to use it on a regular basis which is half the battle.I've seen high end skin are brands which offers the exact same thing fir double the price. I've  tried both brands and got same results so I'm sticking with this one and keep the savings safely in my pocket
1,The best blow dryer ever. 23 Afro American female I use with a long hard comb attachment and this makes blow drying so much easier because I have long thick hair and I hate doing it myself but this definitely helps out when I'm tryna save money but skipping the salon
1,"I have had my Beauty blush for years and have yet to use it up.  While I don't wear it every day, I do use it very often and it only takes a little bit to give a nice flush.  I have light skin (but not fair) and I think that Beauty is a color that anyone can wear.  It's pink but not blue based so it suits warm skin tones as well as neutral ones like mine.  I'm not sure that Bare Minerals even makes Beauty anymore.  I was recently in Sephora and I don't think I saw it as one of the options.  Good to know that I can get it on Amazon and for about the same price as in the store."
1,"I love all queen helen products since i was younger and since they are no longer in drug stores i was so happy to see they are available on amazon, This product is great for once a week usage and it really does make your skin glow and feel tighter. I was very happy that they shipped on time as well.  I would deff repurchase."
1,"I really like this product. I was looking for a replacement for a similar version of this product that is 3x as expensive and has a quarter quantity wise of what this one does. Although the Peter Thomas Roth brand does not work as well as the other brand I was using, it's still a fairly decent product. The only downside is the smell. I have no idea why the company tried to mask the chemical smell with what they call a peach bellini scent. I have to hold my breath when using as the smell is so overpowering. It only enhances the alcohol and gives it the most off putting fake peach smell.Even with the smell, I still like the product but think after I'm done will go back to the more expensive one."
1,"im 13 and i love neutrogena products. i bought this from target and it was $10. i have been using it only for a little while but i noticed it made my skin super soft!! and spf in a moisturizer is awesome, and the fact that it is no comedogenic (srry idk how to spell that??) i would totally recommed this, i have sort of oily skin and i think i just need to buy some blotting wipes or something like that, elf ahve some 150 for $3!! but i think that theres nothing that will stop the oil from coming out through the moisturizer or your makeup. if that makes sense. hope this helped :) good luck"
1,There's a trick to using Buf-Pufs. You don't scrub your skin with them - you use them very quickly and lightly across your skin to create friction. Once they've been used for awhile (on both sides) you need to replace them. I'd say every month.
1,"I've been on a search for the right shade of dark burgundy type red. I've looked online for all the swatches, etc and came to the conclusion this is it! I own OPI Magala Wine (Creme color w/ 2 coats) vs. Essie Bold & Beautiful (Gelly like w/3-4 coats). Both very similar in color. Essie BB, the more coat it becomes darker, so you do have the option of shade you want. I suggest 3 coats to get an even coat unless you're very good at applying it evenly with 2 coats. I gave this a 4 star because of the application. Formula was easy, but a bit on the thin side, and I've found that Essie's brushes are small. This is my 2nd Essie bottle and I don't like their brushes vs OPI, China Glaze, etc other brands. I guess because my size of my nails are the average size so applying it takes more strokes vs someone with a smaller nail bed. I hope that's the right term to describe your nail size?So if I had to choose which color. Both are equally nice, but it would be Essie BB because it's a true dark red I'm looking for and I'll have to tolerate with the formula. OPI Magala wine was nice, but not as deep red as I want this to be. Perhaps I have to try OPI again and I'll update this reveiw.UPDATE: July 2013I wore both OPI Magala Wine and Essie Bold Beautiful again. Essie's stayed on much longer than OPI. This time I decided to pool or flood the brush before applying and this works. It only took 1-2 layers. Perfect! I'm pretty rough with my hands and I do play sports. It didn't chip at all. If you apply your base and top coat correctly. It will stay on longer!!My friends complimented me on the shade of color, ""sophisticated""!"
1,"Beware when buying any light nail polish color, no matter the brand! I usually really like OPI because it's simply the best quality, but this color, not so much. I think it's hard to make a decent light pink color because it requires so little pigment that the formula becomes watery. When you try to apply it, and pools at the corners of your nails. Once you get around that, though, the color is nice, a nice light pink that's not over the top and could almost be whitish -- the picture really doesn't do it justice. Bottom line is I gave it 3 stars because the quality is not good, but if you're desperate for this color, like I am, it IS your best option."
1,this is a great product and leaves your skin so soft and  moisturized.  i put it in a spray bottle and spray my face a few times a day just for moisture and it really works and does not disturb your makeup.  i was using wen mist $$$$ but this is just as good.
0,"Hard bristles do not catch hair, so why do companies not understand this? Also, this is just a heated brush. It is NOT an air brush."
1,"For years I have used oil on my wet skin after a shower/bath because of its moisturizing power. But when I was skin tested for allergies for new skin issues, it was discovered that I have an allergy to fragrance. That's when I switched to this product. It does what I need it to."
1,"Well, you've no doubt heard from some other reviewers that cetaphil's moisturizing lotion formula is greasy so I won't beat that into the ground. It does bother me that a product with the 'lightweight' and 'non-greasy' monikers does not live up to expectations. However, if you put a very very small amount of water into the bottle (several drops), just enough to curtail the thick viscosity, you should be fine.Aside from that the product does the job. If you are looking for a non-comodegenic, hypo-allergenic product then this is for you. If you are also looking for an oil-free product, then this is not for you."
0,"Didn't experience any difference in lip texture, plumping, moisture, nothing.  Tingly?  Yes.  Anything beyond that?  No.  Could not use under lipstick in the morning or it would smear off.  Applied it, left it on as long as possible but eventually had to remove what was left before applying lipstick.  Applied at night before bedtime. No noticeable difference for me.  Disappointed."
1,I don't know if it relieves my stress but I do look forward to using it every night after work so that is a plus! this is smooth and creamy and lasts a decent amount of time when used with a loofah!
1,"LOOOOOOOVE this adhesive. I usually carry it in my bag while out, but really never need to reapply for security purposes. The best part is that it dries clear!"
1,I bought this hoping I wouldn't have to blow out my hair and then flat iron or curl it. It does work but my hair is not as FULL as it would be if I blow it out first however it does come out really shinny! Both attachments give a different look so try them both. I gave it 4 starts only because it's really LOUD and I wish it had my power but I still like it.
0,"This is the first time my skin has ever had a reaction to skincare. The only thing I love about my skin is that it never seem to react to anything I subject it to & I have no allergies when it comes to skincare. Now I can only say, most skincare. I love the ROC Wrinkle filler & bought it before trying this cream. The most sickening thing about this cream is that it gave me a break out which is rare. I now have 4 pimples which are rather red & yet, I don't see any results. I felt a slight sting when I put the cream on, near the cheek & mouth area.I usually sort of wipe off remainder cream on my neck after applying it to my face & now, parts of my neck is rather red & itchy. UGLY!! Again I shall say, this is the first time this has happened so this cream is a very special cream indeed! On a lighter note, I bought the eye cream of the same range & it was fine. I don't see really visible results but it was easy to smooth on & comfortable to the eyelids. I'll review that one when I have more time. I shall still to the ROC Wrinkle Filler from now on."
0,this color is way too light and to get the white-ish color you have to have 3 coats. The seller is the BESTS (not the first time I order from them) but THIS particularly nail polish is not great... I'll just stay with Opi &lt;3
1,"PROS- I LOVE the way this makes my skin look! It has light reflectors that highlight parts of my face and gives my skin this gorgeous sheen.- SPF- Skin looks more even after continuous use.*CONS- *Unfortunately, it clogs my pores and causes me to break out if I leave it on all day; on the other hand, if I wash it off immediately when I get home after a few hours, my skin looks better.- Not water resistant. It will &#34;melt&#34; when it comes in contact with water.I've recently started trying to use more natural, eco-friendly products. Aveeno Positively Radiant Tinted Moisturizer isn't 100% natural and I believe it has an EWG rating of 3 with limited information from Aveeno. Although it seems to clog my pores and melts when it comes in contact with water, I REALLY like the way it looks. I use it when I know that I won't be out all day, that I won't be around water and I want to look fresh."
0,Terrible product. It made my hair green. I couldn't believe it. And it dried my hair really out a lot. All my natural locks were gone and I looked awful. didn't even want to leave the house any more. It took almost 14 days to get rid of that green color and to get some shine and elasticity back into my hair. Never again.
1,This is the most unusual moisturizer I have ever tried.  The texture is very light and it absorbs in almost instantly.  My new favorite.
1,"I get the cheapest decent shampoo for my husband and this fits the bill and smells amazing, which is more important for me than it is for him."
1,"I was looking for a gentler toner, and this is it. It works well and I really like the smell. I have had a couple of people comment on how good I smell after using it. And it not an overpowering smell, just a light rose scent."
1,"I like this Castor Oil as a detangler for my hair. It leaves my hair softer, helps keep styles in place and offers shine."
1,"I bought this for my teenage girl for one reason only....hoping it would be less noisy than her old one.  The bathroom is separated from our bedroom by just a wall, and when she dries her hair EVERY morning it was like the alarm going off!  Anything had to be better.  All the other gimmicks advertised...about frizz, volume, etc.  I just didn't worry about it.  Every hair product advertises they add volume, they make hair shiny, they get rid of frizz, they make you look like Jennifer Aniston.  Rarely do they do any of that, or at least none seems superior to the others in many ways.This dryer is quiet!  Unless I am already awake and listening for it, I cannot hear it running.  Less noisy than her electric toothbrush, just a quiet hum.  And, joy of joys, she loves it.  She says it does actually cut down on the amount of frizz, and with the diffuser, she gets the volume look she wants.So, in every way, I heartily recommend this Conair Dryer!"
1,This stuff is very soothing and I enjoy using it.  I don't like to always take medication so it is nice to put this on and be able to just lay and relax.  I have bought almost all the other badger balms.
1,"I accidentally dyed my hair too light and needed to take it down a few notches. I grabbed this in Clove (medium cool brown). Because my hair was very dry and porous from my recent overdye disaster, I put in a protein filler (which you can buy on here or at Sally's) and then dyed my hair with this. When I washed it out my hair was evenly toned, soft, and shiny and exactly the color I was hoping for. Based on all the other reviews I just threw away the booster packet, I assume it's terrible."
1,"Twice the thickness of the light night cream --- somehow makes skin feel moisturized for a long time but absorbs enough so it is not so sticky.  Excellent.  Very neutral scent, with no unscented-chemical smell to annoy or interfere with colognes.  As with all Neutrogena products, not a problem for my acne-prone skin."
1,"I've been using this for several months now.  My nails do seem to be a bit stronger, but don't grow any faster, or really look any better.  I won't purchase again - I'll just eat more Jello."
1,"This soap is great. And, as my headline states...the scent is very addicting...and, because i wash my hands many x's a day, it's a nice treat throughout the day."
1,This soap has a smooth creamy texture that I love. I like to save it for special occasions to treat myself.
1,"Aveeno is always a great product - their lotions are more moisturizing and healing. If you have ezcema or worse, try their ezcema cream, it's pretty effective."
1,This was a very good wrinkle cream.  I am not out of it yet but when I run out I will probably buy some more.
1,my nails and cuticles have shown noticeable improvement with daily use of this oil for the last two months.  It has a pleasant smell and is neither overly runny or sticky as some other oils tend to be.
1,"This is the best eyelash adhesive I've ever used!!!! It is my favorite. I have black lashes, so this matches my color well."
1,"I have been using hot curlers in my hair since I was a teenager!! I was always wary of these because I thought the steam would make my hair frizz. I have been so pleased with them. They are easy to use, heat up quickly and they stay in without a lot of crazy pinning. My hair looks shiny when I take them down and it lasts! I hope this is the last set of hot curlers I ever have to buy! They are great!"
1,"It seems almost too simple that sticking a peice of stiff paper between your eyebrows would work but it really does.  A very simple, inexpensive item that does produce results.  I wish I had known about these sooner."
0,"Kind of drying, not moisturizing. Kind of disappointed. Will have to keep searching  for a good reasonable face moisturizer. It should not cost an arm and a leg."
1,"To say that this is a ""bad"" mascara would be very untrue. However, because we all have differences in personal style, this mascara is incapable of making every single person who tries it out 100% happy. To me, it is just okay, but to someone who is my complete opposite on the style scale, this may be your favorite mascara. When it comes to my eye makeup, I usually prefer earthy, neutral eyeshadow paired with a very dramatic lash. I like lashes that are long, dark, and voluminous--borderlining on falsies, but not quite there. Maybelline Full 'N Soft just doesn't do that for me. In my opinion, this mascara is for women (or men--hey, I don't discriminate) who would like to look casual during business hours or for teens who are new to makeup and going for a natural look. As far as Maybelline's promise of fuller, softer, healthier, clump-free lashes; I would say that they get a 3/4 rating. While traditional mascaras make your lashes brittle and prone to flaking by the end of the day, Full 'N Soft made my lashes feel as if I weren't wearing any makeup at all--which may be part of the problem, depending on how you look at the situation. When I removed Full N'Soft, my lashes felt healthier than they normally would bare. Also, the mascara delivers on its promise of being clump-free. In a(n)(unsuccessful) attempt to create my more dramatic look, I applied no less than five good coats of this product. While I was silently hoping for at least a little clumpiness to bring the illusion of fullness, this mascara stubbornly refused to tack up on my lashes. Once again, you decide whether that is a positive or negative quality. But when it comes to ""full"", Maybelline Full 'N Soft just did not deliver to me. My lashes were only minimally more voluminous than when I first put on the mascara (I have moderately thin lashes), and it took 3+ coats to make me look and feel as if I were wearing any makeup at all. So for those of you who want only the most natural enhancement of your lashes to get you through the work day or through your first day of high school, I recommend this mascara. But for those of you (like me) who want lashes that would make even the most draggy of drag queens green with envy, I suggest you better listen to your mama and shop around."
1,"Love this iron, it heats up super fast and maintains the correct heat, won't cook your hair.  It has tons of different heat settings.  Its a must have."
1,"My dermatologist recommended this soap to me, for my acne.  I have had acne vulgaris and cystic acne for more than 20 years.  I have tried every acne product out there, including ProActiv, and nothing works as good as this soap (especially in conjunction with my acne prescriptions!) I use the PanOxl soap every day, as my dermatologist recommended.  My daughter also uses this soap (and nothing else) to treat her teenage acne.  It clears her up within a day or two - every time!The bar comes in a plastic tray with a lid, so you can keep it dry in the shower. One bar lasts me several months, with daily use. Some people will experience dry skin, and even redness and itching with this product.  This will go away after some use, or you can skip a day here and there."
1,"Suave is value for the money.  It's not watered down like some other inexpensive brands.  Thick and rich, smooth and silky.  I just love how my hand just glides over my skin in the shower, like I had just buttered myself all up!  It's the same sensation as showering in very soft water -- only I live in an area with nothing but hard water.  I feel clean and moisturized when I'm done.  I've always been a fan of Suave products and this one just reaffirms my loyalty."
0,"I have used this shampoo and it's matching conditioner for over a month. My hair feels like a mossy bird's nest when I use the shampoo. I have to use quite a bit to cover my long wavy/curly hair and it is extremely drying. No lather either, it's like a very unspreadable gel. I have since found a better, more affordable organic brand that lathers naturally ( soap nuts ) and I am so thrilled to have found it. Back to AO, I also noticed a lot of build up. It just wasn't cleaning well no matter how much I used and how much I scrubbed. Forget the conditioner, it did nothing. Waste of money for me. As for GLUTEN FREE? Not sure for those with the allergy. Either it was the smell which I didn't really like or the wheat germ, but I sneezed constantly in the shower with it."
1,"I am very pleased with this product. My skin is very sensitive so i'm afraid to try new things and i'm glad i did! I noticed a difference right away my complexion ,was brighter and my cheeks where rosy! I hope they never stop making it cause i'm hooked!"
1,"This was absolutely a good (minimal) investment for my nails. My nails are stronger, less brittle and I also noticed how quickly they are growing. The other great thing about this item is that it stays on my nails for at least 5 dys without peeling or stripping so I do not have to worry about constant re-application. Great value for the money."
1,"Brought this for my hearing aid molds, but also learned it is good for nail care and those nasty little ridges you get in your nails....who knew!!!  Will def buy more."
1,"I'm a witch hazel advocate! I use it for everything, and I love the rose smell!"
1,"I do like this. A good price and it does help with some of the frizz. I have thin, straight, long hair and it gives a nice shape but curls do not really last."
1,"I bought this item because it was the most reasonable retinol on amazon.com with high reviews.  You guys were not kidding.  It really works!!  I have sensitive skin, so I started by alternating it with my regular night routine and worked me way up to full strength.  I saw results in about 8 weeks.  AMAZING.  As God is my witness, I will never pay $75 for night cream again."
1,"Dry brushing your skin is not new; if you haven't tried it, then you should.  Particularly if you have dry skin, this brush is perfect before a shower, just rub lightly all over.  Put lots of conditioner on afterward.This particular brush is quite good and the price is perfect.  It's a bit rough but just don't rub too hard!"
0,"I've tried this twice, and remain unimpressed.  I bought a full size of it two years ago, but pitched it because the texture was so pathetic, and the powder comes off on everything and everyone (including anyone you hug or dance with).Tried it again last week, after getting a sample from Sephora through the Beauty Insider program. Sometimes first impressions of products are wrong.  Well, I'm still unimpressed by everything about this product.  The coverage is not great, the shades are not great, and the texture feels grainy and like it isn't going to stay in place all day. Not for me."
1,"I love this cleanser, but actually ordered the one with fragrance (hence the four stars).  Will order fragrance free next time."
1,"Great blush for work every day look, goes on beautifully, not cakey or powdery, just a beautiful finished perfected look."
1,"I love this eye makeup remover. I have tried and used more than 15 different products over the years, and I've always liked Clinique's eye makeup remover, but it's a little pricy for someone who wears eye makeup everyday like me. This neutrogena product removes my eye makeup very well (I wear waterproof mascara and eyeliners everyday), and it is not greasy or irritating at all. It's super affordable so give it a try, you won't regret it."
1,"This is my go-to day to day moisturizer.  I liberally apply this after showering to keep my skin smooth & moisturized through the day.  Being able to buy two 16-ounce jars from Amazon has been great!  This product was originally suggested by my dermatologist to help with my very dry skin, and after I've been delighted with it!"
1,I started using this product almost 3 years ago while I was transitioning to natural. I still use this product weekly and I will always use it as long as they keep making it. I have fine 3c/4a hair and my hair needs the extra protein boost to keep it strong. It is lightweight and doesn't have a strong smell. I just started using the Aphogee two minute reconstructor as a light protein treatment after heat styling my hair and I like that product too. I also use the aphogee moisturizing shampoo to clarify my hair every 6 weeks. This product line has worked well for me.
1,I love this little thing!  For the price it work great!  Makes you feel like you are in a spa.
1,"Still no idea why my cuticles are so dry and constantly chopping. And I didn't even know what to search for to fix it. THANK GOODNESS for this magical cream. Saves my cuticles when they get too bad, twice or three times a day and i'm in the clear."
1,My favorite oil ever. For some reason they don't sell it in stores anymore? I don't know why. THis is the only oil I'll use on my skin!
1,"I still can not believe that these things actually work. I tried them as a bit of a lark, thought what could it hurt? Have to say I was pleased with the initial results and have continue to be impressed.Frownies are a kind of stiff craft-like paper with a natural gum adhesive on one side. They come in squares with perforated sections to tear off and use on the desired areas of the face. To apply the Frownies you simply massage the area of application for about 15 seconds, wet the backside of the Frownie patch with either toner mist or plain old water, gently lift the skin adjacent to the application area, to smooth the area, and apply the Frownie patch. Ideally the patch should be left on overnight, but if this is not possible you can still get good results with 2-3 hours of use.The idea behind these things is that you retrain the facial muscles by temporarily freezing the area. (Much like Botox.) I also think that when you remove the patch, the area is slightly irritated and you get some temporary swelling, thus you see less wrinkling for a short period of time.I have been using these things for about a month now and can absolutely say that they have helped. Especially in the () area beside the mouth and nose. Hints I can offer are: Don't use the huge perforated sections of the square if you don't have to. Cut sections to fit your face and use. When applying to the () area, leave a bit of room to the side of the nose - they become extremely irritating when they harden up if the patch is brushing against the curved side of the nose. Remove these things in the shower if you can - or at the very least thoroughly wet them.One other issue of note - some say that surgical tape is just as effective for use in this manner and is a good deal less expensive. Nexcare flexible clear tape has been reported to yield pretty much the same results. I have not tried the tape being happy with this product, but those looking for an even more affordable solution, might want to check it out."
1,I purchased the witches' hazel based on the great reviews on amazon.The product does not disappoint! I love the rose fragrance and how well it cleans my face before I layer on some lotion.It's a steal since it's cheap and takes forever go through a whole bottle.I would definitely buy some more.
1,"I have to say, I love the multiples I came across NARS COSMETIC recently, and i fell in love with the multiples I have Orgasm, laguna (great bronzer), G-spot (my favorite so far), and I ordered the Limited edition tints I found two of them here on amazon, if you want something fresh buy them they don't have the glittery look like the regular multiples and there are just a few left. love this product LOVE NARS:..."
0,I would not use this simply because it pulls out your lashes and is impossible to remove. I used eye makeup remover  as recommended. I still have it on my lashes after scrubbing it of with a cotton balls. My eyes  are all red now. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!
1,"Ever since I turned 25 my skin has been acting up. I had great skin all through high school so I thought, well maybe it was just &#34;my time&#34; to have break outs. I would get zits all along my cheeks and chin, I was so unhappy. I had tried new face washes but nothing was really helping, I finally asked my sister what she had been using since her skin has been looking so nice and she said, &#34;Aveeno!&#34;.I popped on Amazon and did some looking around. When I found this 3 pack I thought, WOW! What a great price! A 3 pack of soap for under $8 is an insane deal for Aveeno products! Bar soap can be kind of gross, but since I'm the only one using it I make sure it keeps clean and dry between uses. To cut down on the grossness factor I wash my hands with antibacterial soap before touching the bar/washing my face and I make sure the bar is able to dry out after use. I wash my face more than I probably should, and this bar is still sticking around! I've been using the same bar for almost 2 months, and I'm sure it will last another month at least. I love the scent of this soap, very fresh and clean. My skin isn't flaky or dry after washing, and finally, it is clear and beautiful again. I will continue to use this for as long as I can find it! I am so thankful I found something that worked for me, I hope it works for you, too!"
0,"I'm more of a loud color person, so for some this color would be a great product, but for me it was a boring color."
0,"I have many friends who use this product but I cannot stand it.  For me, I get no coverage and look chalky and pastey. The color is a match but seems to be mostly corn starch or something of the sort.  It even makes me wonder if this is not authentic.  My friends use it and it looks great on them, but what I received is no good."
1,I use witch hazel toner whenever I run out of my regular Loreal Hydra fresh toner. It smells really good and skin feel fresh after usage. Purchased two bottles just in case I run out of my regular toner.
0,"The R57 is such a lush red color. It looks a bit darker than what's on the box (more like the color at her roots), but that may be because my hair has been previously bleached. I still like it, its even better looking than the box! Before using the Loreal Feria, I had tried the Garnier Olia, which ruined my hair. Olia is crap in a box-it will fry your hair like nobody's business, and the color lasts exactly three shampoos. Anyway, I purchased the Feria to try and cover over the damaged and faded Olia. The Feria did a great job, coloring my multi-shaded and faded hair a deep, uniform auburn color with highlights here and there. I also add jojoba to my conditioner, which is excellent for dry, damaged hair. It has lasted longer than any red box dye, and even longer than some salon colors. In the directions, it says to shampoo hair twice when rinsing out the red dye-I didn't do that. I just rinsed it. This color will continue to bleed down the drain and onto your towels, as any red dye does, but it just has a staying power that most reds don't have. Always use cool water, as cold as you can tolerate, on your red hair.I am trying to find a more natural red henna dye, and tried one from Mendahi on a sample of my hair, but have had no luck with that. I used only one box, and my hair is fine, dry, and to the bottom of my shoulder blades. I also don't use shampoo. Once or twice a week, I dissolve a tablespoon of baking soda in a cup of tepid water (make very sure it's dissolved, or you will end up with white granules remaining in your dried hair!). I wet my hair in the shower, pour this into my roots, massage, rinse, and condition with 100% pure coconut conditioner mixed with jojoba oil. The first time you sub the baking soda for shampoo, you might not love the results. Just try it once or twice more; I did, and my roots are silky soft and very clean. It's also been kinder to my red color, which has the largest dye molecule, making it the most difficult color to maintain.UPDATE! Please use henna instead of chemical haircolor, it's such a better option!My hair is overprocessed, I have been bleaching it for years and had dyed it red with a box dye a few months ago (loreal r57 cherry crush).  My hair was breaking, falling out like crazy and I am trying to eliminate chemicals from all of my beauty products, and typical box hair dye is overloaded with nasty toxins.I was afraid to try henna, because people will tell you that your hair will turn orange-its not true! Henna has saved my hair and I have never received so many complements! I ordered the burgandy 100 gram from HENNA GUYS, they have a website and sell here on amazon, and it provided me with two applications (my hair is past my shoulder blades).  I mixed half of the package with water and a plastic spoon (no metal!), put it in an empty jumbo hair dye applicator bottle from Sallys, and applied it. It was so easy! It's not even messy, just make sure you have a damp washcloth handy to wipe up spills on your face or sink immediately.  I saturated my hair, wrapped my head up in saran wrap, and went to sleep. I left it in for 11 hours, then washed it out and conditioned it.  When it was dry, it had a bit of a brown orange tone, so I prepared the remaining mix, added a raw egg, and reapplied it on my hair.  I left it on for five hours, heated it with a blow dryer for about five minutes, then washed it out.  Remember that henna takes two days to fully develop, so be patient.  It looked good when I washed and dried it, but WOW, it looked even better two days later! It has a gorgeous deep burgandy tone, its shiny and soft, and I have not had a bad hair day since! My scalp does not itch like it does after using chemical dyes, and it looks so rich and healthy! I am so in love with henna, I just can even describe the difference that it has made!  I will forever be faithful to this henna brand! Customer service is so helpful, and will respond quickly to any questions about the product.  Henna is addictive! I am trying the blend of burgandy and deep red next! Love it! Remember that if you aren't getting the deepness of color you want, or it looks orange, henna it again and again until you achieve the color you want! Also, if your hair has been bleached in the past, as mine has, it does take more reapplications to keep the color.  It's just something you have to live with until the bleached portion of your hair grows out and you can cut it off.  Henna is excellent for controlling oily scalp, which was not a problem of mine, but would be very beneficial for some people.  I didn't have any problem with the smell that some people comment about, and even though I left it on for over 11 hours, I did not get a headache.*I have added a picture of my hair with the Feria.  You can find it on the main product page, scroll way down toward the bottom and you will see it on the right. I did not have my flash on, so it appears a bit darker than it actually was."
1,"If you haven't tried a solid shampoo before, you definitely should! Great for camping, travelling, bringing to the gym, or just using as an everyday shampoo. To cut down on bringing a whole bag full of bath products to the gym, I use this as a shampoo AND soap, and it works wonderfully for both purposes.This shampoo leaves my hair FAR less tangled than most shampoos I use, so if you don't often have to use conditioner, you probably won't need it if you use this shampoo!The smell, of course, is grand - if you've smelled other karma-scented products from Lush, you'll know this. It's a unisex kind of scent, so I have to fight over it with my husband when we travel. MUCH better than those little bottles of foul-smelling shampoo and bath gel you get at most hotels. The earthy, citrusy smell of lemongrass, orange, lavendar, and pine is a wonderful way to wake up in the morning.If you go to a Lush store, you can usually get a free tin to store your shampoo bars in if you buy 2 bars."
1,I've used this Neutrogena chap-stick every since I was young (so maybe 20 years now...) I love it. It's very moisturizing without being greasy or having a gross taste/flavor. It works really well at keeping my lips soft!
1,"This is not for the lavender which is featured in the title. I found a really great buy 1 get 1 free at my grocery story of this. It does NOT smell like any tea tree oil I've ever smelled, but it is really nice. I love the pump style. The smell is nice and doesn't linger much after you get out of the shower, it keeps your skin soft and feels really clean. Both my husband and I use it."
1,"First off I have always loved Mrs. Meyers, but this new scent the honeysuckle is delicious. I bought these months ago and we still have a few left. I would definitely buy this again!"
1,"Searching for ways to stop break outs i decided to give this product a try. It has a strong smell of peppermint and it makes your skin feel tighter after use. It helped stop my break outs and clear them up. Although it is only 1 oz a finger tip amount will cover your entire face. The product lasted me about 2 months. I decided to use tea tree oil instead just because this product is so high priced but you do get what you pay for, all organic ingredients. Organic is never cheap."
1,"This kept the Tinea Versicolcor at bay more so than eradicating it. I do think that combined with prescribed products this aided tremendously in my finally getting rid of the skin discoloration. The only setback is the smell. It may have been that my PH just didn't mesh well with it, but it had a strong medicinal smell that forced me to use it only before bed, instead of during the day as I would have liked.Despite the smell I am likely going to be purchasing this again if I notice the discoloration is rearing its ugly head again."
1,"I just got this yesterday but already my cuticles are less dry and my nails and fingers look 100X better, not all dry.  In the winter my cuticles get so dry and I get painful hangnails. I wash my hands alot so I thought this would help, so far so good. It smells great too. Question mine has a slight sandy, gritty feel did I get a bad batch or is this the lemon peel in it? Anyway so far so good and I'm excited maybe I wont have so many painful hangnails this winter!! This would make an excellent stocking stuffer or gift, it's a nice surprize to buy something that acutally does what it says it does!"
1,"I've purchased several bottles of the peppermint lotion for myself and as gifts. The tingly sensation is so wonderful!  I don't mind it in the winter, either...it doesn't make me cold, per se, but it's really refreshing. It is nice to put it on the lay down for a minute, you can really feel it. I've tried the rosemary and find it to be a bit stickier (though the fragrance is lovely). The geranium smells great, but I think I'll stick to what works. Buy the peppermint, you won't regret it."
1,"This is my favorite thing on the planet! I have been using this body oil for years and years (15+ years). I use after shower before drying off, then my regular body lotion, makes my skin super soft and leaves a nice scent behind (if you like the smell that is, also comes unscented). I recommend to everyone and I know a lot of women who use it that also love this body oil. It is a little uncomfortable to get out of towels (also leave scent behind on them) but soaking in detergent for a few hours does the trick. Just leaves a silky soft finish on your skin, not on your clothes, great for dry winter skin."
1,"I have been using this bronzing powder for years and just now got around to reviewing it. It has a wonderful, subtle sheen, so it doesn't look flat and pasty, but also not too shiny. It's a beautiful brown-toned bronze, not orange (and my skin picks up orange very easily). I can't imagine using a different bronzer. This is the lighter version of the Nars bronzers, which is perfect for my fair/light skin. For darker skin, you would want the Casino color."
1,"This has been my go to moisturizer for years. It's light but super hydrating. It also smells really nice, and covers up the usual sunscreen smell you usually get with an SPF moisturizer."
1,"I have very dry skin in the winter, I have tried all kinds of oil when I get out of the shower.  So far this is the best one I have tried.  It smells great, goes on smoothly and blends in easily.  I live that is also has Vitamin E.  I would highly recommend this oil.  I also use the Palmers cocoa butter lotion which is also very good."
1,"This works okay as far as a curling brush, but due to the number of rows of bristles in relation to the diameter of the barrel, there's a lot of hot metal exposed resulting in burned fingers. In order to use this without injury, I ended up buying the &#34;HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove&#34; (also from Amazon). If not for that product, I would have had to return THIS product."
1,"I've been using this as a moisturizer and have been putting it on my eyelashes and eyebrows. It might be my imagination, but I swear my eyelashes grow a bit thicker and longer when I've been using it consistently. It probably also helps that I've been wearing less mascara as well.My husband also thought he had dandruff for the longest time- turns out his scalp was just really dry! I've been using this to give him scalp massages. He loves the extra head rubs and is definitely becoming less and less flakey. 5 stars!"
1,"I have found my brand of natural lotion. However this is not the particular choice as this peppermint leaves me pretty cold for a little while. If that is not a problem for you, then go for it.I will buy another fragrance? but I'm sticking with Avalon from now on. Moisture is what I was looking for and this company has it."
1,"I will readily admit that the ingredients are not great. That's why I gave 4 out 5 stars. But... It works. I've got dry skin specially because I live in a dry climate. After washing my face, it would be greasy looking in less than an hour. I realized my skin was too dry and it was overcompensating. The area around my eyes has drastically improved and my skin isn't as greasy looking.Since using this product for a few months, it does clog my skin. I now only use it around my eyes, cleaning gently with a washcloth.  I have seen a big difference in keeping the area around my eyes moisterized."
1,"Curlers heat quickly and work speedily to give full, springy curls.For those who prefer only waves simply leave them on for a shorter period of time.  You'll find hair hanging in soft waves with an added fullness.Also works well simply for volume - curl and then brush, brush, brush for thick, lustrous hair."
1,"What can I add after all the good reviews about nars blush orgasm? Nothing really, all has been previously said."
1,"Starting with the bad: This mask can stain your wash cloths when you remove it. It's an intense mint that may be pretty uncomfortable to some people. If you have super sensitive skin you may not want to smear it over your entire face until you've gotten used to the sensation. No, it's not a miracle in a tube.The good: It's cheap. It's effective. Works quickly. There's no ""purging"" break out phase. (which I don't believe there should ever be with any product, anyway)Best case scenario: If you use it as a spot treatment over night, your break out will be gone the next day. Does this happen every single time? No. Most of the time? No. Typically, you will just see a very noticeable reduction in the size of a break out. It certainly speeds up the healing process. It does not make a pimple bigger or bring it to a head as some masks do... which can lead to scaring! Instead, this mask dries it out and shrinks the size till it's gone.Like with most masks, this is most effective when you steam your face first. At the very least, use a warm towel on your face for a few minutes before applying the mask.I decided to venture out seeing as this has been my staple mask since high school. It's a drug store masque, and I thought it might be in the best interest of my now older skin to upgrade. I wanted to see if maybe I'm missing out on something better. I tried Origins and Ahava, and quickly went back to my trusty Mint Julep. Both broke me out, and the Ahava also irritated my skin leaving me with red blotches. Queen Helene definitely doesn't fit into the ""you get what you pay for"" realm. Yes, it's even better than Proactiv's *current* sulfur mask (the original was actually good)."
1,I love this derma e cream! It was recommended on a message board with a very large population. It has done a wonderful job of hiding fine lines and making my skin feel silky.
1,"Reading other reviews I feel like my bottle must have the wrong sticker on it. I love the color, it is a very pretty litte pink, delicate with a hint of coolness. One coat can be used with a french manicure (you better be good, this stuff is streaky!), but it looks very light and unnatural on my olive skin. I much prefer to do 2-3 coats and let it mattify. It has no glitter and is extremely glossy, streakless with the second coat. Love it paired with Essie's Love & Acceptance for an ultra-girly pastel feel."
1,"I wear my hair in its natural state no chemicals at all, so I have to keep my hair moist at all times.  I love how this leave in keeps my hair feeling so moist and soft without being greasy. I have other leave ins some that are very expensive but they are made with Natural ingredients, but this works just as good as they do.  I gave this product 4 stars because I dont care for the scent, all of the conditioners in the ""Neutrogena Triple Moisture"" line have the same scent and Im not a fan of it.  Other than the scent this is a great leave in conditioner to me."
1,"I seems to work.  I use it on my wet face per reviewers instructions.  I think the larger side works better for me, but you should try both sides.  I bought this for my blackheads and I do notice residue in the cup after I am finished.  When I use the pore cleanser my face looks better and I can tell the difference when I don't use it.  I gave it three stars because it doesn't remove everything right away.  You need to use it daily.  Other than that I don't have a problem with it.  The suction is good and it works more or less as advertised."
1,I have used this color for years.  I get lots of compliments on it.  It is extremely natural looking especially sense I am very fair skin.  Last about 5 weeks for me.
1,"This glue works great! I love that the glue is dark as oppose to the white glue that is so noticeable. It isn't black, more like a charcoal or dark gray, but blends in real well with your makeup so it's barely noticeable at all. It also holds up really well, I had no issues with the lashes falling off or ""flipping"" up at the ends. I had the lashes on for 8 hours before I peel them off myself."
1,I tend to frown when I'm working out and these help but I had to cut my bangs to hide the pad since it looks like a bandage when you're up close.
1,I use light ash brown for my dark brown hair. I use it only on the grays. I am 46 and graying slowly however some spots tend to stick out more then others. I pick thru my hair and use bobby pins to pull out the gray spots. Then I mix one tablespoon of each of the color mixes into a dish and use that small amount on only my grays. The color matches my hair great. In the end its perfect and after a couple washes my grey look like highlights. That's the look IM after.. I hate that complete colored look you get from dying your whole head so I improvise..LOL.. I love the look and the highlights are perfect. My grays still show in some places but they don't stand out.This product makes my hair so shiny and healthy. I don't know how it will work out when I'm grayer. I have used this natural instincts for years. It is natural and healthy on your hair for it being color. No harsh hair killing stinky stuff..update.. i cant find ash brown coloring at all now.. no more ash colors :(
1,I love this stuff! I put it on after the shower and before I put on cocoa butter and my skin is soft!  Smells nice but does not linger.
1,I was looking to try an nude and this color was perfect.  Nice nude color that goes on smoothly.  Totally recommend this.
1,"I'm 22 and have combination/oily skin with only occasional breakouts. I've been trying to take better care of my skin lately, and decided to try a toner. I'd always heard that Witch Hazel was amazing for your skin, but I never liked the smell. This stuff smells amazing!! Just like roses, but the smell fades after a few minutes of having it on your face, so it's not overpowering or anything. My face usually feels very dry after washing or taking a shower and I need to put lotion on immediately--but not with this. I swip it over my face on a cotton pad and my face feels clean and refreshed and super moisturized! No lotion needed! It's amazing how much extra dirt it gets off my skin too, even after washing my face. I think I'll continue using this for a long time because it makes my skin glow, feel clean, moisturizes/evens out my complexion and I've also heard it's good for anti-aging!"
1,Wonderful product. Paired with a little exfoliation my hands look soft and pretty. My knuckles were my problem area and it looks 100% better.
1,didn't use it continuously though. I still have oily face  after few hours of use and the pimples are still there. Best thing i like is that it's very gentle and would never burn your eyes. No tight feeling after washing your face.
1,"I have advanced from pin curls, to rollers, and then to hot rollers over the ages. What I love about the Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Multisized Hot Rollers is their ""new"" way of holding the roller in place. It took a little over a week to get used to the metal clip, but I've noticed a definite new shine to my hair, I think it's because the clip presses down on my hair and smooths it out. I have fine hair that I have to have permed every 2 months (it is quite short). Without a perm, my hair just falls flat and won't hold a hair style. Also, with short hair I don't need the heated clip. I just use the clip unheated. I'm sure if my hair were longer, I would need the extra heat from the clip. I really love this product and am so glad I found it. Try it--I think you'll love it!P.S. Beauty stylists use this type of curler on their celebrity's glamour photo shoots! (My cousin shared that information with me.)"
0,I didnt see no growth and its too many pills you have to take in one day and the kinda big which I didnt mind its just the quanity .
1,"I adore the scent of roses. My family has a special connection to it, and it always makes me smile. There is a very calming quality to the scent, which is probably why people use it in aromatherapy. Heritage Products has a wonderful product in their rose water. It has a delicate note to it, without being overpowering. What's more, if you are having a skin allergy/redness of any kind, just dab a small amount on a cotton ball, and it resolves your issues, while leaving you feeling as fresh as a rose garden. I like to drip a few drops on my clothing, and my pulse points. Highly recommended and a little goes a long way."
1,"Our good friends gave us a bar of this goat milk soap as a hostess gift.  My husband and I love the way this soap smells.  Very fresh and clean.  It lasts quite a while and doesn't crack.  I have been buying this product for over a  year now and don't plan on changing to another product, ever!"
1,"And there is a reason...  It works! Not if you want star eyelashes, but if you want pretty everyday normal person eyelashes."
1,"I'd been using the regular Neutrogena bar soap on my face for years, but I just decided to grab this one day while shopping.  I could not be more pleased!  I always thought my skin looked ok, but with this I actually love my skin!  Not to sound vain, but I look in the mirror and just think about how good my skin looks now and I don't even wear coverup!  IMO I think it makes me look younger too, but that could be wishful thinking!  This does not have the consistency of a cleanser, it does seem more like a lotion, but don't let that dissaude you, it is really great on the skin!"
1,"This is a good product to help your nails grow out healthy.  I usually put on two coats and then once a week take it all off and start over again.  My nails were splitting and weak, this product seems to have strengthened them."
1,"I can't say much about it because I have short thin hair, but I use it to dry my thickening product and it works as a charm, it also helps dry my razors after I shave to keep them working right so it is a plus. Very cheap too. Just take good care of it."
1,"All I can say is when I put this on my face (as I do every day, I always find myself saying aaaaahhhh.  It feels wonderful going on, and leaves my face so moisturized, soft and smooth.  I have been using Olay for most of my life, and often have compiments on my skin.  I'm a believe in Olay, particularly this cream"
1,"I don't understand why moisturizers/lotions bother with glitter. Glitter is not what I consider a ""glow"", and you're not fooling anyone. I want that healthy skin glow, not that christmas tree glow. Glittery doesn't belong on skin! It doesn't look good, isn't good for the skin, doesn't feel good! I hate having to answer ""hey why is your face all glittery?""In the case of this moisturizer, the glitter makes the texture gritty when applying. I don't like it!But on the bright side, I do love the scent and the fact that has no oil and has SPF. And o yeah. The price! Probably the cheapest oil free SPF moisturizer on the market.  It has a clean, refreshing scent.However, it is a very light moisturizer, so you have to use quite a lot.Sigh. Again searching for another oil free SPF moisturizer. Take out the glitter, clean and clear! And it'll lower your expenses too!"
1,Fantastic coverage. Hydrates and makes my face look youthful and energized with a glow. Slightly tinted and has sunblock SPF 30. This is a keeper for me. Better than foundation!
1,"First off, I started using this product back in the 70s, but ended up over the the years buying all the new and greatest brands, but ultimately came back to this old stand-by, because I happened to be watching ABC's Good Morning America news show one morning, and they had a beauty consultant on which had gone through all the top rated mascara brands including this one. Ultimately, their tests couldn't prove any of the other more expensive brands were any better than this old stand-by.  And the reported indicated that it was more feasible to use this brand. So, I will start using this product again, and stop wasting my money on the other brands which I personally couldn't see any improvement over this one."
1,"altogether lovely! I have purchased this soap in a retail store, paid more. It feels good to know that I will be stocked for a while. Sent an order to my boyfriend, too - sandalwood is good for both men & women. Nice lather, beautiful smell - but not too strong. Calming for your bath or shower. I also unwrap some bars to scent clothing bags and drawers. Yummy!"
1,"I love this color and have been using it for a couple of years. The conditioner which comes with it is excellent as lightening your hair this much, will dry it out badly without conditioning."
1,"One of LUSH's primary attractions is the fact that their products are unique in texture, scent and color and are fun to use.  This is the case with the SEX BOMB- I love the bright pink color and the musky scent.  One of the *best* bombs, and truly an experience!"
1,I love Essie for the quality and colors and I love that Amazon often has a good price.  Pleased with my polish.
1,"I like these rollers quite a bit, although it seems that the set should consist of 6 rollers rather than five, as most women would use two for the top of the head and two on each side.  Perhaps this is to get you to buy a second set, which is actually not a bad idea.When I read the instructions to set them up, I thought the red light that comes on when the unit is plugged in should turn white, which it didn't of course.  There is a red dot on the roller which turns white when hot.  Admittedly, I'm not great with instructions, but it could have simply said:  When the red dot on the ROLLER turns white the rollers are ready. What the instructions say is ""when the red ready dots turns white"".The red dot turns white pretty fast, but the rollers are definitely not hot enough to use, so you have to wait5 minutes more before they are hot enough.  That being said, they work great, producing soft, shiny curls."
1,"I'm assuming that what they tell you is true and you need to occasionally run sandpaper over your face to strip a small layer off. In that case, I'd recommend this to do it.I only use this once a week or once a fortnight. But when I feel particularly that there's too much skin on my face and I need to strip a layer off I use this. The good thing about it is that it cleans quite well yet does not leave your skin dry. It smells nice without being overpowering. And I only use it before sleep and never after shaving because I think that shaving already strips a layer off your skin.So, cleans nicely, does not leave the skin raw, I recommend it!"
1,"i love the peter thomas roth line, and this is no exception. i use them every 2-3 nights (if i used them more than that my chin would totally dry out) and they keep my skin super clean and tight. i've noticed if i go a week or more without using them that the little blemishes start to return, so i'm pretty diligent about washing my face every night and using these a couple times a week. they do sting a bit - some nights it's no big deal and others i've noticed it's more intense and i need to put lotion on right away to help cool things down."
1,"Contrary to many of the other reviews I actually liked this! Being a person who doesn't purchase products made with chemical sunscreens, I have tried a bunch of streaky stuff! Yes, while this does not go on completely transparent like some of the chemical blocks, it didn't make me look like a ghost and I have olive skin! I liked the fact that it contains antioxidants and the price is not as ridiculous as some of the higher end skin care. If you're looking for a physical block that goes on completely clear and are willing to spend a bit more try Replenix Sheer Physical Sunscreen, it's not made to be moisturizing but it has some powerful antioxidants. If you want something with a lower SPF (since Replenix is 50+) I would recommend doing some research although this is not half as bad! I did experience some issues with layering so get it all on before it dries. Eventhough this is supposed to be a lotion, it's better if you put something dewy on your face first (try 100% argan oil or facial moisturizer) just remember to let it set first. I found that it blends better. Although it'd be nice to get the perfect product, moisturizing, sheer, chemical-free protection from the sun, sometimes you can't have it all!"
1,"keeps acne at bay with a lot less yucky stuff than regular acne washes---my main reason for a natural face wash is that i like to tan and the active ingredients in most acne cleansers causes my skin to become sensitive and blister in sun--this product eliminates that problem.Also, doesn't contain any of those ingredients red flagged during pregnancy!  so cheap too!Reallllly burns when it gets in your eyes by the way, but thats not any reason to not love it  ;-)"
0,"I've been using this product for years and thought I found a deal here on Amazon. NOPE! The product is extreamly poor and has no coverage whatsoever. I had to keep using more and more, and it wasn't doing anything for my skin. I should have guessed, this was only $14 vs. the real deal, $27 in my local dept store. I think I'll just pay the extra and get the real product. I will NOT be back."
1,"For so long, I've been searching for a neutral or cooler light brown shade that compliments my cool skin tone. Almost every shade I've tried was either too golden or brassy (which looks awful with my pinkish skin tone), or ash shades made my hair too greenish, or cooler shades turned my hair too purple-ish due to the violet tone in the dye (used to counteract the yellow brassiness). Well, now I just tried L'oreal Superior Preference shade 6BB: Light Beige Brown (Cooler) for the first time, and for the most part, I am VERY pleased with the shade. It's a nice, neutral light-medium brown that (so far) is neither brassy nor purple. Before using this, my hair was a light brown, and this dye hasn't seemed to lighten or darken it very much. Maybe it's a bit darker, but that's typical. It usually lightens a bit once the color begins to fade after being washed a few times. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the gray coverage could be a bit better (especially around my temples, but that's always a problem area for me). I'd give it a B+ for gray coverage. The smell was surprisingly not too bed -- much less overwhelming than most permanent hair dyes I've tried before. This one has a bit of a fruity smell. My hair did feel a bit after I rinsed this out of my hair, but as usual, I use a really good oil-based hair mask afterward, which always makes my hair feel even softer than it did before the dying. I never use the conditioner that comes with the dyes because I find they just don't work as well as most oil-based masks do. I will definitely be using this again. I only hope that, once the color begins to fade a bit, the brassiness doesn't begin to appear."
1,"This is the best boxed blonde I have ever used.I've been bleaching my hair in various ways for ten years now. I've tried every boxed brand under the sun, I've gotten highlights, I've gone to the salon, and I've even had my friend bleach it (she went to Aveda). This has been the best product thus far.My hair is long and naturally a dark dirty blonde color, though it has years of different bleaches in it. This is the only boxed hair color I've used that has actually given me close-to-white results. It will always be a little bit yellowy (just a bit more golden than what's pictured on the box) but I'm sure you could really knock out any brass with a good purple-blue toner. I have not had any issues with brassiness using this brand, though. And that's amazing, considering I used to have rust-colored stains in my hair ALL THE TIME when using other brands and no amount of toner would help. I also only need one box to touch up my roots, which I do every 4 months or so, since my hair is pretty damaged from previous experiences.And the best part is, this stuff doesn't reek or burn or itch like an ammonia-based color does. Normally, I have to leave the bathroom several times during a coloring session and seek fresh air outside, but that's not the case with this! I also only leave it in for about 20 minutes for fear of causing breakage but I still get a great color out of it.The conditioner that comes with it is also good, but as previously mentioned, my hair is damaged (and dry), so I tend to use the entire tube of conditioner after coloring. This ensures that my hair actually feels healthier immediately after coloring and I see less breakage.All in all, I would highly recommend this to anyone considering going blonde. Take it from me, a ten-year expert on do-it-yourself dying.(But I'll warn you. If you have really dark or reddish hair, I'd recommend going to a professional. It will probably turn out orange if you try doing it yourself.)"
1,I love it is why I give this an A+. Great lotion and feels very good on my skin. I do recommend this lotion.
1,"I purchased a sample of this at Sephora out of curiosity, and to see what all the hype was about. Initially, I wasn't too impressed. It wasn't horrible but it didn't ""wow"" me like I had expected it to. I have oily skin, and it maybe was just my skin type or lack of exfoliation.Then I bought a Clarisonic, and wow! I'm not sure how the two mix so well, but it's surely a match made in cosmetic heaven. The lather was just right, and I saw more make-up come off on my Clarisonic brush than normal. My skin was so soft afterwards and felt so clean!By itself, this cleanser is OK, once again it just may have been my skin type. but if you have a Clarisonic, it's a must have. It is worth the hype!"
1,"I bought this after I moved into an apt with a mirror that was pretty far from the sink and did not fold out. I would have to lean really close to the mirror to make sure I didn't miss a spot shaving.The mirror was easy to install and shouldn't leave to much damage. (usual screw holes). Used a low power drill.The arm for the mirror is sturdy and easily folds in and out and stays in place.Both mirrors work well. The magnifiedmirror is perfect.Only negative I have come across is that, like almost any mirror, it doesn't clean that well. Windex eventually does the job, but does seem a little tougher than usual."
1,I got this when I was growing my beard out. I have coarse hair and I wanted something that would baby it a little bit. Saw a lot of reviews from what I believed to be a race of people with traditionally rough and tough hair so that convinced me.It works pretty well. Has a nice scent and seems to have done as much for my facial hair as humanly possible short of oiling the d@mn thing every few days.
1,I use it for the red spots and acne on my face and it seems to help. It is cheap and works so I'm happy with the buy.
1,Olay Total Effect's facial lotion is an excellent everyday lotion.  It goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.  It has no fragrance and absorbs quickly.  The one issue I have is that it leaves me looking a bit shiny.The bottle that it comes in is small and travels well.  It's easy to pump out the exact amount that you need.I have combination sensitive skin and I've not noticed and issues or breakouts.  I've been using it for about a month now with good results.
1,"So far, this is the best leave in conditioner.  It smells great, it softens my hair very fast, and keeps it from getting dry for at least a whole day.  I have very thick, dry, unruly, African American hair, so I think a leave in is necessary, Im still going to try other leave ins after Im done just to see, but I think it would be hard to find one better than this.  I recommend getting a spray bottle though, you can get a cheap one for $1 from any discount store, its worth it to switch it to one, its just a lot easier..."
1,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this toner - mainly worried that I'd smell like a grandma - (what does a grandma really smell like? Hmmm...I'm being ageist here probably ;-)) but I really like the smell and it's very nice on my skin, I have dry to medium skin and I could use the hydration and I'm one of those people who likes to feel squeaky clean but reaching for the rubbing alcohol as a toner...not such a good idea.  And I use regular witch hazel but I was looking for something extra soothing and this is really nice.  I'm not sure if I'll reorder it but right now I'm using it and liking it ;-)"
0,I have been searching for a lower cost alternative to DDF's glycolic acid cleanser and I ordered this one.  I found the product to be so weak as to not make much difference in how clean and clear my face was after using it.
1,The package came a bit banged up but I received it quickly and the bottle was in good shape so that is what matters to me. I have used it twice so far. It makes my nails nice and smooth and my nail polish seems to glide on nicely after using it. Will update if anything changes but for now I am liking it.
0,"This stuff never really worked for me. I have dry, thick hair that's damaged and comes with frizz and the like. This did absolutely nothing for my hair."
1,"I love this polish, it is flattering to many skin tones and I have had many compliments. The application was smooth and stress-free."
0,"I really liked the results I got from this iron. However, after about 4 months the connector that you twist to lock the barrels in place no longer worked. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,"I have very sensitive skin and have used Babor products for a number of years.  They have made my skin better at 63 then when I was 43 or even 33. While those products are expensive and long lasting, they give awesome results. After reading recent reviews,  I decided to try this one as I am on a strict budget for a few months.  I would consider this average.  It absorbs very quickly and does make my skin look good.  I have no breakouts after using it for about a week.  The one thing I am not too keen on is that it contains silicone and I try to stay away from it.  Other than that I would recommend it for the results you may get.  It is definitely worth a try."
1,"this is amazing, i have conbination skin and it works very well with the cleanser.  i have been telling everyone how great this is"
1,"This is one of the few moisturizing products that I've actually ordered a second time.  Usually I use a bottle or part of one, get tired of it because it doesn't work as expected, and move on to another product.  This regenerating serum just works.  It makes my skin feel hydrated and soft without a greasy or heavy feel.  It absorbs quickly and is perfect under foundation or withOlay Definity Color Recapture, Light/Medium, 1.7-Ounce Box.  It's also nice because it goes a long way.  Just two pushes of the pump, a couple of drops, is enough to moisturize my whole face.  So the bottle lasts a long time.The only thing I didn't like as much about this serum is that I mistakenly ordered this one that has a light fragrance.  It's not overpowering or anything and it dissipates quickly, but I really prefer the fragrance free version.Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Concentrated Amino-Peptide Complex, Fragrance Free - 1.7 fl ozI'm not sure if it makes me look younger but it does seem to minimize the appearance of wrinkles.  It makes my skin feel good."
1,You need this if you are at home or taking a trip to the nail shop.  It definitely makes polishes adhere to the nail bed longer than a regular base coat.  I didn't use a base then this I just used this and my polish lasted 7-10 days. Most polish without this chips in about 3 days.  This is definitely the thing to use whenever you are doing natural nails with regular polish.
1,Love this shampoo! It smells natural and fresh for days and does a great job of really cleaning her coat..
1,"Two days after I started using this product, which I love, I noticed that my skin was mush smoother and shinier than it had been before. I love the way it smells, and after using it and then going out, I've gotten complements on my perfume, even though this body oil is all that I was wearing. I put it on mysking while it's still damp, just when I get out of the shower. Highly recommended."
1,"I love this shade.  It gives your nail a clean, neutral, classy look, but it's a bit more opaque than Waltz, which is very pretty but better, in my opinion, for French manicures."
1,"I really like this moisturizer and use it every day as do my teenage daughters, great product that does not clog pores."
1,"Why haven't I been singing the praises of this little beauty of a mascara?!  I get courted away by $30+ mascaras that flake or never wash off!  Even the drugstore brands lured me away with their fancy brushes and promises of butterfly lashes.  No more!  This stuff doesn't flake, is inky and black, but can be removed w gentle soap and water.  My lashes actually feel conditioned after using this for a few days.  Do yourself a favor and buy this!"
1,I work fast food so you can imagine how terrible that is for someone with sensitive oily acne prone skin. I went to spend some time with my sister straight after work one day and she had me use these and WOW is the best way to describe these wonderful things. My face felt completely clean like it cleaned away all of my makeup and i felt it cleaning my pores. I looked at my face the next day and it looked so much clearer than it has in years. I will definitely be buying some of my own and i recommend these to everyone who want a clear and clean face.
1,"I started using this product 2.5 months ago after removing artificial nails.  My nails were always thin, bendy, and peeling before acryclic (this is why I've used artificial nails on and off for special occasions)  I was determined to have pretty nails for my wedding that is coming up in 3 days and was sick of the thick artificial look... for the first time EVER my nails are long and strong, and no more peeling.  My biggest problem prior to trying nailtiques was my nails peeling off from the sides, right when they would grow a little bit I would get a split in the side and it would just peel the whole nail end right off.  You have to be VERY diligent about applying every day, this was hard for me because I was still experiencing peeling at the ridges from the artifical nails so it might seem like it's not working but you have to be patient.  As soon as the damaged nail grew out is when I could really tell the difference and I have had to even file them down.A .25 oz bottle has lasted me about 6 weeks (I'm still only on my second bottle after 2.5 months), although it would probably have lasted longer but once I got to the last bit in the bottle it got pretty thick and I got a new bottle.  I believe they also sell a nailtique protein thinner (nail polish thinner won't work!)  When the protien gets thick it peels off easier, normally I could go over a week without having to remove and start again, when it was thicker it would start peeling off after 3 or 4 days."
1,"Followed directions provided with product and I am pleased with the results. I have an olive complexion, and it looks natural to me."
1,"I have only used the cream a few nights so I don't expect to see a difference. It is a very thick cream, but not to thick. It does feel nice on the skin. I don't care for the smell.  I do prefer a serum .  But if you have really dry skin, you might enjoy this over a serum.."
1,"It smells like lemongrass, but it's just pure lemon oil. It's nice in a reed diffuser. I also use it on my heavy paper face mask, for changing the litter boxes. It really does block the odors."
1,"Easy to set up. Just make sure to absolutely wait a whole day after you apply the silicone. It's extremely important. The only thing is that it couldn't dispense a very creaming expensive conditioner. So I had to dilute it with water to work. Which I didn't like doing..otherwise, this was perfect. But the mirror still fogged. Lol.."
1,"Well priced, came on time, nice product. But just not the right red for me and too much to return it. I gave it to a friend. Made my lips look tiny and thin. Like a mail slot."
0,"The nail stregthener is suppose to be clear, mine has a yellow tint to it. Unfortunally I accidently throw away the returning label or else I would have returned it to the seller. I am sure the product is great but like I said my has a visible yellow tint to it. Also, it tinited my nails yellow. Seller look into why the product has yellow tint to it."
1,This is my second favorite mascara...Revlon grow luscious by Fabulash being my first. I use this when I know I might cry in public.
1,"It's okay. It moisturizes. It feels a bit oily but that might just be my skin. It is light which I like. Also, I like the bottle because one pump is exactly how much I need. However, it smells like a sunscreen. Also, It looks and feels like a sunscreen to some extent. It is not a real problem, but I don't especially like it particularly because, like sunscreen, it leaves your face tinted white before it settles it . I'll probably try something different when I'm done with these two bottles. The only good thing about the sunscreen likeness is that it is SPF 30 which is really good, however; I'm not sure whether I should reapply it after 2 hours of being in the sun like most sunscreens or just leave it. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're looking for a sunscreen."
1,"People are so immature. Yes, the product looks goofy, we get it, but leaving whole bunch of fake reviews is not funny, it's just plain stupid.That being said, facial flex does work. I had a smile line that I couldn't get rid of and that was the only reason i paid $50 for something like that. Within two day, I am not kidding, the line was gone. No only that, my upper lip got fuller. It does make your face,neck and even tongue very sore at first, but just like with any other workout,you get used to it.I am very happy with the results and will continue using it.UPD. I realized I forgot to mention that I am 26 y.o. with no skin aging issues just yet. I sleep on my right side, so overtime I got a crease along the smile line. I am still using the product, along with putting a ban-aid on the sides of my mouth when i go to sleep, so I don't get that line back. I also put petroleum jelly on the area(believe it or not it fills wrinkles in temporarily). If I forget to do my routine, the line comes back obviously, so it has to be done every day.I noticed that some people ordered the product based solely on my review and were disappointed with it, so I thought I'd edit it and let them know what kind of issue it fixed for me."
1,"I bought this for my friend. She says thhe massage cream is very good, and the price is also good too."
1,You really can't go wrong with Essie. I love painting my nails and this is a great color. I have so many nail polishes. It is a great accessory to any outfit. Great fall color.
1,"I bought a bottle for my daughter (10) and myself to help us to stop bitting out nails.  The flavor to me is bitter, but not a digusting flavor.  It stays on the tongue for apx 10min.  For me, it did help me to stop bitting my nails bc the taste would remind me to get my fingers out of my mouth.For my daughter, she doesn't use it everyday, so it hasn't helped her.....if she used it everyday, I'm sure that it would keep her from biting her nails.  The problem is it has to be applied daily to get that bitter taste effect & she doesn't remember to apply it daily, or just doesn't want to.I do think that the price, $12.00 a bottle ,is a little over priced."
1,"You might not like this product if you have oily skin, since we ""people with oily skin"" are used on using products that would make our skin dry to dry out pimples and such.. this product leaves a satin finish on your skin, and i found that my nose gets oily after couple of hours, i did not like that.  However it is a good cleanser, it cleans makeup without having to rub it too hard on your face like other soups. it also smells like Johnson&Johnson baby shampoo."
0,"Another high expectations, and high disappointment. Yes, that`s great cream for 4 dollars, and if you have an oily skin, because it doesn`t really moisturize. I have a combination skin, but after washing it gets tight. This cream sinks after a while in the skin, but I have the same feeling of dry skin later. It has no glide.Now I use it for the body, after adding few drops or aromatherapy oils. I won`t purchase again."
1,My uncle has developed eczema in his mid-60s and has been self-conscious about his newly imperfect skin. Vanicream has helped both in soothing his itching and helping to [slightly] fade the marks on his skin.
1,"Excellent quality, of course - it's OPI, the best there is.  The color is a burnt peach with a slight shimmer to it.  Very classy and pretty, all season color."
1,I have super curly hair and I love that this comb helps me to distribute conditioner better throughout my hair.  It is strong and doesnt hurt.
1,"The Lash Adhesive is the same one that comes with most false eyelashes. The tube seals correctly, so the contents do not dry out before the next time it is used. Highly recommend!"
0,This sells because fatgirlslim is a FAN-TASTIC title. The product smells wonderful! That is where this ends. I am not paying this amount for great smelling lotion. Off brand cellulite gels or lotions work better just don't smell as good.
1,I have natural 3c/4a hair with protein overload. I just started using this and after one application my hair is soft.
1,"This is a sheer, white polish. If I'd done my homework before ordering (Googling &#34;Essie Marshmallow swatch&#34;) I'd have known that this was not the opaque polish I'd been looking for. It is still a high-quality polish with great application, but if you're looking for an opaque white, you probably want Blanc by Essie instead. This one is great for a white-on-white french manicure though--very interesting look!"
1,Cool idea. I love the way it feels on my scalp. I didn't know what to expect I am pleasantly surprised.
1,"I love everything about this moisturizer - it leaves my skin feeling great, protected from the sun and smells good to boot!"
1,"Having found some Olay products that I thought were excellent I gave this one a whirl.  After 6 weeks of use I don't notice a decrease in lines.  My skin is extremely dry, flaky with uneven skin tones and I have noticed improvement in these areas.  Is it from this product or one of the others it is impossible to tell.  I do like that it is fragrance free."
1,"I discovered this peel years ago when Bliss carried the product. I have oily skin with blackhead problems on the nose and cheeks, and dry flaky skin around the lips. I use it mostly around those problem areas. It gets rid of blackheads and sloughs off the dry skin around the nose, cheeks, and mouth.It's like an eraser, and sloughs off little rolled layers of old skin, just as with an eraser, for when you don't feel so dry and faded that a professional peel at the dermatologist is needed yet.In lieu of monthly visits to a spa, I follow the below regiment, which saves money in the long run without compromising good skin.A good ""at home,"" facial regiment once a week for glowing skin is:1) wash face, steam your face for however long your skin type needs (I have a face steamer, which I pour eucalpytus or lavender essential oil into--and I steam to open up my pores for about 15-20 minutes).2) immediately slap on a mud-based face mask (even a cheap drugstore one is fine, but I like Korre's mud-based rose or pomegranate masks for this). Wait til mask dries. Wash it off with warm water. Somehow, a clay-based mask, no matter if it's a cheap Queen Helene Mint Julep mask or a Murad mask, clay sucks up alot of dirt, whiteheads, blackheads, and oily gunk when the pores are just steamed open, rather than washing your face with warm water and slapping a mud mask on.3) hop in steam shower or use a hot towel on your face, use the instant peel by squeezing a glob and work through each problem area, wash off once that area is ""sloughed off."" moisten face with hot towel again, then keep going, region by region. If you squeeze it all out at once and rub all over the place, it won't be as effective.4) wash off. Use a soothing toner like L'occitane's Immortelle brightening water or the normal Immortelle water.5) use good night treatment lotion (immortelle brightening cream, Caudelie night cream, Clarins, etc.)If you do this at least once a week (1-2 for oily skin, once a week for others),and in the ""in between"" days, stick to a regiment of a clarisonic brush or a good daily exfoliating scrub followed by toner and lotion your skin will glow. In addition, drinking lots and lots of water and lots of fruits and veggies, sun protection, taking vitamins, lots of green tea, and getting a good night's rest, are also required.The above regiment is for very oily skin. I don't suggest the level of regimentation to those with sensitive skin or dry skin."
1,"If this product did not work for you, I am truely sorry! But, for me, this is a miracle!! I highly recommend it based on the following and what type of skin I have.My skin is oily, and breaks out occasionally but no matter what I do I have blackheads.  I steam and clean it every day. I don't wear makeup most days yet the blackhead s are there.I popped this gadget out of the box ascsoon as I got it, just taking it for a test run. My expectations were not high based on reviews.I was in shock when I turned it on, and after using a few minutes noticed the cap filling with a white/gray goo from my pores. My blackheads were being sucked out. I checked the mirror,  it seemed so. Just to be sure I rinsed the cap out then tried again. Same result. Maybe its because I steam my face often or my skin is so oily that it worked. But it did! Some things to note, the water tank is tricky to fill. Use only filtered water for it to prolong its life. It sprayed me right in the eye first go. It has one suction setting which is more than adequate but is funneled by using the smaller end. The mist definitely helped it stick to my face. In some places it did not stick as well, like my chin, but it worked. You need to move it up or down or in circles to get full effect. I would buy again and if you don't like it return it. Also there are knock offs so make sure its panasonic american. I would not buy tge japanese one as it may not fit American outlets  and has not been u.l. tested."
1,"This is the best moisturizer on the market for rosacia, really takes away the redness and offers a lot of moisture to the skin."
1,"Title says it all :) It's gentle, easily covers my roots, and gives my hair a luminous golden color with multi dimensional highlights. Will buy again!"
1,"I have absolutely horrible dark circles, far beyond the point of being concealed with any type or amount of makeup, but this product significantly reduces their discolored appearance.This looks pretty good and almost unnoticeable once blended out with my ring fingers. However, I really need a primer or something with this or it creases horribly. It feels sort of greasy and heavy when applied, but if you go easy with it and just make it last by spreading and blending, it works. It looks even better if applied under flesh-tone concealer or foundation.My main problem is that the packaging isn't entirely hygienic, at least if you put the stick right on your skin. It could spread bacteria and cause breakouts, so maybe use a small brush or something with it."
1,"I like this product, it leaves my hair very soft. It doesn't have a smell that stays with you, but it doesn't smell great. I use it on the nights when I skip the Profectiv anti-breakage daily streghtener."
1,"When i first recieved this jar of cocoa butter it was/is rock hard and dry. For everyone who hasn't yet figured out how to use this product, read this review it will save you some time and frustration.I cut out the amount of cocoa butter needed from this jar, added it to a heat safe container with coconut oil at room tempurature... I put the container in a pan halfway filled with water, don't fill 2 much or the water will go into your container. With low heat and a few minutes the cocoa butter melted nicely into the coconut oil, so I removed it from the heat added argan oil, grapeseed oil and mixed. Once it returned to room tempurature the mixture was not dry or hard. It melts easily when I want to use it and my skin has never felt better or more hydrated. This works wonders on winter dry hair as a leave in treatment overnight. I've also used this mixture on my face, under makeup and at night. I've noticed smoother, brighter skin and wouldn't trade my oil for any department store product again.Give this oen a try, it's worth it."
1,I have been using this product for years.  It is the perfect amount of moisture.  I have been buying it in the stores until recently when I realized its significantly cheaper via amazon. I recommend this cream 100%
1,I love these. they worked so well. I have eczema so it helps get rid of dead skin cells that pile up.
1,this is true waterproof the brush is kind of small for me so it takes about 4 to 5 coats before you can see my lashes i gave it a true water proof test yes it is water proof
1,"It is truly absorbent as advertised, but for my long hair it's about 6 inches too short to allow it to be wrapped and tucked efficiently. If one had a smaller head and shorter hair, probably it would be fine."
1,"This is probably the best toner I have ever used. It does not dry out your skin, it is very gentle. I will definitely repurchase. The bottle lasts a long time too!!!"
1,"I can hardly believe I'm writing a review about a hair brush, but this brush is so awesome, I had to do it.  This brush is great!  It glides through my hair so well, and doesn't tangle it.  It feels fantastic.  (I will note, however, that I use a wide-tooth comb first to comb out any bad knots in my hair while it's still wet, and then I use this brush).  My boyfriend even made an offhand comment that he likes using my brush more than his because it feels so much better than his brush, so that should give you an idea of how good it feels.This brush is also SUPER easy to clean.  I used to always have those nasty bits of lint/product that I could never clean out of my brushes.  This one doesn't have that -- I just clean my hair out of it every so often and it looks good as new."
1,The Burt's Bees lemon & vitamin e bath & body oil is a great product. It feels great and smells even better. BUY IT.
1,I am a big fan of the Olay Regenerist line. I have been using the serum for about 6 years now. I am 32 and my skin is better now than it was when I was in my mid 20s. This serum is a life saver because I try to use a lot of anti aging products on and off but I know that if I use this serum once a day I'm covered!I have combination skin and this serum is super absobant.
1,"I just started using it about a month ago. No noticeable difference in wrinkle reduction but also, no bad side effects."
1,"These are great. They stay put all day and they don't squeeze the life out of your brain. Who needs a girdle for your head? These are classic, well made accessories. Love them!!"
1,"I know a lot of naturals (black/african americans) don't like shampoos for obvious reasons. Yet I happen to try the Home Health Antidandruff Shampoo, I don't know what it is about this shampoo, but it's different. If you're battling dry/itchy scalp at times this can definitely do the job at releaving most of the issue. The foam lathers well without it being too overpowering.  The ingredients are also pretty great as well.  Very happy about this product."
1,"I've been using this color off and on for a few years.  I find the feria line isn't nearly as drying to my hair as others.  My hair feels in great shape when I'm done.  I have a hard time keeping color on my hair (with any box or salon color) - my hair wants to turn blonde...even though my hair is brown and the roots come in brown.  I use this every 6-8 weeks, but my hair is usually pretty blonde when I do.  The color comes out great - no orange tints at all...which is a problem I usually have with other boxes.  I will continue to use and stop switching around!"
1,"I had never heard of this product before I came across some reviews of top beauty products on makeupalley.com. Folks raved about the power of this little tool. At $47 I was hesitant but decided to ante up. And I am so glad I did.The #11 buffer is an outstanding tool. Used dry, you simple rub it across your feet. Dry skin quickly sheds off leaving a soft smooth surface. I follow the buffing with a good moisturizer and tuck my tootsies in socks. The results are smooth, soft pampered feet!The price may seem high at first, but a pittance when you think of all the money you would have spent on pedicures.The tool is designed to last for years and after use a quick wash with a small soft toothbrush and soap will have it ready for the next use.An excellent value!"
1,"At first this made my skin oily when using at night. I stopped using it and my skin started to dry out. I have very oily skin.Update: After using the glycolix 20% pads and taking B-stress vitamins, my skin is getting dry. I started using this again at night and the oil free in the day. My skin is clear for the first time since my teens. Amazed! Finally found my formula that works."
0,"Didn't work well on my dry, long hair.  And was a bit of a mess to apply.  I much prefer the Rusk Deepshine Luster."
1,I'm in Love with Geranium scent Mrs. Meyer's Anything!I've liked and used Mrs. Meyers for years!But I've Never found the Geranium scent!I Love Floral scents....even in my perfume....Now I have this amazing scent for household cleaning!I have Never been Happier with a product in my life!
1,"It cleans my face nicely and does help control oil for a while, but it isn't a miracle cleanser. If you have an oily face, there's only so much it can do for you for so many hours. It also works to control acne but I don't really have acne so I can't comment on that. The scent of this cleanser is very strong and perfumy which I don't care for. It isn't a very expensive product so I don't feel too badly about having bought it, but I probably won't be purchasing it again. I'll continue looking for something else. I used to use one of the Neutrogena oil control cleansers but can't seem to find the one which works best for me anymore, so my search is still on."
1,"I&#8217;m a fan of a lot of Palmers&#8217; products and was looking for a good body oil so I really thought I would like this. Having used baby oil in the past, I was shocked at how quickly this was used up. The baby oil would last easily through the winter and beyond, but this barely lasted a month. The consistency was quite thin and runny, so a lot of it was lost in the process of trying to apply. Then &#8211; possibly because of thinness? -  I felt like I needed more. I have used sweet almond oil in the past and it has a similar consistency. On the bright side, it smelled good and felt good, but because of the above issues I won&#8217;t be buying again."
1,"This is my favorite hand lotion.  A tiny dab moisturizes both hands.  I find I have to reapply it fairly often, but I haven't found any better products."
1,"super easy to use, get nice and hot but the curlers have cover-y things that keep me from burning my hands.  It's pretty small so it didn't take up a lot of space when i packed it in a carry on last week.  They give nice curl or good volume depending on what you are looking for.  The only thing I wish is that there was an on/off switch instead of it just turning on when plugged in."
1,"This is a scented OIL so take it easy (this is in response to the reviewer that said it is overpowering)... it doesn't evaporate like perfume sprays so the fragrance stays put for some time.  Black Coconut doesn't smell purely like coconut... this oil smells like the most yummy tanning oil you could ever imagine.  It smells like you are drenched in sunlight on some glorious white sand beach.  I adore this scent.  It's fantastic, soothing, and sexy all at once."
1,"Let me first state that these rollers work very well. I have fine hair and as I'm aging, it's only getting finer and more fragile.  My hair is slightly layered and goes just past shoulder length. These curled the hair wonderfully in a very short period of time.  Probably left them in for 10-15 min tops. The unit delivers on what it promises and I have no complaints there.As others have commented, they can be hot to handle and if you have very sensitive fingertips, beware.  It was not something that was unbearable for me though. I washed and dried my hair while the unit heated up and it was ready by the time I was done blow drying.  As others have stated, there WAS a distinct odor (common to such devices) as the rollers was heating up. Not pleasant but it seemed to dissipate after a while.The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because there are not enough larger rollers.  The smallest ones make VERY tight curls and I can't imagine anyone wanting curls that tight unless they were trying to do all over spirals - and there's not enough of that size roller in this unit to do those anyway.  If you intersperse the smallest roller with the largest ones throughout the hair, the effect is very odd - larger looser waves in some places, and tight, very tiny curls in others.  If this unit had all medium and larger rollers it would be 5-stars."
1,"This shade is no longer available, so I was very pleased to see it on Amazon. Although the seller is wonderful, there is a slight difference in color from my old bottle. It is slight, so it is probably the dye lot, but with OPI being such a well known trusted brand, I would have thought quality control would be better."
0,I have dark reddish/brown hair and wanted to dye it blonde for a change. I chose this brand because the before photo on the box appeared to match my hair the closest and the after photo best matched the shade of blonde I wanted to be. I applied this brand to my hair and it did absolutely nothing. It says on the directions to leave it in for 25 minutes. I wasn't noticing a change so I left it in for an hour. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the conditioner smells amazing and it left my hair feeling very soft. Too bad the dye doesn't work.
1,"I bought this for my mom and she loves it! With use every night, this has helped to reduce fine lines and age spots. her skin looks much healthier too! I have even used it a few times and it really makes a difference. Over the course of a couple days, it improves the look and texture of skin (wrinkles take a bit longer). It helped to reduce some of the hyperpigmentation I have and is great for use on sensitive skin. Also, a small amount goes a long way, so this jar can last for months. Just follow the directions and be diligent and it should work for you too!"
1,Used this to bleach my roots at home. I'm a professional hairdresser but I do not have the time nor the money to buy a professional hooded salon dryer for use maybe 4-5 times a month. Perfect for my clients that can't come to the salon anymore. (I only have 2 that can't make it up stairs anymore) I can still do their usual wet sets weekly without having to drag them to the salon. So far it's not bad. I don't understand the negative reviews. It's 20$!
1,"I have sensitive skin and this soap works great for me. It has a wierd smell to me but it's not a bad smell. I don't itch or get a rash, yay. We also use it on our two year old. You get alot of soap for the price and it lasts a while as well."
1,"I am lightish-skinned black and have to deal with horrible brown spots post-acne.  These products never work as quickly as you would like them to (like, yesterday!) but this gel works and it works faster than I have noticed with other products.  The active ingredient is HQ - same as murad acne spot gel, and I believe at the same percentage, but for some reason this starts to show results faster on my skin.  The only con is that it does cause some dryness, but nothing unmanageable."
1,"This product is OK but not as good as its sister product, Botanical Boost. It somewhat control frizz but no better than other products intended for that use for less money. I will buy the Botanical Boost again, but likely will not buy this."
1,"For years I have struggled with dry, acne-prone skin, and all moisturizers I tried caused me to break out, left my face feeling oily, or would wear-off and would need to be re-applied throughout the day. This is the first moisturizer I have tried that works for my sensitive skin without any of those problems.This product dissolves quickly without oily residue and leaves my skin feeling soft for the entire day (until I wash my face my again).  I use this product twice a day (morning and night) after I wash my face, and I love it!  If you are struggling to find a good facial moisturizer, I would definitely recommend this product!"
1,You can scrub good with these gloves and get a massage while you clean. Its a good thing. I got three.
1,My skin's very oily; this product controls my oil production without drying out my skin! You only need half a pump to get complete coverage! I recommend using this after washing your face with the Pomegranate face wash or the Oil-Free face wash!
1,"Why spend a ton of money on some fancy toner when you can get the best for $9?  This stuff is amazing!  It really smoothes out my skin, gets rid of blemishes, nourishes my skin, and it smells lovely, not like most nasty alcohol-based toners.  This is a bargain (and the bottle is HUGE for the price too - 12 oz!) I work from home so I use it several times a day.  I have definitely seen a difference since using it."
1,a great product of getting rid of dandruff with continue usage.  It has a nice smell and makes your scalp tingle.  It is great for fighting unwanted dandruff with continued usage daily or weekly.
1,"I bought Purity because I saw on QVC that you can use it on your eyes to remove mascara.  IT WORKS!  It doesn't burn my eyes and takes every trace of makeup off.  I can't live without this product, and have began stocking up by the liter."
1,This product is best used on feet-totally helps with odor and sweat.  Plus its all natural-no harmful chemicals or metals.
1,"I've always loved this mascara.  Use to buy it from a different source.  I think I found this as an add-on, so it was inexpensive, which is why I bought it here.  It is as good as other mascaras, I have just happened to always be found of this one."
1,"It's light and perfect for summer.  Much cheaper here than at Target, and it's available in the larger size, which is a better deal."
1,It doesn't work as well as I had hoped but will use it occasionally. My hair is still somewhat fried from a perm I had about a year ago and was hoping this would smooth it better than it does.
1,"First, I went to Thayer's website & found their price for this product is same/similar to Amazon but with Amazon when my purchases reaches their criteria I get Free Shipping. That was a + for Amazon :)Then, when my Thayer- Witch Hazel Toner-Rose Petal arrived I tried it immediately ............. I am in Love ! If you love roses as I do ... you will love this toner ! The fragrance is not overwhelming .... but just perfect !I do not work for this company & I have never given such high praise for anything I bought as Amazon. This product is truly wonderful. Its feels wonderful on the skin & the fragrance is heavenly. I definitely recommend this !"
0,"This hand cream is too thick and not spreadable for me. It doesn't absorb as well as other hand creams I've used. The only time I like using this is before bed, when I don't touch anything throughout the night, I then wakeup with soft hands. It's just too much for day time use. I end up getting everything sticky. I prefer Eucerin Intensive Therapy Hand Cream to this, at least that spreads and absorbs in to my hands."
1,"This turban has worked extremely well for my deep conditioning sessions. I have a 1000 watt microwave and so microwave it for about 45 seconds, then another 15 - 20 to get it to the temperature I want. Once it is hot, it is ready for use! The turban stays hot to warm for about 20 minutes and if I want a longer deep condition I simply place it in the microwave for another 25 seconds and it is hot. Really liking this product! My only qualm is that the turbans design results in the gel packs not quite covering the whole of my head, which means about a 1x2 in section of my head doesn't get direct contact with the heat. I simply turn the turban around on my head after a while to reorient the position of the packs and get the heat to that section that was missed. No big deal, but I decided to give a four star instead of a five because of this."
1,"This is an excellent moisturizer for hands and or dry elbows.  It softens without feeling greasy.I would definitely recommend it, especially for use during the winter months."
1,this is such an incredible little styling tool and it does a wonderful job.  I'm not good with a curling iron but this does comparable results without the crimping and is much easier to use.  Highly recommend it.
1,I look product and it soft my hair as soon as I placed on hair.i have very dry hair 4a/b type of curly hair. I was they sold in bigger jar. It will only b enough for 1more application for my hair.(I use a heating cap and sat for 30mins and shampoo out. (I don't mind paying more for good product that works for my hair. Will order again. (Direction said use once a week but I will only use only when hair is really dry (will use other deep conditioners in between times)
1,I used this brand for years even before I started to go grey. It always made my hair look and feel thick and healthy. I am African American 4b/c hair. Now that I do have grey hair I love that this product really does cover the grey. Many products say that it will but doesn't! This one does the job.
1,"This is still my favorite mascara. It's a great price, it goes on well, and it doesn't clump--or at least not as soon as others I have tried. I have light skin and dark blond hair, and I usually stick with the brownish black color (though even black doesn't look half bad on me, honestly). I try more expensive mascaras from time to time, but I always seem to come back to this one. It really is a tried and true favorite."
1,I love this product. It works great and is not hard and overdrying even though I use more than I should.
1,"I like this hair spray.  Holds my upswept hair without being too &#34;hard&#34; and yet does the job.  I like their Super hold, too, for a couple of recalcitrant spots at the nape of my neck."
1,"I purchased it for my husband, I never used or smelled FCUK perfumes before, only have some clothes from them, but I am really very happy with the perfume, the price was great and the bottle is BIG!!! It's clean and crispy, slightly spicy and sweet - not sugary or candy like sweet, but good fragrance like sweet :) It's perfect for casual use, and bold enough for the evening. I would recommend it for men under 35-40. I would not probably buy it for my dad."
1,"This is a face wash based on castile soap (like Dr. Bronner's), but is milder than Bronner's soap. It has a large hit of tea tree oil, and some other additives that are said to improve the condition of the skin.I have used this stuff on and off for over 15 years as a bodywash and shampoo. My hair is short and I can get away using soap on my hair. People with longer, thicker hair may find soap leaves their hair limp or difficult to style. I appreciate that it cleans and disinfects my armpits so well that I am not so dependent on strong deodorants and antiperspirants as I used to be.It cleans your skin very well and is especially good at cleaning oily skin. A little goes a long way and easily creates a lather. Recommended to put it in a flip-top bottle and shake a few drops at a time as you wash up in the shower. It rinses off your skin easily, but be aware that castile soap does leave a soap residue on things and you may need to clean your shower and sink more often to keep the scum away.Desert Essence products are mostly based on tea tree oil, which is a natural disinfectant. It has a distinct pine-ish, turpentine-ish fragrance that some find off-putting, but dissipates within an hour or so after bathing. A friend of mine credits this product with curing his rosacea. I switch between this product and Desert Essence's castile soap, which is a very similar product without the other cosmetic additives contained in the face wash."
1,"What can I say hmm ....does it work yes ,makes nail hard ,strong and sweet.....follow the instructions as its written on the box along with the other product .This is nice and yes I will order this again ...With this product I took hair,nail and skin vitamins along with its ...watch your nail grow nice strong and long ."
1,"I don't have severe acne, but as I get older (I'm 39) I'll get one or two large and sensitive blemishes a month that don't seem to go away no matter what I do- not even prescription cream seems to make it better. The only solution is to do whatever I can to prevent them in the first place. I used the Aveeno salicylic acid pads for years, but they seems to do only a mediocre job at preventing blemishes. So I decided to go with the 2% salicylic acid in the Stridex pads and see what happened.Within a day of using these (just a light sweep over my face in the shower a few minutes before scrubbing my face with Purpose soap), the blemish I have been fighting with for the past three weeks DRIED UP and went away. In addition, my skin isn't nearly as oily in the late afternoons as it was.I was worried that these pads might be too drying for my skin, but so far that hasn't been a problem at all. Again, I do wash my face a few minutes *after* I use the pad. The pad makes me skin tingle and it's almost a relief to wash that off, so those with extremely sensitive skin might want to consider that.Also, the pads are tiny and thin. I usually have to use two to cover my entire face thoroughly. But still, they seem to be working well, and they are a great price.Highly recommended."
1,I like this toothpaste. It is made of natural herbal ingredients. My kid likes it too. At least I know that when she swallows/eats it she is not going to get sick. Nice smell.
0,I'm trying to find someone that I know that I can give this to. It did nothing for me. I have other products that I'm using now that I can tell a difference from right away this lotion did nothing.
1,"I bought this months ago. Like it a lot. I use it on my feet periodically right after I get out of the shower. I think the little bit of moisture from the shower makes this product more effective. The dry dead skin rolls right off. I use it on my elbows as well to keep the dry skin to a minimum. I know some people use it on their faces as well, however, my face is already soft, and it's also extremely sensitive. So I think this would just make my face break out. I only use it on problem areas like my feet and elbows. Good for the hands too, since I wash my hands a lot, my hands dry out. Makes the dead skin roll off instantly."
1,"Love this color and product!!!  Beautiful deeper shade of orange (not neon like) - goes with just about everything.  Very spring, summer and/or fall."
1,I love this stuff! Your face gets super clean without getting dried out (I don't know how they do that!) and the bottle lasts forever. I have had a lifelong battle with acne (I'm in my 30s and the battle rages on) and this has been a tremendous help.
1,"My story is a simple one:  I lost a nice brush I had received as a gift, had no idea how to find it again, so went to Amazon looking for a decent brush to toss in with my next order.  This one was a tad pricey, yet had so many glowing reviews.  I decided to splurge.This is about as wonderful a brush as it gets.  It's ridiculously light, but so sturdy and useful when it comes to brushing hair.  My hair is very thick, yet this glides easily through it.  It detangles hair well, yet also provides a good brushing for everyday styles.It's easy to spot how quality this brush is.  The bristles are oh so sturdy and hold up very well.Easily the best brush I've ever had."
1,Easy to use dry your hair fast easy to carried is light weight.  you can take it anywhere in that house I usually watch tv while my hair is getting dry. &#10084;
1,"I don't know anything about past or current ingredients that people are mentioning, or whether/how they're different, so don't ask me. But if it matters to you, I had the one in the orange tube, not the white one.This is a really great cleanser. The back tells you that it doesn't leave your skin parched like other soapy cleansers and it's absolutely true. This would be fantastic for dry, normal, or maybe combination skin. If your skin runs oily, I wouldn't recommend this very highly.There is oil in this, as it blatantly advertises, and it makes it smell great. This cleanser pretty much doesn't produce suds at all, which again, is great for people with dry skin. A small downside is that it also probably won't clean very deeply, so if your face is sweaty or has makeup on it, you'd probably need to pre-wash or wipe it off or something first.You can feel a very thin ""film"" of the orange oil on your face afterward, so make sure to rinse well with warm water. If that doesn't appeal to you, you might want to avoid this product. But for me, this eliminates the need for toner and moisturizer to an extent.My skin is often pretty acne-prone and this hasn't made it break out. If anything, my acne gets better when I use this cleanser. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase.Addendum:Well, I know it's natural and organic now because there's mold forming near the cap. So, yeah, beware."
1,I love this stuff and have been using it for many years.  Unfortunately they stopped carrying it in stores so for several years I had to use other brands/products for my &#34;tan in a can&#34; :o).  I took a stab at looking on Amazon and was so happy to see that they carried it!!  :o)
0,"Cheaper in Walmart.  Not great quality, lightweight cheap feeling plastic."
1,"This works, but not great. The mister is useless. I basically have to stand inside the shower for half an hour until my pores open to use this. Then I have to make multiple circular passes to get something out of my face. It seems to work the best on the forehead and around the mouth, since there is a hard surface behind the skin there. Doing the nose is extremely difficult and it really doesn't work because of the shape of your nose. Sadly, there isn't much better you can do with an at-home tool than this. It takes way too much time for the entire process of opening your pores and making passes with the tool to do this every day. Maybe once a week."
1,"OPI is my favorite nail polish.  It goes on smooth, dries fast, has  a large variety of rich colors, and it lasts (I get about 1 good week).They key to nice looking nail polish is the brush, and OPI brushes are very  good.  I am attaching a photo with the brush freshly dipped into ""Got the blues for red"", a shade of deep red with just a hint of blue that I really like.This is a great product, I recommend it.Ali Julia review"
1,"I orginally started using Obagi Clenziderm system for my moderate adult acne.  It is a great system.  After my acne got under control I researched ways to treat my acne scars and hyperpigmentation and that lead me to Obagi Nu Derm system.  I am more than pleased with the Nu Derm.  After trial and error, I realized that the system does work best when you use ALL of the Nu Derm products together.  They truly compliment each other and yield maximum results.  Now my face is clearer and glowing.  I am so shocked how quickly I have seen real results from this system.  The entire Nu Derm system is a bit pricey but it is more than worth it.  A little of all the products goes a very long way.  I highly recommend ordering each item off Amazon.  I have had no problems with expiration dates or anything that one person mentioned.  All the products are brand new and the price is far less than what they charge at the spas.  If you are thinking about trying Obagi, I recommend you visit their website and decide which line is best for you."
1,"I have used this product for the last 15 years.  It's perfect.  I prefer this over the generic store brands because this formula is a little thicker.  The generic seems a bit watery or thin, if that makes any sense.  I've had no issues with using this under makeup, primers, or even sunscreen."
1,I like this cleanser cause it doesn't dry my skin out and puts moisture into my skin.
1,"I must be in the minority here but my skin doesn't burn or tingle from this stuff.  The lotion moisterizes the skin...and that's about it.Here are the listed ingredients as per the package:water, ceteareth-20, glycerin, isodecl neopentanoate, stearyl alcohol (which dries the skin), cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexl hydroxystearate, tetrahydroxypropyl ethylenadiamine, PEG-100, stearate, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, steareth-10, retinol, glycolic acid, copper clusonate, magnesium aspatate, zinc gluconate, butyrospermum Parkii (shea butter) extract, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate coplymer, caprylyl glycol, methyl methacrylate crosspolymer, squalane, aluminum starch ocentylsuccinate, methylparaben, xanthan gum, propylparaben, polysorbate 60, polysorbate 20, fragrance, disodium EDTA, ascorbic acid, succinoglycan.  (May also contain citric acid)."
1,"I was heart broken when my favorite facial cleanser, Skinmilk, was discontinued. I'd been looking for a new cleanser ever since. Even though this cleanser is all natural (which I love!), initially, I had my doubts about this cleanser. I have combination to oily skin, and from the reviews I read, this cleanser works well on normal-to-dry skin. While washing my face with my hands, the cleanser felt oily (it doesn't lather), but once I used a wash cloth to wipe my face, I felt differently. The cleanser left my face feeling so soft and clean. And the orange scent is delicious. It doesn't leave that tight dry feeling on my face that I get when using other cleansers. What I also loved was that I didn't need to use a moisturizer. The cleanser was moisturizing enough. It leaves my face feeling great all day. In a nutshell, this cleanser is all natural, smells wonderful, leaves skin soft and clean, and moisturizes as well. There's nothing more I could want from a facial cleanser. This is my new daily cleanser."
1,"I love this color and its much more versatile than I thought it would be.  It goes on very opaque and you could probably get away with just one coat.  The color and quality is fantastic (well, its OPI, so of course its fabulous!)."
0,"Yikes! I had heard such good things about this brush and was excited to try one out. Even after removing several rows of bristles it still wanted to rip my hair out. The brush is made extremely well and has a weight to it unlike any other brush I've owned before. I've been afraid to try using it again since I don't want to risk hair breakage, but I think this would probably be a wonderful brush for someone with straight hair (my hair is wavy)."
1,"Hoping to replace a more expensive lotion with this but it just didn't work as well.  It was okay, but going forward will splurge for the brand name product."
1,"This was my first time doing a henna treatment on my hair and I must say that it was quite an experience lol. It was messy but worth it  (the only down fall). With this product a lot of people will need to keep in mind that adding other stuff will make it work better. I added cinnamon, coconut oil, vitamin e oil, castor oil for moisture and and honey (aids in moisture and color) I added tea and apple cider vinegar as an acid (i will not add the tea next time) the tea got everywhere and took me forever to rinse out. I left it in overnight and rinsed out the next day and did a deep condition for about 4 hours. Overall my hair is so soft, easier to detangle. I did notice a color change my hair is very dark (kinky hair) so it did have a purple tint in bright light...I will purchase again and play with other ingredients such as the hibiscus..."
1,"I love this serum. It keeps your skin feeling soft and silky. I have been using this serum for several years and would hate to be without it. I prefer the fragrance free serum but have had no problems using the regular scented formula. A little goes a long way and I would say the bottle last close to a month using it once to twice a day. I have tried expensive formulas from the makeup counters of department stores and have never found a moisturizer that was better. It reminds me of a product that was out years ago named, Stop Signs, it was $80 a bottle back in the 1990s and this product is just as good at a lot better price. I plan to keep using this product and hope Olay keeps it on the market!"
1,"I haven't noticed any ""firming"" yet BUT as a scented  body moisturizer, this product is the best one I've ever used and I've tried many.he scent is lovely and enables layering with other Amaging Grace products which makes the scent last longer.I am now a devotee and this won't be my last purchase of the Amazing Grace Firming Body Emulsion lotion."
1,This product is okay.  You can't really remove the regular nail polish.  This product only removes an organic nail polish.
1,"Love Cetaphil!  Used to spend big bucks on those fancy dancy products at the dept. store.  Tried this at the recommendation of a dermatologist who told me all that I really wanted was a good moisturizer....that a prescription would be needed by those companies if they lived up to their claims.....I've been using Cetaphil ever since....also the cleanser.You just can't go wrong.  It's  non -greasy, keeps your skin moist all day....and before you go to bed, after washing your face, all night!  It can be used all over your body actually:  those elbows!I get told all the time that I look much younger than I am, and also that my skin is beautiful....well, I dunno about all that, but any help I get is because of Cetaphil.  I also like bare minerals radiance (slight shimmer) and Nars for some of their liquids (blushes) that I put on to make my skin have a dewy look."
1,Have used this product for about 30 years.Does very well. Fast and easy. I havewhite eyebrows so it's a must. ThankHeaven it's here!!
1,"I have had a lifelong struggle with nail biting. Even during times that I managed not to bite my nails, I was constantly checking them for the smallest snag or imperfection. Throughout my life I tried several different things to break the patterns, including other brands of paint-on stuff that tastes bad. Or so I thought.Well, Mavala is in a whole new realm of bad. The most hardened, obsessed nail-biter will recoil in horror at the taste. If your habit really stems from an underlying issue like OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder), then you may find it doesn't cure the obsessing about irregularities in your nails, but it very likely will cure the biting itself. It's just that nasty tasting. Since applying it, I no longer bite my nails.And yes, if you touch your mouth, you floss your teeth, you eat with your hands, etc. you're going to taste it sometimes. It's worth it til you've broken the worst of the pattern. It's also economical -- applied over dry or polished nails and cuticles, it will last days. And for any guys who may be concerned, it isn't as shiny as a typical clear nail polish, but it does have some shine to it. You can take a bit of a cloth and dab at it while it's drying to make the shine less noticeable if that's a concern.I'm very happy. I wish I would have discovered this 35+ years ago. It would have saved me from a lot of self-consciousness and probably a few colds."
0,"I've been using ceramic brushes for years, so I know they get very hot, but this one does not have a cap at the top, so if you hit yourself anywhere on the face or scalp, you will most definitely burn yourself, and it may scar you.  Just a warning to anyone who is considering buying this brush.  I've thrown mine out after burning myself several times in the last few weeks.  Every other ceramic brush I've owned has had a cap at the top to protect from this, but apparently not this brand."
1,I love Mrs. Meyers products! The honeysuckle scent is my favorite so far. These are the only hand soaps I have used that don't dry my hands.
1,I curl my hair a lot so these are super useful for holding each curl until the end and to section out my hair. I had imagined they would have been larger like the salon type I see used but honestly I am glad they are small. This is so convenient for holding each curl and I like to part my hair into several small sections rather than three or four large ones when styling my hair. Its time consuming but these help the curls stay curly for a longer time. My hair does not curl well and by the time I finish one side of my head the others losing curl. I have only used these a few times but I put them in and sprayed my hair once I was done and my hair lasted a lot longer than normal!
1,"This is the best sunscreen we have found! My daughter goes to a summer day camp that does not reapply sunscreen. We have been using this based on a friends recommendation. She did not get burned once this whole summer (and we live in South Texas). This sunscreen is on the pricey side, but is well worth it. We will definitely continue to use it."
1,If you do your own hair like me this is an absolute must have. I have ear length hair that is cut into a short bob so I must maintain the curls in the back. My old cheapie mirror was a waste I would have to contort my body to even get a good look at the back of my hair. This mirror is wide enough for the job and since having it I have never been able to see the whole back of my hair. Now that I can I don't have to make blind judgement calls. I love it!
1,"I love the L'Oreal Visible lift makeup, it goes on smooth, lasts throughout the day, and has a very light weight feel on the skin. I think it's actually making my complexion better. It was a great price and free shipping from this seller. I would definitely recommend to any age group or complexion type."
1,"I have these in LARGE to use as bunion relief, they tend to irritate and chafe my toes a bit after prolonged use but I've found that if I apply talcum powder frequently PROBLEM SOLVED. The bunion relief is quite minimum but better than nothing. For lasting relief you may want to try the Bunion Aid Hinged Splint for prolonged use, like I will soon. Once I've had it a while I will post a review in the hopes of guiding others in their search of pain relief. Hope this helps."
1,"Not a permanent fix, but if you leave it on all night  and take it off in the a.m. the lines will be gone until the following evening.  Comes off easily in the shower. If you don't put it on exactly in the right place, you may wind up with a line or  two where you didn't have them before, but don't get scared, because they disappear.  Also, although they're not transparent (I'd give another star for that), they're a tan color, (think brown paper bag), it doesn't look too bad. I've already given samples to friends who love it."
1,As soon as I finish this I need to order more. They really do give the lines a break through the night. I wear them overnight.
1,"Absolutely, a miracle nail cream from Barielle. Barielle's reputation stems from this outstanding nail strengthening cream that originally was created to condition the hooves of thoroughbred racehorses; the side affect being that the groomers also developed beautifully strong, peel and split free nails. My nails have always been prone to peeling and breakage. Ultimately, I made matters worse by opting to wear acrylic nails on and off in the past to cover up these issues. Thankfully, that craze is long over; and my nails have benefited ever since by using Barielle. Works well withBarielle Natural Nail Camouflage, .5 fl oz (14.8 ml)"
1,"Completely satisfied. Didn't even realize I was ordering the 'heavy weight' model, but I'm so glad I did because that was the exact reason I was ordering another denman; because the handle on my previous one had broken off. Although this model is a little heavier than the regular 9-row denman it is well worth it if you have really thick, curly, Afro textured hair. I often use my denman on wet hair which clumps my curls together, putting significant more strain on the brush. This brush is holding up well. Highly recommend."
1,"I'm almost out of this shampoo and plan to order more.  It's very light/liquidy, but I like how well it lathers for a sulfate-free shampoo and think it penetrates to the scalp really well.  It has a light citrus scent - I don't really enjoy its smell but I don't dislike it either.  I've used the volumizing version of this shampoo and prefer this version.  The conditioner is also very light.  I have extremely fine/thin highlighted hair and I like how this shampoo doesn't leave any residue (unlike so many of the other natural sulfate-free shampoos I've tried).  The neem is great for your scalp and this shampoo feels good on your scalp when you shampoo.  I always use this when my scalp feels itchy or dry and it feels better after one use."
1,I use this for my lashes and eyebrows.  It saves me a lot of $$$ now that I can do it myself.  It is pretty easy to use.  Be careful if you use it on your eyes. I use a Q-tip as a brush when I do my eyelashes.
1,"I have oily skin and breaks out easily. I've been using this cream every night for about for a month. It doesn't make my face shinier in the morning, instead it makes my skin on my face and neck plumper & firmer."
1,Was given as a gift to a teen. She loves it. This is normally a good product. I'm sure it will perform as described although I haven't spoken to her since she received it. I will post an update future.
0,"I DID NOT like this make up at all.  It made my skin tone look orange - I used the lightest shade available because I am fair skinned but it still turned orange on me!  It also has a shiny glittery effect on the skin that I hate.  I have to agree with some other reviews that it does not cover flaws well either and does not stay on well for lasting coverage.  I will stick with my tried and true liquid brand that has pretty much always served me well.  I only tried the starter kit because I had heard so much great hype for this product, however, I was greatly disappointed in the performance and look of this make up.This stuff just looked like ""glittery powder"" on my face and nothing more. As far as that make-up artist saying you needed ""good skin"" to use this product I am 44 and I have no wrinkles or bad spots on my face, no pimples or rough dry skin, etc. and it still looked terrible on me.  I see a lot of people seem to think this make-up is ""all that,"" and I'm glad it worked for them but I sure didn't like it. I'll never use it or anything similar to it again.  I would suggest going to Wal-Mart or your local drug store and purchasing a similar product by L'Oreal, Maybelline and several other make-up companies which now offer a similar product at half the price of this junk or less which I am told works just as well for those who like a ""loose powder"" type foundation."
1,"First I purchased a very similar item but that did not have the on and off switch up front. I am glad that I returned that and ordered this instead. Also, the rollers are great but I dont use the clips hot rather cold eliminating the clipmarks..."
1,This product is awesome. I have been using Obagi cleansing and day lotion for 5 years. At 65 years old I continue to get compliments on the great complexion Obagi has given me. I specially like that it has sun block. Go with this one. Its topical and feels great.
1,"Great! Doesn't leave residues! Have a great smell, doesn't dry out the skin, leaves the skin between dry and moisture! Btw I have asian skin"
1,This stuff is very thick and creamy. Not sure if it helps with wrinkles but it does leave the skin clean and soft. But it is so thick it comes out in a glob and you have to rub it between your fingers to cream it up before applying it
1,"First off, this stuff smells amazing! Nothing like the chemically lemon scent a lot of products have, this one genuinely smells like the fruit and it's lovely and refreshing. Also, despite the tub being so small it lasts forever! I think I've had mine for at least a few months and there's still plenty left.Now, my cuticles aren't horrible, but I live in a part of Texas where the air is dry and the city environment can really wear on your skin. If I go even 2-3 days without some kind of moisture on my hands my cuticles get dry and cracked, and it's awful. This cuticle cream does a great job at moisturizing and KEEPING them that way for a while. I really only have to apply it once a day and it'll last a good 24 hours if not longer. My nails look neater and cleaner since using this, and my hands feel really soft too.Now for the cons. It's not so great if you want to remove thick cuticles completely. I had a couple that I had to pick at with other nails to get them to come off completely which is much different from my other cuticle oil that only took a bit of rubbing to get my free hanging cuticle off. Second, it doesn't absorb very fast into your skin. I need to either rub the excess around like a hand cream or kind of wipe it off when I'm done otherwise everything I touch has a sticky greasy feeling. It wasn't fun when I ruined my freshly styled hair when I ran my hands through it a while after using this.In all, I think it's a great product, but if you need something heavy duty, look elsewhere. I think this is more suited as a maintenance treatment for cuticles than it is for helping remove frayed or overgrown cuticles. I'd recommend Essie's cuticle oil if you need a stronger one."
1,I see some of these reviews talking about rosemary and lavender.The honey mango scent is not lavender rosemary. Its fruity and sweet smelling. I've been using this for yrs and I love it. Good lather. Natural ingredients. Bottle lasts a while.
1,Very wonderful and beautiful blush.  Makes your cheek orgasmic glowing pink.  This is the only blush i have found to look good on me.
1,The powder that arrives in the small container can be blended with other powders or used on its own as a cheek color. The effect is more sun kissed blush than pasted on blush. It is superior in blendability and is almost essential when using the Bare Escentual products. ESCAPE is the color you want if you need a sun kissed look. It reminds me of escaping to the beach and coming home with a rozy glow. The color is powdery rose and makes cheeks look radiant. You will look especially healthy in this makeup and your natural radiance will be enhanced.~The Rebecca Review
1,"This lotion in okay, not greasy, not very moisturising either.I bought it after reading the benefits of including glycolic acid in my skin care regimen, it was intended for my face. I have not used it for that long on my face, as I use Tretinoin most evenings. When I did use it, it was somewhat sticky, stung a bit, and I did not notice much in terms of effect or benefit from it. I did not break out, but it did not help with the acne and other sundry bumps on my face.However, I had these small bumps, in the fold behind my knees. I read on Amazon that this lotion could help, and indeed it has, within about 5 days the area has been completely cleared of the bumps.I will continue to use it all over my body, and face, whenever I am taking a break from Tretinoin."
1,"If you are a very fair skinned, fair haired blonde, there are not many shades to choose from which don't look garish in real light. This product is awesome. I love the shade...it's a universally flattering peachy-pink with very tiny almost imperceptible light reflecting bits (I'm afraid to say glitter because that would give the wrong impression). It's gorgeous. I also have the multi-stick also in Orgasm and it is lovely too, with a slightly more &#34;dewey&#34; look (the powder is more matte). Gorgeous color for ladies with fair skin/complexion. The picture does not do it justice. Oh, and, ummm, I'm told it actually IS named appropriately!"
1,"In our part of the mid Atlantic, the last warm days of the year have brought out new swarms of brown marmorated stink bugs. Even though we try not to agitate them, efforts to redefine the boundary between human and insect space invariably result in the discharge of the odor that gives them their sobriquet.Clean Day is very effective at cutting the stink bug odor. Its own scent is pleasant without being overpowering.Liquid hand soap may be a commodity item, but your own peace of mind isn't. This is our go-to for eliminating the unfortunate outcomes of human-stink bug encounters!"
1,"I have been training for a half marathon and have been sweating profusely. I have long hair as well, so as a result I have been breaking out on my back. I have used this once a day and have only seen a slight improvement. I will try to use it twice a day to see if my back acne will improve. Note that this soap does over dry the skin, so be sure to use a moisturizer after use."
1,"My hands are very sensitive to soap. For some reason this dish soap doesn't cause me any trouble? I love it! My father-in-law, also has sensitive hands, and he took a bottle home with him the last time he visited. I would recommend this to anyone, who has sensitive skin or is just watching out for the environment. On top of that, I think it works great!"
1,"Meant as a toner pre-shaving, effectively cleans the face. Smells like chemistry - which is sad. Most of the stuff in this segment has some kind of plant-based ingredient list that smells delicious (as opposed to like solvent). That said, does a great job getting the grease and dead skin off of your face. Whereas I can't specifically complain about it - I'm going to try something else next time around."
1,"Being tired of using heavy liquid foundations and with all the hype I ordered the starter kit over a year ago and mastered the technique of buffing. Buffing? Maybe because it contains bismuth oxy as a mineral ingredient? Anyways, It worked well for me for a while until a few months later I began breaking out into random cystic acne - this has never happened to me before. Painful big deep bumps you cannot try to pick or pop which can last up to months on your face and even if left alone will scar. My 30 year old skin is combination but gets dry in the winter and a tad oily in summer months with occasional breakouts. This mineral powder foundation seemed to cause further and more frequent breakouts sometimes daily. It could be an ingredient in this foundation caused this but I will never know for sure. Yes I have made the mistake of sleeping in my makeup and I do not recommend it as it will cause breakouts. The other issue is that I was unable to use cream or gel blushes with this makeup I was forced to stick to powder otherwise it would not blend naturally. Most recently I have noticed after wearing this makeup for a few hours my face appeared blotchy, unneven and my pores appeared larger! The blotchiness I suspect was due to the BE rubbing off easily. I may have looked pretty from afar but when you got up close in my face, what a mess! Sadly, I am searching for new makeup that my skin can handle, maybe a tinted moisturizer. Bummer. Does anyone want my leftovers? LOL."
1,"This toner is awesome. It's gentle on my sensitive/dry skin, smells great, cleans well without drying out my skin and feels lovely. One bottle has lasted me forever so it's definitely worth it!"
1,I heard the excitement about Alpha Hydroxy from my favorite entertainment/health info show of Dr. Oz. I bought both the clearm and the lotion.  The lotion is great.  I think I like it!!
1,"Product much lighter and thicker than I would have liked; I do not see any ""rose"" in it.  It is more of a beige, and no discernible moisturizers."
1,"This is a great option for body wash if you are trying to go all-natural in your toiletries/cosmetics.  The product contains no sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates, and no parabens.  It has a nice thick consistency that sticks to your wash cloth, sponge, (or hand!), and it lathers up nicely.  The scent is nice - not fantastic, but pleasant enough."
0,"I didn't really like this. I have long, thick hair that has a very slight wave to it. Normally, after washing my hair, I blow-dry it and then either flat-iron it to make it sleek and glossy, or occasionally I take a curling iron to it. Often I do not blow-dry my hair completely, and pockets of it are very slightly damp. I was hoping I could use this hot air brush to not only dry those pockets of slightly damp hair, but also give the ends of my hair a little flip (and thus replace the flat-iron or curling iron). This hot air brush accomplished neither task. I would probably have had to spend upwards of twenty minutes to get this brush to dry my (slightly) damp hair. It also did not do anything in the way of adding a curl or even a flip to the ends of my hair, even after multiple, prolonged attempts. The hot air is not really hot enough to have any effect on thick or coarse hair. The only plus side is that it appeared to make my hair feel slightly softer.The brush also does not rotate, despite what the box and the description says. Maybe I got a defective product, but it did not rotate for me. Even if it had, I don't think that would've helped."
1,Another great tool for blowouts and everyday brushing. It gently removes tangles without pulling out all your hair. Highly recommend!!
1,"This iron heats quickly and does a great job smoothing. Mine let's you set your own heat settings and the higher settings are indeed very hot, good for curly hair.I now have the hot tools irons in all sizes. I first bought the 1"" and loved it and have slowly added to my collection, so that I can get different looks. I have naturally tight curls, that are unruly. I use the 1 1/2"" when I want an almost straight look, but want the sides to go back a bit, and the back to have some really big loose curls / waves. I use the 1 1/4 inch to get the Jessica Simpson / Daisy Duke look. I use the 1"" for medium size loose curls (Easy to shake out), and the smaller size for tight curls or corkscrew curls.I find the 1 1/2"" to be faster than using a straightener, and can get an almost straight look with it but add a bit of large curls if that is what I am going for. I use the 1 1/4"" the most (more on a daily basis). It is good for Medium to long hair. Note: the two inch, for me, is very uncomfortable and awkward to use. I have burnt my ear twice, and the curls almost always fall out. That is the only one I regret buying."
1,"This is definitely my new favorite OPI polish! I've been looking for a nice grey color for ages, and this one is great!It even looked good after only one coat!!"
1,"With two coats of Acquarella, it takes 5 minutes to remove the polish off each hand, which isn't too bad.  However, if you have on several coats, it just takes too long.  I quickly swipe each fingernail before I begin removal so that the remover has time to soak in, which does help a lot.Karma Organic Tea Tree Nail Polish Removerworks faster for me, but this isn't ideal for using Acquarella, because the oils can interfere with Acquarella adhering to the nail.  I am still new with using all these products, so I haven't yet reached my own verdict.  For now, I use Karma if I have on several Acquarella coats, but before polishing with Acquarella, I lightly buff my nails and then I swipe each with the Acquarella remover and then rinse before polishing."
1,"I wish I could give this product a 4.5 star review. I became extremely allergic to chemical dyes and products while working as a cosmetologist about 3 years ago. In turn, I have tried to remove all chemical products from my regimen.One very important accessory for women (and men alike) is their hair. My allergic reactions would not allow me to keep on using my chemical colors. I NEEDED to get something on my hair, which is naturally a light mousy brownish color. Not a great mix for my snow-white skin tone. I happened to purchase this product at a local supplements store in my neighborhood. I played it safe, and started with a nice and plain dark brown.Let's just be blunt here, it is a hard, labor intensive, messy, gritty process. Some do not enjoy the smell of henna, as for myself, I enjoy it. Smells like alfalfa hay (childhood memories.) I highly recommend getting a brave friend to help you out here. It makes life SO much easier.After following the instructions, and making my own tweeks, I let it sit on overnight. I do believe that the longer it stays on, the deeper the color. I believe this because of my many, many trial and errors. I have not had the heart to leave it on that long again, as I know the pain that awaits. Once I washed it out (TIP FOR WASHING OUT: FILL BATHTUB UP AND DUNK YOUR HEAD IN AS MANY TIMES AS NEEDED TO LOOSEN THE HENNA. WASH OUT FULLY IN SHOWER.) and dried, I was very VERY pleasantly surprised. I have been even happier since switching over to the Mahogany mix. I love the depth of color it gives my hair, its an indescribable glow. Only henna users will understand.As for the 4 (4.5) star review, Rainbow is the only henna I have ever used. I do love the results, but I intend to try a different brand to see if there is a real difference. I will report back with my findings. All in all, I do recommend Rainbow Henna. Your hair will thank you!"
1,I wont use anything else as a toner now. It smells amazing. There is no use in paying more for a fancy toner. This stuff is old school and legit.
1,"I had been looking for a reasonably priced SPF 30 zinc oxide based sunscreen for quite a while. They are very difficult to find in stores- most zinc oxide based sunscreens in the local drug store are only SPF 15. This sunscreen is super light, effective, and doesn't cause any trouble for my sensitive and acne-prone skin. It does definitely have a bit of a 'sunscreen smell,' but that doesn't bother me at all. I will definitely reorder."
1,"Recommended.I have used this to set my L'oreal True Match liquid makeup for years. I have fairly pale skin, and this is the only powder I've found to match my skin tone. Most powders have a tendency to run pink, and I have decidedly warm undertones, so I was pleasantly pleased to find a powder that won't turn my face orange. I have also used CoverGirl's similar powder foundation, which runs slightly more pink than this (though I'd probably classify it more neutral...), and I have a tendency to buy whichever one's cheaper at the drug store. I do not, however, like the powder puff that comes with this product. It's the thin, flat, cloth-type thing that might work better for some people but cakes the powder over my foundation. Whenever I purchase this powder, I use my own face brush to apply it."
1,"I'm prone to yeast infections, so I try to avoid tampons, which can be irritating.  I've tried two different brands of menstrual cups, both of which were a challenge to remove!  With Softcup, they're super easy to insert and remove.  And while they're not reusable like menstrual cups, they hold just as much and, frankly, I don't want to bother having to wash one.  The fact that they're disposable make them really convenient.  Once they're in, I can't feel them at all, and they don't press on my urethra like menstrual cups do, so it's no problem to pee with them in.  I've worn these on an off for years and have never had any problems with leaking either."
0,I wanted something to make my blue eyes POP and this is blue on the wand (as others have stated) but looks black on my lashes.  I don't know if maybe it's blue under a special kind of light but maybe this isn't for dark eyelashes?  I couldn't see any blue on mine..
1,There is not much to say about cotton swaps - they work. You can do lots of things with them! The price for these is good.
0,"I thought this would be a good polish from the reviews, but its not. I had to put on several coats and it still didn't look right. I love Essie polish just not this one."
1,"Very nice dark teal (dark blue-green color)!  Got lots of compliments.  I normally don't use blue nail polish, but this shade is very nice and great for fall/winter seasons."
1,"I like a more natural/understated look for my eyes.  I have OK lashes and this product does just what I need it to do -- darken and thicken my lashes in a natural look.  The brush is perfect.  I wear contacts & have sensitive eyes (allergies), but this product did not bother me at all.  It comes off nicely."
1,"I love this product!  I've been using Oil of Olay since I was a teenager and dinosaurs roamed the earth. Oil of Olay has consistently been a great product all that time. But, my Oil of Olay disappeared from my area, so I bought this to try. I love it. It goes on smooth and creamy, not oily. It is unscented. Only one squirt is all you need to keep your face nourished and comfortable all day."
1,"Bought this to use at the pool. I like that it's thin. I would say the absorbency is the same as a regular thick towel (not moreso, but it's super thin so I'm still a fan). I have loads of long hair, and I still find this towel a bit too big. It's not quite big enough for a full body towel, so I wish it were smaller or bigger, and less in between. Thought about trying a hair turban, but I suspect they're not as user-friendly (especially for tons of hair) as they appear.But overall I'm pretty happy with it. Again, love the light, thiness. Perfect for the gym."
1,"I had horrible eczema on both arms for over a week. It was bad my skin burned in some spots. I went to the Dermatologist and was given a prescription cream. The cream did NOTHING. After another week of this crud on my arms I spotted the Aveeno I had in my cupboard. I thought, ""Why not?"" I applied it after showering at night twice and on day three ALL of the dry spots were gone. I love Aveeno products and no I was not paid to write this. I am a life fan now."
1,I use this on my daughters hair. Her hair is curly 3b. After washing her mid-back length hair she gets a lot of shrinkage and loss of curl after it dries. This doesn't help with the shrinkage but it does help retain the curl. Her hair is soft and smells great.
1,I am a long time fan of Philosophy. This scent is light and moisturizes well. Don't see any results from the &#34;firming&#34; bit but I don't buy it for that reason. Great light floral scent for all ages.
0,"After using their previous oil control product called Finishes Mattifying Cleanser and loving it, they discontinued it and replaced it with this. I was sadly disappointed, it did not deliver any shine control and actually seems to make my pores larger.I can't attest to the blemish fighting power since I hardly get any in the first place. I've stocked up on the previous product which I find at Big Lots until I can find a new product that actually controls shine or they bring back the previous product."
1,We absolutely love this soap. It has the most wonderful sandalwood fragrance. Buying a case at a time also lowers the cost.
0,This product does come with warnings and you should heed them.  I used it and noticed immediately that my skin did not like it.  It probably is a great product but not on my skin.
1,"This is a good proudct,packed well and delivered on time ...I would certainly buy from this seller again.  I suggest tryng one thing in the Alpha Hydrox brand, this way ou will know if it is good for your skin."
1,"I buy this in bulk because we use it every day. It's well worth the price because a little goes a long way and it really works. I have very healthy, super soft skin because of it."
1,"If your skin is sensitive, this is product for you. It's fragrance free and very gentle. I've been using it for years and am very pleased with the results."
0,"this one i guess is the cheaper version of derma e products. it is got too much fragrance, and is very sticky, they have some better products to offer"
0,"Doesn't smell like coconuts. Smells very synthetic, nauseatingly sweet and plasticky. Not at all how I imagined it would be. Can't recommend this one, not even for teens."
1,"I tend to scrunch up in between my eyes when I listen intently, and if unchecked can begin to get permanent lines.  By wearing these every night (and I only use one triangle), it relaxes those muscles while I sleep so that they don't get &#34;stuck&#34; in that worried look.  I've been using for years, and I really do notice a difference if I run out and don't use for a few nights.  Way better than Botox."
1,"This is not working for me personally . My husband uses it+i likes it. I used  when rinsing my hair sometimes. i stopped!!  its hardy heavy brush just is not for regular use for my more very fragile transiting to natural hair.  although i am gentle with my hair, it still ripped my hair out but that bc my hair is  very weak.  over all great quality and for normal healthy hair"
1,"Been a severe psoriasis sufferer for more than 20 years. This is the ONLY bath soap I have found that does not sting - not ever! I've tried some of the other Aveenos, and some of them do sting, but not this one. And it lathers up really good and moisterizes. Can't go wrong with this one!!!"
1,I love these colored mascaras! This particular one is a very pretty vibrant blue. The only problem is you need a lot of coats to make it really show.
1,"Best hand cream I've ever used, and I NEVER use hand cream. This year, I got a puppy and with it comes a lot of mess and handwashing. Top if off with my working in the food industry + new York winters and you've got dry, painful hands. I tried many MANY different creams at a drug store one day - 2 hours worth of searching from the least to most expensive creams lead me to this one. It has a light leather smell, so definitely good for men also (I like the smell of leather, so Im a big fan, even as a lady). I put it on after Ive washed my hands and it is thick, rich, and I enjoy massaging it into my knuckles. Once it's on, it doenst leave a sticky or greasy film, just lovely moisture and no dryess. I have a mini tube in my handbag, large pump at the office, an 1in my home. I like the stuff to say the least!"
0,"I am not trying to make advertise for the Mary Kay one I was just using it before I bought this Maybelline branded one,this one can do nothing with my waterproof Eye mascara also this bottle is so small,can be only used as a trave sized item!!"
1,"I have very fair, translucent skin and have always had issues with dark circles under my eyes.  I've used every concealer out there, but most only further exaggerate the dark circles and worsen the appearance of bags.  The good thing about this concealer is that it's extremely affordable and the yellow really does help neutralize the appearance of blue and purple veins under the eyes.  The bad news is that it appears cakey when applied under powdered mineral makeup, giving a chalk-like appearance.  This occurs even when the concealer is applied VERY lightly.  If you use a liquid makeup, this will probably not be an issue.  With other forms of makeup, it might not blend as well as you would like.  I still find it does a better job than the other concealers, so I still use a small amount of this and take some considerable time blending it with my foundation."
1,"The choice of having rougher and smoother side is perfect for all skin types. The size is perfect. They dry fast, just wish there were multiples in each pack."
1,"I have just recently been struggling from acne because of my birth control. After i started taking the depo shot i began breaking out bad around my chin and jaw line (sign of hormonal acne). So i began my search, started getting facials, and began my battle. After about 9 months, I found the PERFECT system!!In the morning: Use pca blemish control bar (make sure you rub it in good so you have a thick foam and leave on for the FULL 2 mins!)-Follow with obagi clenzaderm toner (it burns like hell and may dry you out at first but stick through it!)- ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS use a moisturizer! many people with oil skin think they can skip the moisturizer NO! Not using moisturizer only tricks your skin into thinking it's dry and it will produce MORE oils! for the day time i prefer mac oil control moisturizer it also has spf in it.In the evening: cleanse with pca bpo cleanser. It's important to alternate between these two cleansers so your skin doesn't build up a tolerance to the acne medication.-Follow with the obagi clenzaderm toner again.- Then use pca acne spot treatment cream if you have any little monsters under your skin.- Finally, use pca clearskin moisturizer. This is a nice thick moisturizer that's non greasy and will keep your skin from getting dry or peeling from the acne medication and it also helps the healing process.This has been the perfect balance of acne treatments, my blackheads on my nose have vanished, and i have no more cystic acne along my jaw line or chin! This has been a life saver with the combination of BPO, salycilic acid, and naturally healing ingredients, it really is the perfect combination!"
1,"Hey I love this stuff... I bought it unseen based upon reviews because I was terribly desparate to find an acceptable replacement for my phenomenal private salon brand concealor. That product was unbelievable and lasted forever but cost 85 bucks a pop!!!! This turned out to be almost as good...it isn't as thick as my original product, but it was much less draggy to apply. It covers much better than all store bought products ive encountered and the big bonus is that it diminishes the appearance of dark spots when u keep applying it to an area...like acne scars... and it doesn't flare up my acne. Also it doesn't rub off easily like cheap oil based products...powder sets this beautifully. I have been using this in the light shade for about 7 months and its still almost full.I just purchased this for my mom for mother's day...I used it on her black eye that she got from an overenthusiastic toddler and she was really impressed and asked to have her undereyes touched up as well as an age spot... needless to say she wanted to take this stuff home. Now she will have her own and I will continue to purchase this product for us both!Update on my shipping...I checked on amazon the day my product was estimated to arrive and the status showed it had been delivered several days earlier. This was not the case and clearly was a problem having to do with my postal service... I emailed the seller and the next day they sent out a replacement which I got before mother's day-thankfully-and it was sent registered mail this time. I feel bad that the postal service caused them to lose product and money, but it should work out in the long run because I'll continue to order from them due to their great service and quality skin care items! Great customer service, guys!"
1,"I thought I was buying one without alcohol, it appears as though they have fixed the picture. Before it was the yellow label alcohol free version. Was sent the blue bottle, but like I said it is fixed now. Returns were easy."
0,"I've tried to work with this soap for a year and am finally ready to donate it out. It was a gift and is almost full. It has a nice scent.I really tried to like this product. It boasts having multiple uses, but it just isn't plausible for me personally.It feels really weird on skin. I don't like the feeling (diluted or full strength), and I honestly can't tell if it cleans or not. I feel like I have to scrub very hard. Diluted seems to not lather at all or feel clean as I'm using it, and full strength lathers well.It's too drying for AA coily 3/4 hair (diluted).I don't think it cleans well enough as a all purpose cleaner for the bathroom (diluted or full strength).I am no way putting soap in my mouth to use as a toothpaste.There's probably a hundred more uses I could try, but those are the only ones I wanted to consider using it for. It's useless to me and I'm glad it was a gift. I would not purchase and honestly feel this product is a bit over-hyped. There are better natural options out there if you need a beauty soap."
1,I have been using this product for years and can't give it enough praise.  My concern with it is that it came in international packaging not the usual packaging.  I wonder how long it has been on he shelf because philosophy only has a 2 year shelf life and I wonder how long it has been since the product was made.
1,Works well and easy to use!
1,"I use this mascara for the hard to reach places like the back of my upper lashes and the corners of my eyelashes. I still use my favorite mascara for the rest of my lashes, but this is fantistic for getting full coverage. I always keep some on hand!"
1,"This  blush is VERY pretty. I included that it is a great color for women of color because sometimes we look at a color and it looks too bright, too pink,  etc for our skin. This blush is very pretty and  I am NW45 in MAC (hope that helps).  You only need a little because it is HIGHLY pigmented, but it looks great! It is also buildable if you want to intensify your look. Overall, NARS makes great products and this color blush is good for all skin tones! Try it!"
1,this color... it is pinkish very girly color. It can be easily combined with other pinks of the brand or oranges. I love ESSIE
0,"I usually use the Sedu clipless curling iron and love it but wanted to see if this would be faster. My hair curls easily and it's fine. Well, this took FOREVER!! I swear I was at it for over an hour at least both times.. I followed complete instructions twice and both times it took forever. GOD BLESS my Sedu. Anyway, guess what kind of curls I got with the Caruso? No curls! just nothing. Some of the hair had a very slight, strangely shaped curl. I did NOT over saturate curlers or under saturate. Left them in until dry etc. I do NOT understand all the raving reviews. They must be getting paid or something. Who has three hours to get ready in the morning? Not me."
1,Only been using this for 5 days and I can already tell a huge difference! My nails are always peeling and bend like paper right now my nails are real hard and have actually grown a tiny bit. I know that may sound funny to someone who doesn't have problem nails. If your like me any growth is noticeable!! I hope this keeps working the way it has.
0,"This stuff was expensive and didn't absorb with a darn. No mater how little I used or how much I tried to rub/pat it into my skin, there was a greasy layer on my skin. When I woke up in the morning, my skin wasn't particularly soft or hydrated. It has an &#34;old lady&#34; scent and just seemed very &#34;old school&#34; to me., Like something my grandmother would use. There are better products out there for my money."
0,"This stuff is terrible.  It makes my skin break out because it leaves a waxy residue on your face after you wash it off that clogs my pores.  Also, the ""microbeads"" are a joke - you can barely tell they're there and they don't help exfoliate at all.  Worst of all is that this scrub is like a gel, and I prefer scrubs that are like a cream.  To top it off, it does not ""brighten"" or even out my skin tone at all.  I would not buy this garbage again."
1,"I've been using Smile's Prid for nearly 20 years, ever since I stumbled across a few cans of it on the shelf of a local drug store. The packaging looked like something from 1899, so of course I was intrigued. I used it on an infected bug bite overnight by putting some on the wound and covering it with a band-aid, and the next morning was pleased to discover it had worked like a charm. It's created for small boils and other wounds which have pus that needs to be drawn out; it's much safer to let the infection come out on its own with Prid than it is to squeeze the wound. Prid draws the stuff out within a few hours, never stings, and a single can lasts forever. The consistency and color is a little off-putting, but it works so well that appearance doesn't matter. Just make sure you follow directions, and use with a bandage so the Prid doesn't get on your clothes.The formula changed a few years ago to be ""homeopathic"" and it works just as well as the old formula did.  The only difference appears to be in the consistency of the salve."
0,"I have fine, straight hair down to my armpits. I wanted to love this brush because it had great reviews. However, I tried a couple times and each time it just got stuck and twisted in my hair. I thought I was going to have to cut it out once!  If you have shorter, thicker hair I could see how this could work. It just depends on your hair type I suppose."
1,This shampoo is AMAZING!!!  All natural and no harsh chemicals in it. When using this shampoo you don't even need conditioner.  Just buy it already!  Another shampoo you might want to check out that is also wonderful and all natural is NaturOli.  Just search for it in amazon in All Departments.  You won't be disappointed.
1,Obagi is a permanent part of my daily routine.  This is an important part to keeping my skin glowing and smooth.
1,"Thick, rich and creamy, almost resembling custard, this lotion not only gives an intense and healing comfort to the skin but the scent is pure heaven! I also adore the fact that the brand is holistic and cares about animals, no cruel testing and it uses pure plants and botanicals to produce a truly nourishing product.Brimming with goodies such as aloe, sunflower, coconut, safflower, sesame, babasu oils, vitamins E and A, organic calendula and chamomile and a yummy burst of vanilla, this lotion hydrates all day and well into the night. The scent was the best part of it, slightly smoky at first, little plasticky ( I know it sounds weird) it mellows into a cake like aroma within minutes of putting it on, and I swear I could smell the vanilla bean all day long. It was quite an experience to smell like a cupcake until the nightly shower, I might have to stock up since the bottles are small but I can't seem to get enough of it. I skip wearing perfume the days when I use this so that I can enjoy the strong, delicious scent exuding from the skin. This brand has a few other fragrances that I want to try, but first I have to satisfy my vanilla craving which are being fueled every time I wear this.Also this lotion has no water in it, making it really luxurious and very emollient, great for anyone with dry skin who likes scented lotions. Lack of preservatives is also a plus, something I pay more attention to as I get older and wiser  : )- Kasia S."
1,I've looked all over for this product in town with no luck. All I wanted was plain old fashioned clay. Well I found it on Amazon. Thanks!  Products works as advertised
1,"Love this moisturizer if you have oily skin.  For the price, it rocks. It won't clear up skin on it's own, but protects skin and helps any other acne program."
1,"I believe some people simply are not applying this product correctly. I am 53 years old and have severely sun damaged skin. I'm talking red to purple huge blotches down each side of my neck (like a giant birth mark) sensitive skin, roseacea and allergies. This product is the only one out of 100s I have tried over the years that does cover it up! Watch QVC and see how they apply it... lightly in circular motions. You can get any amount of coverage you desire. I use the med shade, BE blush, then a light swirl of the mineral veil. It lasts all day without touch ups, humidity did not make it melt, and my skin has improved tremendously! It does not settle in my fine lines. I have also tried 100s of moisture products. Hard to believe, but banana boat after sun aloe lotion is the only one that works for me! The others cause breakouts, dryness, flaky patches, or too much oil. I apply this right out of the shower, have coffee then apply the bare minerals. Everyone comments on how fantastic my face looks! My dermatologist asked how the heck I covered up my purple neck! My GP thought it had completely vanished lol I started with the starter kit which also contains a nice bronzer for a hint of more color in summer. It also has a CD to teach you how to apply the makeup."
1,"Great color!  A little thinner than OPI usually seems to be so I would probably need 3 coats to feel like it was completely covered but I just did my toes and since I'm far enough away from them I doubt I'll do it differently, just wanted to mention it for anyone who plans on doing their fingernails!"
1,"Your skin and much more specifically your delicate spots require a higher PH Balance - Making it more acid - to keep things clean and healthy.  I saw an article once..... ""the vagina is a tomato"".  It basically said what I just said.... we require a higher PH balance to keep our delicates and not so delicates healthy.Having said that.... this is one of the few soaps you will find that does have a PH between 4.1 and 4.5.  It smells a little lemonesque and does the job in an uncomplicated manner.  Straightforward.  Simple.I've been using it for years, and used to have to special order it through my health food store.  What a pain!  Finding it on Amazon made my day!Yes, it does cost more than an alkiline bar of soap.  There is a reason you wash with a higher PH balance (do the words fresh and clean mean anything?), and that is worth the extra money!"
1,"I think these will be great jumbo heated rollers with dual voltage to use in Europe.  BUT, I use a hard sided spinner suitcase that opens into two compartments, instead of one large compartment.  This travel hairsetter has a small stand on it, which looks pretty sitting in the bathroom, but will take up needed height space making the double sided suitcase difficult to close.  I found on Amazon the Conair MiniPro Hot Rollers and they fit just fine, even in carry-on size. This set will be fine at home and came with claw type clips that hold the roller in place to support a curly set.  This was not written in the Amazon description.  I wish I had known because I spent more money to get clips which I didn't think came with the set."
1,"I have bought the fragrance-free version, as I am scent-sensitive. The product is really scentless, and the clear gel even cools the skin and dries quickly, protecting from odor throughout the entire day.Highly recommended."
1,"I use this for washing dishes, vegetables, as a bubble bath, washing my hair....I could go on and on.  A bit expensive but worth it.  Love that it is all natural.  Almond is my favorite scent."
1,"I bought a tube of this several years ago and am just about out. I am 64 and have very few wrinkles so I think it has worked pretty well for me. I apply every day once a day. I know it says for stretch marks but works well as a facial cream. Don't get to close to the eyes as there is  peppermint smell and it burns the eyes. You may want to get the unsented eye formula for your eye area. I will continue to use this as I think it works the best of anything I have tried, and believe me I have tried many products and keep coming back to StriVectin-SD Intensive It WORKS!"
1,"I do not think I will be buying loofahs again. I never thought to use a glove to exfoliate in shower and dry brush before showers. However, after reading reviews I had to try it. LOVE IT.I keep one glove for dry brushing and keep the other in the shower. It is soo much easier to use then brushes or loofahs. Like rubbing with your hands . Shower gell them and they are good to go. Very natural to use."
0,"Ox Bile is essential in helping with digestion of fats in older people or in people who have had their gallbladder removed but this dose is very high.  I spent the night of the first dose in great pain, throwing up a very strong acid bile that burned my throat and mouth for hours.  The diarrhea was just as painful and it took several hours to clear my system.  3 different bouts of vomiting and diarrhea. Just beware if you are a first time use of Ox Bile, to take a smaller dose, start out with 125 mg and work up as needed.  I will purchase some empty gelcaps and break down the doses to manageable levels so it is not a waste of money, but it was sure a shock to my system."
1,"Simply the Best IF...you follow the directions. You use this great product to cleanse your hair of all the impurities and gook leftover in your hair from your regular shampoo, conditioner, and the world. You use it for 14 days. Shampooing  once a day or every other day, whatever your routine is. It really works, I've been doing this since I was a teenager. I do this routine about every five to six months. This routine is essential for fine/thin hair."
0,"This arrived today after my husband ordered it because he heard me talking about wanting a blue nail polish. It looks much better online. I don't know why in person it's just not as pretty but it's not. I'll be returning it. On another note, he surprised me with German-icure and I love it. It's not as red looking as it looks online but it's still very autumnee (I just made that word up haha)."
1,This is a beautiful nail color.  I get alot of compliments on it.  It goes on very well and stays on.
1,This is the real deal....very thick but absorbs well and is only one ingredient which is the most natural form of vitamin E.
1,"This is a perfect blush.  It lasts FOREVER. It is a great, great, great color. Either the name scares you or entices you."
1,"Great blush, going to try toofaced next time for a cruelty free option. Definitely goes well with lighter skintones. Ran out a bit fast considering the price but this is the first time I've used a high end blush so I'm not sure what I was expecting."
1,i heard tea tree oil was good for your skin and i have problem skin so i decided to give this a try. i like the smell and the way it lathers but it has a very watery consistency. It is helping my skin out so far but ive only been using this for 3 days so we will see.
1,"I'm nearly 20, and decided that my one bad experience with toner shouldn't shy me away from others (my sister had me try Sea Breeze when I was younger and not only did it sting, but also dried me out and inflamed my cheeks). I had been looking at the Thayer products because of the high ratings, when I noticed this one. Not only was it cheaper, but had more fluid ounces, and decided to get it. Right before I was going to add it to my cart, I had the sudden urge to see if Walgreens carried it. I checked, and not only did they have it in stock near by, but it was marked down from 4-something dollars, to 2.99! Not wanting to wait, I went and snatched myself a bottle within the hour and tried it for the first time along with a 6.8oz of Nivea's Soft Moisturizing Cream (I'll be reviewing that next) and I could see the difference immediately. My skin's overall tone looked very well, and it didn't sting at all. In fact, it felt quite refreshing, so I held a cotton pad of it over my eyes for a bit (I suffer from pollen allergies and my eyes have taken a beating this spring). The smell to me isn't bothering at all. In fact, I think my mother had this one cream with Witch Hazel in it, so the scent of the toner was vaguely nostalgic for me. For some reason it almost reminds me of canned fruit or something. I used it again this morning, and in total~ I'm really diggin' this stuff."
1,"This cream works well on my face, neck and hands. It goes on smoothly. Doesn't leave residue or grease on the surface. I have been using it for a few months and the outcome is positive.  Recently, I had to purchase a few extra jars because my daughters were stealing from my stash. LOL. Would definitely recommend this cream to others."
1,"Do you believe in magic? Well, if you don't, try Rezamid and it will make a believer out of you. I'm always amazed at how quickly Rezamid works on my acne. I put it on at night, and notice a reduction in redness and the size of blemishes by morning. I've found that it works better if I tap it on with the tip of my finger, but don't spread it. It ends up being a little blobby, but that doesn't matter when I'm sleeping. If I have a particularly bad breakout, I'll use it during the day, but that usually isn't necessary because it works so quickly at night. It is a bit expensive, but you don't need a lot to make a difference, so this little bottle will last a long time. I've used other products, but none of them work as well as this does."
1,"Not only a good travel kit with a little of everything, but a great way to sample Burt's products.Includes: Hand Salve--tin of very thick, soothing hand creamCoconut Foot Cr&egrave;me--cloudy light cream that works on callouses.Milk & Honey Body Lotion1 oz.,Almond Milk Beeswax Hand Cr&egrave;meGarden Tomato TonerCarrot Day Cream--this broke my skin outLemon Butter Cuticle Cream--thick, smells of fresh lemon, softens cuticles well.Orange Essence Facial CleanserBeeswax Lip BalmRosemary Mint Shampoo Bar--great way to carry shampoo on camping or to the gymPeppermint Shower SoapApricot Baby Oil --smells heavenly, not powdery like baby oil."
1,I have tried using many other companies and all causes rashes over my face. This one is good. Its small rough particles give a very fresh feeling after use. I recommend it.
1,I wasn't expecting alot from this product based on the price. In fact i was going to use this a back up blowdryer to use on my dogs after their baths. I was pleasantly surprised by it though. I have now made this my number one blowdryer and have down graded my more expensive one to the dogs cause even though this is CHEAP its a GREAT product and drys my hair SO MUCH FASTER then my 50$ dryer!
1,"I do not know how it works but it does work! After showed with this for 2-3 times, the pimples on my back disappeared."
1,"This conditioner works quite well, but it's not anything remarkable.  Given the price, it's about on par with Paul Mitchell's Detangler, so this is a good substitute for that product if one wants to save money (and don't we all?).  It works well at detangling hair. I'm not very pleased with the scent, as it reminds me of bar soap or industrial hand soap, something very ""neutral"" and ""clinical"" about it that reminds me of something that is not shampoo.  Luckily, it does not linger.  I will likely purchase this product again, in the larger size."
1,"I've been using this for years because it keeps me reliably odor-free and dry.  My sensitive skin gets along great with it too.  Like another reviewer, I suggest applying over a larger area than typical to guarantee the odor blocking, which I think is a common problem with gel anti-perspirants. Hard to beat the subscribe and save price which is lower than I can find at stores locally."
0,returned. this stuff contains alot of ingredients like three different parabens that are not good for 'sensitive skin' as advertised. i returned it.
1,"I love this liquid hand soap, the lemon verbena scent is wonderful, I keep this by my kitchen sink.  It is a great product."
1,"I do like it , but Proactiv toner  has a fresher smell , I'm going back to Proactiv"
0,This stuff isn't gentle at all. It seems grainy and it dried out my skin. I tried it for a few days before giving up and returning it. I would not recommend this.
1,"This topcoat is something I cannot live without!  After polishing my nails with the required number of coats I need, I wait approximately 5-10 minutes and apply a fairly generous coat of Miracote to each nail, making sure to cover the entire nail and carry the topcoat down over the tip of each nail.  Wait a few minutes and you can proceed with small chores while the topcoat and polish finish setting.  It has a wonderful high glossy shine, and seals in the polish.  With an occasional touch up, my manicure now lasts me 7 full days, and in many instances even longer.  And it looks great.  This topcote is a must have if you do your own manicures!"
1,"This is the only product that does not irritate my face.It really softens and protects your skin.I have tried the expensive ones out there, but this seems to be the best one for my skin."
1,An item you can do without. Before i bought this i would sit covered over a bowl of hot water. The benefit to having this product is that you can turn on the steam as soon as you need it. Still takes like 5 min for it to actually start steaming. Once you have your face in the bowl mask you can feel a bit insecure because if that thing splashes water on you it will burn you. The battery operated exfoliating brush (included) is loud and cheap. I dont use any of these things as much i thought i would.
1,"Neutrogena transparent facial bar soap is such a wonderful soap, and it lasts a looooong time. I use this with my Clarisonic and it works wonders! With other soaps my face would dry out, but this soap leaves the moisture in your skin. A little bit will go a long way with this soap since it lathers so well. I rub my Clarisonic on it a few times, and the lather is amazing! It is also great for removing makeup. I rinse my face with hot water, grab this bar, rub it between my hands a few times, then rub the lather on my face and massage it all around. I only have to do that once to get all of my make up off. With other soaps I have to lather and rinse nearly 5 times before all of my makeup will come off. Neutrogena is amazing, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great facial bar soap or even just a soap to remove makeup. Oh! and it smells wonderful!"
0,I used this according to the instruction and it seems to me that my nails became somewhat more brittle and prone to breaking.Also it gave my nails an unattractive yellowish look.The people who find this works seem to wear nail polish over it.  Maybe this makes a difference but it is not mentioned in the product instructions.  I don't typically wear nail polish.
1,"I got color matched at Sephora. I never would have thought I wore such a dark color. I would have picked a much lighter for myself. Boy was I shocked! Looks very natural, blends great and I have no complaints. I would definitely suggest getting color matched!"
1,"I love these clear bars, just wish they were a little larger because I use them in my shower for my whole body.  I love the clean smell and it doesn't leave any soap residue on the shower doors.  Love all the Neutrogena products."
1,"first of all, i am really glad i bought 24 of these for just under $20 instead of one of them for $4.  i'll give the extras away as gifts or something. they are small enough to fit in a pants pocket, except the finger ring kind of protrudes.  i have a normal-sized female hand, and it is a little smaller than my palm.  i have one at work to use as a comb, and one in the bathtub to use when shampooing.  the bristles are flexible.  it feels a little bit rough on my scalp when massaging the shampoo in, but i like it, and i comb through my medium-short hair while massaging.  a really neat result has been that loose hairs get caught up in the little brush/massager, so very little hair is floating around in the water.  that part is GREAT!  but i don't think one of them is worth $4, and am very glad that i didn't pay that price."
1,"This was ok, but didn't love it as much as the other one. My husband likes to wear it, but I do try to get him to put the other one on. I guess it appeals more to men than a woman because I think it's more a manly smell than the ones I usually wear. A great gift for a man too, especially with X-mas coming up."
1,"I used another pore cleanser brand for years until it broke, and I've been using this one for a few weeks now. I've read quite a few reviews and there are always some who insist pore vacuums don't work. If they have one that has enough suction power (like this one) I'm convinced they are not using it properly. First off, this is not for those who only have a couple small blackheads on crevice on their nose. This will not get those out under one try, but I find they eventually become loosened. This is best for those who have a widespread problem across the cheeks, forehead, and chin. Those folks will see improvements much faster.Extractions are the best, but they cause swelling and irritation if I do them myself and I'm afraid of scarring. Salon visits for extractions would be wonderful, but a visit every 2-3 weeks is also out of the question. Pore strips rip away my skins moisture, cause irritation, and leave a lot of the product behind. That residue only causes more blackheads, leading you to buy more. That cost also adds up.If you use this right and give it a few weeks you will be a believer:Make sure you steam up your face really well. Forget the mister feature; it really isn't needed. You do need your face to be wet, but you also need to use it either during the steaming or immediately after. So its best to just use this near the end of a hot shower. You need that steam to get the blackhead junk to slide out.When you use it on your face you should feel a slight tug. You need that suctioning effect. Slide the machine around the areas you need it with that tugging continuously going. If you lose the suction just hold it to your face until you get it again. I think a lot of people just move it around their face without the actual suctioning effect going and that's just worthless.It also works must better if you reverse the tip piece. The box comes with the small tip ready for use. Just flip it around...the larger tip is what works, the smaller tip is a waste of time.I generally see results after the first 2-3 treatments. After long term use (several weeks) I begin to find it difficult to find a blackhead in a close up mirror."
1,"I used this before, and hope this is the same thing but they changed the outside look of the tube. I really enjoy this mask and think it works great...but my package was supposed to be here at the latest the 8th and I still have yet to receive it. After not even hearing anything from them I decided to contact seller and they were nice, telling me that it is almost here. Just frustrating I can get a foot spa bath, facail sauna system and many more larger items from other sellers on time, but not this little mask tube. But end of story is this is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone! Just order way early from when you expect it to be there!"
1,"I ordered from One41Beauty. Love this color!! Totally beautiful and amazing! It's a bit greener then the pictures lead but it's beautiful none the less! I got tons of compliments today at work. The only negative is, if you use it with the silver shatter don't expect to see much, it somewhat blends in. This color is so pretty though it should be a stand alone color!"
1,smize while you moisturize.it's super light! does the job. smells amazing. 10/10 would do again best deep hair mask that i've used.
1,Great hydration without the breakouts. Scent is alittle much and may not work for alot of people with allergies to fragrance. They need to make one fragrance free then I would rate it a 5 star.
1,"Avalon Organic Botanicals has created a rather smooth exfoliating enzyme scrub. This is a non-irritating product. In fact, the exfoliating granules are so small, they really are more of a secret ingredient. That makes this perfect for sensitive skin. It was interesting to see how well this product worked, when the gel looked so smooth. The fruit enzymes and gentle exfoliating granules do really smooth away all those dull surface cells.Ingredients: Certified Organic Lavender Floral Water (lavandula officinalis), Certified Organic Aloe Barbadensis, Multi-Fruit Enzymes, Silica, Powdered Corn Meal (zea mays), Certified Organic Extracts of Chamomile (chamomilla recutita), Echinacea (echinacea purpurea), Ginkgo Biloba, Green Tea (camellia sinensis), and Lavender (lavandula officinalis), Organic Sea Kelp Extract (laminaria digitata), Methyl/Propylparaben, Pure Essential Oils100% Vegetarian IngredientsIf you love lavender scented products, this will be a healing experience. Keep this in the shower for improved skin texture and clarity. If you are tired of dry flaky skin, give this a try.~The Rebecca Review"
1,"I love this blush!  I was talked into it by the sales lady at the Sephora store.  (I only say &#8220;talked into it&#8221;, because I wasn't thinking I would ever be the person to spend more that $12 on blush, but I did and I'm not sad about it.)  It's just beautiful!  It's a great color and goes on easily and stays on.  (I think it needs a touch up ever 8 hours, but I think that's to be expected.)  I've purchased this item several times now and I'm going to continue to buy it.."
1,"Got this for my hubby for our anniversary and he was so delighted. I received it in time and packaged very well, and the price was excellent! Thank you!"
1,OPI is great nail polish ~ goes on smooth and drys fairly quick.  This is a perfect Nude color if that's what you're looking for.  Super shiny and lasts a good two weeks on toes.  Perfect neutral color ~ Love it.
1,"I haven't used this long enough to honestly rate this product. Nevertheless, so far, so good. Waiting patiently for a positive result."
1,Good product. Use a little bit on your spot and the next day its already shedding the first layer of skin. By the 3 rd day the spot is almost gone. Cant get these results from the most expensive products
1,"I didn't know if I would like this, as I normally prefer very ""clean"" or single-flower scents.  I don't like Opium-type spicy perfumes. However, when I got this earlier today, I did NOT sniff it straight from the bottle.  After reading dozens and dozens of reviews on it, I knew that it had to ""warm up"" to my body chemistry before I would know what it really did for me.  I lifted my hair and sprayed a little on the back of my neck.  A few hours later, I can tell you that I absolutely LOVE this!  It smells great and has a bit of a ""clean"" tone to it.  I intend to stick with this one.  :-)"
1,"Suave Naturals Conditioner, Tropical Coconut - 22.5oz. I have used this product many times and I love it. It cleans well and smells so good. I would recommend this product to anyone."
1,"Just to clarify, here's what this product is NOT:-this is NOT lightweight-this is NOT instantly-absorbing-this is NOT watery or creamyBasically, don't expect the milky, instantly-absorbing hand creams you'd find at places like L'occitane or C&E.; The formula is more akin to stuff like Aquaphor, so 'hand cream' might be a bit of a misnomer (this is more of a waxy gel than a cream).Be warned--this formula IS waxy, thick, and not as easy to spread as runny, milky hand creams. BUT, it absorbs quickly enough, and application isn't particularly laborious. A little goes a long way.Here's why I like it:-NON-IRRITATING: I tend to get eczema during dry winters, on sensitive areas of my face/arms (e.g. around my lips, elbows, etc). I've tried tons of creams meant for 'sensitive skin', that only served to provoke already-irritated/dry skin. This stuff has never once irritated inflamed skin.-NON-GREASY: ok, so this stuff doesn't instantly disappear onto your skin. BUT, it's not nearly as grossly greasy as products that are mostly petrolatum (e.g. Aquaphor, Vaseline). If I have an eczema flareup on my face, I don't want patches of shiny grease. Thankfully, this stuff is not that.-ACTUALLY HEALS DRY SKIN: I visited to numerous dermatologists who all told me ""no idea what causes eczema, nothing you can do except use your topical steroid creams"". It was a vicious cycle: sensitive-skin formulas like Cetaphil, Cerave, Eucerin, etc, only provoked already-irritated skin, and thus couldn't provide much-needed hydration. Which made my skin dry. But when I used water, it only further dried out my skin. Topical steroid ointments were the only things that worked, until I tried this stuff. It's seriously a life saver!"
1,"Love the feel of this product, I dont know if its stopping the aging process, but it is a light moisture product good to use under make up"
1,This product doubles the effects of your normal support tablets. It  has natural way of dealing with menopause as it helps with a number of ailment. It even gives theMenopause Support- 3 Bottles/ 1 Month Supply. All-Natural Herbal Remedy for the Relief of Hot Flashes and Other Menopause Symptomsa run for its money. You might want to look into this product.
1,"Good for making a jelly sandwich. As usual, Essie has good coverage, stays on well, and just good stuff all the time.EDIT:Finally used this by itself for my 4th of July mani. It took 3 coats to get a good coverage but tried quickly."
1,"I have very oily skin that also gets extremely dry in the winter. I heard that this is a good moisturizer, even for those with oily skin. It absorbs very quickly and does not feel greasy. My skin does not feel dry after application. However, it does not seem to improve my oily skin and I think it would be too much for me to use in the summer."
0,"Whoa doggy! This is a strong, strong scent!!! My first time using it I got nauseous from the scent. I have been wearing perfume and oils since I was 15 and none of them have had that affect on me. I like strong perfumes, but this took the cake. Maybe next time I try it I won't roll, but dab and then see how it is. The scent was strong all day."
1,"This lotion didn't irritate my skin or do any damage, but I thought it was nothing special. It created a greasy film on my face that I had to blot off and cover with powder every morning."
1,"Love the way it leaves my skin, smooth and clean for me this is the best one I've tried. Also purchased &#34;Neutrogena Blackhead Eliminating Daily Scrub&#34;  didn't like the feeling it left on my skin.  But this one is great and for me much better than any I have tried."
1,"UGH skin!  I have been on long term steroid therapy combined with winter's harsh wind and cold made my face drier than the Sahara Desert. A merry go round of skin products later still no significant improvement.  Then a few weeks ago I added a variety of Olay products to do battle.  Although I must admit I was skeptical after lathering on much more expensive products with excellent reviews from Amazon.  How could a product purchased in the supermarket do a better job?  Got news for you Olay trumps them.  My skin was actually softer and looked less lizard like.  Loved that it was fragrance free.  Sometimes I overdid the amount I needed so just scooped it up and used it elsewhere.  Experiment with the amount your particular skin texture needs.  It isn't Crisco.  This led me down the Olay path of skin care and I haven't looked back.I added the following to my arsenalOlay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid Ounces,Olay Complete Night Fortifying Moisture Cream 2 Oz,Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl OzandOlay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser 6 Fl OzYay to better skin!"
1,"It smells nice, like roses. After a good hot shower and scrub, I use it to close the pores on my nose."
1,"Kiddo does not love it, but she also doesn't want to give up her current Abby Cadabby toothpaste (she's over Sesame, but not Abby yet), so I think some of her &#34;ewww, grosss!&#34; complaints are just grousing. I think it tastes fine and I like what they have in this. I thought it was a good transitional paste to what we'll eventually use in the next year. She's just under two now. I'll update the review when we fully switch."
1,But I switched to Olay Serum - only because I'm not a 20 year any more :)Thing face treatment IS actually good.
1,"I have absolutely horrible cuticles and very dry areas around my nails. I, unfortunately, have a compullsion to bite and pick and the dry areas to the point of my fingers bleeding. I read the reviews and decided to try this. It is very easy to use and it does smell nice but it really hasn't helped. it doesn't leave you feeling greasy at all and I love anything from Burt's Bees but this just didn't do much for me. I did apply it compullsively to try and get the moisture back but it never really changed much. Oh well, I guess it just wasn't for me."
1,"I have been using this for years and love it! It feels nice and light on my skin. I use it by itself and under make up. I have light skin so I try to make sure I use sunscreen before leaving the house. This doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy, just soft and supple."
0,The color is much darker than what is pictured. I am a level 6 1/2 or 7. It took me to a level 10 1/2 or 11. It has a yellow cast to it. I was going to try this on my natural non-colored hair before using bleach. I was hopeful to get a bleach blonde color but it was not as pictured. It took me about 3-4 shades lighter but I was hopeful to get past the yellow stage.
1,"I have tried other brands in the past but nothing is better than Q-tip.  Softer yet stronger, there is nothing better.  A product with a thousand uses.  This 500 count can be found elsewhere cheaper."
1,"Another Olay product I love, can&#34;t say enough about this product either,its wonderful to use, makes my skin very soft"
1,"I just adore this fragrance. It's fresh, light, feminine, and floral and not at all overpowering or musty. It's described as a ""combination of sparkling green apple leaves, zesty orange mandarin, charismatic pink magnolia, seductive purple freesia, and soft blue musk that explodes into a colorful floral fragrance."" Don't let the blue musk part scare you, because this is definitely a soft and dainty scent. It reminds me of wildflowers and Spring time. I can smell it throughout the day, especially if I spray a little bit on my clothes. When I was wearing it recently, a lady said, ""That smells expensive."" It's classy and timeless. Definitely signature scent material."
1,"When I was young my mother never used a conditioner on my hair. My hair would get so tangled in knots that I'd literally have to have it cut off. It was only when I discovered conditioners that I could finally grow my hair long. The conditioner is necessary for me to keep my hair tangle free.The problem I have with many conditioners is that the chemicals in them aren't great for my skin. My skin tingles or even gets sensitive after I use the conditioner. This is especially noticeable after I sleep for a night, since my hair gets on my pillow, the conditioner rubs off onto the pillow and then my face lays in that.I'm really pleased with the Suave Humectant Conditioner. It is one of the least reactant conditioners I have tried. I can use it daily without any problems. It does a great job with my hair, too. It definitely makes it easier to brush through. What's interesting is that it's labeled as a ""for dry or damaged hair"" conditioner. I would normally consider my hair to be on the oily side, but the conditioner does quite well for me. It doesn't make my hair oily.Well recommended."
0,"If you want to live your life like a vampire...this is the right product for you! Why? Well, I found out the hard way, Glycolic Acid increases your skins sensitivity to the sun. A warning was issued on the lable, but silly me didn't think it would be that big of a deal. I burnt horribly the next day from 20 min. of sun exposure! YIKES! Not worth it.It does, however, improve the look of the skin, the price is great, and there is no fragrance(YAY). BUT, like most beauty products, it has dimethicone, which is an acne irritant. If you have horrible acne like me, dimethicone is TERRIBLE for you! Find something with out it! If you don't, than this might work nicely for you. Dimethicone is bad no matter what, but it wont hurt your skin appearance if you have no acne."
1,Really love this product.  It works wonders for damaged hair and finally brought my hair back to life.  BRAVO!!! LOVE IT!!
1,"The gallon size is an excellent value. The soap is great and can be used for so many things. I've got smaller bottles around the house as bathroom hand soap and as shampoo/body wash. I use it to mop the floors, scrub the tub, and clean the litter box. I've used it as dish soap and as laundry soap. It smells nice, lathers like a champ, and is gentle enough to use on my face."
1,"Aveen Clear Complexion is the first moisturizer I've ever used, and I have to say it did not disappoint. I've never used many products to improve my skin, but I will definitely keep this in my stash now!I never had problem skin in high school, but once I hit college I just started having a lot of breakouts from high stress and poor eating habits. I finally found a daily facial wash that worked well and didn't completely dry out my skin (causing me to break out more!), but the combination of new skin wash and this moisturizer are what ultimately cleared up my skin.No more redness, and I've had one breakout in the last two weeks since using this. It really makes your skin look even and clear!"
1,I love this brush. It is perfect for applying face color or blush. It is a great buy and I plan on ordering another one or two to keep on hand.
1,The smell is the best thing about this soap.  It's very true to what you'd expect.  This is one of the more moisturizing of Philosophy's soaps.  It's not quite as frothy as some of their others so if you care about lots of bubbles in your bath this isn't your best choice though as I said you can't beat the scent.  I use this as hand soap because it cleans but doesn't dry my hands.  And did I mention the lovely scent?  LOL
1,"I have been using this moisturizer for more than a year now. It absorbs nicely, and moisturizes thoroughly. Does not make face oily, works well all year round (winter and summer)..."
1,"Every day wear without the heavy feel.  It does last & last whether you use the top clear coat or not.  Exceptionally natural looking only better.  Difficult to find in stores and the prices found on Amazon are comparable so, I order in bulk when found."
0,Given all the great reviews I was disappointed in this cream. It was heavy and left my greasy. The SPF smell is horrible. Cause me to break out and made my roseaca flare up. I could probably use this as a cream for my hands when going to the beach but that's about it.
1,"I used this product for myself. I have a very bad habit if biting my nails AND the skin around my nails to the point of bleeding...very embarrassing and nasty looking. This stuff worked great, however I've quit using it since it has ruined certain foods for me.Every time I'd go to chew on a finger, the gross bitter taste of this would stop me, however, the day after applying this (showers and hand washing will NOT take this stuff off), I made ribs for dinner...my favorite. I ate my first rib, went to lick my yummy Raspberry Chipotle BBQ sauce off my fingers, and about gagged. It completely ruined my dinner after that.I can't really fault the product for this since technically, it IS doing what it says it's supposed to...keeping your fingers out of your mouth. I just can't continue using it though since I have a toddler whose food I usually have to tear up, and we tend to eat a lot of finger foods here (Daddy's currently deployed, so Mommy eats what the little one eats!), and it's just disgusting to have that taste on your food.Overall, I kinda recommend this. It does work, so there's that, but if you handle a lot of food with your fingers, then I say pass...as soon as you get that taste in your mouth, it takes forever to get rid of it."
1,This comb does wonders for long hair. Dry or wet. I purchased 2 because of the price and the looks. I like the color and the grip of the comb. I would recommend to any looking for a good hair comb.
1,"I was pleased to receive this bottle of Lavender oil as quickly as I did.  The lavender oil smells nice, but the true lavender scent is not as strong as I had hoped.  I have never bought lavender oil before, so perhaps this is how they all are.  I wanted to make a linen spray with the oil.  I only wish there were more to the contents, but I am happy with it overall."
1,I saw this and figure I would give them a try. When I finally got to use them I read the directions and scanned the square and watched the video. It took a few tries before I got it in place.( I have a injured back so there's not a whole lot I can do. ) I would stay in place for about three hours and then I would have to push it back in place. I still think it would be better if them did come in different sizes because I do feel it is to big. It might just be me cause I haven't had any kids.
1,"This product is best to use after you've had a skin peel or microdermabration. You have to wait until all the skin on your face has peeled and then you can use it. It's incredible how much junk it sucked from my pores after a skin peel.If you don't have the money or time to have a skin peel or microdermabration you can scrub you face in the shower and then use it while your face is still wet. It won't unclog as many pores but it's still fairly good. Then I just use a metal pore extractor for any clogged pores it left behind since I don't want to use the metal pore extractor for all of my face.There are three rules I always follow when using this product: 1) always use after a shower 2) always keep my face wet 3) always after I've expoliated my faceBy expoliating, there's less blocking the suction.If I don't do these three things this product is pretty much useless.  Oh, and I don't advice using the big suction cup. The small one is better."
1,"I absolutely love this shampoo and the matching conditioner. It makes my hair look GORGEOUS. Ever after the first use I noticed how much shinier and fuller my hair looked. I also find that my hair is easier to style when I use Jason shampoo and conditioner. While it really does make my hair shinier and seem thicker, it does seem to makes it less soft to the touch, but it LOOKS soft and touchable so that's all that really matters, right?"
1,"I like to use SPF30 during the summer months and this moisturizer fits the bill.  It feels great under makeup, has no perfume-y odor, and is a great price point. It is no frills,but does the job!  For the winter months, I would suggest layering this with another moisturizer if you have dry skin.  Overall, great product and I haven't burned yet!"
1,"Bought this foundation for my Sis, she grew to love this partically brand and colour. Our weather is very warm, but it holds!! It doesn't smuck, leak or anything like that. It looks great on her and she says it safe to wear the whole day, esspecially in the morning."
1,"I'm not really sure what every ones problem of complaining about the brush unless you have no hands or parkinsons and can't hold your hand steady its virtually impossible to get this all over your eye. The brush is far shorter than most liquid eyeliner brushes and only one coat is needed. I haven't even used liquid liner in twelve years until the last week and first try made a very even and precise line. I bought this for the waterproof factor and since it is the first liquid eyeliner i ever owned 13 years ago. I also bought e.l.f. brand because it was incredibly cheap. For $8.99 at CVS you get 0.25 oz of product compared to almays 0.10 oz for $8.49 (not waterproof), CGs 0.08 oz at $8.99 (not waterproof), L'oreals 0.08 at $9.99 (not waterproof) and e.l.f.s 0.10 for $3.49-$7.99 (not waterproof). For a bargain shopper or even as a spare for those who don't mind shelling out their life savings got one tenth of an ounce of eyeliner, i would highly recommend this product.  For those who have no hand eye coordination or can't draw a straight line to save their life I'd suggest not buying eye liner at all since you guys always blame the product instead of your own inability to properly apply the product. http://instagram.com/p/qE7J5sQ8PP/ a picture comparing the two products."
1,"I had seen several presentations on this on QVC, and wondered if it really did what was claimed. It claims that it gets makeup off in one step, and you do not need toner.  When I used it for the first time, I said WOW!  It got mascara off like I had never been able to get it off before, and my face did feel as though I had used toner; it did not feel tight,just clean.  No more extra steps for toner and eye makeup remover, because Purity Made Simple does it all.  Amazon has it on Subscribe and Save, so I will order it that way next time."
1,"I have never had such long nails. This might get me into the Guinness book of world records....or at least on Intervention: Can't stop growing out my nails.Seriously, this stuff has made my nails so strong after a series of Shellac treatments. I'm addicted to it now."
1,"best.  smell.  ever.  Can they make this into a perfume please?  Light and refreshing.  I opened it and stood, sniffing the bottle for about 5 minutes.  Works nicely to tighten pores and refresh.  I put into a mister bottle and spritz throughout the day, plan of taking on the plane with me and on vacation next week for a pick me up.  love love love it.  PLEASE make it into a non-toxic perfume for me !!!!!"
1,"I found this at another website:Everclean Shampoo helps relieve the itching and scalp flaking associated with dandruff, psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. The active ingredient Salicylic Acid combines with a rich, moisturizing base that includes:  # Aloe Vera - a moisturizer and protectant for scalp and hair# Allantion - to soothe and improve scalp condition# Vegetable Protein - to add body and sheen to the hair# Panthenol - to add body and sheen to the hair# Vitamins A&D; - essential nutrients for scalp and hair# plus gentle herbal extracts of Chamomile, Comfrey, Henna, Hops, Horsetail, Nettle and RosemaryIngredients:Active Ingredient: Salicylic Acid 1.8%Other Ingredients: (In Alphabetic Order): Allantoin, Aloe Vera, Extracts of (Chamomile, Comfrey, Henna, Hops, Horsetail, Nettle and Rosemary), Glycerin, Grapefruit Seed Extract, Lauramide DEA, Panthenol, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Myreth Sulfate, TEA Lauryl Sulfate, Triethanolamine, Vegetable Protein, Vitamin A (Retinyl Palmitate), Vitamin D (Ergocalciferol), Water.It works well, I notice I get issues when I have too much fat in my diet. It's not 100% natural, but I have issues with the tea tree (slightly allergic) which also works for the issue & definitely make sure you get on scalp rather then getting on the hair as letting it sit on the hair for a few minutes will dry out the hair a bit.This is much better then their scented version which has Pine Tar which at close proximity can make you smell like a ""burnt forest"" or ""pine scented car freshener"" lol"
1,A little watery and streaky but it's worth it for such a unique color!  I have pale skin and I would say that this would look better on darker skin.
1,"the Olay Regenerist line of products really work quite well.  I didn;t get the results I desired, and yes I was being realistic, but it did a far better job then most others, including those really expensive ones.  I would purchase again"
1,This product cleans my face so well.  My skin feels so clean and looks to healthy when I use this.
0,It is very hard to blend in to your skin.  I have to add moisturizer to it in order to blend it in.  Will not buy again.
1,"The product arrived timely and the packaging is wonderful. I've used Mavala Stop since I received it and although it hasn't completely prevented my granddaughter from sucking her two fingers, she is aware that she will receive the &#34;painting&#34; on her fingers if she places them in her mouth. I feel it is helping in the sense that she knows the taste isn't something she likes.  That alone is a help for me.  I'm confident that she will eventually be more aware of Mavala Stop and discontinue this habit. I have nothing negative to say about this product since it does make my granddaughter aware of what will happen if she doesn't follow the instructions and keep those fingers where they should be."
1,"I am a huge fan of most Neutrogena products, as they are generally very gentle for my somewhat sensitive skin. This toner is refreshing, and seems to pair nicely into my routine. It does appear to be mildly pore refining, but it's a miracle worker. It's just a great toner for a 20 something with relatively nice combination skin. I use it daily and it hasn't ever given me any problems."
1,"These headbands are cute and comfortable. I can wear them for 6 hours without getting a headache. My only complaint is that they break easily, however they are reasonably priced."
1,"I have not been able to find this conditioner anywhere until I spotted it on Amazon. Because it's a spray mist, it's much easier to control where and how much I want to apply, which I like because my hair is fine and most bottled conditioners weigh it down, even after ample rinsing.  This spray also enhances the highlights in my hair - I don't know why since it's not meant to do that, but I don't mind. The scent is wonderful and light. I purchased a 3/pk for about $11 with free Prime shipping so for now, I'm a happy camper!  Thanks again Amazon....."
1,I was a bit hesitant to buy this lipstick...due to my skin tone...but it works!  It is a shade of red with a bit of coral in it..not a blue-red but a yellow-red.  It is bright!  I usually apply once and the color lasts a long time.  This is not a 'looks like I don't have lipstick on' shade.  Gorgeous!
0,"Avoid this product - it cannot be used for more than 3 minutes without overheating. I used mine twice - for about 3.5 minutes each time. This includes shutting the unit off and on to reposition it. The third day I used it, it started to smoke! It is a piece of junk made with poor quality parts."
1,"I own Taj Mahal ( my absolute favorite blush IN THE WORLD), Taos, and Torrid. I usually wear either Taos or Torrid as daily blushes and reserve Taj Mahal for special occasions. I'm an NC 44 in MAC so my skin is caramel colored, Taj Mahal is a bronzy/berry color on me, Taos is pink and is the color I am when I blush, and Torrid is a warm peachy color. These blushes last ALL day so it's worth the investment. Also the pot will last forever because they are so pigmented you only need to use a little. I have sensitive skin, but have never had a problem with these blushes breaking me out. I use drug store mascara, eyeliner, eyeshadows, and lipsticks, and splurge on foundation and blush. I highly recommend these blushes!"
1,"I have been using Dr. Bronner's for a while now in homemade products like body wash and face wash. Up until this purchase I have been using the baby mild unscented because my kids use the body wash too, but I decided to try this almond scent because I was bored with the unscented. My oldest son doesn't like the smell, although he doesn't HATE the smell. He is picky about scents and prefers artificial strawberry smell to this, lol. I love it though. Something I would order if you already know you love that almond smell."
1,"I NEVER TASTED IT, BUT MY KIDDO HATED THE TASTE AND STOPPED THE BITING HABIT AFTER 2 WEEKS.."
1,"I am a daily swimmer, both in pools and the ocean, and my skin becomes parched, not just from the salt and chlorine but from the sun.  I needed something serious to put on my skin to rescue it.This is the best thing I've tried yet for my skin, since it soaks in and softens and smooths my skin.  I put this on as soon as I get out of the pool, when my skin needs it most, and rub it in and my skin actually glows and feels wonderful.  And it does work for 24 hours.  I wake up the next morning and can still tell that my skin has been pampered with this.  There is still a smoothness and softness, and no sign of the dry tight feeling I usually have when I don't use this.  I even use this on my face without any bad reactions.  It seems to soften lines near my eyes too.  I don't ever want to be without this.  It has no scent, which I like also.  Of all the drugstore moisturizers I've tried this is the best"
1,"This product does what it says it will do and the battery in it lasts a VERY long time.  I like the ability to adjust the size.  However, it takes some getting used to suction wise.  But once you get the hang of it, it works great on acne and pores, especially for the nose and chin areas.  Good price too."
1,"NOW foods offers good quality oils for a good price. I have never had a problem with any of their oils. I don't trust the dropper that comes with it, as it is usually a little loose and I have had one fall off while using it before. I just bought a bag of disposable pipettes that I use with my oils."
1,"Great product. Love that is can help exfoliate your skin. I noticed a difference in my skin texture. It's not horribly priced, but I still wish it was cheaper. The pads are super big, so I normally cut them into fours to get more use out of them. Would recommend."
1,"Smells a bit like bacon or jerky, definitely not for the fru fru girls bathroom, but for the man cave it's great.  Great lather, excellent cleaning and clearing up/preventing of psoriasis issues"
1,"This is the absolute best creme for dry hands, feet, legs, arms, elbows - any surface area you've got that's dry, this is what you need!  I got so tired of lotions that felt great when I put them on, and an hour or so later it was as if I hadn't put anything on at all.  Then I found Camille Beckman and this stuff leaves my skin feeling great for hours.  As mentioned by another reviewer, you need to let this soak in for a few minutes but after that the effects last for hours.  I keep one jar by my bed and another at work.  You don't need to use much so a jar lasts a long time.If you have dry skin and have been looking for something that lasts longer than an hour or so, give this a try.  The ""Camille"" scent has a bit of a rose scent to it, which I like, but they do have a wide variety of different scents if this isn't your style."
0,"It was hard to get it assembled.  Even then, I couldn't adjust the height.  So I adjusted me to fit the stand.  It actually worked pretty good for about two weeks.  Then I turned my head and the dryer fell off and broke the stand. All gone now. Just another piece of broken plastic taking up space."
1,"You can't beat the price and performance of this product. When it arrived, I had three spots of acne on my chin. I applied the gel right after I received it, and before I went to bed. When I got up in the morning the redness had subsided and the acne was practically gone. One more application before bed clinched it.I'm 61-years-old, so this is later stage acne. For mt, this product did an amazing job. It has a pleasant, fresh aroma and, unlike creams. leaves no cakey white spot where the product has benn applied."
1,I love Essie polishes and this color doesn't disappoint. It is perfect for a nude nail but gives just the most beautiful color ont he nails.
1,"I've been using Scalpicin off and on for many years, and they have been using the same &#34;delivery&#34; system (same container) for the entire time.  It comes in a little bottle, and you squeeze it out, and too much always comes out (the idea of it maybe?).  But it's too good a product to not purchase because of that, so I've found my own solution.  I purchased a small set of travel containers that includes a little sprayer bottle.  I empty the contents of the Scalpicin bottle into the spray bottle, and VOILA! I have a wonderful delivery system that delivers just the right amount of Scalpicin to any area on my head that needs it.  No extra Scalpicin seeps out and oversaturates or drips down my face.  It's a truly wonderful product and with this little modification, it's perfect.  The itch goes away almost immediately and I'm free of it for the entire day.  I very highly recommend Scalpicin to anyone with a scalp itch problem that isn't caused by untreated dandruff or psoriasis.  Sometimes your head just itches and Scalpicin is the answer"
1,This is MY ALL TIME FAVORITE NAIL POLISH. PERIOD. It is such a great color and it looks good with my skin color (olive). I take it with me whenever I go to the nail salon in case they don't have it. I call it true blood because it kinda reminds me of the show :)
1,"It works great to seal moisture into my hair, and also softens and protects my edges. It's very thick, so only a little is needed. If I have dry patches on my scalp,"
1,"I have been using this product for 3 weeks and have had great results. I have dry, sensitive, blemish prone skin. I'm in my late 20's with severe environmental allergies and mild acne. I cannot use Benzoyl Peroxide as it's too irritating and actually makes my skin swell.  Retinol, AHA and BHA are the only OTC products I can use without breaking out. This product is not hard on my skin and I've noticed my acne clearing since I've started using it. In the morning, I can see my blemishes have healed some compared to the night before. I have also noticed old blemish spots fading significantly.  I also like that it comes in a tube rather than a jar. The antioxidants and other ingredients won't spoil that way. Good for Neutrogena for coming out with this product!"
1,I love this mud mask. For me it's really refreshing. My skin becomes softer after applying this mask. I will definitely buy this again.
1,"I have tried the 5% and the 10% version of this bar and I would say that it is pretty effective to a degree.  The most I can use this bar is once a day every other day in the colder months and once a day every day in warmer months.  I would describe my skin as sensitive but it is not extremely sensitive like some folks I know.  I have to make sure that I rinse very well so it doesn't bleach my sheets or clothes and follow up with a good moisturizer, depending on the weather."
1,This has helped a couple of itchy areas on my body that have been resistant to other lotions and creams. It's definitely more effective.
1,"My wife bought this toner, she said:I was using Body Works's Tea Tree Toner which is supposed to help with acne and this Witch Hazel toner works ten times better. This toner will not dry out your face like the Tea Tree toner. I love that the Witch Hazel toner is alchol free and have aloe in it. I notice it helps calm my skin down after I had been using Retin-A and my face is particularly sensitive. I would even say this (along with a good moisturizer) has helped my skin over the last several weeks and contributed to my decrease in breakouts. I hardly even use my Retin-A anymore. This definitely helps control the oil production and balances out my pH."
1,I used this in the past as i like the smell. I have since switched to infinite skn toner and gave this to my mom and she loves!!!
1,I like this mask a lot because it smells yummy! And it works well to clean the pores. I would for sure get this again.
1,OPI is always great quality. This is a fun color. I'm a huge fan of neutrals. The color doesn't exactly look like the picture but I'm a fan of the color. My OPI collection is growing!
1,I realy love Orgasm blush from Nars. I always try another brands and colors but is nothing in this worls that can compare with the orgasm color . I am  will use it until I died.
1,"I was using Bare Escentuals mineral veil at $20 a pop (smaller container compared to this as well) with average results when a co-worker with fabulous matte skin introduced me to this when I finally asked her how she stayed shine-free all day when I had to reapply powder on my nose two to three times a day. She told me she uses the Maybelline Shine Free powder. I couldn't believe it but I tried it anyway because at $5 a container, I could just trash it if I hate it.I love it from the first use. It's not translucent. It has a bit of color. But the color is so light it really just perfects your foundation and give your a matte flawless finish. I dust it on top of my make up all over to set. Then I take a flat brush and pat down more powder on the oiliest parts like t-zone and area around the nose. Don't worry, it doesn't cake. The color doesn't build up and become unnatural looking either. It's so great at controlling oil, staying put, and looking great, I hardly reapply powder to my face the rest of the day. My make up doesn't end up in my smile lines either. I find that I rarely even use the powder in my compact anymore. I just keep it around for the mirror!I bought one container and it lasted me months. When I finally ran out and went back to Target for more, it was no longer on the shelves. I tried 5 other Targets around my work and home with no luck. I was so sad that it was discontinued. I ended up buying the Cover Girl powder thinking it would be the same but that powder was awful, dense, no oil control, and smelled. For the last several months I was back to using Bare Escentuals. And just by dumb luck I run into this again on Amazon tonight while trying to fall asleep. Why didn't I just check Amazon in the first place? Definitely putting it on my Subscribe and Save list so I can get it sent to my house regularly. So excited!!!My point is... try it. It's only $5. I don't think you will be disappointed."
1,I have been using Purpose products ever since I was a teen.  I used to have acne and dry skin and needed a product that I could use to moisturize my face.  Because my face is sensitive I would always break out but when the dermotologist recommended this product I was elated and am still using it to this day.  It does what it needs to do to keep my face moisturized and looking young.  I am 55 now and still have smooth beautiful skin.  I recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin.
0,"Decided to try this product since I've had many, many hormonal issues since going off the pill, acne and weight gain being the two biggest problems. Since going off the pill, I steadily gained 20 pounds over 2-3 years and watched my relatively nice skin become mottled and scarred. I hoped I'd be one of the lucky ones, but this product exacerbated my problems. After two dosages, I ballooned another 7-8 pounds over night, and felt crazy and hyper-emotional, like the pill used to make me feel. Needless to say, there is no way I would try to &#34;push through the estrogen dominance&#34; like so many people recommended, and I'm glad I didn't since using DIM, Evening Primrose Oil and Milk Thistle have worked so much better.Would never, never try again. Waste of money."
1,"This face soap is great for removing ALL makeup, even eye makeup which I think is just great because it saves you from that extra step of removing eye makeup and THEN the rest of your makeup.  Plus I occationally have eye lid ezcema and this has so far been the only face soap that doesnt cause flare ups!"
1,i feel there should  not be another  color.  my boyfriend loves  it.  so do i!!
1,"Love it............... it cleans skin wounderful, if u boil hot water on the stove.steam it, take a hot washcloth and let it soak for about 1 min, cool the cloth down it a lilcold water.. put the cloth on your face let it sit there for about 1 min to open your pores.take a lil bit of facial cleanser and rub it on your face, then rinse of with cold water... skin comes outlooking like milk.. wait about 2 mins then put your favorite moisturizer on your skin, head out the door.and start your day.. trus me."
1,i dont think it works for me. after i wash my hair it work for the first day or 2 when using often but it does not last or work for me
0,"I love PCA Skin.  But I have mild breakouts, more black heads and white heads and sometimes a random big zit.  I thought this would clear up my mild break outs.  Honestly I don't use it that often and my face is pretty dry.  I have oily skin but this is drying me out.  I have backed off and stopped using it. With drying out my skin am having more of a breakout more often.  So unless you have pretty bad break outs I don't recommend this.  I also use the pigmentation bar. I love this.  And I'm sticking to this one for sure.  That one helps keep my break outs at bay I think."
1,"I work in a Plastic Surgeons office, and we sell another high end mineral makeup. It cost much more than Bare Minerals. My opinion is Bare Minerals is better. It covers much better, and looks more natural. The one thing I discovered is that instead of using the brushes that are recommended, I apply with a round makeup sponge. The coverage is better that way. Also you can dab alittle more to cover any area you need to with your sponge. And if your oily at all, a must is Mineral Veil. Love this product and I have used it for years. Liquid makeup has so may fillers that are bad for your skin, and they also use dangerous ingredients like glycol.Another big plus is ease of application. Mineral makeup cuts you foundation time in half. You never have to worry about that unsightly cut off point."
1,I am a woman of simple steps so having one product that does 3 things is perfect for me.  I use this as base and top coat and it goes on smoothly and dries fast.  OPI is my favorite brand of nail products.
1,I don't use it all the time but it works really good is practical and I like how is compact
1,I love these.  I got myself two sets and moved all the blue/larger ones  in one container. I use them all the time and only aftrt I apply a heat protecting product. And then a curling cream. Leave them in for at least 15 min and done.
1,"I like this product and have returned to using it when the drugstore is out of my usual on-the-spot treatment. I use this product only at night - when the cream dries, it does leave a little flaky residue - for this reason, I would recommend using it only at night or other times when you aren't going to be out in public. It can dry out your skin a little. In the morning, I have noticed that my blemishes are much less noticable, though there are better on-the-spot treatments out there that do jsut as good of a job reducing blemishes and aren't quite as drying."
1,"I have long hair and I've been looking for the perfect towel to absorb water but be less bulky.  This towel also dries quickly, which is really nice.  I would totally recommend it.  I bought two so I wouldn't be without when one was in the laundry."
1,"I hate the smell, but there is nothing to do about it, since is too thick I thing it with lavender oil, I've been using it every night in my eye lashes and no lie, my lashes are longer that fuller. Love it. I use it in my hair ends, but I can smell the stink during the day, even if I mix it up with the other oils, anyways I'm giving it 5 stars bc it does what is made for."
1,"Im a WOC and I always wanted a yellow concealer for my under eye circles and I read the reviews and bought this one. The concealer by itself is really good quality, creamy texture, long stay,, good coverage plus in a convenient stick so u can just point n put. But honestly I gave it a number of tries and it just looked too pale on me, as in, less yellow more cream-white so it would show through even after blending and blending with my colour foundation. DOES NOT look good on me at all. I guess I'll have to find a proper yellow one in my country local brands, which cater to our skin colours. But that said, its a good product. I still use it for spot concealing."
1,"So it took me a while to decide how well I liked this eyeliner.To start off with, it has a really deep, strong color that doesn't fade, so that was a plus. The consistency of the eyeliner itself isn't too liquidy or goopy... it's a great thickness. I've used this eyeliner for a couple years now, on and off, to line my top lid and do a bit of a wing.Here's where things were iffy: after a couple of hours, the eyeliner would crack. It wouldn't smudge or bleed. It would CRACK. By the end of the day, if I hadn't reapplied it, there would be breaks in what was once a lovely smooth line. I didn't need a makeup remover wipe to take it off, I could practically peel it off. Weird!! Was it my eye? Was it the liner? I determined eventually that 95% of it was caused by the fact that the bottle of liner I was using was OLD. Like, several years old. I knew it was old from the start, but it was an otherwise great liner, so I continued to use it. It wasn't until I bought a new bottle recently that I figured this out. The new stuff will still crack occasionally in small amounts if I wear it for a long time and I guess scrunch my eyes up a lot, but nowhere near the amount it used to.The brush is advertised as tapered but it's not as tapered as I would have expected. It still has bristles; it isn't a triangular foam brush.It is indeed waterproof from personal experience.Overall, pretty good eyeliner, at least compared to some other liquid eyeliners I've tried as of late. This is definitely my go-to product and has become my daily liner."
1,Awesome deal! I have those red bumps on my upper arms and I use this stuff every time I shower. I slather a bunch onto my arms and let it sit for about 45 seconds and rinse with warm water. Red bumps are almost gone! It works great on my face during a breakout too. My skin feels really clean after rinsing off.
1,I have been using this for years.  I like that it is not oily.  I like that I can subcribe and save.
1,"I was so discouraged by the last Maybelline Mascara that I was unsure I was going to find one I liked besides the Falsies mascara. The first thing that drew me in on this was that it was waterproof, and volume. I have really thin-point-straight-down lashes, so I know I should stay away from really wet mascaras and go for volume and waterproof since they have a more ""waxy"" build. Though, this does stay wet enough to build and build to get a look I have been trying for, without massive clumping or turning my eyes into a solid mass. The second thing I was excited to see is that it came in brownish black. It is so difficult to find a mascara that is waterproof and brownish black. Usually the only waterproof one is Very Black. It looks just a touch less harsh with my skin and eyes (I have fair skin and dark brown hair), a little more natural.All in all I love this. It holds my curl and the brush is super nice and not too big.I would recommend this to anyone with thin lashes like me."
1,"I am always searching for a foundation suited for my olive skintone. This color was perfect in caramel beige and for my type of skin , Dry with oily t zone. I was so shock to find a foundation which covers minimizes my  discoloration on my cheeks and makes my skin look so much better. I was so happy ordered several more for not to run out. Thank you Amazon for carrying this product.The product is medium coverage , applied it in sections and don't need that much, this gives a better coverage to your face. Please use a light hand on application. I notice some women like to rub in their foundation like lotion. A big no , no.Thank you ,Native Rose"
1,Nice comb.  Works well in the shower when you are trying to comb conditioner through your curly hair. Wasn't to thrilled about the cheap plastic feel but it serves its purpose.
1,"it had a strong lemon fragrance that last for the whole 'burn' that I had on the incense cup.  Loved that it was not too pungent at all, but not so 'soft; that you could not even pick it up.  Will last me a long time for sure! good value"
1,"I like the way it leaves my skin feel. This has a very light fragrance, and is a good moisturizer."
0,I have the conair 1 1/4 inch hot brush but my hair is very thick and long so I wanted a bigger barrell.  This was all I could find. I read all reviews before I purchased and people either loved it or hated it.  If you have the conair first you will hate this brush.  If you have nothing to compare it to I guess it would be ok.  The cool tip at the end is too small and I kept burning my finger tips.  The on/off switch is right where your hand goes so you have to keep switching it back on.  It does not get hot enough.  If you have a lot of hair don't waste your money.  I've gone back to using my conair.  Wish it was bigger but it always makes my hair look great! I donated mine to a thrift store.  I paid for shipping and by the time I paid to have it shipped back it just wasn't worth it.  Whoever buys it will probably pay 2 dollars for it and that is about what is was worth to me.  Someone please come out with a 1 1/2 inch hot brush!!!!
1,"I am a devotee to this serum, it does wonders for my skin. I've always been complimented on my skin, but the lack of sleep and long work days haven't done it any good. This serum is a truly regenerating serum. I put it on every morning before any makeup and the results are visible. When I stop using it my skin becomes less smooth and does not glow.I also tried the Olay ProX range but it is a little too much for me right now being in my 30s. This fragrance free serum is just the perfect thing. I have combination skin and it works well for me. Sometimes I don't get it as it is pretty pricey but I can tell the difference in my skin when I am using this serum so I caved in and signed up for a subscription on Amazon. The one with the SPF factor is not as good as this one, nor the one with ""Touch of Sun"" tanning. This is THE best, and gentlest anti-aging product I've found till date.The greatest compliment I can give is that if I had to choose one face moisturizer for the rest of my life it would be the regenerist."
0,"I tried this a while ago, back when I had bad body acne in my teens. The fragrance only irritated my skin and it was only after using the facial wash that I realized that I was sensitive to salicylic acid. I gave this to a friend, and it worked very well for her because she doesn't have sensitive skin."
1,"Cleans and moisturizes without drying, and without leaving skin oily.  Minimizes acne flare ups.  I haven't had any acne problems once I started using the product again.  Natural - Not a lot of chemicals.  Good for the skin."
1,"Right amount of coverage!Not too much , but if you need more you can just apply some more !"
1,"This is my third attempt to find a reasonably priced mascara that didn't give me dark smudges under my eyes after only a few hours. The Maybelline Great Lash out performed two Loreal mascaras, but still did not give me the long (8 hours) wearing time I prefer.If you don't mind checking every few hours to dark smudges then this is an OK product. I will keep searching!"
1,Cheaper than the name brands but works the same!~Star Nail Pen-Style Polish Corrector...arrived super fast and a lot less expensive than the Cutex brand!~ I recommend these!~
0,"Please don't buy this product, I bought it and it was completely dry even though the packaging was completely sealed.... I haven't see it sold anywhere else, so I am guessing its really old, i'm really disappointed in this"
1,"This is a strange product.  You must get a small amount on your finger tips and apply to a wet face to ""activate"" it.  It is fairly dried out and thick in the jar but I am told this is normal.  It does however do wonders for your skin.  I use it every couple of days and it never  irritated me.  Excellent exfoliator and smells pleasant."
1,"I use this for smoothing my skin, wrinkles, and Blemishes! It is like Magic on acne and seems to clear up problems within 1-2 days for me. I use it in the morning also if I have any trouble spot not on my face. I also put this on my hands and elbows to smooth them as well.Without store deals & coupons locally, this seems to be the best deal for this product as well."
1,"I use this after every workout. It cleans my face and neck without leaving my skin dry. My skin feels so smooth and supple and the scent is very pleasing to me. I have been keeping it in a zip-lock in my gym bag, just in case the top comes loose, and I have had no spills. Even though I use this stuff every time I work out (about 8-10 times a week), I can tell that this is going to last me a long time! I highly recommend this product and will buy again in the future."
1,"I waited an entire month to finally post my review for this face masque. I bought it because of all the positive reviews.Immediately, I was impressed by the smell. I know some people don't like it, but the minty smell was something I wasn't used to for a facial masque.  Before I tell you how well the product worked, I must first tell you, that I have the most difficult to tame acne a person could have. Doctors' prescriptions, and various attempts to cure it has all been for naught. I HAVE tried everything possible.I used the masque as specified once a night for an entire month, and here is what I have to say about the results.The mask is like any other mask, but after washing it off, your face feels super refreshed. I figured I'd see some awesome results because it made me feel awesome, or even just smaller pores..but I wasn't so lucky. My acne had not decreased, nor did my pores shrink anywhere on my face. The only benefit I achieved from a month of using the masque, was healthier feeling skin. The problem is my skin is still plagues with acne, and this masque is supposed to reduce it.I can't be super harsh on it, because I'm a special case, and I'm sure people with average acne love this product, but it is not any more powerful than other products around.ProsMinty SmellImproved Skin HealthConNot Effective against severe acneUPDATE*After months of treatment with solodyn pills and retin-a, I've improved dramatically. If your acne is really bad go to a dermatologist and have these prescribed. This facial masque is nice and all, but it is no substitute for medical treatment."
0,"I rarely ever return items because it's such a hassle. But this, is being returned immediately. The idea is actually very good- it has a side heater to heat up the clips as well as the rollers, a feature I've never seen before. However, the clips do not hold- at least not in my long hair. No matter how many times I tried, the rollers would always fall out within a few seconds. Even when I stayed completely still (very difficult when putting in the remaining rollers) they would still fall out. They never stayed in long enough for me to see how well the curlers worked."
1,I've always liked this as a final part of my make-up regime. It really seems to set my base make up and it's a great powder. After finding the right shade you'll be in love with this product.
1,"I have a lot of hair that lays flat on my head. This wonderful product is easy to use and give me the body I want. I cannot believe how simple it is to use. Per instructions I waiting until my hair was about 1/2 dry, then I sectioned it off, and started drying. I cannot believe how much body my hair has with no products! And it stays that way without any hair spray.  Seriously love it and wish I had purchased one a long time ago.PS: I'm lazy and don't want to waste hours drying and fixing my hair. This does it in one step of drying and styling."
0,"Nice spray, but as I have arthritis in my hands, the deodorant cream spray was too large for me to use.  Nivea Rool-on and Ban Roll-on deodorant are better for me--both available on Amazon!  I especially like the Nivea Roll-on as I have sensitive skin!"
1,This color goes on well and it goes with absolutely everything. Even darker colors work well with it if you have a fair to medium skin tone.
1,"I have acne prone skin and try to stay as natural as I can with facial products. I've always avoided toners because most have alcohol - something that makes my skin worse, but that didn't keep me from searching for one. I had heard of witch hazel before but the smell scared me off instantly. I stumbled upon this by pure accident. I was pleasantly surprised! The rose scent is light and fades rather quickly and I feel does an excellent job of clearing off the last remnants of make up from my skin. It doesn't irritate though I have found if I use too much I can feel it on my face. It becomes almost sticky. All in all I'm happy with my purchase and recommend it to anyone with acne prone skin looking to add a toner to their regimen."
1,I ordered a second one. It works! My (varicose) veins are almost unnoticeable. I don't think it helps the spider ones.
1,"works great, easy to use and safe on hair. My hair does not feel damaged or fried. Very happy with this item"
1,"I got this because I have fine, wavy brunette hair that often frizzes.- I wanted something that will reduce fly-away hair- I wanted a way to style my hair super fast between washes and still look good.This does the trick.- Variable heat - great.- Tip stays cool so you can actually handle both ends.- Nibs on the brush stay cool while the barrel heats up so I don't burn my skull Ever anymore.- Super fast warm-up time.- I can use it to straighten my hair by just drawing the brush through my hair straight- I can use it to curl my hair by turning it while the hair is wrapped around it.It does risk tangling if you wrap long hair around it more than twice, so I try not to do that.All in all, I love this puppy.  Highly recommended."
1,"The first thickening shampoo that works on my fine hair. I have tried all the expensive brands, and this one is the best by far."
1,"I've been using this mascara for years because all others will smudge.  Even the ""smudge resistant"" or ""smudge proof"" variety cannot hold a candle to this mascara.  It applies in a way that creates little tubes on your lashes that will stay on until you take them off.  And removal is easy.  In the shower just wet your face and use your fingertips in a soft downward stroke to gently coax them off.  Over the sink, wet your face and use a washcloth to remove them gently.  Use the same motion with the washcloth as used to apply mascara. One tip:  If using a lash comb to separate the lashes, a metal lash comb works best and do it before the mascara dries."
1,This is a one coat polish that has a really pretty shimmery look to it which gives it depth.  This is one of my favorite blue polishes...and I have tons of blues.
1,"I have used Olay products since they only had &#34;Oil of Olay&#34; back when I was 16 yrs. old. At my age, 57, I don't have the wrinkles or dry skin that other people my age have. I occasionally  have tried other products, but never twice. I always go back to Olay, because it feels the best on my skin and does what it says it will do. The serum is especially creamy, but light weight."
1,"This is an awesome conditioner for dry hair that needs a little bit of protein and a dose of moisture. The conditioner is somewhat thick so a little goes a long way. This leaves my dry, thick, curly/coily hair soft yet strong. I also use this as a deep treatment once a month by adding a heat cap. Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase."
1,"Love this product. Good for Use daily. It is lightweight so you don't feel like your face is caked with makeup, it is compact to fit in any makeup kit."
1,"I have fair, pinky toned skin and wear cool colors. This polish is a thicker cream, a little harder for me to apply. It is a soft, slightly pinky, light neutral. I can wear this polish with any of my clothes and never have a clash. Being a light color, tiny chips or tip wear are not so noticible.I have used one coat alone, without base, when I just had t get my nails done to go out of the house. It gives a very soft barely-there cover to bare nails I didn't get to buffing and looking decent. Normally, this would be 2 coats, that go on a bit thick, over base coat, and a clear top coat. A very light, finished look I really like.I love OPI polishes because beside wearing well, there is a complexity or depth to all their colors. Never a like slapping on house paint look."
1,"Can't believe this brush was so inexpensive.  I love it - finally a brush where my hair does not get caught in the groove connecting the handle to the brush (this is all in one piece so there is nothing to get caught in).  It's almost impossible to break any hairs with this brush.  This will def help prevent split ends.  I wish the handle were slightly longer, but other than that it's perfect.  Makes styling my hair a breeze!!"
1,It's not nearly as bright as the picture. It's actually more of a deep metallic blue. I'm actually pretty bummed about it.
1,"When I spray it on, I can't spell it after the first few minutes. My first Ralph Lauren fragrance was Ralph Hot. I really like it because it has a distinct scent and lasts all day. It's suited more for evening wear and that's why I wanted to purchase this scent. I'm glad I decided on the 1 oz. jar, because I have many other fragrances I can smell and prefer."
0,The pencil part is so hard I cannot line the rim of my eyes at all and it's also difficult to use it on my eyelids. It's fine for the eyebrow if that's all you want it for.
1,"Noticed results after about 4 days. Feces is grass green & odor has been reduced. I have noticed a difference in body odor. I still get it, just not as strong. I've been taking 4 a day & am over weight."
1,"I was sucked in by the eyelash craze. I tried strip lashes, but had to take them off daily. I watched some videos on how to apply these flares and ordered this - amazing deal on Amazon! I practiced applying these using Duo dark glue and my lashes came out fantastic!  The lashes lasted about a WEEK! It took about 45 minutes (perfectionist) to apply; short flares at inner corner, medium lashes on most of the lash line and long flares at the outer corner. I had such a natural result! My sister-in-law wants me to do hers! Even my husband liked them and he hates when I even wear makeup! Lol I just ordered another 6-pack in anticipation of my friends asking me to do theirs. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE LASHES! They look very natural when applied with using about 12 flares per eye."
1,"And I'm pale, thus the 5*'s for ""Orgasm"".  This is a pricey blush but I haven't been able to find a suitable duplicate in any other brand that matches the blend-ability, wear-ability and the pretty pinky-peach slightly shimmering shade that looks very natural on my ghostly skin.  I should also note that I am a klutz of the highest order and have lost numerous blushes when they've slipped out of my hands and hit the tile floor.  This blush has miraculously stayed intact despite numerous hard drops and I have to credit that to the nice packaging it is encased within.  I highly recommend this shade to klutsy, pale folks or those looking for just a hint of color."
0,I used for 2 months and saw no results or change in skin firmness
0,"I really don't see any difference using products such as this on me.  If I had, Olay would be my preferred brand.  Don't waste your money, just buy a good moisturizer and cleaner."
1,"This cover stick lightens under the eyes. it's not heavy, and it stays on. In the drug stores etc, I can't find the right color--but I found it here. YAY! What are you waiting for?"
1,"It has a nice glow, not glittery at all so perfect for daily wear, but the color is a little lighter than I thought, since I have yellow skin tone it has a rather subtle appearance. Overall it is okay"
0,"Between this Neutrogena Spot Treatment and Oxy Spot Treatment Maximum, there is no contest! The Oxy works and the Neutrogena does not, pure and simple. I have only the occasional pimple these days, but want a treatment that quickly dries up the oil  and inflammation. The Oxy costs more but is worth the price, the Neutrogena does nothing (as far as I can tell) as a spot treatment. A better medicine will prevent scarring and disfiguring marks on your face! Early application of effective medicine can stop an emerging blemish before it becomes much worse. The Oxy Spot Treatment Maximum did a far better job for me."
0,"Fake rose smell, it was pleasant. This just wasn't the toner for me. Made my face worse with this and Neutragena Oil Free Acne Wash."
0,I Love Rose Scent but....I had to literally throw this away!The scent .... was so STRONG...it gave me a headache!I have never had trouble with any product where the Rose scent was too strong!
0,"They are a quite big so i cut them in half to get more use out of it. I would use this 2-3 times a week for the past couple of months and have not seen any improvement. If anything i broke out slightly more, nothing major. Not worth it my opinion."
1,"This seems to be a very nice body wash.  The pump was chipped  when it arrived but replaced it with another pump I had,"
1,This is my favorite mask of all the different ones that I have! It works wonders for scars! I highly recommend this facial mask!!
1,You really can't beat the price of this product.  I use this for &#34;pre-pooing&#34; my hair. I mix it with coconut oil and it gives the mixture a nice consistency. I wouldn't use it as a deep conditioner or a leave in conditioner but it would make a nice cowashing conditioner.
1,I didn't use it past a week. The reason why is that it's smelled kind of funny. will look for another product that doesn't smell so perfumy.
1,"I use the Great Lash with a curled brush and love it. I've tried the straight brush and unfortunately it makes my skinny lashes clump together. The curled brush however goes on evenly without globs. If you go through mascara monthly like I do, this is an inexpensive solution to having great lashes!"
1,"this color is perfect for summer, exaclty like in the picture, i get a lot of compliments from this colour"
1,"Next to the old Pantene, this is the best for removing residue and oil and grease from the scalp.  Recommend highly"
1,"I love using this lotion because it does an excellent job of removing dead skin cells. In the process, my skin appears even."
1,I love it!!!!!!
1,"The product's good, so I set up an Subscribe & Save for ir, as well as the Regenerist Eye. But it seems that every time I add some other item to my cart, I get a message telling me that the price of these two items has INCREASED since I put them in my cart (on Subscribe & Save).  Today it's already happened... TWICE!  There may be subscribing going on, but the saving part is dwindling to the point that I'm prepared to CANCEL my S&S with Amazon, and just buy it at Costco!"
1,This is a great addition for Spring and Summer.  It's clean and fresh and a great simple fragrance to have on hand.
1,I don't like soaps that don't really &#34;clean&#34; and this one leaves my face feeling like I have actually washed it. Recommended by my dermatologist. It also doesn't strip my face at the same time. Good for those with not-young skin (I am 39) but who have oily skin considering their age.
1,"Like everything else, you have to read, and follow the instructions in the pamphlet that comes with the product of hair color. What I like about it, is, that it is easy to use and gives you an excellent result."
1,very good ingredient.. and smell was wonderful.. everything was good.. some people may do not like because it does not make enough forms.. but i knew more form means more chemical.. so i loved it..
1,"I don't usually wear makeup, as it's not really a good fit for my occupation. I decided to try this out, and I like the way it works. It doesn't leave my lashes think or clumpy. The company has fast shipping and great packaging."
1,"This is another mask that I love. I use it weekly or bi-weekly. You put it on, let it dry and pull it off. It is thick and very moisturizing, helps to pull of gunk and dry skin and leaves  my skin bright, clean and happy."
1,Clears up my skin and gets rid of any excess oil or dirt. You can use it in between face washes or right after. Has a nice smell also.
0,I have used electric curlers for 25 years and this is the worst product I have ever purchased. Extreme heat in 75 seconds? Lie! How about mediocre heat in 10 minutes! Don't waste your money. Also the clips are terrible and DO NOT secure the curler. Just bad all around.
1,"Compared to some of the brand name cleansers out there, this inexpensive cleanser by Aveeno gets the job done equally well. I love the way it cleans away make-up without leaving my skin too dry, and truly makes my skin feel refreshed and clean. Excellent value for money!"
0,"I put it on my hair as my friend advised me as its good for anti hair loss, but it gave opposite result I lost my hair, moreover there appeared something like scurf."
1,We use this exclusively for removing grease and oil from clothing before washing because it works great.  We pretreat the stains and let the item sit and then throw it in a cold wash and this removes almost everything.  I can wash light blue work jeans covered in black grease stains and make them look practically new.  Fantastic!
1,"I've never used a curling iron like this, it's not bad but I'm a bit uncoordinated and clumsy so I can't seem to use it well. I'm still trying!"
0,"It looks ok when you initially put it on, then within an hr or so the lashes start to look dull (not much length or volume)."
1,This comb does a good job getting tangles out without hurting the hair. Gradnkids love having me combg their for them
1,"Easy to use and lasts a long time... The powder henna is the best dye I have ever used.  Not only does it NOT do any damage it leaves my hair extremely shiny and beautiful.  The color is very rich.  I really mean it, NO damage.  I leave it in my hair for two hours under a plastic cap and it can even be left on all night although I personally never tried that.  The only drawback is that the powder is very gritty and takes a bit more work to work it through your hair.  You can't use a bottle to apply it.  I use a bowl and wear plastic gloves and slop it on with my fingers then massage it in.  Honestly I will never go back to using a regular dye on my hair... I love Colora Henna powder.  I use Red Sunset.  By the way, the creme color doesn't work well at all, USE the powder.  Don't be alarmed by it being a green powder, the color result on the red sunset is auburn.  It also smells a bit like alfalfa or tea to me, but I like that smell anyway..."
1,this works and I see noticeable results but i need to get a bigger tube i dont know if i should put out the money
1,"I've used a lot of eyelash adhesive in my life, but this is by far the best.  It stays put and dries well!  I love this stuff."
1,"I actually like this stuff a lot.  I use it as a conditioner wash (over the original mane n tail bottle, like a 2-step for more moisture) and sometimes for wash days to detangle my hair while it's wet.  My hair feels softer when I do the process.  The smell is not bad and it's thick in consistency.  It says leave it in for 1-2 minutes before rising it out, but since I have kinkier hair I have to keep it in longer which is fine it doesn't break my hair off."
1,"I keep it on my vanity and use it to ready my skin for applying moisturizer - helps absorption, or before applying makeup - helps blending.  The 5oz size is just right.  Only wish Evian would also make these in decorator cannisters so it is less like displaying their brand name on my vanity table."
1,I felt underwhelmed by this lotion after all of the positive feedback I read in the reviews before purchasing it. It makes my skin feel sticky and I have not noticed any improvement in my skin tone or texture.
1,Saved a couple dollars than if I went to the MAC store will shop again if she has more thanks a bunch!
1,"This towel is a must have for curly hair care.  I decided to buy this after reading online that normal towels cause frizz in curly hair.  I ultimately bought this towel at Bed Bath and Beyond because I couldn't wait for 2 days for this to come via UPS.  I paid slightly more than it sells on Amazon.Overall, I'm pretty happy with how it works, it takes a lot of moisture out of my hair. I give it only 4 stars because it doesn't reduce frizz as much as I had hoped even though I have been using it in conjunction with the curly girl method.  Another potential problem with the towel is that if you have really long hair, it will stick out the bottom of the towel (note that the towel is only 19 inches wide).  My hair is a few inches below my shoulders and it only sticks out the bottom of the towel when my hair is getting too long and it is time for a hair cut.I think some of the other reviewers overstate the effectiveness of this towel.  However, I have very thick hair, so maybe it works better for people will thinner or shorter hair."
1,"I used to spend $20 plus on mascara's bc I have no eyelashes, well small blond ones anyways and this one is less then $7 and works just as good as the department store brand."
1,"A coworker turned me onto the cream in the tube.  I tried hers and was absolutely amazed at how it made my hands feel, so much so that I went to Ride Aid immediately and bought myself a tube.  I've used it over the course of 1 weekend so far and realized two things: 1. It has made a difference in my skin already and 2. I cannot be without this stuff.  So now, the tube that I just bought gets toted around with me everywhere in my purse.  My hands are so grateful :)The only thing is, my Rite Aid only carried a few of these and I am going to invest in the whole line.  I am really wanting to try the foot cream with the shea butter.I also wanted to tell the person who reviewed this item stating that it was a waste of money that I think they are crazy because I can feel this lotion on my hands for a couple of hours after I've applied it.  It does not in any way feel like water.  It feels like a protective coating around your hands and the first time you put your hands in water after applying it, even hours later you will feel it ""washing off"".  It is not greasy whatsoever - it just feels GOOOOOOOOD.Please try it for yourself.  I have severe dry skin and this is the first thing that I've tried that really helps!"
1,"This attaches with silicon glue-stuff, not with suction cups like it's brother with the built-in shelves.  I have both types, and both work great.  I guess the suction cups are because the shelf one also has a hook to hang it from the shower head, even though I don't use that part of it.But as far as the quality of this unit for the $27 I paid:  top notch."
1,"I have been using this hair color for a couple of years. My hair is medium brown and this does get it to blond. However, just like all other hair color formulas, I do have to leave it on a little longer to get to the blond I want (probably 25-30 mins instead of just 20 mins). My hair is not as blond as the girl on the box. However a friend of mine uses this product & her hair is close to the color on the box. She also has been using it for years.The 1* comment claims this is organic. It doesn't claim to be organic, the box says, ""With Selected Organic Ingredients"". When going blond, you are REMOVING your natural hair color, other than the sun, I am not aware of any completely natural way of doing this."
1,I didn't really but this to massage my scalp. My hair tangles fairly easy and I use this in the shower to get the tangles out. Works great too!
1,skin is great
1,"Been using it for years, as it doesn't dry out your skin, and once a week I add baking soda to the mix and get a great facial with it."
1,"This was recommended by my dermatologist.  I use hazel witch astringent to remove oil, then I rub this in just like a lotion...no washing with water...it cleans your face and doesn't over dry it, which can actually cause pimples.  My face never has redness from other cleansers that I've used with water.  Great for sensitive skin and people prone to break outs."
1,I use to use this product religiously but it seems the prices went up. Because of that I don't think I can keep buying it. Maybe if I can find it in a big box store.
1,"Smells nice but takes awhile to sink into skin, face feels wet for awhile. I don't care for that, I'm always in a rush."
1,"This body spray smells really good, sweet, exactly like cotton candy.  The only problem is, it doesn't seem to last very long.  I'm a real stickler for long lasting perfumes, so if it doesn't last long I won't wear it.  I gave it to my granddaughter and she LOVES it."
1,"I love Khakis and moss greens and wanted to try this duo (Paramaribo) . It's amazing,easy to blend and great pigmentation,I applied it before work and it lasted till I took it off at night.After all ,it's NARS ,and I own some other NARS eyeshadows and they are all AMAZING."
1,Works really nicely.  It does not make your face oily at all but give enough moisture where it feels really nice.  I definitely recommend this product.
1,"I used to have extremely dry skin and everyone noticed, it was awful, i hated it so much. Finally a friend who also used to have dry skin recommended this product to me. She has a huge bottle of it at home and during the day she brings a small sample sized bottle of it with her in her purse and she let me try it. That afternoon i drove to the store to buy it.How did i live without it.My skin is no longer dry, its soft and i am so happy. Everyone now asks me now what product i used to get such soft skin. It Is Honestly Silk In A Bottle!!!! I highly recommend this product!!! If you try this product you wont regret it."
1,"I HAVE USED THIS CONDITIONER FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS IT'S THE BEST. WHEN MY HAIR NEED EXTRA CONDITIONING I PUT AN EGG WITH IT. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE INGREDIENTS, I USED YOUR SELENIUM SHAMPOO FOR MANY YEARS, AFTER YOU DISCONTINUED IT I HAVE NEVER FOUND ANYTHING THAT TOOK IT'S PLACE,, EVEN THOUGH I TRIED MOST OF YOUR OTHER SHAMPOOS. I AM HIGHLY ALLERGIC TO MANY HAIR PRODUCTS. THANKS CK"
0,"I bought this cap from another site and although it works well, it cannot get as warm as you'd need it to be for deep conditioning nor does it stay warm for a long time. I used this product ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTIONS and the packs burst and the gel hardened. I called the place I got it from and they do not sell refill packs. I have yet to find any place that does. So now, this product is basically a towel. It was okay while it lasted though but if I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have bought it."
1,"I recently purchased this from a local store, I have to admit I only bought it because it was reduced price.  But I have be using it twice a day for two weeks and the difference in my skin is very apparent.  I am a black 46 yr. old, since using this my skin glows, my cheeks are naturally rosy, my skin tone is evening out and my pores look better.  And my skin is so soft like a baby's.  I will be definitely be using this for quite some time, and the amount you get 6oz. is quite a lot of product.  In addition to my face and neck, I have be using it on hands and they are smoother and less wrinkled.  I wish I could bath in this stuff.  I would highly recommend it and there was little to no smell from the product."
1,"For a long time, I was ignorant in using a smaller round brush, thinking it would do anything for my hair. This large 2 in round brush with ventilation not only styles my hair the way I want it to, but also makes the hair drying process faster."
1,This scent is wonderful. Not overpowering like others I have tried.  Its been on 6 hrs and still smells divine:-)
1,"I noticed a difference the very next morning after using this.  Some of my lines around my mouth were smoother and my face was very hydrated.  They say creams can't really firm, but this one does.  Everyday my face looks better and better."
0,"I read all the positive reviews and decided to give it a try. I am not impressed with these rollers since it takes way too much time (and lots of practice) to get it right. Part of my curls were way too tight, I had to use the blow dryer and a brush to &#34;uncurl&#34; them. Not enough large rollers for my med. long hair, the small ones are useless unless you have real short hair. Also the clamps to hold the rollers leave a mark on the curl which again requires a round brush and a blow dryer to even it out. Another item that will rot away in a drawer since I - regretfully - disposed of the box prior to testing them."
1,"Great hair massaging oil when it is hot. In the winter the coconut oil gets hard and it is difficult to use it. I guess you need to warm it up. The smell is a bit strong, but my dry scalp seems to enjoy it from time to time. It is a bit messy to use it and it has a very oily consistency. Not good as a leave in conditioner for too long. It drips down you face and neck."
1,It's a real peel-off mask. Easy to remove the peel from my face. The only thing is that it's not as moisturizing as I think. Just fine on hydrating.
1,This stuff is amazing!! when u put this on it feels kinda of like mint! It made my skin a lot better! i use this at night and also a little goes a long way!! LOVE THIS &lt;3
1,"I have been pleased with the results of Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Lotion.  The packaging is not fancy, so the price reflects the product, and is reasonable.  The lotion appears to be improving the texture and appearance of lines on my face and neck. As with other Alpha Hydrox products, initial use brings with it a tingling sensation to the skin, but it is not irritating over time.  Overall, the product does what it claims at a no-frills price that I can afford."
1,"I really like these rollers because they don't take a long time to warm up so it make it very easy to roll up my hair and get on my way. I will say that I have shoulder length hair so if you have longer hair it might take longer than it will for me. Like other people posted, the rollers can be a bit hot to the touch when you first take them out of the warmer but just set it down for a minute and it's fine after that. I would've loved to give this product a 5 star review, but I didn't because I don't like the clips that came with them. I purchased pin curl clips and they work really well at holding the rollers in my hair."
1,"It helps with removing dirt from your face & with acne a little also i put it all over my body to keep my skin soft. Once i started doing that my boyfriend said ""your skin feel soft"" lol I'm like okay so it didn't before??? but whatever. Maybe its all in my head but i prefer the original Witch Hazel its like this one is missing something. oh and ladies if you shave use this after to prevent bumps. :)"
1,"I specially love the scent and the lightness that it feels (assuming that you don't grease yourself up with too much oil, and apply as recommended).  You don't need much!!  It smells great, and I love it when my partner loves how I smell, and motivates him to caress and grab me--it draws his attention if you know what I mean. ;)"
1,"I've only been using this for a couple of weeks.  I do not expect miracles but I am hopeful for some improvement.  The tingle I felt was very slight and after 4 days of use, I did not notice it all.But it feels light and goes on smoothly. For this alone I give it 4 stars"
0,"My skin was relatively clear except for some acne on my jawline. I had been using Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Night Moisturizer and it was working wonders. I switched to this product when I noticed the Neutrogena Moisturizer wasn't reducing the jawline acne as much as I wanted and I wanted to try a less expensive night time moisturizer since my face had mostly balanced out.Terrible mistake! I stuck with this product for about a week, to at least give it a chance, but the acne became increasingly worse! Eventually with 5-7 new break outs a day! I stopped and switch back to my Neutrogena Moisturizer, however, the acne this moisturizer caused left me with damaged skin. It's been about a week and a half since I used Aveeno Clear Complexion and I my face is just starting to lose the large, red post-pimple marks. The Aveeno Clear Complexion, during the week of use, caused my pores to become larger and release a lot of oil throughout the day. I'm switching back to Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair."
1,"I've been an Olay user for almost 10 years now, and swear by this brand. In fact, this is the only brand that hydrates my super fussy sensitive/oily skin without making it breakout or leaving it too dry.I used this serum for a week, once a day around my nose area, eyes, laugh lines and frown lines, and put my regular total effects moisturizer over it. It didn't feel greasy, but the areas I put the serum definitely looked greasy, I had to dab extra powder. After a few days, I noticed I was getting breakouts in the areas I put the serum. Too bad, the serum feels good going on, and feels good staying on.So I'm using it just around my eyes for now. If you have oily/acne prone skin, you may want to stay away from this."
1,"By far my all time favorite perfume. I have worn it for years, and still get compliments on it. It smells nice, and a light scent lingers all day long. Also, the scent doesn't clash with the types of scented lotions I wear with it from time to time. Pretty bottle, too!"
1,"I tried this product while looking for a replacement for the Neutrogena Visibly Firm lotion that has now apparently been discontinued.  I am NOT impressed.  It reeks of ""that sunscreen smell"" and leaves my face feeling greasy for hours.  It does not work well under makeup - the face ends up with a somewhat smeary look, similar to the look you get on a hot day when you've been sweating buckets.  Additionally, it causes a very uncomfortable burning sensation if you get even the tiniest bit in an eye.I now only apply this product on my neck and d&eacute;colletage. While it does seem to work pretty well as a moisturizer, I will not be purchasing any more when the two-pack has been used up.Disappointing."
1,"I bought this after seeing it in Cosmo Magazine. It is Princess Kate's favorite polish. I love the way it looks. It is not clear, but not white either. Just a frosted look sort of. But very classy looking and goes with everything. My friends all love it."
1,I have hyperkeratinization and these take care of it. It really helps to keep your dead skin from building up and clogging your pores. They really work.
1,"This is the best all natural deoderant I've ever used.  I have only used the Herbal Scent which is pleasant, not overpowering, but strong enough to cover a man's natural all day musk.The key is you have to shower daily.  Meaning, you can't get away with wearing this all day unless it goes on freshly cleaned armpits.  If you wear this all day, go to sleep and don't have time in the morning to shower, you will stink by that afternoon.  But if you do shower daily (no judgments if you don't), this deoderant is an all-natural wonder.  And I've worn this during hot, humid days in the sun.  And it works!  No rashes or the worries on putting aluminum on your skin.  I am no a lifelong customer!  You should be one too."
1,It doesn't clump.  It gives that perfect hint of color. I love this mascara! Pleased & Totally satisfied with my purchase.
1,I used to inject Botox for my forehead's lines every 6 months these past few years but thanks to this produce I don't think I will never ever again need to do that painful procedure. It's wonderful to wake up in the morning and see your forehead without even a line. I think it has something in it that not only prevents muscles from twitching but also makes the skin a little bit numb. I love it. The only thing you should be concerned about is that you need to apply it every night in order to keep the effect alive and constant and is it really a big problem to stick a small patch every night before going to bed? of course a big NOT!I tried several produces from several companies before this one and what a shame they were useless but this one is a cosmetic miracle for those who don't want to go under painful procedure to snatch their beauty from aging!
1,"The color is gorgeous, the application flawless, the texture like silk,You cant go wrong with this blush.Quick tip, use a kabuki brush ,then blend until desired color achieved.(use a makeup sponge) etc. Amazon did it again with there service!"
1,"Granted, I think it's a little too pricey. It is a great retinol product though. Keeping me looking young. :)"
1,"Loved this lotion.  I saw it on a show on t.v. and bought it to try it out.  I think it smells great, feels great, a little goes a long way so the price is not so bad under those circumstances.  The price is a bit much but when you only need to use a very little bit for a great feel and coverage, the lotion will last a loooonnnnnnggggg time so I don't feel the price is too much for that reason.  I will be purchasing this lotion again and again.  It is wonderful and makes my skin feel soooo very soft and great."
1,"My eleven year old finally stopped biting her nails because of this product.  She said it didn't taste awful, but tasted bad enough to act as a reminder that she was biting her nails.  So it works!"
1,"Thayer's makes one of the best Witch Hazel. This one is no exception, with a lovely natural perfume of pressed rose petals and an added moisturizer from the aloe vera.  I use this everyday and is a must-have in my low-maintenance sulfate-free morning wash regimen.  I recommend to anyone that wants to tone his/her skin without stripping the natural oils."
1,I ordered this for a friend and she is very pleased. She had a hard time locating it elsewhere. She uses it every day and always looks great!
1,This has a nice creamy feel to it and feels good on my skin. It is non irritating and I will order this again.
1,"I have been using the ROC retinol correxion creams for several years and at age 47, IF I have fresh hair color covering my gray, I can pass for 35 or younger EASILY.  I was developing a long horizontal crease on my forehead --&#34; just like my grandmother's forhead &#34; -  and now that crease is barely noticeable!!I have to say that I prefer the night cream even in the daytime because it is MUCH lighter feeling - however I have used both and they DO both work.  I would say that the day cream isn't necessary unless for some reason you feel like you need the added sunscreen.  I will probably only use that one in the summer (I live in Maine) Perhaps if you live in the south, you should consider the day-cream for the purpose of protecting your face from sun damage year-round.Note:  you can sometimes find this at Sam's Club in a two-pack for a better price per unit, BUT you have to buy 2..."
1,"This stuff definitely works! It gets even the toughest eye makeup off without any struggle. It DOES leave a little bit of residue, but it doesn't bother me. I use this BEFORE I wash my face, so I end up washing the residue away once I wash my face. Love this product and will continue to purchase it."
1,This is the brush my husband uses. His first one lasted for years but his one has only lasted about a year. The end tips began falling off pretty quickly.
1,"I'm pretty new at this, but am so far happy with this adhesive. it's good for my dark lashes. right now i'm using individuals and this keep them in all night, which is all i want."
1,"I've been wearing Pheromone on and off since its introduction and consider it my signature scent.  Unlike another reviewer, I find it fine for daytime, though I suppose it may depend on your personality.  I had a lot of attention from coworkers (men) when I was younger and wearing this.  As long as Marilyn keeps making it, I'll keep buying it!I don't see why it's considered light, floral and romantic, though.  I always think it smells like mystery and gold."
1,"Confession: I am a long-time devotee to Burts Beeswax Lip Balm (also available on Amazon). When my lips are really dry, though, I reach for this. It sticks around if I put it on at bedtime, so my lips don't crack. I've never had a cold sore, but I sometimes will cut the corners of my mouth shaving; this keeps them from cracking, shortening healing time.There is no flavor to speak of, and no tingle. It's not as greasy as vaseline, not as waxy as most lip balms, and lasts for longer than any other I've found."
1,"This shower detangler does wonders for my LONG, thick hair! It doesn't pull on my hair and it easily glides through. I definitely recommend!"
1,"I can't say enough about this product, wonderful bubbles, smells famtastic and leaves skin smooth and feeling very clean.  Definitely worth the money."
1,"I heard that serums were great for skin because they are more concentrated and can combat problems more effectively.  The problem is serums can be quite pricey and so I did lots of research to try and get the most out of my money.People raved about Olay so I finally caved.  I have oily/combination skin and also hyperpigmentation.  I figured I would begin twice a day and reduce the application if I found it to be irritating.  This product did not irritate my skin at all, it didn't cause any breakouts or issues with oils. It goes on clear and instantly absorbs.  I use it twice a day (under makeup and under night cream) and it makes my skin feel so smooth.  When combined with my evening moisturizer I feel as if my skin is extremely hydrated.  Best part is no breakouts!  Usually new products cause me to break out a but this serum is wonderful.I did not think my dark spots faded much until I began to put on my make after about 2 weeks of using this regularly and noticed I am using much less foundation and concealer.  I would not call this a miracle worker for anyone who suffers from hyperpigmentation but it can help reduce the appearance a bit.It is a very good serum for anyone just being introduced to serums or does not have any severe skin conditions (ie. cystic acne).  I recommend it!"
0,"I have oily acne prone skin and I started getting fine lines around my eyes. I usually like Neutrogena products but this one is a dud. First, it doesn't lather at all. I've had an issue w/ it actually sliding off my hands a few times since it doesn't lather. Second it has a weird smell. Third it doesn't work. I'm delusional in thinking that a few months using the product will suddenly make my fine lines disappear but there is no difference at all. Plus my skin is still oily and I've broken out several times since I started using it. After this bottle I'm done. I'm in the market for something new."
1,This color went on amazingly well and looked beautiful on my nails. It is definitely one of my favorites and will always keep it in my nail polish collection!
1,Beautiful color! I use it to keep brass out of my hair. This is the only has that has ever worked and made the blonde bits green.
1,"and they work very well. High quality and inexpensive, plus fast shipping. Just add a few tablespoons to a jar filled with salt, and you have your effective, cheap daily shower scrub for dry skin. Also works great on chapped lips and dry hands!"
1,"I bought this over a week ago at target for my combination skin. I break out quite easily on my forehead, and have a few blackheads on my nose. After using once a day, my forehead, chin and cheeks have broken out. And I never break out on my cheeks. On the plus side, my forehead is no longer an oil slick...I understand that products have to clear out the dirt and oil first, but if this doesn't improve in one week, this is going in the trash.3/24Most of the breakouts cleared up with continued use one week after my first review. However, my skin is a bit flaky around my nose. A bit ironic for a moisturizer if you ask me."
1,"I have natural dark brown hair with small amount of gray. this I a very pretty brown red, not that purple red that's so horrid."
1,"I really like this shampoo. My only issue with it is you need a lot of it in order to lather. Mind you my hair is not long nor is it thick (hence the biotin shampoo). But, I will deal with this unless I find another organic shampoo to use. But for now, I'm sticking with it. My hair has been nice and shiny since I started using it. I had an excessive amount of postpartum hair loss and was trying to find something gentle on my hair that would improve it's health and thickness. Whether this is helping I'm not sure. I'm also taking Biotin and prenatal vitamins still, but it's definitely not hurting."
1,"These are super soft and lint free. The best thing is that they don't absorb too much product. Some of my lotions and toners are quite expensive and after months of use, these actually will help you save quite a bit of product. Great for removing eye makeup and using as DIY masks as well. I would absolutely give the product five stars but the only thing is that the one that qualifies for Amazon Prime shipping costs a lot more than other sellers. I rather get it for almost half the price from Sephora or etc.Update:I'm glad that the price has been lowered significantly. Changing from 3 stars to 4!"
1,"This is one of my favorites! So glad I took a chance and bought this scent :) I only wish the tube lasted longer! It is such a great, clean scent-not overpowering and the staying power on your hands is amazing-your hands (feet too!) really feel wonderful after lotion is applied!"
1,"This product is so cool. It covers the grey at my temples and around hairline perfectly. The color is perfect for my hair. I color with Nice N Easy Dark Neutral Blonde. It stays until I wash it out, but I reapply every morning even between washes, due to face washing, as I use right along the hairline mostly. There is no scent and the product is like a heavy lipstick or concealer makeup. Will definitely purchase again, but it will be a while, this is a lot of product for a little price and I don't have to use much at all for my needs."
1,So i was a bit skeptical about this product at first. I tried it for a whole week and let me tell you-brighten skin tone-acne going away-old acne scars fading-new acne scars fading-softnes-smoothnessI just dont really like the smell. I did a patch test as they said. It burns on acne marks alil but no harm just working.How I use it before I go to bed i apply a peas size that all. I even started using it for my toes knuckles they have gotten hard from last summer.. and its helping!!
1,"I have been using this for about a month now. I can certainly see a difference! My hair is fuller, is more manageable, and feels clean. I bought this because of a receding hairline. It has helped! Although, I can pick this up at VitaminShoppe in northwest Indiana for about $7 a bottle."
1,"I love this serum with sunscreen you get the best of both worlds. Goes on smooth, smells nice, and gives me great moisture. I know i'm doing something good for my skin"
0,"This hair color i think is ok.I think it has way too much blue though and should have more black.Everyone was telling me you have blue hair!!! And another negative was that it faded the second day, a week later my dark brown hair was back and my bangs were still blue. Not a good black hair dye. Try ultimate black instead does not fade!!!"
0,"This product was tried on a thumb sucker and a nail biter.  It did not work for either.I felt terrible after using it, it made my 7 year old vomit.  As for the thumb sucker, he didn't care, he just kept right on sucking his thumb.  The smell of this stuff is very, very strong.  If the child touches ANYTHING, the taste and smell will get on that item.  If your child, for example, is going to eat a banana, they will get the taste/smell of this in their mouth/nose.  When it is on, it's hard to have their hands even near your face, it's so disgusting.  I would never put this on another child.  Even as an adult, just lifting your coffee cup to your face you'll be able to smell it, get the taste, from your hands.  We can't recommend this for any child and will keep looking for solutions to our thumb sucker and nail biter. I was hopeful after reading the reviews, but we are deeply disappointed.  This is just awful."
1,"I love this product. Have used this for years. Thank you Maybelline. And yes, I have used Maybelline for years."
1,"I put this on before I go to bead and when I wake up it's gone. When it dries, it dries as a powder which is why it doesn't stay on. It'd be unrealistic to expect it to stay on but maybe some modifications should be made so the lotion stays on for a bit longer. I don't see how the lotion could help shrink pimples when it only stays on for less than two hours.I find that this works best with pimples that already have a white tip. Put it on when you get home from work so it can work on your blemishes as you're up and about."
1,Fantastic Product - been using for a long time - my hair stylist recommended it for my hair thinning and it's absolutely AMAZING
1,My hand needed a lotion that would not get all over me.  I knit a lot and that dries my hands so it is great.
1,"You cant go wrong with this soap. It's gentle on sensitive skin and it is beautiful and see through  ,nice to look at while you use it."
1,This mascara is always perfect.  Don't use the waterproof...Brownish Black works well with lighter eyes for a daytime look.Very Black gives a more intense lash for evening.
1,I've been using Olay Regenerist cream for a few years now and am very happy with the results. I added the serum to my morning and evening routine and found that it has made a difference in my skin. I like the fragrance-free version.
1,This works similar to the Proactiv sulfur mask for me. I dip a q-tip down in to the liquid and then cover my zit(s) with a pretty decent layer of it.Over a day or so it definitely shrinks them down a bit.
0,"This hair dye sucks bad. I should have listened to the bad reviews, they're everywhere, and they're right. I only ignored them because I thought this brand had the only semi-permanent dye on the market for natural colors but then later I found out Garnier has the semi-permanent HerbaShine one. I'll be using that one next.My hair is naturally dirty blonde and straight/thin. This left my hair a really weird red color. No hints of purple at all. It left my roots CLOWN RED for some reason, and the rest of my hair a different darker shade. The color is extremely patchy and I somehow missed a ton of spots. I think this is due to the instructions saying you must have DAMP hair before you dye it. So annoying. How can you tell where you need dye if your hair is already wet?The color is very dull and it looks like I'm wearing a Halloween wig. It's just really bad. I left it on for 20 minutes instead of 10.I don't recommend this at all.I refuse to use the 2 week refresher because reviews say it's even worse than the dye itself."
1,"I've been using this lotion for a couple of months now. It's nice and works well as a lotion, but it has yet to get rid of my &#34;chicken skin&#34; as a lot of users said it would. I put it on every night and have not seen much of an improvement. I will continue to use it until it runs out, but probably won't buy it again."
1,"Extended my manicure 3 days... fantastic! (I'm sorry, but why must this be a certain number of words?  I'm happy with it because it made my manicure last longer; isn't that enough?  Geez, Amazon!)"
1,"Not sure if this plumps up lips or makes them appear fuller because it fills in creases, but I love what it does. I put some on my finger before putting it on as I do not want the wand picking up lipstick pigment."
1,This color is just right because you can adjust the amount to keep it light or darken it.  Works great as eyeliner too!
1,"I started using this in combination with their night recovery cream. I couldn't be happier. I look at least five years younger and it has taken away that tired, drawn look.  My skin is softer and brighter.  My wrinkles are much less noticable. More importantly, as I have tried tons of products, it has reduced my under eye circles. This is no small feat. I have super dark blue, very hollow/sunken-in circles that, even with cover up, are still dark and shadowed because they are sunk in. This has plumped up the skin below my eyes, and, in addition to getting rid of much of the wrinkling, it has made it easier to put cover-up on the remaining discoloration, as it has taken away at least half of the sunken in look and the darkness. Really a big difference in only a week of using these products. I highly recommend this!"
1,"I didn't find this product to work as well as I had hoped.  I have enjoyed other products from PCA, so I find the brand to be one that can be trusted in most instances."
1,"I've spent a lot of money buying top line products for my kitchen in the past few years and always come back to this brand. It is actually worth every penny and you only need a little to rid hands of kitchen smells, cut grease all while smelling so nice (unisex) and leaving hands so soft. I can feel the olive oil in the soap while washing hands but it does not leave hands oily. This product is wonderful. I decided to replace the soaps in my guest bath with this and the matching lotion which is also incredible and use in kitchen as well. In fact I will eventually replace all my bathroom hand wash with this. The scent is lovely, fresh and clean. Coriander and Olive is my favorite scent in this line and I also use the dish washing soap and hand creme. Be on the lookout for some of the beautiful bottles offered with this hand wash. They are ever so classy, classic and effective. You will fall in love with this refill as it is price effective."
1,"I was starting to get a lot of breakouts, even though I was in my 40's. I was trying everything out there, and nothing was working. I had used this product a long time ago, and started using it again. I can't go without it! My breakouts have decreased by at least 90% after using this product.  Highly recommended!!"
1,I use this under any moisturizer that I use. It has helped my eyebrows and eyelashes grow!!! Put a little dab of this on your eyelashes and eyebrows at night and you will see the growth !i love this little magic in a bottle!
1,"After searching and using different soaps and facial cleansers, I've finally settled on Philosphy's Purity.  Love the way it cleanses my skin, it feels soothing and doesn't dry out my skin.  I like the smell and it feels refreshing."
1,"This cream is teriffic for dry, chapped, cracked hands. This cream is totally non-irritating and totally fragrance free. I slather it on at night and wear a pair of inexpensive white cotton gloves, although you don't really need them because the cream is not greasy.White Cotton Parade Gloves(By the way, no need to buy expensive ""medical"" gloves--the cheap ones work fine.) Works like a charm! Also keeps cuticles soft and preserves that manicure. Highly recommended!"
1,"I love this Essie nail polish Mademoiselle , it makes me feel like a Mademoiselle when I wear it ,it is a beautiful color sheer looking and kept my nails strong everyone noticed my nails when I went to visit my friend at a hospital the nurses kept coming in and out of the room noticing my nails finally I told them it's Essie nail polish Mademoiselle they all went wow,I said yeah it is a wow color,one of the nurses was a male he even liked the color kept starring at my nails.amazon thank you as always for bringing us the customers great products for lower prices,and I told the nurses get it at amazon they have the best prices."
1,"I have tried all kinds of oils over the years to combat dry skin.  I love this Neutrogena body oil, I love the large bottle it comes in, it has a great flip top that makes it easy to use, without making a huge oily mess.  It smells great, it goes on smoothly and is easy to blend in.  I will be ordering more of this, it works so well.  It has helped me get rid of a patch of very dry skin I had on the back of my neck.  I just put this on after a shower, when the skin is still moist.  It really moisturizes and isn't greasy."
1,"I used to have more of a dry/normal skin type but as normal..skin changes over time, and for me mine has been changing to be more on the oily side and where occasional breakouts have now become a persistent thing. For a while I have already been using cleansers that target acne and didn't see much improvement. It took me a while to realize that maybe it was time I changed my moisturizer too (Duh!). My previous moisturizers were those for normal/dry and those that claim to be &#34;for all skin types&#34; (lies!!!!) so this is my first time trying a moisturizer that targets oily/combo skin.I've used this for only 2 days now but I have felt and seen instant results. I truly believe it has helped  keep the oils at bay and in turn keep my acne from continuing to swell or creating more. I was concerned that it would have more of a drying affect and leave any dry spots noticeable, but surprisingly it did not!A lot of pros:*Lightweight*Unscented*Not greasy*Not sticky*Dries almost a matte finish so you don't look shiny*While it helps to stop the oil from surfacing,  it still keeps your skin very moisturized.I'm pretty impressed with this moisturizer.  Other moisturizers tend to leave your skin sticky and shiny but this did not and it just made my skin look like bare, ungreasy, unshiny skin!! (just with pimples that are hopefully leaving soon).In case you were wondering:I use this with the Neutrogena Deep Clean Cream Cleanser and a Murad cleanser that I switch between. Also, I find that powder/mineral foundation has helped to add that extra layer of oil stopping fighting power."
1,the latex base wouldn't stick to my eyelids so I ended up giving it to a friends. She love it.
1,"This powder/foundation is the best color match I have ever found, plus it has great coverage without being too matte/heavy, when applied with a good-quality, natural hair powder brush.I love MAC products, usually, just not this one.I think it contains mineral oil, probably in very high concentration. Every time I use it near my chin and nose, I break out, badly. The rest of my face gets red and itchy, too. I'm apparently allergic to mineral oil, and when I stopped using this makeup, the breakouts stopped, too.I switched to a synthetic brush at first, thinking that the natural animal hair was the problem, but it didn't help. I switched to Bare Minerals, trying to get a more natural product with the same coverage as this makeup offered, but that didn't work, either--that brand is too sheer and the color match just wasn't as good as MAC. Bare Minerals did feel light-weight on my face and was nice for summer, though.I don't like liquid foundations, or I'd try MAC's Studio Fix Liquid version, which I hear is 100% mineral-oil free. the reason I don't like liquid foundations or concealers, is because they're harder to take with you and apply when you're on the go, or can't get in front of a mirror somewhere to see what you're doing. I'm on the run and also travel a lot, and I wanted one thing that was easy to pack, that I can carry with me in a coat pocket or very small purse, that works well, and isn't outrageously expensive.Any suggestions/good alternatives to this one, ladies?"
1,"This is scented, so sensitive skins may react. I love the scent, and the glycerine leaves skin soft. Many men like this soap for their face. The scent is clean and not overly feminine. The bar will &quot;sweat&quot; in summer, so keep it in a dish that drains well."
1,"I haven't used it long enough to know how well it will work but I appreciate how quickly the lotion gets absorbed.  The thing I'm confused about is that this is a product recommended by Dr. Lee, yet the packaging shows that the progesterone comes from wild yams which Dr. Lee says not to use.  If anyone has a clarification I'd love to hear it."
1,"I love these! I use them when I'm in between my botox treatments. I really feel like they help me get through an extra month, or so then I don't have to get my botox so soon after it wears off. I suggests these inexpensive little patches to anyone! I love them! I think they are easy to put in place and they stay in place when I am ready to take them off."
1,"I have known this product for 20 years; the good thing is they have not changed the formula, which is great; probably one of the best creams out there! The only thing they have changed is the packaging. Very natural product, no bad stuff in it!"
1,Moisturizes great and smells sooo goood!!! Love that cherry almond scent. Just like the jergen's cherry almond but on your cuticles. Very happy. Try to use every day and cuticles are softer and less hangnails.
1,"I started to break out in a rash under my arms. HUH ? So, I tried letting it all clear up, but every time I used an anti-perspirant again... BLAM ! IT WAS BACK. I eat a lot of veggies and herbs. I really can't do without an anti-perspirant. Deodorants only mix with the odor and get more potent during the workday. I was DESPARATE. Almay is THE answer. No more rash, no more odor. Whew. The things we take for granted until something changes. Thanks, Almay"
1,My cuticle are always dry. Massaging this into them has helped them so much and they are much softer now!
1,"I bought this along with the DHS Zinc shampoo by advice of my dermatologist.  I have psoriasis and extremely sensitive skin. I can use both with no problems. This product is perfect for the ""other day"" shampooing. (I like to switch my shampoo and conditioning every other day) This shampoo does the job, cleanses without drying or irritation and that's all I need. I love that it doesn't have any perfumes added. I really hate all those shampoos and conditioners that are so ridiculously overly scented that give me a headache directly out of the shower. Well anyway that enough of my ranting. I just wanted to add a positive post for those of you that are thinking about it but can't make up your mind.  As I said its good for people with sensitivities or that are easily irritated. If you are looking for something high performance shampoo then this may not be the one for you."
1,I really like this polish. OPI s always good quality and this on is no exception. It goes on nicely and it is such a pretty color.
