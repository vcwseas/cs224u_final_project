1,"At the time this album was released (1992), this type of music was called ""alternative metal,"" but this album (""Meantime""), and this band (Helmet) were, for all intensive purposes, the start of the genre that we know today as nu-metal. Its heavy riffs, stop-start rhythms, and soft-hard song structures were the motivating force behind many `90's hard rock bands. Thus, Helmet should definitely be considered one of the most influential and important rock bands of the 1990's. Even super-influential bands like Korn, Pantera and Tool have cited Helmet as an influence.Musically, it's clearly evident that frontman Page Hamilton listened to a lot of Black Sabbath while making this record. ""Meantime"" is full of sludgy riffs and even some Ozzy-esque vocals (which are especially apparent on the song ""Unsung"").Songs like ""Ironhead,"" ""Give It,"" ""He Feels Bad,"" and ""You Borrowed"" best illustrate Helmet's famous stop-start rhythms (and ""Ironhead"" even has fast, almost galloping guitars), and ""Unsung"" and ""Turned Out"" have the aforementioned sludgy riffs, which lurch and almost bob. Elsewhere,""In the Meantime"" has a heavy, grooving main riff, ""Better"" and ""Role Model"" should quench your cravings for a heavy song (""Better"" has some heavy yells, and ""Role Model"" has heavy, churning riffs), and ""F.B.L.A. II"" has a guitar solo and some everything-but-the-kitchen sink drumming.For whatever reason, this album has aged very well (better than most nu-metal records). This may be because Helmet were such an original band, or maybe because Page isn't constantly yelling about ""nookies"" and hatred. Or maybe it's because ""Meantime"" has a few guitar solos, and guitar solos are foreign to almost all other nu-metal bands. But, whatever the reason, Helmet are not normally grouped with nu-metal bands, so they are one of the few bands whose albums sales didn't plummet when nu-metal collapsed. Thus, it's OK if your friends know you listen to Helmet--they won't laugh at you.In conclusion, this is where nu-metal began, so if you hate nu-metal, you should hate these guys; but everybody who enjoys nu or alternative metal, and those who are fans of Korn, Deftones, Tool, etc. should definitely check out ""Meantime."" And even if you don't listen to Helmet, you should definitely give them props for essentially being a modern day Black Sabbath and creating a whole genre--even though that genre would die off about a decade later."
1,"At this point only three albums into his solo career,a lot of things were happening in the music world around Brian McKnight. A talented singer/composer/producer/musician he was not only from a very strong musical pedigree,but had a distinct advantage during this particular time as well. McKnight was at this point witnessing the end of the hip-hop/soul boom of the mid to late 1990's and entering into what was basically the modern R&B; era based primarily in some variation on an Arabic/Classical mixture and a 2-step dance beat which actually has defined the R&B;/hip-hop world up to this very day. Because of his musical ability however,he was able to find ways to make these sorts of awkward moments work more to his own favor.As usual for McKnight he seems to have no end of catchy,melodic,midtempo rhythmic love songs such as the title song,the more 70's flavored ""Could"",""Show me The Way Back To Your Heart"",""You Got The Bomb"" and ""Hold Me"". These are more of the same sort of songs that established his signiture sound. On some of the uptempo songs,things become very interesting very fast. ""You Should Be Mine (Don't Waste Your Time)"",""Everytime We Say Goodbye"" and ""Jam Knock"" are filled with guitar/bass and drum loops that sound like they came from contemporary live musicians. It's a move heavily grooved based sound,towards the funk. And they work extremely well. Later in the album the flavor gets extremely on the lightly oriental type melody of ""Til I Get Over You"" and the elaborately orchestrated ""I Belong To You"" and the gospel of ""When The Chariot Comes"".In a lot of ways there aren't many albums that complete such a broad picture of Brian McKnights talents as this one. His career has never been built on eveness and consistancy. But here you have his trademark slower jams,excellent uptempo numbers that are among the best and most funk oriented he ever made and epic numbers with this strong cinematic flavor that point the way to the future. After this album the future would be quite different where McKnight was concerned however. He would find himself on Motown after this for a stint of about half a decade. And this album serves as a transitional effort between the earlier and later period of his musical career as a result."
1,"Though I prefer his work in The Eagles, I really love Don Henley's solo work as well. He didn't have nearly as much hits on his own as he did with that band, but nonetheless quite a few of his solo recordings became very popular and made the Top 40. ""Actual Miles: Henley's Greatest Hits"" gives us 13 of those hit singles, and though it's missing a few essential tracks, it still is a very good.Anyone interested in Henley's solo work should find most of what they're looking for on here. You get the big hits (""Dirty Laundry"", ""The Boys Of Summer"", ""All She Wants To Do Is Dance"", ""The End Of The Innocence""), popular radio hits (""Not Enough Love In The World"", ""Sunset Grill"", ""The Heart Of The Matter"") and a two very good (then) new tracks, ""You Don't Know Me At All"" and ""Everybody Knows"". So, if you're a casual fan, you pretty much have all you need.However, there are a few glaring omissions. Henley's first solo chart hit, ""Johnny Can't Read"", has been omitted. Also, two big hits he did as duets with female solo artists. First, the number six hit ""Leather And Lace"" that he did with Stevie Nicks (his onetime lover) has been cut off. That's sad since that is a song I love. Also, his number two smash duet with Patti Smyth, ""Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough"" has been cut off. Granted, thise songs were not on Henley's albums but on his duet partner's albums, but they still should have included them anyway. Also, I also would have settled for a solo perfomance of one his Eagles tracks, preferrably ""Hotel California"". Also, since this collection came in 1995, you won't get his 2001 hit ""Taking You Home"".Other than these munor complaint, ""Actual Miles"" is an excellent representation of Henley's solo career that should appeal to most."
1,"Anyone who's ever stepped foot in a bar or put money in a jukebox is more than familiar with the work of John Mellencamp.  His earthy pairing of rock and country, not to mention lyrics that often celebrate the American dream  as well as its disillusions, produces a down-home feel that appeals to any  hard-working guy sidling up to the bar for a cold one.  Listening to a  Mellencamp record always sounds like you're sitting in on a jam session;  the musicianship is tight as can be but it still sounds like everybody's  hanging loose.  This compilation, then, featuring almost all of his major  hit singles, sounds like a party from start to finish.Early hits like  &quot;I Need a Lover&quot; and &quot;Ain't Even Done With the Night&quot;  still hold up well, and even the most modern rock would be hard-pressed to  match the weight of the grooves found in &quot;Hurt So Good&quot; and  &quot;Jack and Diane.&quot;  The songs that proved him heir to the  Springsteen throne, &quot;Pink Houses&quot; and &quot;Small Town,&quot;  still sound as earnest as they did upon release, and if ever a pair of pop  songs justified testing the volume limit of your stereo, they would be  &quot;Lonely Ole Night&quot; and &quot;Crumblin' Down.&quot;To have the  collection stop at 1988 is puzzling, however; this leaves out his amazing  cover of &quot;Wild Night&quot; with Me'shell N'Degeocello, and the two  major VH1 staples from his &quot;Mr. Happy Go Lucky&quot; release,  &quot;Key West Intermezzo (I Saw You First)&quot; and &quot;Just Another  Day.&quot;  Had these been included (instead of the less-deserving  &quot;Check it Out,&quot; a &quot;Cherry Bomb&quot; knockoff) the  compilation would have felt a touch more complete.  Still, you hold in your  hands thirteen classic examples of down-home, feel-good rock, one of which  is a brand-new cut (the impressive &quot;Without Expression&quot;).  Get  your friends to a pool hall, order a round of brews, drop a couple of bucks  into the jukebox, and enjoy."
1,"Coming close behind &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot;, &quot;Rock of the Westies&quot; is  a hard act to follow. Yet it succeeds admirably, as one of Elton John's finest during his classic vintage years. Without a doubt, it's his hardest rocking album. The finest songs include the hits &quot;Island Girl&quot;, &quot;Grow Your Funk On Your Own&quot; and &quot;I Feel Like A Bullet (In the Gun of Robert Ford&quot;; the latter his best ballad since &quot;Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me&quot;. Yet there are also neglected treasures such as &quot;Feed Me&quot;, &quot;Street Kids&quot;, among others. Unlike his previous albums, &quot;Caribou&quot;, and &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot;, there's no track here which can be regarded as filler. I doubt I've heard Elton's vocals in finer form during this time, and he sings well with great range and conviction. He's also backed by a terrific band, featuring guitarist Caleb Quaye, bassist Kenny Passarelli, keyboard wizard James Newton Howard (who's now a celebrated Hollywood film composer), drummer Roger Pope, and of course, percussionist Ray Cooper and guitarist Davey Johnstone. The sound quality is better than that on my old LP. This is definitely one of Elton John's essential CDs."
1,"The radio edits are actually kind of fun.  This was back in days of  re-recording the vocal track with a new set of lyrics, and some of them  make more sence then the dirty version (&quot;This DJ&quot; for example).  I personally like the clean version of &quot;Do You See&quot; as well.....  It's almost like looking at the album in a new perspective.  Some of the  tracks are just edited, with out new vocals (however they are mostly  non-singles, &quot;This Is The Shack&quot;, etc...)  This album is a  Hip-Hop classic, and almost every song on here is classic as well, (except  maybe &quot;Runnin' Wit No Breaks&quot;).  The clean version is almost as  tight as the dirty version, and that says a lot about an album."
1,"The third solo release, In A Major Way, from the self-proclaimed ""Ambassator of the Bay"" delivers a complete project with mainstream success.  E-40 speaks over ""Intro"" as he gives the ingredients contained in this album that ties with ""Da Bumble"" both produced by Sam Bostic & Mike Mosley with speed variences.  The objective is definately arranged for the trunk as 40 Water flows without any hooks, chorus or breaks, but his original multi-styled flow with charisma and energy as quoted ""...he say / she say / b*tch, that away...""  ""Sideways"" featuring B-Legit & Mac Shon is for the riders hitting the strip or the block as E and B share verses highlighted by the catchy hook.  ""...big timer, timer / 40 water..."" ""Sprinkle Me"" featuring Suga T had all the perfect elements with a memerable hook, perfect delivery and production makes this a highlight with a mainstream feel.  Taking it to the streets with all star support from 2Pac, Mac Mall & Spice 1 on ""Dusted 'N' Disgusted"" as each shined with their signature flow.  Performed as a letter to a friend in jail ""1-Luv"" featuring Leviti poses the reality of simply living and E-40 did not miss a beat.  Relating to getting high and getting drunk for serious smokers and drinkers, ""Smoke 'N' Drank"", was written with just that in mind.  ""Dey Ain't No"" is dark with an incessant deep bass enriched by a piano silhouette to give this LP a more street feel.  Speaking about the street games, E-40 spits on how to invest into businesses for a legal hustle on ""Fed"" featuring Suga T.  Sharing verses with B-Legit & Celly Cel representing the ""H.I. Double L."" side of Vallejo, California on how they live.  ""It's All Bad"" is about life in the ghetto and changing times comparing it to excerpts found in the Bible.  This song was enlighened at the conclusion with a surprise guest by E-40's son with a solid performance.  The ""Outro"" only left the listener craving another dosage of this sixteen track album."
1,"This may be heresy to some people, but Disraeli Gears is tied with ""Days of future past"" by the Moody blues as the best rock album of 1967. Yes, I even think both of them are better than Sgt.Peppers by the Beatles! The other albums just about as good as this from the late 60's are the Moody Blues ""On the threshold of a dream"", ""Led Zeppelin II"", and ""Abbey Road"" by the Beatles. This is not nearly as bluesy as ""Fresh Cream"", but it's got more good songs than that one does. I won't mention the two main hits because everybody knows those epic tracks, but the tunes that I like best are ""SWLABR"", ""Tales Of Brave Ulysses"", ""Dance the night away"", ""World of pain"", ""Take it back"", and ""Blue Condition"". I don't have this remastered version, but have the first issue from the 80's, and it sounds just right to me sonically. This is the only Cream album that I ever liked totally, but each album had at least a handful of good tunes. Enjoy!!!"
1,"In the Mid-90's, There were a hot bed of rappers that hit the G-Funk bandwagon.  Warren G was one for sure.  But I have to say, he has just the right personality to make it big.  He is intelligent, reflective, fun to listen to, and has a good, rhythmic flow.  He spends less time cussing, and more time reflecting on life, having fun, and surviving in Long Beach, Ca.  For only having 12 tracks (2 being skits), there is little room for filler.  No problem, there is no filler here, just vintage west coastin' beats and awesome rhymes from G-Dub.  G-Dub is a great storyteller.  Every joint is the bomb!  ""So Many Ways"" to me, is a nice lyrical joint where G-Dub and the Twinz wreck shop and buck down wanna be's over a sunshine gold'd's and palm tree's style beat that made 1994 my favorite year in rap.  This album stands as one of them that made me a passionate G-Funk fan.  This album is the definitive G-Funk album in my opinion!  ""And Ya Don't Stop"" took awhile to grow on me, but the sweet beat took over and Warren's dope flow had me shook!  He may not break new ground in a lyrical sense, but I love his flow, and his lyrics bring me to when hip-hop was tight; Warren G is hip-hop, and he shows it throughout.  ""This DJ"" is the laidback party jam with the sweet whiny synth and smoked out beat.  ""What's Next"" gets it a lil more gangsta with Warren G and Malik trading spitfires over yet another sweet sunny beat.  Warren produces his own beats here, and his beats are among the best in the industry, especially here.  How could any serious head hate on a joint like this one.  Any hip hop heads should have this in their rap collection."
1,"This album was Spice's second major label release and it is a good one.  Not his best work, but then it's hard if (according to me) all of his albums are worthy of 4 stars (at the least) and most are 5 star classics.  Production is good and handled by Ant Banks, EA Ski, Prodeje of South Central Cartel, Too $hort, DJ Xtra LArge, and Johnny Z.  Guests are few (on 3 of the 14 songs).  It has 1 classic, 2 near classics, 9 good songs, and 1 that's ok and 1 that I skip.  This was recorded when he was only about 22, but he holds it down for the East Bay.

1,"bought this one for a friend and its one of those every day rotation disc that stays in the player according to him. this is your next stop after makaveli, this one is everyones top 10 rap list. order one for yourself, order another for your best friend."
1,"this has the famous songs from the album back in the day.  some of the songs on this CD are i feel the earth move, you've got a friend and so far away.  and the sound is great.  a keeper."
1,"Really, who can resist bursting out laughing when George shouts that line out in the middle of Flash Light? Not me, that's for sure. This is a classic, arguably the best Parliament album (though one could make a case for Mothership Connection). Like Mothership Connection, it's a concept album that doesn't take itself even remotely seriously. On the contrary, it's a riot.First off is Bop Gun (Endangered Species). What a song! Funky bassline, great ensemble vocals, cool horn chart and an awesome fake ending... classic stuff there. Then comes the first of the two ten-minute grooves: Sir Nose D'voidoffunk (Pay Attention - B3M), which introduces ol' Smell-O-Vision himself, Sir Nose D'Voidoffunk. This song is arguably the funniest in Parliament's catalogue, and certainly one of the funkiest. The clever, charming Wizard of Finance is a more Motown-sounding song, with a great bassline and horn part. It's funny, too!Now for Funkentelechy, arguably Parliament's best song EVER. It's a monster eleven-minute groove that'll have you dancing and laughing at the same time. The basic concept of the song: choose funk (which stands for all that is good) over the fake, material things in the world. Maybe I'm overanalyzing, but whatever. It's great. Placebo Syndrome is probably the weakest song here, but it's still pretty good, with a solid groove. The Placebo Syndrome, if you were curious, is disco (which stands for all that is fake and material). The whole thing closes out with Flash Light, which revives the Nose. This ended up their biggest hit, a masterpiece with great bassline, a hilarious chant taken from a Bar Mitzvah, cool fake ending, and Clinton yelling out ""Dance, sucka!"" - two words that sum this album up perfectly.Ah, yeah... THIS is how ya play funk!"
1,"I bought the LP in 1963.  Up to that point I had only heard his debut album, ""PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE"" and some singles I had purchased.  The original LP was a mind blower, and none of the rereleases have matched the sound of the simple mono LP.  The early and middle sixties were really, in my opinion, James' greatest days as a vocalist and a showman.  The band was also terrific.  The funk years found him demanding the groove, and finally, when his great voice began to fail, simply holding on.This CD is OK if you want a taste of the great JB, as a great R&B; performer.  To those that are unaware, the ""extras"" are simply  recorded edits from the album which were used to fill up 45 re-releases some years later."
1,"I will also member his the voice in the radio station 101.1 FM in NY City. He give so much to music that I love so much myself, thanks. David"
1,"I'll get the Doggystyle comparisons out of the way first, I was only young when both albums were released so didn't buy either until recently, however I can see how at the time people would have been dissapointed.  Doggystyle is in my opinion one of the best albums of all time, it is an absolute classic, due to his murder case amongst other things, his follow up was delayed by years.  This was an extremely anticpated album, and frankly it comes nowhere near Doggystyle, but people giving Tha Doggfather 1 and 2 stars are being unfair, you should review thew album on how it sounds, not how it compares to Doggystyle.I have rounded my review up to 4 stars, which is generous this is a good album but nothing more, it is nowhere near as bad as some people make out though.  In total there are 5 skits (too many) and 16 songs in total, the majority of these songs are actually good, though I wouldn't say any are classics.  Favourites include the title track Doggfather, Gold Rush, You Thought, Snoop's Upside Ya Head and Vapors, which is an excellent track and the best on the album.  Lyrically the album is good, Snoop's flow doesn't quite fit the beats like it did on Doggystyle though, and some of the production is mediocre (some of Daz beats are below his usual best).I would reccomend anyone to buy Doggfather, it is a good album when reviewed on it's own merit, we all know it's not his best work (apart from the reviewer below), but it shouldn't be slept on.  Check it out, but if your don't own any Snoop albums, you should already know what to check first."
1,i had this cd back in the days and it broke got me a new one brings back memories. lovely cd.
1,"Daryl Hall still retains his dynamic, soulful voice, which continues to be one of the most beautiful instruments in pop-soul.  This contemporary, yet timeless, slice of Philadelphia International soul is a must-buy for us Daryl Hall John Oates complete collectionists.The standout track is the magnificent ""I'm in a Philly Mood.""  It is the perfect ""quiet storm"" style R & B ballad.  While no other track comes close to scaling this heighth, they create a soulful atmosphere.  You could even call it a ""Philly mood,"" if you were so inclined."
1,"The O'Jays were at the height of their fame in 1973 when this album was released and was immediately one of the most popular records heard at parties and on radio stations. The title track is a moving retelling of the awful legacy of the slave trade and what will be America's greatest shame for all time. Relationships with women are examined here as well, with the fine song, ""You Got Your Hooks in Me"" and ""Now That We Found Love"". The importance of a meaningful system of values is the theme of ""For the Love of Money"", and ""Don't Call Me Brother"" is an acknowledgment that your neighbor and street corner buddy can be your worst enemy. Sage lyrics and wonderful message music from Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff."
1,"I believe that this is a very strong album BUT I must say that ""Get Lucky"" is better.  This album is just slightly ""too pop.""  ""Get Lucky"" is very ""pop"" as well, but it rocks better and harder than this one in my opinion.I rate and recommend Loverboy albums like this:#1 - ""Get Lucky""#2 - ""Loverboy""#3 - ""Keep It Up""Everything after ""Keep It Up,"" other than the song ""Lovin' Every Minute Of It"" is pure crap.  Trust me."
1,It's amazing how well this album stands up over 20 years.I wasn't really into this when it came out. It didn't seem as fresh as their first album and this one came out about six months after 'The Chronic' so obviously hip hop fans were heavily intoxicated by that G-funk sound.This album was totally different but very good in a more narrow way.
1,"Another vote for Boss Guitar for the best Wes Montgomery record of all time. These remastered series are limited, and the sound is so much better than the regular CD that you wont believe it. This is essential listening."
0,"Well, let's not deny the impact Shania Twain's looks have on record sales. Twain is absolutely one of the most beautiful women I've seen and she can also sing - that's good but not essential for success. ""Come on over"" is mainly country-pop of rather harmless character and songs like ""Man I feel like a woman"" and ""Don't be stupid"" is alright. The big hit ""That don't impress me much"", which by the way isn't sounding anything like country is a great song, but the rest of the material is very mediocre. I guess country music as a genre were in need of something to still be appealing, but I doubt this commercialization is the right way to go. To me it sounds a bit lifeless and without soul. I put my hope to the likes of Steve Earle and Jayhawks instead."
1,i love this cd it was the 1st Alice in chains  cd i ever boughti love it because of the grunge guitar and layne voice justabsolutly amazing can say this is their best album that they putout so if you're looking for true alice in chains get this cd
1,"I don't know much about the whole psychedelia concept-album schtick that the Moodies were channeling when they laid down this great album - my folks were getting married at about this time. So it doesn't evoke halcyon days for me - I'd like to think I can just listen to it as a pure musical event, and as such although I don't rate it as their best album, I can wholeheartedly recommend it as an ensemble of gorgeous tunes, surpassing musicianship and some searingly perfect singing (check out the 2nd verse and chorus of ""The Actor"", the peak of the set, IMHO).The album opens with ""Departure"" - which is edgy and manic, someone losing their mind in 52 easy seconds, before segueing into ""Ride my See-Saw"", a rocky little number with rat-race lyrics and a sweet guitar solo from Hayward. Some folks denigrate ""Dr. Livingstone I Presume"" but I cannot agree. Sure it's a little dopey (polar bears in the Antarctic?) but the chorus is catchy.I never really liked ""House of Foor Doors"" - or at least the ""song""-parts. The instrumental breaks are superb - one always remembers that the Moodies played all this THEMSELVES and is suitably awestruck.""Legend of a Mind"" is an acknowledged classic that has its detractors. I don't believe it to be a pro-LSD song, or at least it is too ambiguous to support that conclusion without qualification. The musicianship is superb - Ray Thomas' flute playing is masterly, and the ending is hard-driving sonic bliss. However, I rate ""Our Guessing Game"" (from EGBDF) and ""Eternity Road"" (TOCCC) as better examples of Ray's skill as a songwriter.""Voices in the Sky"" is a little slight. Nice, but slight. ""The Best Way To Travel"" is interesting but again a little lightweight. Momentum returns with ""Visions of Paradise"" and ""The Actor"" - gorgeous flute, vocals, guitar work. ""The Actor"" is a pearl of rare perfection, even for the Moodies in this era.The set concludes with ""The Word"" - a Graeme Edge poem and ""Om"" - a near-parody of Eastern thought and sound that is saved by the superb massed harmonies that the Moodies did so well at their peak.I must enjoy this album - the title is my Amazon byline - and I believe anyone who enjoys musicianship and the craft of songwriting will hear this without regret."
1,"When this great album was released it was clear Daryl Hall arrived in stellar form as one of the most gifted singer/songwriters of our time, classic work should have done the same for Daryl Hall that ""What's Going On"" did for Marvin Gaye! Here is an artist on par with Marvin Gaye, Al Green and other great soulful singers but for some strange reason zero radio support & Daryl Hall has not received deserved recognition as a solo artist, should have done it for Daryl as this great release is filled with amazing performances. Daryl has a large fan base who are real music lovers who find this is a real mystery and it would be interesting to know the reason behind this injustice, why was ""Soul Alone"" kept from the airwaves and how strange there wasn't at least one big hit from a collection that has that ""hit-sound"" running all through it? ""Power Of Seduction"" opens this great collection finding Daryl at his seductive soulful best in a song that again has ""#1 hit"" written all over it! Hot rhythm track with that wildly soulful voice being a magical musical treat to savor and enjoy over and over...hot rhythm speeds along ""This Time"" then pounding passion explodes in ""Love Revelation"", another should have been #1 hit and one would have to be in a coma not to be moved by this hot rocking classic! ""I'm In A Philly Mood"" gets inspiration from great Philly soul artists, Daryl's nod to past masters creates a new ""Quiet Storm"" smooth soul classic in the process. ""Borderline"" brings together two soulful masters, sophisicated flowing masterpiece with a sterling vocal complete with fluid scatting and sublime keyboards, six plus minutes of musical bliss flow into Marvin Gaye classic ""When Did You Stop Loving Me, Stop Loving You"", Daryl Hall does Marvin proud with a deeply soulful mesmerizing and hypnotic performance that is off the chart great! Sublime passionate gem ""Help Me Find A Way To Your Heart"" soars to glorious heights, ""Send Me"" is a romantic jazz influenced rhythm cooker that is another mesmerizing gem in a stunning collection filled with them. ""Wildfire"" soars to passionate heights followed by the hot cooking & wildly funky ""Money Changes Everything"", great rocker pulsates becoming another cooker that should have been a huge hit, clearly a collection of winners that is a ""Unsung"" masterpiece!  Magnificent finale ""Written In Stone"" is beautifully sung with so much passion, clearly this great singer/songwriter is a legendary master unlike anyone else...many are praised but Daryl Hall is the real deal & greatest of the blue eyed soulful singers of his generation and beyond...Bravo Daryl, this timeless classic is amazing!"
1,"The Luniz debut album is a classic gangsta-rap album at gangsta-rap prime times. It's 2001 and I still like listening to it. So... I think it's off the hook! Maybe this ain't a well-planned album but that ain't a point of gangsta-rap. It's about repping the OAK on their G-level. Some people may know them from 'I got 5 on it' but there's much way better tracks on the album. I don't wanna dis' 'I got 5 on it' cuz that rtack a WestCoast classic but there's songs with better lyrics.  But I can admit that I really nod my head on ""I got 5 on it (+ the Reprise)"" and ""5150"", too. In addition, I can't dis' the Luniz 1st album in no way! That's a classic and everybody should'a admit it! Told: 5-stars!"
0,"Hard to believe this cd is sandwiched in between British Steel and Screaming for Vengeance. In the liner notes it reveals this album was written mostly in the studio... and it shows. Many of the songs, at least half, seem half-hearted and shallow. It's pretty clear that the band didn't live with these songs enough to make them ""special"". Tracks, 7, 8, 9, 10 are ALL totally forgettable.Still, like many things Priest it's pretty much a necessity at any rate. Solar Angels being my fave with Desert Plains being right behind.The ""bonus track"" is poorly produced and has low sound quality, add to that a forgettable rendition of Desert Plains and you have two extras right out the window. If your looking for the best of what IS JP, try British Steel, or my favorite Sin After Sin. Buy Point of Entry ONLY after all other cd's have been exhausted and even then... tread lightly."
1,This is the album that brought female rap into the forefront. She was the first major female after Salt-n-Peppa. She's still the best.
1,"When I first heard this album it was on vinyl when I was seriously into the music of Earth Wind & Fire and to be honest I didn't like it very much. The music seemed very removed from what I was listening to at the time which was for the most part very hardcore funk,R&B; and soul. And that's strange because this is a review by one of a few people with genuinely good things to say about 80's music in general. That was 15 years ago and upon hearing it again my opinion is a bit broader. I will say one thing for this-the way this album was presented (at least on vinyl) each side-or half if your listening to this CD version starts off with a very obviously pop/rock with a lot of louder guitars and drumming:those two songs being ""Photographic Memory"" and of course the albums big hit ""Easy Lover"",the song most people remember from this album and the reason most people probably came into it in the first place. As other reviewers have pointed out these songs are not at all indivative of the album as whole and were likely put on to cross the album over to the pop charts. The majority of this recording is every bit the regally produced R&B;/funk that would be common to find on any EWF release,even during this era. ""I Go Crazy"" and ""Time Is A Woman"" are actually better examples of the 80's electro funk sound as they both focus on creating a textural mood and tempo as opposed to seeing how many synthesized effects could fit into one song. ""For Every Heart That's Been Broken"" and ""Woman"" are both excellent songs that,with the combined sound of the Phenix horns and Philip's jazzy gospel chordal phrasing on the vocals make them both sound like possible EWF outtakes from theFacesera of their recording career. Same goes for the heavily gospel sounding ""Show You The Way To Love"" which would not have been out of place on EWF'sPowerlightfrom the previous year before this. ""Go"" is one of the more heavily funk oriented tunes and kind of glues the sound of a lot of the rest of the album in one great jam. There are also two somewhat epic songs in the title track which is a seemingly awkward mixture of 80's progressive pop and afrobeat. Somehow with the great melody Philip pulls this rather Peter Gabriel sounding tune off very well. The last tune is a great moody version of ""Children Of The Ghetto"",again an epic song in more of a jazz-funk vein. Overall the sound of this album is quite different from that of Philip's solo debutContinuationwhich has a more fluid sound from cut to cut and doesn't have songs with such an obvious pop and rock influence. Even so there is a lot of great music here,especially from the mid 80's usually electronic/synthesizer oriented R&B;/soul and funk environment so this is more than worth checking out."
1,"this one is dope and that cover is dope too, lol!overall a good krs album, good for those times when you want that old school vibe in your headphones"
1,ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS IF U DONT HAVE IT THEN U SHOULD GO AND GET IT.
1,"December 26, 1998 was the day that I actually walked into a record store. I had one CD on my mind, which was &quot;Come On Over&quot; by Shania Twain. Ever since that day, I have been really glad that I actually bought that CD.The only two songs that I listened to were From This Moment and You're Still The One. However, a few days after that, I finally had the chance to listen to the entire CD while I was cleaning. You would not believe how I was dancing while the CD was playing!"
1,"I am not going to offer up a review of the entire album. There are MANY talented folks here who have done a much better job of it than I ever could hope to, so what's the point? I'd just like to offer up my 2 cents on my favorite songs from this great Moody Blues work.First off is John Lodge's classic, feel-good rocker 'Ride My See-Saw'. (This tune and 'I'm Just a Singer' frequently trade places as my favorite Moodies song). I might as well admit it right now: I am a HUGE John Lodge fan and he is my fave Moody. That will become glaringly apparent if you read any more of my Moody Blues product reviews. Am I the least bit biased towards this living legend? Not at all! While I am not totally sure of the exact meaning of the lyrics, on the surface RMSS seems to be rife with double entendres and sexual innuendo, at least that's what I've read many times.  But knowing  of JL's  deep religious beliefs, I strongly guess that that's not the case at all. This song is just plain fun to listen and sing along to. John and Justin's great guitar work ain't none too shabbily showcased either. RMSS is John Lodge at his rocking best.I am also a big fan of Ray Thomas' often overlooked (and in my opinon) under-used talents. His ode to 'Dr. Livingstone' is a cheery, cute song that I could listen to all day long while having a goofy smile on my face.  Ray's next offering, 'Legend of a Mind' is a legend of a song, and perfectly shows off this man's awesome vocal skills, not to mention the fact that he can blow the living tar out of a flute. This song has the best series of build-ups (for lack of a better word) and crescendos of any song I have ever heard. (You'll have to over-look the fact that I am not at all musical nor versed in music lingo, so that's the best description I could give. I hope most will understand what I'm talking about). I can literally listen to this song over and over w/o growing tired of it. The subject matter of this song doesn't matter to me one iota. The melody, the beat, the musicianship, and John's fabulous high note harmonies all combine to make this song a pure delight to my ears.Next on my list is Lodge's 'House of Four Doors'. I'll spare you the details of how great I think this song is. I'll briefly just state that HOFD is hauntingly eerie and beautiful all at the same time. Maybe- just maybe- I could have done w/o 'some' of the sound effects of the creaking door, but hey John didn't ask me for my opinion before including them. It really doesn't affect my overall opinion of this great song. Yes, it's a John Lodge tune, and yes I darn well love it.I am ending my little synopsis with two songs from the sublime Justin Hayward.(BTW, I like him, too. He's my 2nd fave Moody). Firstly is 'Voices in the Sky'. I have to admit that it took me a while to really love and appreciate this one (I don't exactly know why) but it is a truly lovely song.  This song DOES make me wonder what the birds could say to me if they only could. As usual, Justin does a superb vocal and the song fits him and this album really well. But.... my favorite Hayward tune on this record is by far 'The Actor'. In fact, it's one of my all-time favorite songs of his.  Both the lyrics and the sound of this song are as timeless today as when JH penned it many years ago. Something in this song really strikes a chord in me. Perhaps it's the fact that we all tend to put on a good front for the world and get caught up in playing our little roles? I heard Justin sing this song live recently and I have to say the man's voice sounds just as good as it did way back when. He truly is a gifted singer, guitarist and performer.Well, I guess I'm just about through telling y'all (I'm from the South, after all) about my favorite songs from ISOTLC. I hope this ""review"" makes someone want to go and listen to these songs (or the entire album) anew- or better yet- hear them for the very first time.  Either way, I do hope you enjoy!"
1,"2nd album by the Toronto based band ""Get Lucky"" #7, brought this band it's biggest sucess.  Led by vocalist Mike Reno and guitarist Paul Dean Loverboy's ""Lucky"", is a AOR favorite with guitar and keyboard riffs everywhere.  Produced by the late Bruce Fairbairn( who really hit it big in 1980's).  This album was also engineered by Bob Rock (who has done great things with other hard rock bands in the late 80's and 90's).  The album had so much to offer,""Working For The Weekend"", which hit #29 hot 100 and #2 mainstream rock, still a radio favorite today.  ""When It's Over"", with that keyboard and bass riff, this is a mid-tempo rocker that hit #26 hot 100 and #21 mainstream rock.  ""Jump"", was a favorite of mine, wish more people could hear this song on classic rock radio and sirus radio.Other songs that hit my playlist back then ""Lucky Ones"" #36 mainstream rock, ""Gangs In The Street"", ""It's Your Life"", a fun album track.  And their epic number ""Take Me To the Top"", which hit #23 mainstream rock.  Saw these guys in concert in '82, they were on top of their game!  I thought this band would last longer, but the material dried up and so did the band.  There still performing today."
1,"To this day...funk music is defined by Rick James...and it is so awesome to see him celebrated with this deluxe edition re-issue of one of the greatest albums of all time.  ""Street Songs"" (the studio release) has no ""sleeper"" moments...Most noted for the upbeat, danceable funk tracks, I simply must draw attention to the ballads that seem to always get overlooked...""Make Love To Me"" (with it's reference to the ""saxophone sound"" so often referenced by Teena Marie) and then the ultimate slow jam ""Fire & Desire"" (with the Queen herself, Teena Marie) establish that Rick could rock the ballads as well...The live side is incredible...My only gripe is that the infamous live version of ""Fire & Desire"" is not included...Rick and Tee do team up for ""Sucker For Your Love"" and rock the house...Rick's voice is a little shotty on the live side, but the energy and audience enthusiasm give a true view of what the show was really all about...A MUST HAVE!"
1,"This is soulful funk from PARLIMENT, the brain child of Mr George Clinton.  On UP FOR THE DOWN STROKE the band, including one of the most influential bass players of all time, Mr William (Bootsy) Collins, is just getting started.  The title cut is an anthem.  WMBFG and POAB are slow and soulful.  TESTIFY and GOOSE have the foundations of super, super heavy funk.  If you are interested in funkadelia from the seventies or in music with a groove, this CD will interest you."
1,This is true Alison.  This is true bluegrass.  This is a wonderful CD!
1,"I remember Martin Page as one of the writers of Starship's 1985 hit We Build This City, some songs by the Pointer Sisters and other artists. But this album that he put out in 1994 is by far one of the best pop albums made during that decade. Page just sounds fabulous on these songs, with loads of personal and emotional themes to load up 80 episodes of Oprah and lots of tissue on her set. I still love the title song, In the House of Stone and Light, which I still hear in some stores some 11 years later!  But there are other good songs here, such as Door, Monkey, and some other songs. The arrangements are nice, the songwriting and music from Mr. Page very well done.  It does have that adult contemporary pop feel in it, mostly midtempo to slow songs. The musicians sound nice on here, very much a live feel here. If you passed over on this album in the '90s, you need to rediscover it now!"
1,"Anyone who thinks Vol. 2 is the best Jay-z album is DEAD WRONG, the only other Jay-Z album that matches up to Vol. 1 is Reasonable Doubt.  This CD's production was great and jigga even prevailed over a horrible puff daddy track with some tight lyrics.  After this album Jay-Z changed from what he was, or you could say he caught the &quot;Nas syndrome&quot;."
1,"A Secret Wish in my opinion is the best electronic album ever made during the 80s and even beyond to this day. Trevor Horn and Steve Lipson's impeccable production may have a lot to do with the polished result, but the main ingredient is in the form of four immensely talented Germans: Michael Mertens,Ralph Dolper, Suzanne Freytag and Claudia Brucken. Their combination of cold Kraftwerk like synths with cinematic lushness has created a blueprint album that inspired many electronic artists during the day and even afterwards. This expanded 2 cd edition is beautifully remastered and packaged, although several  remixes had to be left out due to space constraints. But what the hell ! This is still the best reissue so far !"
1,A lot of people didn't know about this cd when it came out. This was and still is a great buy. the singing is (PRICELESS).......
1,"For those of you previous reviewers, who gave this a mediocre review, shame on you!!! These songs bring back some really good memories, when I was growing up and finding my way. I like this volume of greatest hits, better than the one with ""Kentucky Woman"" and ""Cherry, Cherry"" that's mostly songs from the 60's. How could a collection with ""Love on the rocks"", ""Hello again"", ""Forever in blue jeans"", and last but not least ""September Morn"", be wrong!!! This stuff was the soundtrack of my elementary and junior high years, and I truly love this music!!! He's kinda lost the magic he once had in the 60's and 70's, but he's a great guy. THANK'S FOR THE MUSIC NEIL!!!!!"
1,"Ladies Of the Canyon, Court and Spark, Miles of Aisles (a Live Work of Art!) and &quot;finally&quot; we come to Chalkmark In A Rainstorm. This was one of the last things that I bought on vinyl (remember that?) before I started to convert CD. Needless to say I played this album till you could practically see through the grooves. When friends would come over we would all marvel at the incredible sounds coming out of the stereo. This album was, believe it or not (like many of Joni's others) nominated for a few GRAMMY AWARDS, including Best Pop Vocal Performance-Female. I don't remember what won instead of this album but, I do remember the deep dissappointment that this album didn't reach the masses. With smart catchy lyrics and singable harmonies, this is Joni's best offering since Court and Spark! If you are looking for something to sample from Joni's Less Folk/More Pop/Jazz oriented period, THIS IS THE ONE. The only album of hers that I would recommend more would be Court and Spark. This one will have you singing along and wondering where the hell it's been hiding from you all these years. You gotta love this one!"
1,"In the style of Chester and Lester the great partnering of Chet Atkins and Les Paul, comes Atkins and Mark Knopfler. It is always great to see to excellent guitarists with different styles sit in with each other and jam, and ""Neck and Neck"" is no different. But, it does not quite have the same magic as the old Chester and Lester albums. Here, Knopfler pulls on his Country roots and plays more to the music style of Atkins. It may be hard to recognize Knopfler's playing as it is a departure from his rock, but is in line with his Notting Hillbillies days.The album opens with a country-blues tune, ""Poor Boy Blues"" with both men doubling on guitar and vocals. Each takes a turn at soloing, the master and the student, both quick and excellent. The tune is an upbeat toe-taper. The days of Chester and Lester are revisited with ""There'll Be Some Changes Made"" where Atkins and Knopfler go back and forth about their playing style...Atkins to start playing rock and roll and wearing leather and makeup like ""Jackson and Prince"" while Knopfler tries to keep him where he belongs. The barbs they give each other while they trade solos are fun. ""Yakety Axe"" is kinda fun Country ditty. ""Tahitian Skies"" sounds like a mix of their versions of ""Why Worry"", airy and jazzy.This is a good album from two guitar greats. Nothing to amazing comes out of this, just good songs with some solid guitar work. You'll get a couple of laughs out of this album, and if you like Atkins and Country, this is a good album to have."
1,"This is one of those very special albums/now CD's that can be counted on to always generate a happy smile to my face.  I saw the Cars (dig this...it should be ""the other way around,"" huh?) ""open"" for Foreigner in '78.  For reasons that are not relevant here, I have to admit that that concert experience was right up there with seeing Ian Hunter up close or seeing the Stones in '75.  Well, my band already did ""Just What I Needed"" (which was difficult to perform without that all-important synth line).  Still.  On one of the very greatest nights of my life, my best friend/guitarist and our lady singer decided that they had had ENOUGH of my ""pain,"" my ""angst,"" whatever, due to a divorce earlier that year.  I was at work at a most ostentatious clothing store, and I wouldn't get off till 9:30,  But regardless I received a phone call from Kent, telling me ""he and the lady had broken into my apartment, where did I hide the g**ja, and to find y'self a date there, we're takin' you out dancin', we're tired of you whinin' all the time.""  I did, the beautiful red-headed lady security person agreed, and...To make a long story short(er), I ""got up"" for a second, and when I returned the band was just finishing Segar's ""Sunspot Baby.""  The beautiful security lady sat there with a delicious ""come hither"" look about her.  We danced, and (YES!) ""Baby"" segued right IN to ""Fire Down Below.""  A more appropriate song was never written.  But, as to say, ""This Is YO' Nite,Chaz Turner!,"" the band concluded with the Cars' most ethereal ""Let The Good Times Roll.""  As I wrote in a paper for a ""psych 101"" class a couple of years later, ""I won't embellish the story with pornographic details.""  But be THAT as it may, we all wound up at my apartment about 4:30AM, played a little music, had a drink and a smoke, and sort of....""paired off.""  Yes.  And the good times did, indeed, ""roll.""Two things: A) Anything you may have heard about redheads is undeniably, 100% truthful.  I mean that in the most positive, loving way!; B)...and I can CERTAINLY understand, whenever Keef is interviewed about the ""current state of rock and roll,"" he always replies, ""%&$# the 'rock,' gimme the ROLL!""  Yeah, brother!"
1,"Upon hearing the sad news of lead singer Stuart Adamson's death, I had to pop this CD in, and enjoy one of the best debut albums I've ever heard. In 1983 you couldn't turn on your radio without hearing &quot;In A Big Country&quot; with those trademark bagpipe-like guitar riffs and Stuart's soaring vocals (and what a music video too by the way...). In a time when synthesizers took center stage, Big Country rocked out with a unique take on pop music, and it worked. This album is solid from start to finish and so polished (thanks in part to the legendary Steve Lillywhite), you'd never think this was a debut album. Standout tracks include &quot;In A Big Country,&quot; &quot;Inwards,&quot; and &quot;Fields of Fire.&quot; Big Country's entire catalog is worth looking into and I played much of it through the mid 90's while I was still in radio. You'll never confuse these guys with anybody else from the 1980's and &quot;The Crossing&quot; is a great addition to any collection. We'll miss you Stuart..."
1,"No matter what decade it's from, most people naturally feel compelled to listen to anything that Stevie Wonder makes, because you know it won't be bad. This album (his second most recent non-compilation album) is no exception, but it was probably good that he decided to take a lengthy break after it, because it is probably his weakest work overall. This album spawned the hit radio ballad ""For Your Love"" and the quasi-spacey ""Edge Of Eternity"" is interesting, if unusual. The rest of the album, like any Stevie album, is certainly acceptable, but not quite up to the standards of ""Innervisions"", ""Songs In The Key Of Life"" or even ""In Square Circle""."
1,"i usually listen to metal when it comes to rock music. i'm a metalhead, so generally my attitude towards punk is like AH!! GOOD CHARLOTTE'S GAY!!! but then i realized, like with any type of music, you have to search for the good stuff; it's like with rap, people think Chingy and crap like that, but then there's Atmosphere, Sage Francis, and Cage (""the good stuff""). i actually found this cd is my friends car, i borrowed it from him and gave it a try. i played it and i fell in love with it. my favorite song is ""dig up her bones."" that song really got my attention because it was strong, it was hard, and it hit you in the face. the feeling i got was the same feeling you get after listening to guns n roses ""welcome to the jungle"" it hits you right from the beginning. the chorus brought me to jump up with the music. another good track on here is ""don't open 'til doomsday."" a simply amazing song, and a simple amazing album. each track is fast, and hard hitting. from beginning to end, Misfits, take you on a rollercoaster ride. it doesn't stop, it doesn't pause. the whole record just keeps going, on and on and on. this album is an amazing piece of work and anyone who wants to listen to real punk rock needs to pick up this album. this is the closest to 80's The Clash and Sex Pistols punk as you'll get."
1,"Sonny Rollins - Way Out West SACDI will admit that I was shocked to see that there are THREE version of ""Way Out West"" on SACD.....Analogue Productions, Japan SHM and this one on Fantasy (Hong Kong). Gee there are about 5 million albums I'd love on SACD and yet there are 3 separate versions of this one alone.......kinda crazy....Anywho.......let me just say that I am big fan of Sonny Rollins and think that ""Way Out West"" is one of his great albums! I was a bit unsure if I should really own another version of this but with all the great reviews I decided to give it a try...and I am soooooo glad I did.I can not compare this version to the Japan or APO SACD releases but can say that I think this one is very good. The quality of the mix is actually quite amazing with great instrument separation and superb clear sound. This recording is warmer and smoother than the RBCD Remaster on Impulse I own and some of Rollins' sax feels like he is right in your living room playing beside you!On ""come, gone"" at the end there is some wild sax stereo panning going on (the 2 channel mix) and right at the end it is almost like Sonny turns and faces you as the listener.....it was almost like he had his back turned and then at the end shifted around......never heard anything quite like that before and dont recall that on the RBCD.I love the distinct drumming with such clarity in the left speaker while Rollings cherps away on the far right...while the bass is mid-left channel. This is really a fun recording and the great depth and stereo effects makes this SACD a real winner.The recording engineer was Roy DuNann who I think did a great job on the SACD mastering."
1,"There are so many acts that truly have defined the sounds and souls of the 1970's. Although they've had such great music, there have been just very few definitive performers still showcasing that feeling of great classic music like Billy Joel, Chicago, Stevie Wonder, and especially Elton John. Elton's music of the 70's as well as his later eras have still brought so much joy to all corners of the world. While his first greatest hits record did actually deliver that point of his era, his sequels could've been a lot more to actually have been desired. That is the point within this record.Elton John Greatest Hits Volume 2 is a reflection of his highpoints from the mid 70's. The collection mainly is comprised of several good tracks like the somber Someone Saved My Life Tonight, Philadelphia Freedom, and the hard rocking Pinball Wizard from The Who's rock opera Tommy. Although the collection has some good tracks, there are just so many great songs that weren't actually highlighted at all like the soulful Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word, Don't Go Breaking My Heart with Kiki Dee, Burn Down The Mission, and many other great gems.All in all, Elton John Greatest Hits Volume 2 could've been better, if there was more to have been highlighted. Instead, I really suggest you purchase the double album Elton John Greatest Hits 1970-2002. Saying sorry to this collection, isn't the hardest word.Album Cover: BSongs: CPrice: C 1/2-Remastering: B-Overall: C"
1,"By the time 1981 rolled around, Billy Joel had established himself as a legitimate superstar.  Billy would have seven studio albums under his belt but had yet to make a live album.  Billy Joel's 1981 release ""Songs in the Attic"" would be a live album with a different spin.  The main purpose of this album was: 1) To provide a live collection of Billy Joel songs; 2) To focus around ""Old Billy Joel"" songs from early in his career - songs that had almost been forgotten about - or not heard much by the average fan.  As a result, Billy provides a ""live"" album with a different spin when you compare it to many other live releases.  Overall Billy succeeds in providing this spin while providing a very good album.I look at Billy Joel's career as having three phases. The first phase is what I call ""Old Billy Joel"". This basically includes all of his material from ""Cold Spring Harbor"" through ""Turnstiles"". These are perhaps the strongest days as the piano sound, but they also contain most of Joel's least heard material. The next phase is what I call ""Middle Billy Joel"". This was his most successful period and covers from ""The Stranger"" to ""Billy Joel Greatest Hits Volume 1 and 2"". Joel would go through a transition during this phase - expanding his musical horizons and exploring different avenues. The final phase is the ""Later Billy Joel"" phase - this covers ""The Bridge"" to ""River of Dreams"". In this phase, Billy would start to incorporate some of his older styles of music while not abandoning his desire to continue to explore new avenues.  While ""Songs in the Attic"" was released in the ""Middle Billy Joel"" (Phase 2) period, all of the music comes from ""Old Billy Joel"" (Phase 1).""Songs in the Attic"" provides 11 tracks from the ""Old Billy Joel"" phase.  The songs are distributed from the four albums from this period:  ""Cold Spring Harbor"" (""She's Got a Way"", ""Everybody Loves You Now""); ""Piano Man"" (""You're My Home"", ""The Battle of Billy the Kid"", ""Captain Jack""); ""Streetlife Serenade"" (""Streetlife Serenader"", ""Los Angelenos""); ""Turnstiles"" (""Say Goodbye to Hollywood"", ""Summer, Highland Falls"", ""I've Loved These Days"", ""Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)"".  While this collection does contain some well-known songs such as ""Say Goodbye to Hollywood"" and ""Captain Jack"", I give credit for Billy Joel for going out on a limb an stay away from the more commercially known hits.  In the liner notes, Billy does explain that he looked to include songs that had a lot of passion when played live.  Many of the old songs translated into some very passionate performances.  He explains that ""Piano Man"" wasn't included because it sounds similar live as it does on the studio version.  Once again, Billy succeeds at including a collection of songs that display passion.  Ath the same time, I would have liked to have seen more than two songs from both ""Cold Spring Harbor"" and ""Streetlife Serenade"".When I review a live album, I usually prefer the album to basically be a full recording of a concert.  In other words, I prefer the tracks come a single night's performance and be arranged in the order that they were played in concert. I normally am not one for edited concerts or live compilations.  However, as far ""Songs in the Attic"" goes, I feel I have to bend my rule.  Billy Joel's intent wasn't to release a live album, but to bring visibility to the passion and the energy generated from those older songs.  While I still would have liked to seen all of these songs from a single performance, this might have been a very difficult thing to accomplish.There are no poor performances on this collection, however there are going to be some tracks that stand out above some of the others.  I was very surprised that it was ""She's Got a Way"" was the single that garnered the most attention.  While it's a nice song, I would definitely categorize it as one of the album's weaker tracks.  Perhaps one of the best songs is ""Los Angelenos"".  This is often a forgotten song when looking at the Billy Joel music portfolio.  While we think of Billy as a ""New York Kind of Guy"", Billy did spend some of the early years of his career in California.  Billy delivers an outstanding passion and energy of this song - complete with good use of Synthesizers.  When it comes to forgotten tunes, many forget about some of the outstanding tracks on Billy's debut ""Cold Spring Harbor"".  One standout song on ""Cold Spring Harbor"" is ""Everybody Loves You Now"".  When you listen to the live version included on ""Songs in the Attic"", you will hear an even better version of this track.  Finally, the live version of ""Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)"" is another Billy tune that gets forgotten about.  This version will eclipse the version that was found on ""Turnstiles"" - and once again succeeds in delivering the passion that was a goal Billy had set forward when making this collection.The enhanced version of this collection includes video versions of three of the songs on this collection: ""Say Goodbye to Hollywood"", ""Los Angelenos"", and ""You're My Home"".  These videos aren't going to be the best in terms of quality, but they may still satisfy the Billy Joel fan.  The liner notes for ""Songs in the Attic"" are outstanding - especially for a live collection.  There are two write-ups - one by producer Phil Ramone and one by Billy himself.  Also included in the liner notes are lyrics - something very unusual for a live and/or compilation album.  Overall, this is a very good live collection.  Not only will this satisfy the serious Billy Joel fan, but someone who has a casual interest will want to check this out as well.  Highly recommended."
1,"For their first four albums, the Moody Blues recorded their material by building the albums layer by layer as they put everything down on tape. This would lead to incredible (and incredible-sounding) albums, but would make the material difficult to duplicate live, as there were only five guys on stage to play this massive music. For their fifth album, 1970's &quot;A Question Of Balance,&quot; the Moodies decided to record as simply and as close to a live performance as possible. The resulting album, while having more of a live, looser feel to it than previous Moodies albums, is undeniably another Moody Blues classic that's just as incredible &amp; incredible-sounding as it's predecessors. Justin Hayward's &quot;Question&quot; is one of the Moodies' most famous tunes, with one of Justin's best vocal performances, that alternates between being a ferocious acoustic rocker (just listen to Justin *strrrruuum* that guitar!), and a lovely ballad in the bridge section, and then back again. It's simply marvelous. The rest of the album stands mightily tall next to it: Mike Pinder's &quot;How Is It We Are Here?&quot; has a great air of mystery to it, Ray Thomas' &quot;And The Tide Rushes In&quot; is one of his most beautiful contributions to the group, Graeme Edge's &quot;Don't You Feel Small&quot; is a spooky little percussive number, and John Lodge's &quot;Tortoise And The Hare&quot; is a bouncy rocker. The great Moodies music continues in the second half with Hayward's pair of melodic beauties, &quot;It's Up To You&quot; &amp; &quot;Dawning Is The Day,&quot; Lodge's great sing-along, &quot;Minstrel's Song,&quot; Pinder's absolutely haunting &quot;Melancholy Man,&quot; and Edge &amp; Thomas' lovely poetic finale, &quot;The Balance,&quot; spoken by Pinder. The Moody Blues were one of the world's biggest bands in 1970, and, by their own admission, they had a lot of questions to ask of themselves at the time, both as successful musicians and as people. They brilliantly asked those questions with &quot;A Question Of Balance,&quot; and in the process, they delivered another outstanding Moody Blues album."
1,Probably Barbra Streisand' s strongest album.....and all the songs written by the Brothers Gibb...how can you miss.....great album with great music and lyrics....two thumbs up
1,"Once in a very long while, an artist comes out with a blockbuster album that truly overshadows the competition. Stevie Wonder's Innervisions is one such album. Indeed, Innervisions is so strong that the music on this album remains stunningly beautiful and memorable after several decades. Stevie was in his very best form on this great album.The CD track set begins with the ballad entitled ""Too High."" Stevie sings about a woman who tries drugs to ease her pain but the drugs don't get her very far. The backup chorus and musical arrangement work well and they have that 1970s funky, catchy sound to them. Stevie's voice is in perfect form; the percussion and guitars enhance the natural beauty of this fine melody. Awesome! In addition, ""Visions"" is a beautiful ballad that uses guitars and bass while Stevie sings so well about the possibility that he may finally live in a world of peace.""Living For The City,"" a strong and somewhat gritty number, explores the tough fight African Americans often face when trying to get ahead in life. ""Living For The City"" uses an awesome guitar arrangement with drums and percussion to really make this ballad shine! Great sound effects, too.""Golden Lady"" starts with a beautiful piano arrangement; Stevie sings joyfully and confidently about the love he shares with his woman. The melody stuns me with its charm and beauty; and the chord changes evoke a sense of depth, sincerity and intimacy as Stevie sings with all his heart and soul. The piano, electric guitars and percussion work wonders for ""Golden Lady.""""Higher Ground"" is yet another masterpiece on Innervisions; this 1970s funky melody proves catchy and very memorable. Stevie sings flawlessly of how he's going to turn over a new leaf and get his life going in the right direction. Stevie's character also puts his faith in his religion in order to give him the security and confidence he needs to turn over a new leaf. ""Higher Ground"" has a firm tempo just right for the mood of the song. ""Jesus Children of America"" is also memorable; Stevie's message is that all people, religious fundamentalists, drug abusers and even his audience, must ""come clean"" and live a more meaningful life with true honesty, true dignity, humanity and even more the way Jesus wanted.""All In Love Is Fair"" is a thoughtful, painful ballad that tells the truth about love and romantic relationships. Sure, people vow to stay in love--but all too often they don't. Stevie sings of how his love with his woman did not stand the test of time; Stevie sings this with passion and style. ""All In Love Is Fair"" is a remarkably tender ballad that makes me cry whenever I listen to it--and I never cry! The elegant musical arrangement uses guitars, percussion and a stunning piano arrangement to bolster the song. ""Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing"" again sports that funky 1970s style which works so well for this fine number. ""Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing"" features Stevie singing of how he'll always be there for his lover; he also encourages her not to pay attention to superficial people who claim their lifestyle is too tame. Stevie's desire to remain at his lover's side touches me with its message; and the funky rock and roll 1970s beat stands in contrast to the depth of the romantic, passionate lyrics about the consistency of his love for his woman. ""Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing"" is easily a masterpiece.The CD track set ends with another thoughtful song with another important message; ""He's Misstra Know-It-All"" criticizes phony people who can't be relied upon when the chips are down. Stevie mocks this type of person even as he sings his name as ""Misstra Know-It-All"" instead of ""Mister Know-It-All."" The piano, guitars and percussion again contribute to a gorgeous melody; and ""Misstra Know-It-All"" provides a strong ending for this album.Stevie Wonder is both a genius and a gentleman; but this album in particular proves his masterful talents without any doubt. We are all better off for Stevie's sharing his gift with us; hopefully Stevie Wonder will continue to entertain us and spread his message of peace as only he can for many years to come.Thank you, Stevie Wonder!"
1,"This is, in my opinion, his best work. Enough said. If I had to only have one of his works, this would be it. I'd take this one over any Greatest Hits compilations as well. It just works."
1,"Basically, you need this album. When Motown got all political with Marvin Gaye's What's Going On and Curtis Mayfield on the come-up Stevie drops Innervisions and blows it all out of the water. As this is my favorite album of all time perhaps I'm being biased, but there's no question that Stevie's on top of his game with this album - the production is practically flawless; his voice slides over the smoother tracks like Innervision and Don't You Worry Bout a Thing, and on the more politically-charged tracks his voice booms with emotion and passion for topics ranging from military conscription, racial inequality and hypocrisy within religion.You can't even say which tracks stand out because they all do. Higher Ground is an energetic blues-funk song that inspires even the more politically apathetic of people. Jesus Children of America is a beautifully arranged piece that starts off smooth and gradually builds into an aggressive stomp funk.If I had to choose the stand-out track would be Living For the City. It is perhaps his most emotional song ever, sending a powerful message through simple lyrics and a beautiful arrangment.If you don't own this album then buy it now. Along with Marvin's What's Going On, Innervisions gave birth to the political era of soul, paving the way for some of the best acts of our time."
1,"This is one of those rare CDs that I can put in and listen to beginning to end.  It is a bit more traditional country than is played on the radio today, which is not a bad thing by any stretch of the imagination.It kicks off with &quot;The Hard Way&quot; and goes right into the women's anthem &quot;He Thinks He'll Keep Her&quot;, about the guy who takes his woman for granted (as many guys do).  &quot;I Feel Lucky&quot; was a big hit on the radio.  &quot;The Bug&quot; is an upbeat, fun romp, as is &quot;Passionate Kisses&quot;.  &quot;I Take My Chances&quot; and &quot;Come On Come On&quot; end the disc on a great note.  Chapin is a talented writer and performer and I know she will be around for awhile!"
1,"Secrets is heavily ballad oriented than her debut but continues on the theme with love, romance, and seduction. but what's really missing on this album are the fun up and mid-tempos from the debut album. the only uptempo song you are going to find on this is you're making me high which was her first single off the album. somehow, i find myself relating more to secrets at this time of my life. i even have the curlier hair like toni on the album cover..more than i ever realize. despite the lack of funky, dance tunes, secrets is still as sensual and sexy as the first one.1. Come On Over Here (5/5)- was this song on the Waiting To Exhale soundtrack? it sounds like it would be on it.the beats kinda remind me of Brandy's Sitting In My Room. it's a nice first track.2. You're Making Me High (5/5)-this is the most sexual song Toni has ever done...she took it further than the first one. this song is definately a turn on! the video was hot too! it made me blush, though.3. There's No Me Without You (5/5)-i could relate to this song very much at this time in my life. i can agree withevery word the song is saying.4. Un-Break My Heart (5/5)- it's Secrets own version of Breathe Again, but Un-Break My Heart was HUGE back then!Everybody knows this song. I always hear it on the radio. Toni hasn't made a song like this since then...5. Talking In His Sleep (3.5/5)-it's not my favorite, but it reminds me of Love Affair which in my opinion was much better.6. How Could An Angel Break My Heart (5/5)-the lyrics sound so sad and beautiful. it tells sad tale of a toni's one time lover finding someone else to love and how she misses the things he would do to her. you barely hear songs like these now. it's so underrated.7. Find Me A Man (5/5)-it's about wanting to have that special man to hold and love. someone that is caring andrespectful. i know this song is for me!!!! that's exactly how i've been feeling for the past year.8. Let It Flow (5/5)-it has the same acoustic guitars that There's No Me Without You has. this is definately one of the best tracks on the album. it's very laidback.9. Why Should I Care? (5/5)-there are times when I feel like giving up..why should i care about love or thatperson? what's the point of it? toni knows exactly how it feels.10. I Don't Want To (5/5)- I used to cry when this song first came out. I never thought in a million years I wouldfind myself relating to this song right now. once again, just like There's No Me Without You the lyrics says it all to how I feel.11. I Love Me Some Him (5/5)-this song is so cute. the title of the song makes me smile.12. In The Late Of Night (5/5)-this is the saddest heartbreak song. i've so been there. laying on the bed atnight..feeling so lonely and empty. there are church bells ringing in the song."

0,Very generic. No soul. No substance. No life. No emotion from the artist. No creativity. No nothing.
1,"With unmatchable pacing and manic energy Michael Jackson's Off The Wall is one of the best albums ever released, and out of all the Disco era music I've heard this album has probably aged the best of them all.  Perhaps the defining aspect of this album's success is the excited tone Jackson puts into every single, this being before he became one of the world's most iconic figures and before he became the Tabloid's favorite target.  This makes Off The Wall his most excitingly fun album.  It is free of his `Save the World' messages and loneliness so it just makes the album a lot of fun to listen to from start to finish.Songs IncludeDon't Stop `Til you Get Enough - The most infamous of the album's singles Don't Stop `Til You Get Enough is one of Jackson's best.  This song is just exciting one of many on this album that make you want to take to the dance floor.Rock With You - A lovely ballad that is one of Jackson's best slow-dance songs.  The song is sweet, tender, and has an undeniable great beat.Workin' Day and Night - Another in a series of songs that just about force you onto the dance floor.Off The Wall - This is probably Jackson's best title song of an album.  It's serious in lyrics, yet at the same time it has a fun tune that gets your body moving.She's Out of My Life - One of his famous concert songs it is sweet and heart wrenching.  Many people who understand a break-up, or even if you have never gone through one should feel the emotion of this song's tune and lyrics.All the songs on this album and it's the most exciting of Jackson's albums.  It isn't his best album but it certainly is the most free-spirited of his albums.  You can tell that he had fun recording the album and that this was treated more as an experiment than a profession.  It falls behind Thriller on the chart of Jackson's great albums and with a low-price you are insane not to have this album in your collection."
1,what can I say another classic album by still today one of the hottest artist that every graced HIP HOP
1,"A worthy purchase.Value for money is what this DVD-A is all about.3 versions of this classic album, Video footage and a booklet with good info on the recording process and personel.One thing that I was surprised was the fact hardly any Beach Boy play a note on these tracks.Nevertheless it's a masterpiece.Worth getting."
1,"I ordered the RVG Remaster without realizing I had the previous edition (remastered by Ron McMaster) in my collection.  An A-B comparison reveals that the previous edition has depth, subtlety, dynamic nuance, with the opening rhythmic figure by Hank Jones followed by the sustained pianissimo whole notes of Cannonball and Miles establishing an inviting mystique, then building on this mood right up to the first chorus of what is probably the most celebrated recorded version of ""Autumn Leaves"" in jazz.  The RVG remaster starts with ""hot"" mics on the piano, then on both horns, with little difference in dynamic extremes.  In fact, dynamics, ensemble textures, and stereo separation become meaningless as Rudy seems intent simply on making whatever instrument is temporarily featured as loud as possible.  Having been spoiled by the previous edition, not to mention Miles' sound on his classic Columbia sessions, I can't stay with the RVG remaster, though admittedly some listeners attracted to the 1950s hard bop Blue Note sound may react differently.The bonus track on the previous edition is titled ""Alison's Uncle""; on the new edition, it's ""Bangoon.""I have hundreds of Van Gelder-engineered sessions past and present and have yet to hear a remaster that is a dramatic improvement (in the case of ""Somethin' Else"" the opposite seems true).  Apparently Blue Note had second thoughts about the project and has passed it on to Concord, though the majors are increasingly pushing downloaded tracks and the bigger profit margins they bring (no packaging costs, no need to pay writers for liner notes).  The RVG reissues were at least welcome for assuring the continued circulation of vital music and for the updated, frequently informative and insightful liner notes.  Unfortunately, we've reached yet another stage in the digital revolution.  It's exceedingly rare now to find domestic jazz releases, whether new or reissues, of any sort.  Like other collectors, I've had to look to Spain, Japan, Italy, Germany, Holland, etc. for reissues (and first-time releases) of historically significant, indispensable American music.  (I'm left to wonder if Ken Burns' absorbing PBS series on jazz merely provoked complacency or, worse, a backlash against the music.)"
1,"Prior to recording this album, REO Speedwagon had been around for many years having a measure of success in their American homeland. This album took their career to a much wider audience at home while gaining international recognition for them, including the first two of their three UK hits.About half the tracks climbed high in the American charts, with Keep on loving you hitting the very top - it also made the UK top ten. Take it on the run, also a huge American hit, made the UK top twenty. Don't let him go and In your letter were among the other American hits. The music is almost relentlessly up-tempo.Any group that has such a long career (and plenty that don't) inevitably go through personnel changes. The line-up that recorded this album was Kevin Cronin (lead vocals, guitar), Gary Richrath (lead guitar), Alan Gratzer (drums), Neal Doughty (keyboards) and Bruce Hall (bass guitar). Kevin's strong but well-controlled vocals backed by the superb musicianship of the other members made this album a classic.Good as their other albums are (at least the ones I've heard including Good trouble and Wheels, the two that followed this one), this is the album for which REO Speedwagon will be remembered for in America (where it was the biggest selling rock album of 1981) and elsewhere (where it gave them recognition that they previously didn't have).If you only buy one REO Speedwagon album, make it this one - even ahead of a hits collection. Most of their greatest hits are here."
1,"Only every once and a while does a rap masterpiece like this come out (i.e. Biggies &quot;Ready To Die&quot;, Eazy E's &quot;It's on 187um killer etc.). This album was Tupac's first with Death Row and he did not dissapoint with songs to get you're head moving, or your brain thinking he did it all on two discs of pure west coast goodness. And I know this is going to get me alot of negative votes but...please let the man R.I.P., no more of these ... &quot;hes alive&quot; theories, he's gone and you have to accept it,sorry."
1,"Rarely had a group debuted, in singles-form no less, with a more potent attack than the last track of their most powerfully raw output, making radio radical if just for a moment. The group might have refined a few songwriting techniques in future releases but never sounded as urgent again, only pulling away from what their moniker and manifesto originally ordained."

1,"With bouncy tunes and smoooth ballads, this was probably the last truly fun ABC release. I still like &quot;Be Near Me, How to be a Millionaire, Vanity Kills, and 15-Story Halo. To me the band took itself too seriously after this one and that is a shame."
1,"First of all ive got to say that cd1 is'nt better than cd2.But overall this album is not that bad,not the best 2pac album of course for several reasons.It was released in 1997 but the songs are from 1994,some of the songs lacked what id expect of him.I liked do 4 luv and hellrazor,when i get free2,hold on and some others.But this album has some really good beats and tunes,get it but dont be to disa pointed about some of it."
1,"This is suuuch an amazing album on every level. I don't throw the word &quot;masterpiece&quot; around lightly, but that's exactly what In Sides is. If you're not a believer in electronica as a true art form, this may be what changes your mind.A few specs, so you know I'm legit: In Sides is the big brother to Orbital's 1993 &quot;brown album,&quot; with its relentless, continuous-groove, DJ mix style. In Sides is four distinct &quot;sides,&quot; built around a pair of 2-part, side-long suites-- the now-classic techno ballad &quot;The Box&quot; and the mind-expanding &quot;Out There Somewhere?,&quot; with several incredible feats of MIDI engineering in between, including &quot;P.E.T.R.O.L.&quot; and &quot;Adnan's&quot;.A little background: On 1994's Snivilisation the brothers Hartnoll got a little out of hand with the vocal samples and wild tempo swings. It was an album Orbital fans (like me) appreciated, but ultimately couldn't truly love it. I wished they'd leave the IDM to guys like Black Dog and just make us wanna spin 'round like a record again.Well, call it a comeback: Im 1996 In-Sides delivered the goods with floorshaking rhythms that would make the Pope want to get down and boogie. He'd stop contemplating the significance of &quot;Thou Shalt Have No Other Gods Before Me&quot; to marvel at the interplay of unearthly synth melodies, robotic snare &quot;whap&quot;s and those signature Orbital basslines.For that matter, there are only two carefully placed vocal samples on In-Sides, versus the seemingly hundreds that populated the last album. This is a good thing. Orbital may be many things, but it is not funny.(One more thing: &quot;The Girl With The Sun In Her Head&quot; was recorded in a mobile solar-powered studio, I guess as a sociopolitical statement. Those tree huggers!)And I haven't even talked about Disc 2! Discover it for yourself..."
1,This album was and still is essential to the problems that existed and still do exist in the world to this day.  There could not have been a better album recorded from a political and social standpoint. Marvin left the world with a lot to think about when he recorded this masterpiece back in 71. It was a fantastic thing for Motown to do by remastering this classic album. I just wish Marvin was still alive to see how his work influenced a lot of fans as well as artist.
1,"Every now and then a selection of music comes along that begs me to set aside my (sometimes) petty concerns and just to review it as I see it. An important piece of music, such as this, really demands total focus. If not, you will not know how very special it is. Or how it all matters in all our trials here on earth. It is soul music (perhaps), but it cuts through to our heart and, collectively,our spirit that very few achieve. Even after so many years, it remains a milestone.Indeed, what is going on here? This is Marvin Gaye's ultimate plea- to God, to Jesus, to humanity to finally bring some semblance of coherence and something better within all our lives. It is not enough that it is so pivotal for it's time (so unlike the soul and rythmn and blues preceding this), but it delves into harder edged issues that cut through generations. It was relevant then, is relevant now, and will be relevant for the future. That is because it is universal. The urgency here, and what is at stake, is very important. It pertains to our survival and overcoming pain, in whatever form it appears to you. This effort is a treasure and definitely worth your time.First off, Marvin employs many various shades of musical excursions and motifs throughout. You'll hear the sax, piano, bells, guitar riffs and drums (and much more) weave in and out of musical themes in most creative ways. Using the orchestra to full effect - it weaves in magical waves to compliment his voice. And Marvin is up to the task and then some. On some songs it is difficult because just when you thought it moved in some coherent pattern, it changes and then you get some augmented about face in another direction. I think that, with anything new (at that time) acceptance is a hard road. But do not forget you are talking about an incredible, innovative talent here. There are not many that measure up to this.He starts off with ""What's Going On"" whereby he gives you the main theme of the album, ""You know we've got to find a way, to bring some lovin' here today"". And, from that point on, he will relate, or reveal to you, the hard truth of life and how to go about changing it. Certainly, these songs relate on an individual, personal basis. And, how wise that is. For, if any real, effective change is to take place, it begins within yourself. I like this song also for the lyric ""Don't punish me with brutality, Talk to me so you can see"". A plea to connect to a better level of understanding.""What's Happening Brother"", is about a man returning from war who is faced with good news from the newspaper but is faced with a bad economy, no jobs, and bleak prospects all around. He asks, but probably knows, that he's returned to a darkness, instead of the heaven he wanted when he arrived. This song morphs into the heavy laden ""Flyin' High"", whereby a way to deal with the pain is drug addiction. But, with that, we learn that the pain is real and does not go away.Marvin then connects this to a plea to ""Save the Children"". ""Who really cares?"", he asks. The music here comes in certain strains and stanzas, varying the mood and leading to, hopefully, an upswing of hope. ""God is Love"" escalates towards a higher purpose. In a way, Marvin creates his own soul gospel sound here. Love, here, is not just a word. It is the answer. And it comes across as pure and not contrived in the least.The groove then gets slowed down just a notch with the nexus of ""Mercy Mercy Me"" which is an ode to the abuse of our environment. Marvin covers alot of ground here - but indeed, he asks the tough questions of the world. After cruising through this song, notice the dread and flat chords and notes at the end. An ominous warning so take heed.""Right On"" musically percolates along with a piano and flute journey that allows Marvin to soul cruise. That no matter where you are in the spectrum of life, to have pride in the gift of love you have been given. ""Wholy Holy"" then becomes an ambient, slow ethereal blessing and ode to God. Filled with tenderness and heart.Finally, ""Inner City Blues"" harkens back (with insistent groove) towards the harshness and trials of life. But, this time he is sure that love is the answer to the madness. Again, he knows, ""we've got to find a way, to bring some lovin' here today"", and thus, the theme comes full circle.In closing, this album was a bold move back in 1971, yet I can see why it remains extremely high in any list of the best popular recordings of all time. He changed the course of this genre and influenced alot of great artists along the way. Beautiful, eloquent and superb. To be without it, your vast musical archive will suffer dearly.Highly recommended!Mery mercy me - Seers ain't what they used to be ---LOVE --- Metamorpho ;)"
1,"THIS BAND IS SO CHEESEY AND THEIR HIGH PITCHED SQUEALING LEAD SINGER IS SO ANNOYING (IN THE SAME REALM OF GEDDY LEE OF RUSH) THAT THEY ARE ARTISTICLY ONE OF THE GREATEST FM RADIO ROCKERS OF ALL TIME...AS BOTHERSOME AS STYX OR RECENT YES...THAT YOU CAN'T TURN EM' OFF..WHEN I HEAR 'I'M GONNA KEEP ON LOVIN' YOU' ON THE RADIO, I AM SUDDENLY MEZMERIZED FOR A MOMENT AS IF I AM LISTENING TO MAYBE BARRY GIBB AND THE BEE GEES.....THIS WHOLE BAND IS INCREDIBLE !

1,"This is SELF's first outing and it is no less than excellent.  In any review of any disc by this marvelous act I will always say that MATT MAHAFFEY is a genius.  A little more guitar driven than future efforts, SUBLIMINAL still has raw, unbridaled hook that makes every song catchy, intelligent, and extreemly listenable after several plays.  A CD that should already be on the shelves of any who know what good alternative music is all about."
1,"it may sound clich&eacute; but this is a classic, Paul Simon is an excellent songwriter (and vocalist) and many times his songs are great to read as poems as well. even if you've never heard these songs and just read the lyrics as if they were poems you would be extremely impressed. Luckily for Simon and Garfunkel they also sound great when sung. They harmonize really well and both have flawless vocals. A definite must have for any music collection."
1,"Rumor has it that Pete Way played on the album, then left before it's release. That's why the bass playing is uncredited. This is a great debut from a bluesy hard rock band. Fans of Zeppelin will like this band."
1,"Forever Your Girl by Paula Abdul is the ultimate pop dance album of the '80s. Paula's voice has never been strong but her delivery and execution of these songs is amazing. Songs like Knocked Out, Opposites Attract, The Way That You Love Me, Straight Up!, Forever Your Girl, and Cold Hearted were all hit songs and Paula's dance ability didn't hurt either thanks to her videos. Check this trip down memory lane cd out sometime!"
1,"Michael Jackson maybe one of the weirdest stars in music, he wears makeup, he has ruined his looks by countless botched up plastic surgery jobs and somehow, he has even managed to change his skin colour. But, all that aside, he has made some of the most memorable pop and dance music ever, and this album just goes to prove that you cannot judge music by the 'cover'. Greatly overshadowed by various scandals and tabloid stories, Michael's music became secondary and some people even refused to buy his records because of that. And that's too bad, because what you have on this album are well produced, well performed dance/pop songs, one a duet with Stevie Wonder. 16 page booklet includes lyrics and photos."
1,"When I first saw and heard &quot;Pink Moon&quot;, one of my favorite songs for many years, being used in a Volkswagen commercial, my first thought was, &quot;Oh, cool. Nick Drake's music is finally being brought to the  masses.&quot; Believe me, I've seen many examples of great songs being  tarnished forever by being used in a bad commercial, but this isn't one of  them. The song is used tastefully and respectfully; Nick Drake largely  shunned human contact, so he would probably have approved of the  commercial's depiction of 4 kids who decide they'd rather just drive around  on a starry night than go to some party and get wasted and laid. I'd also  say that, judging from the fact that a 28 year old record is #12 (Mar. 27)  on the Amazon best sellers list, that the song is just as much a commercial  for Nick Drake as it is for Volkswagen. Think of the power of a 30 second  snippet of a song: without any information about the artist, people have  searched out this deceased man's music, wanting to hear it again. My hope  is that these neophyte Nick Drake fans will listen beyond the title track  and discover just what an amazing album &quot;Pink Moon&quot; really is.  That song is just one of an amazing collection, recorded by a man in  extreme despair, with lyrics that appear to be out of some poet's feverish  dreams. Maybe they'll then move on to Drake's other wonderful albums. And  hey, if it took a car commercial for this to happen, so be it."
1,"Either this or ""Swordfishtrombones"", which is lyrically possibly one of the best songs of all time. This is Waits at his peak, before he started to really repeat his shtick. It has his humanity, his poetry, his great sound. And if I'm not mistaken, Keith Richards is on this (but I could be wrong; it's been decades since I read the liner notes) I think ""Jockey Full of Bourbon"" is probably my favorite track. A must buy."
1,"With some of the other 70's artists that have come and gone, very few have retained the longevity that they did.  ABBA was one of them.  Composed of Agnetha, Anni-Frid (Frida), Benny, and Bjorn, the quartet would deliver a powerhouse performance of 10+ LP's that would continue to strike the heartstrings of ALL generations.  Even 30 years later, whenever I put on an ABBA record, it still sounds as fresh as ever.These 19 songs are an excellent overview of their 10 year career (1973 to 1982) and contains mostly their hits (the sequel, More ABBA gold, had some more obscure tracks plus a 1982 non-album number, ""I Am The City"").  If I ever wanted to listen to an album front to back (i.e., in sequential order), this compilation would always be in my personal top five list!  Unfortunately, you won't find any songs on this CD from their 1973 debut, ""Ring Ring"", nor any 1982 tracks.  It's all from 1974-1981 in non-chronological order.""Dancing Queen"" -- 5 stars; this was the quintessential ABBA song that catapulted the quartet to new heights.  I love how Agnetha and Frida's voices meld so great together.  :)  Sixpence None The Richer would later cover this song in 1999 for the movie/soundtrack ""Dick.""""Knowing Me, Knowing You"" -- 5 stars; another ONE of my personal favorites, it's a rather melancholy number.  The lyrics sound like the prequel to what would eventually mean the permanent breakup of ABBA.  :(""Take A Chance On Me"" -- 5 stars; I love the intro -- the 2 women and 2 men respectively trading off their vocals before the beats kick in.  Erasure would cover this song when THEIR career also took off.""Mamma Mia"" -- 5 stars; an up-tempo number, this song would become a permanent staple as a theatrical Broadway musical, even today.""Lay All Your Love On Me"" -- 5 stars.""Super Trouper"" -- 4 stars; ""I Have A Dream"" -- 4 stars.""The Winner Takes It All"" -- 5 stars; this is my second favorite song on this compilation.  Great vocal from Agnetha, and it sounds like a kiss-off to an ex-lover.""Money, Money, Money"" -- 4 stars.""S.O.S."" -- 5 stars; my third favorite song.  It is so catchy and addictive that other artists have covered it, including Men Without Hats (from their 1989 LP, ""In the 21st Century"") and Peter Cetera (formerly of Chicago).""Chiquitita"" -- 5 stars.  A much more serious and quiet ballad until the chorus kicks in with a very angry and brilliant piano!  :)  Sinead O'Connor would later cover this song for her 2003 double LP, ""She Who Dwells...""""Fernando"" -- 4 stars.""Voulez-Vous"" -- 5 stars; my fourth favorite song.  ABBA was at its plateau during 1979 when this mega smash got the world's attention.""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)"" -- 5 stars.  This was a 1979 non-album track that didn't make it onto the ""Voulez-Vous"" album.  Madonna would later use this song as a sample for her 2005 minor hit, ""Hung Up.""""Does Your Mother Know?"" -- 5 stars.  The lyrics seem to talk about an underage girl who wants to hook up with an older man.""One Of Us"" -- 5 stars; ""The Name Of The Game"" -- 5 stars; ""Thank You For The Music"" -- 4 stars.""Waterloo"" -- 5 stars; ABBA's first mega smash.  This is also my favorite song of the set.  And I know that I've said this in other reviews, but I couldn't stop listening to this song, even if I wanted to.  :)  It's just THAT awesome; I love the up-tempo and the 2 women melding their vocals together.Sadly, ABBA imploded in 1982 after their final album (consisted of lots of non-LP/B-side tracks) and they also got divorced.  I don't recall what happened with Benny and Bjorn (it's Google time!!), but Agnetha would have 5 solo albums, whereas Frida would only have 2.  I will list them as follows for anyone whom is interested.Frida -- Something's Going On (1982); Shine (1984).Agnetha Faltskog -- Wrap Your Arms Around Me (1983); Eyes Of A Woman (1985); I Stand Alone (1987); My Colouring Book (2004); A (2013).I would VERY HIGHLY recommend that you also pick up the ABBA Box collection (you can easily find it listed on Amazon).  It's consisted of ALL of their classic LP's, plus one CD of non-album tracks.  I believe that it also includes their 23-minute grand musical opus, ""ABBA Undeleted.""  It's a mash-up of some demos (some of them made it onto their albums and others were scrapped) but I really love how it is all put together.  I also believe that the box contains 2 additional DVD's of some music videos, a full-length concert, and/or 1970's interviews.  You don't want to miss out on ANY of that, so it is truly worth the money and the time.  :)  Happy listening!!"
1,"Please read this review if your fire has been doused by the buckets of flame-retardants heaped upon it by the Entertainment Tonight mentalities who've been reviewing it.First of all, there is NOT ONE word in her poetic lyrics which could possibly infer ""gay"" or ""lesbian"" themes.  What there IS in this beautiful collection, is an abundance of material that touches upon the fruits of diversity, acceptance, and individuality (tolerance is too weak of a word).  The only reason reviewers can even begin to get preachy so far as to call this a ""coming out of the closet"" album is because they ""know"" (from their ET shows and from the check-out counter rag-mags that inundated the public with Melissa's ""sexuality"").This album is about heart, about truth to ones own nature, about walking your own path, about love and heartache, but most of all this album is about INTEGRITY.Sure it boasts the sultry pining I'm The Only One, and the love-lorn Come To My Window.  But every song on this collection is a poem, beautifully written and scored with a lot of heart.  This album is the pinnacle of Melissa's maturation as a songwriter and singer (check out Heart's Dog & Butterfly if you want to know what I mean).I'm not going to run down each song with a bullet-comment review, just realize that If I Wanted To, Silent Legacy, I Will Never Be The Same, Yes I Am, Resist, and Ruins, are among the very best songs Etheridge ever wrote and performed.If you are a fan who has not purchased this and are sitting on the docks with her debut album believing it was the best ever because you were blown away when it debuted, pick up Yes I Am and you will be blown to the next level.  This album is as much better than her debut self-titled as that one was better than all the pasty female rock artists that saturated us during the 80's.The acoustics are rendered lighter than air while the electric guitar leads just soar like a stealth bomber.  These melodies are both so complex and yet richly simple it's as if Melissa is an artist who painted each song with brush strokes from her heart.If you are just pondering buying this album because of two songs, you might as well pick up her ""greatest hits"" album instead because you sound like a Bryan Adams or TP&theHeartbreakers; kind of listener to me.  If, however, you like the richness of ME's writing style, her brooding vocals, and her gut-wrenching music (if Melissa Etheridge MOVES you) then don't miss out on this album, it's definitely her 5-Star performance!Once again, Melissa issues a directive on individuality, a cry for acceptance and diversity, not a lecture on sexual preferences.  Those reviewers are on the wrong channel watching the unfolding dramas of Brad and Angelina, Tom and Katie, and can't live without trouble in paradise!  And if you like artistry in music, something deeper and more meaningful that the pablum of ""commercially successful"" music, take a big bite of this apple!"
1,This has to be the greatest recording ever in human history. This album will probably remain my all-time favorite for the rest of my life. After almost 30 years nobody has come close to its brilliance. When you play this album you are listening to God through Stevie
1,"As a life long fan of Teena's music, this album ranks a strong 4th on my personal favorite list.  I love this artist because she is truly an original who took her varied musical loves and melded them into her own style - still a courageous feat in the music biz. This fact alone is why her fan base is so loyal & fanatical, because she stays true to HERSELF and doesn't cater to the newest latest trends.My personal faves on this disc are: Irons in the Fire, Tune In Tomorrow (this was one of the first jazz influenced songs that I truly dug), I Need Your Lovin', You Make Love Like Springtime & Young Love.What's funny about Teena's music is that although heavy on the horns & synths, her music never sounds dated or classified to one era, it's truly timeless - I'm still listening to this album that was released almost 20 yrs ago like it was just released last week!!"
1,"Unshackled from the restraints of the Motown formula, with ""Music of My Mind"" and the more gratifying ""Talking Book"", Stevie embarked on a sense of mission to create his own vein of music attesting only to his vision. Continuing this flurry of creative impulse comes this extraordinary blend of soul, funk, rock, gospel and Latin Swing. The flow is undeniable and every melody makes itself felt on initial impact and it just gets stronger the more you hear it. His synthesizer and piano playing power the music and he articulates them as proficiently as his established expertise as a singer/songwriter.In short, this concept album of humanity in the modern day is a work of genius. It kicks off immediately with the funk-raising ""Too High"" that musically elevates the listener to the stratosphere, especially with the punctuations provided by those soul-sweetened background singers. Miraculously, with so much happening in this anti-dope song, one can still discern its rueful stance. On the hypnotic closer, ""He's Misstra Know-It-All"", its character has been riddled with defense mechanisms from day one - perhaps with the fear of escaping them. His sublime rocker, ""Higher Ground"", documents his faith here and above. ""Golden Lady"" reveals that side of Stevie that's pure entertainment. It completes the picture of Stevie just being Stevie and he surrounds this charmer with his usual great melodic facility.Then there's what I regard to be the three most illuminating songs Stevie's ever done. ""All In Love Is Fair"" details life's ultimate win or lose challenge, making this majestic ballad all the more bracing. In ""Visions"", he transcends his realism into the crystallization of his idealism. This song gets complemented by a snazzy jazz guitar solo - a beauty. After all this, what can be said about ""Living for the City""? It's Stevie's titanic soundscape that bares a social heart. He takes an unflinching observation at how the American Justice System can operate. The protagonist is bereft of his liberty and it fully overrules his hope even when he's out - roaming the streets as he gazes into the future.At just twenty-three, Stevie's artistically febrile and exploratory mind has achieved a real rarity - that of instilling a bit of guidance without any preachiness undermining its intent. It's this that stands as his greatest record."
1,"Billy had a huge hit with 1983's  An Innocent Man  which contained some very good pop songs like the title cut, Leave A Tender Moment Alone, and Keeping The Faith among them. However, the album contained a lot of fluff as well and turned off some long time fans even as it created a whole new MTV audience for Joel. There was hope by me, that he'd get back to his ""classic"" style and sound of his late 70's early 80's music.....the music that ultimately ended up being his best stuff. And with the first single and video off his next studio album, 1986's The Bridge, there was promise. ""A Matter of Trust"" rocked....with a set of lyrics that rivaled anything he'd ever done. The rest of the album didn't meet those expectations however. There was some quality stuff on the album (Baby Grand, Code Of Silence) but also some real clunkers too. This Is The Time and Temptation were generic examples of the great ballads Billy used to create seemingly with ease in his classic period like She's Always A Woman, She's Got A Way, and Vienna. Too much boring fluff like Running On Ice, Big Man On Mulberry St., Getting Closer and especially Modern Woman fill out the album. Not a terrible album by any means, but The Bridge represents for me the beginning of the end for Joel's best material and a time period in Joel's career when the albums began to take longer and longer to write and obviously much more difficult for Joel.....either out of boredom with pop/rock or having nothing left to say creatively."
1,"This record put these guys on the map. Although these guys have recorded some catchy songs before and after this recording, nothing has exceded this release. The mix of rock n roll with orchestral instruments works very well as Jeff Lynne's added special effects offer just the right dosage whereas on subsequent releases they were far overblown.The spaced out percussion solo on So Fine is incredibly weird in a good way as one feels like he's taken to another land. And the fade out on Shang Gri La is just so haunting.  And how about the drumming on such tracks as Rockariah and Do Ya?  What really makes this recording great is the atmospherics that exist on every track.  Anyway, this is a real gem for those who like something creative and different in their music."
1,"STREISAND SUPERMAN is one of Streisand's many pop-oriented confections of the 70s.  Basking in the success of A STAR IS BORN, Columbia obviously wanted to duplicate her emergence as more than just a standards and theatre superstar.I'm a lifetime fan of Babs and SUPERMAN has some great performances showcasing her inimitable voice.  The album's biggest single, MY HEART BELONGS TO ME, is a smooth pop single.  The string-laden title track is an infectious track.  ANSWER ME is a restrained and moving effort, as is Kim Carnes' LOVE COMES FROM UNEXPECTED PLACES.  DON'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU READ is the strongest of the ""rock"" tunes.  CABIN FEVER is somewhat embarrassing and I FOUND YOU LOVE a disco misfire.  Billy Joel's NEW YORK STATE OF MIND borders on a little too overblown.  Rupert Holmes' LULLABY TO MYSELF is a strong feminist anthem Barbra does justice to.As with any BS album, it's the voice that counts, and while SUPERMAN has some kryptonite moments, fans will want it in their repertoire."
1,"There's nothing I can say aboout this album that haven't been said by everybody who feels it as much as I do. Except for the fact that it's the best disco album ever recorded.The sheer originality and imagination of this classic album is enough to put Donna Summer's whole catalog to shame. Off the Wall also boasts memorable hooks (Choruses) that The Bee gees wish they had on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack.The reason why I go as far as to call this the best disco album is because Michael brought a more soulful feel to the songs, which made the songs seem more authentic.  Quincy Jones also pushes the disco beat to the background (slightly) to give more attention to the grooves (rhythms) as well as the vocals. As a result Quincy is able to prove that disco can have credibility when it's in the hands of the right producer. with Mike's vocal sincerity, and quincy sparse approach to to the disco beat, Off the Wall has aged better than all other disco albums. It holds up well in 2005.Another thing I love about the album is that Quincy Jones never overdid anything in the beats. Unlike all other disco albums, which might lean too heavily on orchestraed strings and ignore everything else, quincy knows when to bring in the horns, and when to bring in the breakbeats, etc. In other words, he knew when to let a good thing quit which makes the music all the more clear and focused.When they had the disco demolition in Comisky Park  back in 79, instead of using dynamite, they should've used this album as a wrecking ball. Simply because it's so good it crushes the h*ll out of all other disco artists and albums.DISCO MAY'VE BURNED OUT A LONG TIME AGO, BUT OFF THE WALL CAN STILL TURN UP THE HEAT AT ANY PARTY ON ANY DANCEFLOOR."
1,"This c.d was recently purchased on a whim after hearing a snippet of Baby  Come To Me on a commercial for a various artists R&amp;B compilation c.d.  Not the actual song itself but the style of this music brought back  memories of the 80's when artists like Luther Vandross, Freddie Jackson,  Anita Baker, and other true R&amp;B artists would produce &quot;real&quot;  music for the heart and soul (mind as well). Words like soothing, seductive  and sensual don't even begin to describe what this album is about. The only  minor downfall is the numerous slow ballads which start to pile up  consecutively towards the end of the track list. Otherwise, a collector of  fine soul/R&amp;B/contemporary-adult pop would be surely missing out on an  underappreciated and gifted vocalist."
1,I love this release by Elvis.  I take it as a tribute to the singer/songwriters that inspired him.  The selections and arrangements make this a solid country venture for Mr. Costello!
1,"While ""Songs...."" is certainly an ambitious album, even by today's standards, and after being a diehard Stevie fan for my entire life, listening intently to his work and studying this particular LP with my ears for years, I still think there's something missing. I don't know if he just spent too much time 'perfecting' his approach or trying on too many hats, but much of this sounds forced. While I love artists who overreach and bravely wander into new territory, such bravery and experimentation can't be half-hearted but must be approached with vigor and fearlessness. The songs here are good, but not good enough to warrant their length or bloated production, half-baked song ideas simply can't be covered by strings or by running really long. Lyrically, things are equally shaky and almost an embarrassment (..""until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4???"") and could have used a lot more focus. Stevie the ARTISTE' just got a bit out of hand here. ""Songs...."" is good but not great."
1,"3 1/2Elemental remains the sleek early 90's production job it initially sounded of, though can putter off on autopilot, while vocals grow increasingly grating, in its cheesier moments. Thankfully, TFF never leave entire songs stranded for too long, with mushy pace often subsided by broad electronic strokes to help clear the palate when needed."
1,"""I'm Your Man"" has a perfect title.Leonard Cohen IS the man, my man and the man for everyone who loves a sweet, sad ballad sung in a voice that drains every teardrop from the lyrics, and sets them to music that washes over you like rain.This 1988 disc represented a breakthrough of sorts for the Canadian born singer/songwriter. Combined with his now legendary appearance on PBS's ""Austin City Limits"" the same year, ""I'm Your Man"" won Cohen a legion of new fans in the U.S. where he had previously enjoyed relatively minor success.From the sinister ""First, We Take Manhattan"" and ""Everybody Knows,"" the latter highlighted by John Bilezikjian on the ode, to the wryly amusing ""Tower of Song"" and ""I Can't Forget,"" this album provides a crash course in all of the man's styles. The topper, though, is the epic ""Take This Waltz,"" based on a poem by Garcia Lorca. Jennifer Warnes shares the vocals here, and adds considerable depth to an already powerful song.Cohen has made better albums (1971's ""Songs of Love and Hate"" is his finest album in my book), but ""I'm Your Man"" is his most accessible.You the man, Leonard, you the man.Brian W. Fairbanks"
1,"Billy Joel became a star based on the success of the album that preceeded this, &quot;The Stranger.&quot; Like that album, &quot;52nd Street&quot; contains more stories of Billy's life in New York. From the overplayed &quot;My Life,&quot; to the magnificent &quot;Half a Mile Away,&quot; there really isn't a bad track on this album. Check out &quot;Rosalinda's Eyes.&quot;"
1,This is CK at her best. Only artist nowadays who comes close to this style and beauty is Norah Jones.The song's words are easy to understand and contain universally important messages.
1,"the two opening songs are my favorite Bob Dylan songs ever, period.  I am not saying, by giving this a four star review, that this is a bad or mediocre album;  I do enjoy all of the songs.However, Bob Dylan has never really been my cup of tea; he is so taken up with his ""poetry,"" and what has any of it really changed, you know?  The world isn't going to stop being a bad place just because Bob Dylan wants it to!  Yes, he is very important to rock music and folk music, and people analyze his stuff all the time, but the man seems a little crazy and full of himself.  that is probably what happens when little people start worshipping you and quoting your words at every turn.  I mean, the man thinks he understands all these things, and that there is all this philosophy that he ""gets.""  I find this kind of poetic stuff to be quite trite and annoying in the grand scheme of things.  If he let go of his pretensions, I would enjoy the music a lot more.  I have this same kind of problem with the Beatles, and I wish that people would stop giving hero worship to music artists.  contrary to what mr Dylan said, music is not hard work, and it pays an obscene amount of money that is overall not deserved.That said, this is a good album.  It is enjoyable, and mostly focused on people and relationships.  with the exception of ""buckets of rain,"" the last half is fairly lackluster.  I know a lot of people really like Dylan, and if you are one of those people, you need this album."
1,"A NOTHER GREAT CD BY PAC WHICH GOT HIS BEST TRACK EVER (I WONDER IF HEAVEN GOT A GHETO) AND OTHER GREAT TRACKS LIKE OPEN FIRE, WHEN I GET FREE 2 AND DO FOR LUV, GO GET THIS CD, R.I.P Tupac"
1,"Welcome to ""core seven"" album number five as seen through my eyes.  This is the one that takes us into the 70s, but the band is still constant in their peace loving and deeply introspective themes.You will recall (Those of you who are younger, anyway.) that the Vietnam war still wouldn't be over for a few more years, so we are naturally given a lively spiritual awakening from the start with Justin Hayward's ""Question.""  It's true what he says about people being greedy to this day, even in their most seemingly honest and goodhearted searches:  ""All the love you've been giving has all been meant for you.""  In a sense, he has answered his own questions about ""hate and death and war.""  Human beings are utterly selfish and see their own way as the right one no matter what anyone else says.""How is it We are Here,"" Mike Pinder's followup track to ""Question"" seems to address an even darker side of man as we destroy the environment for our own needs in the midst of a starving world.  To this day, what's new?""And the Tide Rushes in,"" is Ray's rather depressing, yet beautiful, take on how people destroy each other's dreams like ""the tide rushes in and washes my castles away,"" and yet he observes that a blackbird can find joy in watching acorns grow.  It seems we can learn a lot from nature if we take the time.""Don't You Feel Small"" is a completely relatable Graeme Edge song.  ""Look at progress, then count the cost.""  We are destroying our world simply by denying our own foolish part in letting someone else care.  ""Who's the biggest fool of all"" indeed, but we have the choice to wake up now because ""time's to come there'll be no choice at all.""""Tortoise and the Hare"" is, if I'm guessing correctly, John Lodge's commentary on the hares having it too easy so that they get lazy and lose the race because the turtle's who've always had it hard kept right on working hard until they win.  That's a good concept to consider if you have to work for everything you have.Justin Hayward's ""It's Up to You"" is basically a very straight forward and honest song with an addictive melody about making good choices and thinking for yourself.  One begins to see as the album goes on the shift from frustration to optimism and hope.  It's balancing itself out, lending cadence the the album title's concept.""Minstrel's Song"" is always among my favorite John Lodge songs, as he seems to have borrowed a bit from Ray's often childlike and sweet, simple melodies.  ""Listen to the one who sings of love.""  It is sweet, singalong-ish, and stays in your head for hours at a time.  It is a lovely sentiment and not heard often enough in this day and age of angry bands.""Dawning is the Day"" is also one of my favorite Hayward songs because it's easy to personally relate to being so lost that you often need others to help you find yourself.  How often do you feel like that soul in the meadow?  ""Wake up in the morning to yourself.  Open your head and look around you.  Listen, we think we have found you.""  Sometimes all you need is to get away from everything and take a step back as well, just letting go of everything.One of Mike Pinder's most depressing and deeply moving songs has to be ""Melancholy Man.""  It is amazing how the differences in people's viewpoints can have such a devastating effect on those who don't agree.  In fact, it is sad that Pinder was so moved to write something that is so devastatingly true.  You can't even argue with what makes his observations so well-phrased:  ""Another man is what you'll see who looks like you and looks like me, and yet somehow he will not feel the same.  His life is caught in misery.  He doesn't think like you and me 'cause he can't see what you and I can see.""  Approach this song with caution, because it is the most depressing track on here.I love the closer, Graeme Edge's ""The Balance.""  This consists of some of his most beautiful hippie-logic-meets-the-Bible wisdom with the story of any man (ie, any one of us) and the way he learns to correct his own attitude toward others by realizing he is not perfect either and learns to forgive out of compassion and love:""He thought of those he angered--for he was not a violent manAnd he thought of those he hurt--for he was not a cruel manAnd he thought of those he frightened--for he was not an evil manAnd he understood...he understood himself.""Edge also stresses that this is nothing new:  ""Just open your eyes and realize the way it's always been.""This is where the album balances itself out after its many moods and contemplations.  I find this to be among the strongest of the core seven because the concept of the album lives up to its title and is only disappointing in slight ways that don't matter enough for me to give it a lower rating.  There are some Moodies albums I'm still not sure of and some I know I dislike without completely hating, and then there are those that deserve to be a part of your Moodies collection.  With no hesitation, A Question of Balance should be one of them."
1,"This album is not my favorite MB offering, but there are four incredible songs on it that I dearly love, one being my ""sometime"" favorite MB tune. I'm only going to mention these songs in my little piece here. I titled my review as I did because of the perfect display of Justin's and John's strengths on this album, Justin being the soulful balladeer and John the ultimate rocker. These two great men are just ""all that"" in my book, so I gotta give 'em their due.Justin Hayward's 'New Horizons', partially inspired by his late father, is a stunning song in every way. Both the arrangement and the music are wonderful, with the strings and Justin's guitar sounding almost mournful at times. Hayward's voice has such a sad and deep note to it as well and he uses it masterfully. His wide vocal range is spotlighted here, along with John's perfect use of subtle and understated harmonies. This song just grabs you by the heart and never lets up, but at the same time it's so beautifully done that you have to enjoy it as well. ""Horizons"" is just simply Justin Hayward doing what he was born to do.Ray Thomas' 'For My Lady', written for the woman he was then married to, is this man at his awesome best. His rich baritone voice, with all its layered nuances has never sounded better, and it soared on the higher registers. The music and lyrics, which are both outstanding, complement each other so well. What more can I say except this is a beautiful song and Ray sings it to perfection. As an aside, I am so very glad he sang it at the 'Red Rocks' concert a few years back for all the world to discover and enjoy.John Lodge once again manages to both playfully rock me and deeply touch my heart with his two songs on this album. A lot of fans and critics consider Lodge's  beautiful 'Isn't Life Strange' to be his best song. It is a favorite of mine, as well. To all those who say John is neither a great singer or writer, I dare you to conclude that after giving this song a really good listening to, preferably two or three. John has never written so poignantly and eloquently as on this song. He writes: ""Isn't life strange? A turn of the page. A book without light unless with love we write"". WOW! is all I can say. John's airy, ethereal voice- not to mention his fabulous falsetto- have never sounded better or stronger. Justin's co-lead and harmonies once again show how terrific these two men sound together. The orchestral arrangements are wonderfully done without overwhelming the song, only adding to its magnificence.I'm saving the best for last: John's  'I'm Just a Singer In a Rock n Roll Band'. This song frequently trade places with 'Ride my Seesaw' as my absolute favorite Moody Blues song. 'I'm Just a Singer' is THE consummate rock song and John Lodge is so very much in his element on this great song. My gosh but the man can rock it out like no one else. John wrote this song in response to the legions of ""spaced out"" fans who worshipped the Moodies as their messiahs. Thank God for those misguided fans or I wouldn't have this great song to enjoy- lol! Not only is the song plain fun to listen to, its lyrics actually have a deep meaning. This song is a winner in every way possible. All the Moodies give stellar performances vocally and instrumentally. The rhythm, beat and tempo of this song are outstanding, carried along by the masterful hands of Graeme Edge on percussion (his best performance, IMO) and John on his  funky Fender bass. Mike Pinder's keyboards/ Mellotron work is absolutely incredible, and Justin's blazing guitar solo blisters the ears. I love to listen to this song cranked up full throttle while wearing headphones. I hit 'repeat' and off I go rocking for an hour or more on just this one song alone. (No, I never get tired of it- not yet anyway) I'm sure I have sustained major ear damage but the sheer joy this song brings me is well worth it. If I still smoked cigs, I'd have to light one up after experiencing the genuine pleasure this song gives me- it's that good! To all the fans who got to see this song performed live pre-hiatus, I am so very green right now. To me, this phenomenal song is the Moody Blues at their ultimate best.Well dear folks, that's my take on 'Seventh Sojourn', four songs of it anyway. Take a listen to it...... and enjoy. As for John Lodge and The Moody Blues, I have to say that they are MUCH more than ""just singers in a rock n roll band"" to us fans.  They are a fantastic group of talented men who bring so much needed joy and pleasure to a hurting world. Thank you!"
1,"The Jacksons did a great job on this cd/album, in fact, the title, Triumph, is fitting!"
1,"""The Hurdy Gurdy Man"" was probably Donovan's last truly solid effort, although a few missteps mark this as a slightly lesser work than the three previous masterpieces that came before it.  Although nearly all of the tracks on it are strong, the overall sound and style is perhaps a little *too* diverse, creating an unfocused atmosphere that is in contrast to the singular mood which ""Sunshine Superman"", ""Mellow Yellow"" and ""A Gift From A Flower To A Garden"" were able to create.The album opens with the title track, one of his best-ever compositions that starts out as a whisper and ends as a raging rocker featuring the singer backed by three future members of Led Zeppelin; however, the rest of the record is radically different from this, ranging from psychedelic drones to acoustic ballads and a few featuring the West Indian influence found on the previous single ""There Is A Mountain"".  ""Peregrin"", ""The River Song"" and ""Tangiers"" belong to the psychedelic drone genre, and all three are mesmerising in style, with the ""The River Song"" being particularly beautiful.  ""Get They Bearings"" is a catchy piece of jazz-rock with saxaphone, while ""The Entertaining Of A Shy Girl"" and ""The Sun Is A Very Magic Fellow"" are slightly twee but still charming ballads in the flower-power mold Donovan is perhaps most associated with (if a bit unfairly, especially given the power of rockers like ""Season Of The Witch"", ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" and ""Barabajagal"").The album begins to drag towards its finish, however, and ""Teas"" is perhaps the weakest closing track on any of his albums, leaving one with a more mixed impression of the work overall than was necessary.  When one considers the high quality of the singles and outtakes included as bonus tracks on this remaster--especially ""Poor Cow"", ""Lalena"" and the truly bizarre ""What A Beautiful Creature You Are""--one wonders why these weren't included on the final release.  In any case, while not a first choice for new Donovan fans (that would *have* to be ""Sunshine Superman"", in either its US or UK incarnations), it is still an essential purchase in rounding out his classic period, and certainly a superior effort to succeeding efforts like ""Barabajagal"" (get that one anyway, especially the remaster with its superior bonus cuts)."
1,"This along with ""Criss-Cross"" have been roundly acknowledged as among the best the Monk has ever done.  Considering he had recorded dozens of albums, that's no small praise either.  This version of the classic album is a work of art in itself.  The mini-lp sleeve replica is very well done and it reproduces very faithfully the cover art on the original lp release.  In addition, all the tracks have been very well digitally remastered so that the sound quality is really very, very good.  This is by far the best version of this album that is currently out there.Recommended for all fans of Monk and of great jazz in general."
1,"I'd like to start by saying that this is one of the better albums of the 90's and the No Doubt album that is most popular among the fans. It was also the band commercial breakthrough album, although it was acually their second. No Doubt from Anaheim, CA was defenitely a fresh and unique band when they came out in 1995 with this one. They mixed Rock with Ska and Reggae but were also able to create good hooks on most songs and occasional tear jerking ballads like ""Don't Speak"". No Doubt with lead singer Gwen Stefani was some kind of new wave band of the mid 90's just like Debby Harry and Blondie had been in the 80's. Although they were diffrent musically, the 2 singers had something in common. Needless to say, ""Tragic Kingdom"" is No Doubt at their best and nothing short of excellent. It's fun, catchy and with a fresh and unique sound that certainly got the attention of most people at the time.It all starts with the excellent hit single, ""Spiderwebs"" The song is about a relationship that is almost like a spiderweb and the song is a trademark No Doubt song with all the Ingredients they mixed to create their special sound. Gwen's energy is amazing. ""Excuse Me Miss"" is slightly slower but doesn't lack the goodies either. ""Just a Girl"" sound alot like ""Spiderwebs"" but it's more of a girls anthem. It was their first single and a very good one. ""Happy Now"" is very good too, a very energic song with good guitars. ""Diffrent People"" is the opposite, a happy mood song. ""Hey You"" is another No Doubt standard in midpace. ""The Climb"" shows that the band also can make ballads. ""Sixteen"" is perhaps for a younger audience, a song about teenagers with an energic hook.The upcoming two songs are 2 of the best. First comes ""Sunday Morning"" that also was released as a single and is one of the more rock influenced songs of the album. ""No Doubt"" is my personal favorite and infact one of the best ballads of the decade, can you believe a band that sang ska-pop on ""Just a Girl"" could make something so diffrent like this one. A beautiful and tear jerking ballad. The song is co-written between Gwen and brother Eric and is about her previous relationship with bandmember and bassist Tony Kanal. Tony broke up and the song was made to cover the pain that Gwen went through. It still gives me goosebumps. ""You Can Do It"" sound disco influenced, it's odd but who's surprised?. ""World Go Round"" is a mix between Ska, Jazz and pop, It's really catchy but a typical album song. ""End it On This"" and ""Tragic Kingdom"" the title track both are solid standards that melt into the album concept well.Overall, Classic 90's album that was and is special in it's own way with the bands Ska revival, some reggae, some rock and pop. It got diversity, energy, it's fun and catchy. If You are new to the band start here cause it's their best album and the one that made them famous too. 5/5 stars."
0,This album is worthless. What's up with the hype. I could not find one song that I liked...Horrible album bes avoided. Rock With you is a decent song but the rest is terrible.
1,"Following up a blockbuster like &quot;Thriller&quot; would have been impossible for anyone, but Michael Jackson proved he was more than up to the task! While the much touted Stevie/Michael duet is the only real sin here, the rest of &quot;Bad&quot; is quite good! There are no filler tracks, and even at it's sappiest (&quot;I Just Can't Stop Loving You&quot;) this work is still transcendent. My favorite cuts are the biting indictment of &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; (still the best video of his career!),&quot;Speed Demon&quot; (cheesy yes, but also catchy as heck)and the slow, bubbling passion of &quot;Liberian Girl&quot; (should have been a single). &quot;Bad&quot; is essentially a greatest hits package covering '87-'89 since 5 tracks here were number 1's and everthing here was worthy of release as a hit or B-side. Just chalk this up as another Jackson classic, not as consistently great as &quot;Thriller&quot;, but a worthy sequel."
1,"in the case of Hot Buttered Soul, Less is truly more.and the remastered quality is AWESOME!great price, you can't beat it."
1,"This is an album that perfectly captures the dark, delicious, decadent feel of a great night of bar-hopping and dancing, including the 4 A.M. hangover afterwards. And the music? Fantastic! You gotta love the percussion and rhythmic touches in these tracks, which are innovative and anything but standard issue. It's a classic album of its time. I saw her perform once live at a gay bar, and after her performance she came right out on the dancefloor and danced among us (with one of her blonde hunk boyfriends, and she could attract them in droves!)  We were young, and a guy I'd been dancing with dared me to go out and ""touch"" her, so I did, and she just smiled and laughed,a very unpretentious lady. It struck me that she was a romantic sort of woman, not just the ultra-eccentric, cool as ice tough-chick that's all part of her act. We loved her! And this album, which includes the great ""Pull Up to the Bumper"" and the moody ""Walking in the Rain"" is my favorite of all that she has done; it's brilliant, in fact."
1,"Any other duet would get an easy 5-star for this effort, but the best performers sometimes get critiqued a little tougher. Plus there seems to be still the overly sensitive college intellectual sound here that may be a little grating over the years. SCARBOROUGH FAIR is a pleasant tune,simply not among my favorite's from these fellows. PATTERNS is more interesting, and HOMEWARD BOUND will always ring true, though the chorus sometimes sounds a little rushed,almost another song tacked on.59th STREET BRIDGE is a fun song that has always reminded me of girls skipping or jumping rope in the city. DANGLING CONVERSATION is beautifully done, even if the lyrics seem too obviously from an English Lit class. And FOR EMILY is another beauty, even if again a little too sensitive.  Most of the rest are contemporary,circa 1967, and not really memorable. BOOKENDS  and BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER  are better efforts.Still, a very worth late 1960's effort by the leading folk/pop duet of the time."
1,"What a wonderful compilation of the master of soul's very best. Put it on  your system, pour the wine, light the candles and enjoy. These songs bring  back strong memories and added desires. &quot;Your My Everything&quot; is  one way to describe Barry himself.Thanks--CDS"
1,"Albert Collins and Johnny Copeland were two of the pioneers of Texas blues, and major influences to the late Stevie Ray Vaughan. These two guys work their magic on this CD, and bring on a young bluesman named Robert Cray. These guys just seem to have fun with this CD, never trying to outdo each other. Great riffs in the leadoff track &quot;T-Bone Shuffle&quot;, harmonica on &quot;Bring Your Fine Self Home&quot;, lyrics in &quot;Black Cat Bone&quot; (hear Johnny Copeland yelling &quot;Hey Albert!&quot;) and the last track &quot;Blackjack&quot; where each does a tremendous guitar solo. Cray, of course, is now a major talent in his own right, and Johnny Copeland lives on in a way in his daughter Shemekia Copeland's music, but here is a playful, low-key yet powerful, piece of work from some of the masters of electric blues. Highly recommended for serious blues fans."
1,"In my opinion this has to be Luther's most uneven 80's record. Luther must have been doing some heavy Gotham City nightclubbing to include overproduced/synth-heavy cheesefests like 'I wanted your Love' and 'For the Sweetness of your Love'. In fact, I'll Let you Slide was the first single...are you kidding me??!!! And just when it seems all hope is gone, along comes the title track, 'Make me a Believer', 'How many times can we say Goodbye', and Luther's magnum opus, 'Superstar/Until you come Home to me'. Sing Luther!!!Sure, you could bypass the Velvetta tracks and just buy a greatest hits package with all the hits. But this is Luther y'all. But if you want to be a true LV fan you need the whole experience, the love songs and the cheese."
1,"First collection of hits by Bon Jovi released back in 1994.Two unreleased track: the power ballad ALWAYS and the semi-acoustic uptempo SOMEDAY I'LL BE SATURDAY NIGHT.As usual the standard of the quality is very high.You also get included here IN & OUT OF LOVE, the band's very first Top 40 hit.All the rest is the material that made Bon Jovi famous.I would have given it 5 stars if only BORN TO BE MY BABY, LIVING IN SIN and the Christmas tune I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS would have been added.If you want an overall view of their career this far, this is a good choice"
1,Great album from a great band! The CD was just like the original LP I bought back in the day. The remastering really brought out the crystal clear harmonies and chord progressions that made this band unique. I will buy from this vendor again and again.
1,"Your purchase should be based entirely on the question asked in the title of the album itself.  Are you still down?  There have been a lot of albums released after Tupac's death, and beginning with ""R U Still Down"" it is easy to tell that quality, original 2Pac material is becoming hard to come by.  Tupac was immensely paranoid about his own death, and was absolutely convinced he was destined to die an early, tragic death.  Because of the paranoia, he recorded as many songs as he could.  It is amazing there have been so many cds released after his death, but it is easy to tell that Sug and Death Row are running out of quality material.With that said, I still think this is a great album.  ""R U Still Down"" is very catchy, ""Hellrazr"" is an incredibly powerful narrative, and of course there is ""I Wonder if Heaven Got a Ghetto,"" which I think is one of the best songs 2Pac ever created.  The first cd is great, and shows Pac at some of his best.  But, the second cd is not nearly as good, and really starts to drag at the later half.  You know it is bad when they have to double up songs too (""I Wonder if Heave Got a Ghetto"" reappears on the second CD and is a so-so remix at best).Overall, you just have to ask yourself ""Am I still down?""  If you can't get enough 2Pac, go right ahead and buy this album, you'll likely not be disappointed.  However, if you are starting to lose interest, this CD may not be worth the money, especially since the second CD is only mediocre.  And finally, if you are new to Tupac, ""Me Against the World,"" ""All Eyez on Me,"" and his ""Greatest Hits"" CD are better starting points."
1,"It was with deep saddness that I heard of the passing of Composer,Arranger,Singer,Producer,Songwriter,DJ and humanitarian Mr.Isaac(Black Moses)Hayes a few days ago.Myself being being a big Isaac Hayes fan.And having just about everyone of his albums decided to review the 'Hot Buttered Soul' album.Because this is the album that startled it all and gave birth to the movement.The Isaac Hayes movement that would come to dominate the mid sixties and on into the mid seventies.Isaac Hayes had a uncanny way of taking other peoples songs and turning them into something very special and unique.And when Isaac Hayes decided to rap on some of his songs the raps were done with class and style.You found yourself actuality feeling the pain of the guy as he drove his car with tears in his eyes on his way to Phoenix.On 'Walk On By' Hayes gives us a fantastic arrangment and a great vocal performance.And if you like some funk in your music you got 'Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic'.And finally you have 'One Woman' a song dealing with forbidden love sung with deep depth of feeling by Hayes.'Hot Buttered Soul' with its mixture of horns,strings,vocals and storytelling turned out to be a powerhouse elixir of sound.We should also give some credit to Stax records for having the guts to put this album out to the public.I think the biggest influence 'Hot Buttered Soul' had on R&B is that it put an end to the three minute rule for R&B songs.Before 'Hot Buttered Soul' R&B songs were three minutes or less.After 'Hot Buttered Soul' artists like The Temptations,Barry White,Donna Summer,James Brown and Stevie Wonder  songs became longer.By breaking the three minute rule Isaac Hayes made it possible for these artists and so many others to extend their musical creativeness.After 'Hot Buttered Soul' Isaac Hayes and The Movement would give us the albums To Be Continued,The Isaac Hayes Movement,Black Moses,Live At The Sahara Tahoe and of course Shaft.With the great songs Our Day Will Come,I Stand Accused,Never Can Say Goodbye,Ain't No Sunshine and Theme From Shaft.This is just a small amount of music that came out of the fertile musical mind of Iassc Hayes.Well the fertile musical mind of Isaac Hayes is at rest now along with Curtis Mayfield,James Brown,Barry White and Luther Vandross.With only a few of the R&B giants left what the furture holds for R&B? I for one do not know.But I do know this.The music of Isaac Hayes will continue to be a source of entertainment and Joy(another one of his albums).Rest In Peace Brother Hayes."
1,"Whether it's fast or slow, melancholic or rocking, Bon Jovi fill stadiums and break hearts over and over. The omissions of In These Arms and Never Say Goodbye from the US version are unfortunate (especially the latter; so good it makes me sentimental for a scene I never experienced), and I'll Sleep When I'm Dead and Living In Sin should've appeared, but everything else is amazing. My personal favourtie here is I'll Be There For You. The finale gets me every time, but Always, Livin' On A Prayer, Bad Medicine and You Give Love a Bad Name are up there as well. Actually so is everything except Lay You Hands On Me and the vaguely cheesy Runaway (the keyboard on is seriously dated). One of teh great 80s rock bands who still keep it pumping today."
1,"BLOOD ON THE TRACKS is almost universally regarded as Bob Dylan's greatest album after BLOOD ON THE TRACKS (or at least after the inconsistent brilliance of the songs that he recorded with the Band in Woodstock, NY, some of which made it into THE BASEMENT TAPES) and with considerable justification.  Although Dylan remained productive for most of the decade following the release of BLONDE ON BLONDE, his output was clearly not on the same level as on it, BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME, and HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED.  Though JOHN WESLEY HARDING represented only a slight decline from those masterworks, such ill-conceived ventures as SELF PORTRAIT, DYLAN, and PLANET WAVES caused many to believe that Dylan had lost it.  BLOOD ON THE TRACKS was one of the great comebacks in the history of rock, comparable to Elvis's 1968 television special.  The Dylan of this album was different yet the same, still spinning out one astonishing lyrics after another, and stretching songs to narrative limits as never before.  With the release later in 1975 of a some of THE BASEMENT TAPES, Dylan was completely back on top.In my opinion, only one thing keeps BLOOD ON THE TRACKS from equally HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED and BLONDE ON BLONDE for utter genius:  the back up musicians.  Both of those albums featured a host of utterly brilliant musicians, from the likes of Michael Bloomfield and Al Kooper, to Nashville veteran Charlie McCoy, whose eleven-minute brilliance on acoustic guitar on ""Desolation Row"" made an already great song even greater.  But one looks in vain on BLOOD ON THE TRACKS for musicians who contributed guitar like Bloomfield and McCoy or Al Kooper's accidental organ on ""Like a Rolling Stone.""  The playing on BLOOD ON THE TRACKS isn't bad; it is merely uninspired.  As a result, an absolutely astonishing group of songs is held back ever so slightly.Still, abject amateurs couldn't have obscured the brilliance of the songs on this album.  All the songs on the album are at least very good, while at least five or six are by any standard--or more importantly, by Dylan's almost impossibly high standards--great songs.  ""Tangled Up in Blue,"" ""Simple Twist of Fate,"" ""Idiot Wind,"" and ""If You See Her, Say Hello"" are simply masterpieces of the first rank.  And ""Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts"" almost approximates a B-Western in its comic yet moving narration of a bank heist and murder in the Old Western.  That song proceeds almost cinematically, moving the story forward not so much by focusing on the action but by a series of glimpses into the main characters.  All in all it is an astonishing achievement and might be the finest telling of a tell of any song in wrong.  ""Simple Twist of Fate"" similarly tells the story of a man who falls in love with a woman after a single night of passion.  The musical highlight of the album for me is, however, ""Idiot Wind.""  Since BLOOD ON THE TRACK Dylan has even on otherwise weak albums written a score of superb songs.  But I'm not sure that any of his post-1975 output has matched ""Idiot Wind.""  The passion in his singing was matched previously on such classics as ""Like a Rolling Stone"" and ""Positively 4th Street,"" but not on many other occasions.  He sings some of the words almost as if he is trying to stab someone with them.  Everything is in the song.  Humor in the way he sings ""I can't help it if I'm lucky"" after he tells of how he inherited a million bucks after the death of the woman who originally inherited it from her husband when he died, perhaps by the singer's hand.  And irony in the way he snarls the words ""Sweet lady.""  But with all the anger in the song, much of it is reflected back on himself, and he truly does seem to mean it when he sings ""We're idiots babe/It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.""In my opinion (well, OK, it is the opinion of a mass of music lovers, so I can't claim any originality here) Dylan is the predominant musical figure of the past forty years.  That it isn't his greatest album is a remarkable testimony to his genius.  But let me try to express how great this album is another way:  if any other figure in music had produced an album this great, he or she would instantly have been declared one of music's greatest lights.  Music may occasionally reach this level and even in a few instances surpass it, but those moments are very, very few and far between."
1,"This being Elton John's second album after ""Empty Sky"", it truly embarked Elton on his remarkable career.  It was the first of many productions by Gus Dudgeon and contained Elton's first group of band members that would last throughout the seventies.  ""Your Song"" was the big hit here, but songs like, ""Take Me To The Pilot"" and ""Border Song"" became FM radio station staples.  Elton also recorded live with an orchestra here and it marks the first time that he really took advantage of the setup.  Stand-out cuts are ""Sixty Years On"" and ""The King Must Die""; songs he later recreated in concert.  Bonus tracks, ""Bad Side Of The Moon"", ""Rock `n Roll Madonna"" and ""Grey Seal"" were fantastic single B-Side cuts that should have been on the original album.  In fact, ""Grey Seal"" was later rerecorded for ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"".  In SACD Surround Sound, this album is like being in the studio with Elton John the first time he had a huge success.  This is a landmark album."
1,"A more consistant album than &quot;Thriller&quot; (honestly), and equally groundbreaking in its own way. This new edition has been sonically buffed-up to some extent, and a few bonus tracks added on. The bonus tracks - 2 demos (OK) and an interview (snooze) - don't add up to too much. Nice booklet with new notes. Essential if you don't already have the first version on CD, a nice luxury if you do."
1,"First of all, in the context of the time that this was recorded, it was a pleasant departure from what was dominating the airwaves.  At that time most  of the record chart hits had a disco beat and were heavily produced.  Then comes this recording heralded by the tender R&B; influenced ""What You Won't Do For Love"" which instantly became etched in just about everyone's memory.  The song had a directness, a tenderness, with a simple horn chart and spare accompaniment.  The song is timeless.Bobby has very clear tenor voice with an excellent range and he knows how to use it.  This simplicity and directness carries through the whole of this recording.  They songs all have the ""heart on the sleeve"" feeling.  There's a bit of heartbreak with all the sentimentality.  So much so that it's almost borne of that early sixties innocence.The songs are diverse in influence.  Jazzy, with Carribean, World, Pop and in one case Disco influences.  Although the Disco tune is not as heavy handed as that genre could be.  That being the first cut on this recording.Throughout Bobby delivers with a grace and maturity, if a little tortured in the lost-love or scenarios of some of the songs.It's good simple pop music, which as I said was a refreshing departure from the heavy production values and arena rock recordings of the time.  Bobby has since had a good career both as a songwriter, session singer and headliner in his own right.  He has tackled some diverse material and has even outdone the Michael Bubles and Harry Connicks of the world with two popular standard recordings.It all begins here."
1,"In 1985 Stevie Wonder came back with his first studio album in 5 years to most fans excitement. Wonder had taken the 80's by storm and scored more hits then ever but his creativity had subsided to give room for pure Pop instead of Soul. Considering that this album came out in 1985 it's not that strange that some of the songs rely on synthesizers and drum machines which sound rather dated today but ""In Square Circle"" is considerable better then the soundtrack album he made two years ealier for the film ""The Woman In Red"" and some of the songs here are simply outstanding. Here you find the catchy uptempo ""Part Time Lover"" a huge hit that topped the billboard charts and is one of his alltime best. For alot of people this was probably the first exposure to Stevie Wonder's greatness. If you listen closely to the end of the verse, you can hear Luther Vandross's humming. Second song ""I Love You Too Much"" is another great number, a love song where Wondeer prove he still got it. Other good songs are the South African influnced ""It's Wrong (Apartheid)"" with African chants and drums which deal about the obvious thing stated in the title. A brilliant ballad called ""Overjoyed"" that could have been released today probably takes the price as the best song. It's about finding that special one and to feel ""Overjoyed"" by that experience and hoping that the other person feel the same about you. ""Wherabouts"" may not have the catchyness but it's lyrics are wonderful about a man trying to capture the moments in the past where everything was working fine for him with love and happyness. Two funky numbers with ""Go Home"" that was a #10 hit and good for the dancefloor and ""Land of La la"" which probably got a double meanming when it talks about finding fame and success in LA and then sings land of La LA in the hook which stand for something else. The last three songs, ""Strangers in the Shore Of Love"", ""Never In The Sun"" are quite forgettable midtempo/lovesongs while ""Spiriual Walkers"" is a synthesizer friendly pop song. As a whole, ""In Square Circle"" is a good enough purchase with plenty of memorable songs. It's the last good album from Stevie Wonder. In particular ""Overjoyed"", ""I Love You Too Much"" and ""Wherabouts"" are hidden gems that proved that Wonder still had it. There isn't that much more to say other then if you like most of his music you're gonna like this one aswell even if it's not among his better albums."
1,The final cut on this CD alone makes it a must-have!  Brian's vocals and songwriting are wonderful - he's a treasure!
1,"Hey Wonder fans!Come back to 1987 and take a revisit to Wonder's most underrated album I can think of!&quot;Characters&quot; thankfully came before Wonder's sad daliance with dull New Jackswing arrangements on some of his 1990's albums and makes a muchimproved follow up to the unfocused &quot;In Square Circle&quot;.Similar sound,MUCH better songwriting.From the sad but memorable &quot;You Will Know&quot;,the stomping funk of &quot;Dark And Lovely&quot;the MicahelJackson duet &quot;Get It&quot;,&quot;My Eyes Don't Cry&quot; and the classic&quot;Skeletons&quot;,this album is packed with corkers!And no filler-the latinish &quot;Crying Through The Night&quot;,the Supreme's-like &quot;In Your Corner&quot; and the roadhouse R&amp;B of &quot;Come Let Me Make Your Love Come Down&quot; are ticklish highlites while the fabulous&quot;Galaxy Paradise&quot;,&quot;Free&quot; and the pulsing ballad &quot;Each Beat Of My Heart&quot; are quintessencial Wonder tunes that (as usual) seem to defy catagorization.And he even has time to throw in a classic pop/R&amp;B tune in &quot;One Of A Kind&quot;.This is also one of Stevie's few albums seemingly aimed primarily at the 1980's urban Afro Amercian audience-perhapes a sad reminder of the album's seeming lack of universal success.But that doesn't make ANY of it's 12 cuts any less potent so &quot;Characters&quot; is STILL an all-time Wonder classic!"
1,"After revitalizing his career as well his personal life with 1992's ""The One,"" Elton John wasted no time capitalizing on his comeback. He launched a massive, lengthy world tour, and scored the hugely successful ""The Lion King,"" which garnered him an Oscar. By 1995, Elton was once again able to prove that he was, still standing.His album release from that year, ""Made In England,"" is further testament to his enduring staying power, as well as the ever enduring prowess of his lyricist, Bernie Taupin. After years of dabbling with electronic sounds, Elton finally returned to the more organic sounds of earlier albums such as ""Elton John"" and ""Madman Across The Water."" The result was a top to bottom succession of classic Elton, complete with stirring, beautifully complex melodies and Taupin's sincere, emotional, often humorous lyrical touches, anchored by fine musicianship anchored by longtime stalwarts such as Davey Johnstone on guitar and Paul Buckmaster handling string arrangements.Kicking off with the stunning, Lennon-esque ode to love, ""Believe,"" which is similar to ""Imagine"" in its simple yet powerful plea to unity and peace, yet elevates itself to a higher artistic plateu with Elton's dramatic, emotional vocal and Buckmaster's steady, soaring string arrangement.This level of artistic excellency maintains itself throughout the rest of the album. Among the gems present on this album are another somber, brooding Lennon tribute, ""House"" (similar to Lennon's ""God"" in its sparse arrangement and steady lyric pattern), the sad yet hopeful ode to a war torn, shimmering city of emerald in ""Belfast,"" which features some of Buckmaster's best string work since his early 1970s' work with EJ, and two rockers, the autobiographical title track and the witty, Rolling Stones-ish ""Pain,"" whose title and lyrics juxtapose with its in your face, guitar driven melody, further proof Elton's gift for irony in music. ""Man,"" while tepid on paper, is driven by Elton's gutsy, passionate vocal, while ""Cold"" and ""Lies"" are, much like ""Believe,"" simplistic but powerful.Best of all, perhaps, is its mystical closer ""Blessed."" Containing snatches reminsicent of ""Your Song"" and other, earlier classics, ""Blessed"" is a look towards the future, as Elton and Bernie express their desire to have children and continue to explore new territories, both in music and in life.""Made In England"" is a masterful latter day effort from EJ, and one that ranks up there with some of his all time best work."
1,"whether a debut album or not, whether a black rock band or not, this is a superb recording, period! A solid effort front to back. Muzz Skillngs on bass and Wil Calhoun on drums are an airtight rhythm section laying down a solid platform for the great guitar work of Vernon Reid and the superb vocals of Corey Glover.The fact that they are black doesn't hurt because they have a certain swig and sway that alot of white rock bands don't have. All that aside, this a great rock CD and should be in your collection. It doesn't get much better."
1,"Nothing like getting hooked on a song when it first comes out, and sticks with you afterwards. I've been a fan of Mike Oldfield ever since I heard &#34;Tubular Bells&#34;, and continue to be now. In the past few years, many of Oldfield's iconic albums have been remixed and remastered by Mike himself, to include box sets with the original versions along with updated remixes of the original, as well as a DVD with a discrete 5.1 surround mix of the album. I make no secret of the fact that that's why I buy these box sets. &#34;TB&#34; and &#34;Ommadawn&#34; are among my favorite albums, and when &#34;Crises&#34; was released, with its hit single &#34;Moonlight Shadow&#34; (sung by Maggie Reilly), I bought it immediately.The opening title track is one of Mike's long-form tracks, and comparing the original CD with the stereo remix shows several differences that some people on a website I frequent panned vehemently. I actually liked the reworking, and even said so on that site. One of the things Mike did was to expand the intro of &#34;Shadow&#34;, which I found interesting. The sound of the 5.1 remix brought the textures out even more. My feeling is that Mike wouldn't have undertaken this project if he didn't think he could improve on the original mix, to make it fit more into the vision he had for it. I think he succeeded. This set is not cheap, but it's worth every cent in my opinion. I encourage the listener to go into it with an open mind and form their own opinions."
1,"How did I get into Primus.  It must come from South Park tv show where the main song is done by Primus.  South Park (french version from France) is hilarious as their expressions don't even sound vulgar to us in America.Really, a hard to describe album.  Is it music or is it sound? I don't know but it quite good and different than anything else.  It 's all about what can be done with a bass.I bought it for the song ""Wynona's big brown beaver"" which makes me laugh a lot.  I usually hate voices like on this song but this one is true perfection with music and lyrics.The best song on this album is ""Southbound Pachyderm"".  Wow a masterpiece!  It has that ""Stranglehold"" Ted Nudget feel in it.First song on this album is used very often in show for bass solo by other bands.Excellent"
1,"The [then] eargerly-awaited double-album opus &quot;Songs In The Key Of Life&quot; - believe this or not - is considered over-rated and over-produced to some of the most hardcore Stevie fans today.  In truth, it  really is an impressive statement, like earlier albums in the Wonder  catalog, Stevie masters many kinds of music without ever losing his own  identity.  &quot;Songs In The Key...&quot; boasts many elements; most  prominent are funk jams &amp; delicate ballads, but there's also acid-rock,  swing, latin, gospel, even Hare Krishna chants.  As usual, Stevie has an  exceptional gift for lyrics and this album makes no exception.  There's  destitude horror in &quot;Village Ghetto Land&quot;, historical  declarations in &quot;Black Man&quot;, and biblical wailing in  &quot;As&quot;.  &quot;Joy Inside My Tears&quot; acheives in greater effect  what Stevie's &quot;Superwoman&quot; did 4 years earlier, it combines  happiness &amp; sadness in the same space.  It's as if you can hear Stevie  laughing &amp; crying at once when this track plays.  The very-familiar  &quot;Isn't She Lovely&quot; is a beautiful valentine to his wife &amp;  daughter.  &quot;Another Star&quot; is the epitome of 70's jazz/soul/funk,  it mixes lighting voices, wailing horns, rapid percussion &amp; Stevie's  beating piano.  The album is so varied that it may not have an immediate,  exciting appeal to the ears.  Like other brilliant music, sometimes it  takes several listenings to decipher what it's all about.Some of the  tracks extend themselves to 7 or 8 minutes, but you don't really notice,  you could go on singing La-La-La forever.  There really is a lot to swallow  at once.  Once again he repeatedly seems to be reaching for truth.  It's as  if he's always saying - of all things a blind person could say - &quot;With  love, there is always light at the end of the tunnel&quot;.  It is a  landmark album."
1,"Just a classic CD on this one. Wow, from start to finish, this album is just loaded with tracks from &quot;Your Body's Callin'&quot; to &quot;12-Play&quot;. My favorite track is &quot;Seems Like Your Ready&quot;, a slept on classic song. To me this is where R. Kelly starts production spree of songs from Hi-Five's &quot;Quality Time&quot; on. Of course, the two stand out songs with the remixes for &quot;Bump &amp; Grind&quot; &amp; Your Body's Callin'&quot;. So please get this one because it is a definite can't miss."
1,"I've held off reviewing SKIN TIGHT all these years beacuse at one time this was an album you could take for granted EVERYBODY having, and not only that, being able to cop a certain infectious bass line off of it to boot.  One might even call the famous vamp from SKIN TIGHT the ghettoe version of CHOP STICKS.... you just had to know it... - - yet I'm surprised that there are some people these days who aren't quite down with the Player's, even though they paved the path for everything that came after - - including Prince and today's nu-soul.First - - the concept - - hard core funk, but with a bit of everything thrown in... especially Jazz and Gospel harmony, and even touches of the pop/rock of the era - - and all this done with a distinct flavor of a new type of '70s soul- - There were also slow jams here and there, but slow not in the sense of sweet and lush (like Barry White and Issac Hayes) but NASTY and HARDCORE (complete with the latest and funkiest analogue synths of the era including plenty of MOOG, CLAVs and ARPS). . .  That was the player's unique formula, and today its not something new, its THE RULE, and there is no doubt that when you see all the groups today who got their stuff from Cameo and Prince, you definitely have to be aware that THEY in turn got it from SUGAR and the Players.SKIN TIGHT (recorded circa 1974) marks the begining of the FUNKY SLOW JAM and the Ohio's unique brand of Jived out Funk with a wicked Jazz edge...  The PLAYER'S were also unique because even though they were doing ultra hard core funk along with their label mates P-FUNK on the WESTBOUND label, they were still quite underground when (like P-Funk) they jumped to Polydor - - even for a group who's tunes had a lot of pop and disco crossover appeal (the lyrics were mostly about the three Fs... the first two being fun and funk - - but I forget the third...)When you listen to this album its great... a real journey - - it can be dance music, just as much as backround, dreaming or whatchamacallit making music, and you can follow the journey from begining to end... a lot is happening and there's a sound and production style hard edged yet smooth that no other group quite had - - For this reason, SKIN TIGHT is one of those albums that belongs in every true funk and soul collector's album - - and yes, bass players need to be studying that famous vamp one and again - - hard to believe almost 32 years later ! ! !Now as for me and my favorite Polydor era OP albums, although SKIN TIGHT and FIRE set the precedent, actually HONEY and CONTRADICTION are my faves (Honey also being my favorite of their distinctly recognizable album covers !)"
1,"REO Speedwagon broke into the Billboard Top 10 and America's teenagers started to hear this band due to this classic album released in 1981.  From the slow song &quot;Keep On Loving You&quot; which always reminds me of those dances in the high school gym.  To other gems such as &quot;Tough Guys&quot;, &quot;Don't Let Him Go&quot;, &quot;Take It On The Run&quot;.REO Speedwagon had its glory days in the sun before going back into obscurity in the mid 1980's but for a couple of years they were Rock and Roll royalty and hearing this album (CD) it is not hard to see why.  Highly recommended!"
1,"Michael Jackson's album Dangerous lead into what would become the greatest world tour of its time and the song follows his path of improving and changing styles.  This album features a hard-rock single and it also is the first time Jackson would insert rapping interludes- I'm not one for rap, but Jackson always made sure they fit into the song.This is one of the greatest selling albums of all time, just barely beating out Bad as Jackson's second biggest selling album.  People said in Dangerous that Jackson had become a mechanical entertainer, but I strongly disagree.  I find his work in Dangerous just as good as previous albums even though its highlight singles may not be on the level of some of his previous songs.Album Highlights Include:Jam - A very fast paced tune from the King of Pop provides an exciting start to this excellent album, and features a very fun tune and rap interlude.  Like other fast-paced songs from Jackson the lyrics are spoken at a machinegun pace and are hard to get if you don't pay attention.  The music video featured the other MJ: the King of Ball (Basketball, to be exact) Michael Jordon.In The Closet - A smooth, sexually suggestive song with a crisp beat and lyrics.  Some may remember its sexually stimulating music video.Remember The Time - Another crisp, smooth love song from Michael.  The music video was set in Ancient Egypt.Heal the World - The song written to launch Jackson's Heal the World charity which continues to operate `til this day.  It is in the style of his previous ""change the world"" song Man in the Mirror.Black Or White - The song's most infamous single is exciting and expresses strongly the desire for race equality.  This unedited version includes an introduction similar to that of the Black Or White video with Macaulay Culkin.  With guitar solos provided by the infamous Slash the song is incredible.Give In To Me - What I believe to be Michael Jackson's most underrated song this Rock & Roll piece (Once more featuring guitarist Slash) worth looking into by not just fans of Michael Jackson or pop, but people who enjoy real Rock music.  For me, this song proved that Michael Jackson could succeed in whichever genre he wished to perform- in fact, this song makes me hope that we'll see rock songs in his unreleased archive.Will You Be There - A sweet, moving song that is a must have.Gone Too Soon - A loving tribute to those who had to leave this Earth that if it doesn't hit any emotions I'd have to say you've never lost someone.It was truly fitting for it to have been sung at the late King's funeral.Dangerous - Now the song is good but not as good as many of the others.  Also, having grown up on his stage performance version of the song I'd have to say I prefer the lyric arrangements in the stage-performance version over the actual song.  Still, a good piece nonetheless.Going to some of the critical complaints of Dangerous and later Invincible were the length of these albums.  A ridiculous thing, because when I spend my money on a CD I'm happy to know that Jackson always made sure you got plenty of bang for your buck.  Dangerous contains fourteen tracks, and sure, the arrangement and transition between pieces may be a tad off, but at the same time -considering Jackson so rarely released albums- I'm relieved that he always made sure to respect the buyer by making sure their dollar would buy more than most other CDs which average 8-12 tracks.Dangerous is not as diverse an album as some of his other works (Thriller, Bad, Invincible), but it defiantly contains the King's spark of creativity in every second of its running time.Also: Make sure to check out Michael Jackson's DVD concert 'Michael Jackson - Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour'.  It will blow you away!"
1,"""Pet Sounds"" seems to be compared a lot on this website to ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"", which might be okay since The Beatles were so impressed with The Beach Boys new (at that time) album, but at the same time the comparasion is ridiculous. Both are legendary albums in different ways, and ""Pet Sounds"" for a moment in time made the Beach Boys the greatest rock and roll band in the whole world, even bigger than there friendly competitors The Beatles (who came right back and took the title away from them with ""Revolver"").First off, ""Pet Sounds"" is a far, far departure from the Beach Boys that most people know and love. These songs aren't about fun in the sun, girls, and surfing. Instead, it is a deep examination of the thoughts and dreams of a young boy, and how they change as he grows older and his problems and worries become bigger issues for him to deal with. Many people know that Brian Wilson, the leader of the band and the creator of this album, had many mental problems, and also had various drug addictions at this time as well, so he had a thousand ideas that he was thinking about. Also, Brian was an obsessed perfectionist, he wanted to create an album that was greater than anything that had come out before. He spent hours upon hours in the studio, creating layers upon layers of sound and vocals, using any instrument available (even soda cans!) He created a sound that was more lush and beautiful than anything ever before, creating almost a ""dream"" sound of reflection of a boy becoming a man who for his whole life was yearning for the love and affection that he felt was missing.""Pet Sounds"" is Brian Wilson's baby, and many even argue that this was his solo debut as a back up band was used on many of the songs instead of his fellow band mates. However, the harmonies and vocals are what make this so pleasing, and only his band mates could help in that. The songs themself are pretty excellent. ""Wouldn't it be nice"", ""Sloop John B."", and ""God Only Knows"" are the well known songs, and the only ones that you are able to listen to as singles. The other songs you have to listen to along with the album as they paint the whole picture that way. The album is about one man's search for love from boyhood to manhood, and the pain and hurt he goes through in his search for it. If Wilson's lyrics don't make you reflect yourself or even make you feel the pain, then listen again. And again. And see how the album will move you in ways your never felt possible.Such a complex and challenging album to listen to that is essential to every rock and roll fans collection. While this album might have started the break down of Brian Wilson, and while the rest of the band mates didn't necessarily agree with the direction the music was heading in (more songs influenced by drugs and mental illness, which the band wasn't dead set on singing the lyrics to), for one moment this album made them kings. Brian was working on his next project, ""Smile"", when The Beatles released ""Sgt. Peppers."" After listening to it, Wilson put up his white flag of surrender, the others went back to the simple days of surf rock, and the Beach Boys never reached the level of creativeness and uniqueness as they did with ""Pet Sounds."""
1,"The songs on this album are really soft and lovely, but the most memorable songs on here are the title track and ""I Am a Rock."" It's not that the rest of the tracks are bad songs, just not as memorable, critically-acclaimed, or polished as the material on an album like PSR&T is. The two hits are padded out with nine filler songs; the most enjoyable of them are ""Kathy's Song,"" ""April Come She Will"" (a gorgeous song based on a childrens' nursery rhyme), ""Leaves That Are Green,"" ""Blessed"" (based on some Biblical verses), and the two suicide songs, ""Richard Cory"" and ""A Most Peculiar Man,"" which are placed back to back (on purpose?). ""Somewhere They Can't Find Me"" is a faster version and lyrical reworking of the earlier slow song ""Wednesday Morning, 3 AM,"" and ""Anji"" is an interesting instrumental which was written by Davy Graham. ""We've Got a Groovy Thing Goin'"" is upbeat enough, but the mere title really dates the song; who says ""groovy"" anymore? Overall they're all good songs, but taken in comparison to their later albums just not as memorable or mature."
1,"Here Joni's creative embers are glowing brightly again. Her languid voice is accorded poetic justice by the sparse backing on themes eternal - religious symbolism surfaces in Passion Play and Slouching Towards Bethlehem (an adaptation of a Yeats poem). The topic of growing old, gracefully treated in Nothing Can Be Done and Come In From The Cold, is brilliantly balanced by the teenage romance of Ray's Dad's Cadillac, in which Joni puts one over Rickie Lee Jones, one of her imitators. Savour these lines: ""Ray's dad teaches maths/I'm a dunce, a decimal in his class/When it comes to mathematics/I get static in the attic."" Well, this is music - not maths - and Joni gets four out of five for composition and performance."
1,"The Best of Kansas offers most of their best songs, but you know, there's NEVER been a case where I was completely satisfied with a compilation disc.  It's because once you explore an artist more, you realize their Best of or Greatest Hit collection can't possibly capture their best moments.  And since ""the best songs"" and ""their biggest hits"" are two separate things, this CAN'T be the Best of Kansas.  It's missing a few highly memorable progressive rock tunes, especially some of their songs from the first two albums.  As someone who's a fan, I don't like that very much.  But then again, as a fan, I don't need this album.  I recommend you pick up the first two albums to hear what Kansas was like in the early days and then pick up one of their later albums to see where they ended up."
1,"Most young today people associate The Beach Boys music with surfing,cars,chicks and fun,fun,fun.Thus when the songs,Wouldn't It Be Nice,Sloop John B,and God Only Knows are recycled for the umpteenth time on  a compilation album,it's easy to overlook the wonderful production,as well  as the depth of its parent album Pet Sounds.Since it set the standard for  albums for the last 34 years,most seemed lost on its impact.But when you  truly listen and get inside these songs that you really experience the  beauty of this album.The aforementioned themes are replaced with songs of  introspection and more adult themes.Brian Wilson's need to compete with The  Beatles turned into burning creativity as he recorded Pet Sounds with  meticulous attention to detail.Using some of Phil Spector's Wrecking Crew  as well as the famed Wall Of Sound technique,the albums complexity was  nothing short of amazing.Songs like That's Not Me,Here Today and Caroline  No display both beauty and sadness in their own unique way.Wouldn't It Be  Nice, God Only Knows,and Waiting for the Day are rays of light that seems  on the brink of turning into dashed dreams.The Beach Boys harmonies are  flawless though since Brian sings most of the leads,you'd almost think  they're guest stars on their own album.Even for all its accolades,Pet  Sounds was deemed a failure back in '66(due to the general publics as well  as Capitol Records inability to understand and embrace the record)But over  the years it has left the other Beach Boys albums in the dust,as well as  accorded its own boxed set.In '66 it seemed way ahead of its time,nowadays  it just exist outside of time."
1,"I waited a long time for this. I've been a fan of this album forever, and unlike some of my other 'faves', this one still gets plenty of rotation. It did however, need remastering as the original issue CD is a tad sterile sounding with regards to fidelity. Nonetheless...This album is nothingly less than one of the Top10 all-time greatest pop/rock albums. There isn't a dull moment on the entire thing, and even the extras on this reissued version shine. The bonus track Surrender could have easily been a top40 hit. And considering that this album contains the band's best music from a compositional standpoint, it makes sense that they included instrumental rough mixes of classics like So Fine, Tightrope and Telephone Line, which nearly act as stand alone pieces. And there's an alternate vocal take of Telephone Line, which may give you pause deciding which version you like better.Many people have purchased ELO's Greatest Hits and called it good, but a few of the tunes on New World Record never made it to the first Greatest Hits album and IMO, these songs are essential - tunes like So Fine, Do Ya, and Tightrope represent some of ELO's finest work. The title track is a minor pop-prog masterpiece and Shangri-la is a great way to end an album, with its blatant homage to The Beatles' Hey Jude.Maybe some of the newer comps have remedied a few of these songs' lack of inclusion elsewhere but now that this album has been remastered (quite well actually) its a no-brainer...I can't recommend this album highly enough."
1,"This was PE's debut back in 1987 which was a good year for hip hop and with Chuck D, Flavor Flav, and terminator X known as Public Enemy it was even better.it starts with ""Your gonna get yours"" which is a strong track as is 'Sophisticated B-tch' which has a rock beat to it. The standout tracks are 'Public Enemy No 1' 'Raise the Roof' 'My Uzi weighs a ton' and 'MPE' which are all tight songs.There is no wack tracks on here so you won't be dissapointed when you buy it, cause it is a dope album for any PE or hip hop fan."
1,"This album was released during an era where slow jams were in and giving up-tempo R&B flavor a try was also in. Like many of their counterparts during that time, the pretty ladies of Changing Faces needed to realize their strength in ballads and avoided trying any up-tempo material. However, there are a couple of good tunes on this album, particularly the slow jam, ""All Is Not Gone"", where sorrow and regret serves as a theme for a song that was definitely written with the intent of winning over ones with heartbreaks in their history. R. Kelly-produced hit ""Stroke You Up"" was a radio smash, but the lyrics weren't exactly poetic or articulate. But, it's still a popular track that may bring back some old school nostalgia for some of you."
1,"It's debatable as to which album is better among ""Off The Wall,"" ""Bad,"" and ""Dangerous"" (I skipped Thriller because it's too famous). Lyrically speaking, in my view, I would crown ""Dangerous"" as having the best lyrics since it has more tracks and they're original (from the man himself). However, it being his first major album, I really love ""Off The Wall."" The rhythm on this album in general is abundantly brilliant. From track 1 to track 10, none of the songs are dissatisfying. You have a song about heartbreak ""She's Out Of My Life,"" a song about encouraging a sexy person to dance with you ""Get On The Floor,"" and a song contemplating on stealing away a taken person ""Girlfriend."" Others have magnificent beats that will keep you moving. I don't think that it's worth sitting in your car or on a train listening to this unless you could really control your motions because this is an action-packed album and it's meant for dancers. ""Working Day and Night"" is energetic. ""Rock With You"" is smooth and seductive. ""I Can't Help It"" is awesomely full of love. ""It's The Falling in Love"" is a captivating duet. ""Off the Wall"" is a club song. The last song is dynamic. Buy ""Off The Wall"" from Michael Jackson."
1,"""Sunshine Superman"" was Donovan's first ""Electric"" album, first released in late 1966. Although producer's Micky Most has been givin much credit for creating Donovan's ""new progressive"" sound, there had actually been signs on his previous album ""Fairytale"", that he would be exploring new styles and sounds on forthcoming records. The great song and slightly jazzy ""Sunny Goodge Street"" would have fitted nicely into the concept of both ""Sunshine Superman"" and the follow-up album ""Mellow Yellow""When the album was released ""Sunshine Superman"" had already been a huge hit on the singles charts on both sides of the Atlantic; with its great bass intro hook.On many tracks though, Donovan's folk background still shines through. Some songs are still very folkish, featuring only Donovan and his acoustic guitar, but with additional classical instruments like woodwinds, violins and harpsichord.Other songs are highly inspired by Indian music featuring both tabla and sitar.Among those the beautiful ""Guinevere"" and ""Fat Angel"" are clear favourites.On ""Bert's Blues"" Donovan combines elements from both jazz and and classical music, creating an almost avantgardish new fusion.Quite outstanding is the classic ""Season of the Witch"", which has been covered by various other artists; Donovan at his heaviest!The majestic ""Celeste"", which closed the original album is another highlight.The 7 bonus-tracks are all fine. Some are outtakes, others are early versions of  songs that would later appear on ""Mellow Yellow"" and ""Barabajal"".The booklet is a great read featuring biography and detalied information about each track and Donovan's collaboration with Micky Most.Though most of the strongest tracks can be found on various compilations; and though a few songs may sound a bit out-dated, the album as a whole still appear as an essential document of how music changed in the middle 1960's, and that Donovan was more than just a softer British echo of what Bob Dylan was doing in America.Recommended!"
1,"Contrary to my friend from England , I really liked this release from 1985.  Having seen the group when they headlined Tina Turner's world tour, I was impressed by its vocals and musicianship.The hit single &quot;Something About You&quot; and the title cut were the reasons for my initial purchase; however, the remaining tracks are earworthy memories of the &quot;fun&quot; 80's."
0,"It probably seemed like a good idea in retrospect. Elvis wanted to go to Nashville and meet with an icon of a country classic producer, then cut an album of some of his favorites right there in music city. And after cutting some of excellent singles in a country format (""Radio Sweetheart"" being one), ""Almost Blue"" really could have been a great record.Instead, it was Elvis' first big misstep of his stellar career. He failed to understand the hack mentality of the Nashville scene, and ""Almost Blue"" is the sound of a 9 to 5 producer (Billy Sherrill) trying to shoehorn a band of randy brits into a paint by numbers sound. While the album kicks off like it should (""Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used To?""), the ensuing album finds the band in a straightjacket. The sole exceptions, naturally, were the ballads. (""Good Year for The Roses,"" ""Brown to Blue"" and ""How Much I Lied."") The rest of ""Almost Blue"" then struggles to get out from under the limitations. It left Elvis and the Attractions, who had spent those first three albums exposing themselves as a volatile, high energy creative force, suddenly blanded into cookie cutter recordings robbed of an album worth hearing more than as a vanity project."
1,"...Stryper bowed out shortly after the release of this album, their record label (Enigma) having gone bankrupt. .. Ouch.  It's too bad because this is their most developed release, their most mature effort, and their most controversial album.The band itself can explain the controversy far better than I can, but I encourage you to read the book LOUD 'N' CLEAR by Dale Erickson and Jesse Sturdevant.  It sheds a lot of light on the subject.  Lyrics were behind the problem as the bands distributors (BENSEN) no longer felt that the band was pushing the Christian viewpoint(s).  This is clearly untrue from much of the lyrical content on the album-even within the title track itself.  Clearly, this album caught Stryper at a tough time when they were struggling with their identity as a 'Christian Metal Band'.  No other band has probably been as pigeon-holed as this one.  But for all the controversy, the music remains quite good here.  There are a few lapses into the tired 80's metal cliches, but the album also contains some great tunes like ""Two Bodies"", ""All For One"", ""Lady"", and ""Ordinary Man"".  I can do without ""Two-Time Woman"" and ""Rock The People"", but I have no MAJOR complaints outside of those.  And I have NO complaints with the sound.  AGAINST THE LAW is by far the bands best sounding album.  Major producer Tom Werman handled the board duties expertly and we end up with the fattest mix of any Stryper release-it's nice to hear the bass and drums even more up-front.  Robert's kit sounds GREAT.  The guitars are THICK.  The band even LOOKS tougher in the insert photos!  By the way, the band did not have a say in the cover concept-they hated it.  And here for some reason the colors look washed-out.  Perhaps the picture is of a [inexpensive] re-release of the disc?"
1,"The Best That I Could Do culls John Mellencamp's singles from a ten year span that make up his golden age.  Taking songs from His self-titled album through The Lonesome Jubilee, we hear his progression from leather clad rocker to Midwestern bard.  There's not a clunker in the bunch with songs like &quot;Cherry Bomb&quot; (his best single), &quot;Crumblin' Down&quot;, &quot;Jack &amp; Diane&quot; &amp; &quot;R.O.C.K. In The U.S.A.&quot; particularly standing out.  In fact they among the best singles of the 80's.  The album contains one new song &quot;Without Expression&quot; and although it isn't up to the hits, it's still a good song.  If you like, straight ahead, honest rock music, then this greatest hits collection should be in your collection."
1,"I'VE BEEN A PROUD JUGGALO EVER SINCE I DISCOVERED THEM THROUGH THEIR ''ANOTHER LOVE SONG'' VIDEO BACK IN 1999. BUT, THIS ALBUM, WHICH WAS REALLY THEIR 2ND CD [THE RARE ''DOG BEATS'' EP WAS REALLY THEIR FIRST EVER CD] AND THE 1ST JOKER'S CARD, IS SOMETIMES MEDIOCRE. SOME OF THESE SONGS, SUCH AS ''WIZARD OF THE HOOD'', ''RED NECK HOE'' AND ''PSYCHOPATHIC'' REALLY SUFFER FROM WACK BEATS. HONESTLY, ''WIZARD OF THE HOOD'' COULD'VE BEEN THE BEST SONG ON THIS ENTIRE CD IF IT JUST HAD A BETTER BEAT. AS ALWAYS, THE RHYMES THAT SHAGGY 2 DOPE AND VIOLENT J KICK ARE NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. BUT, THAT DOESN'T STOP THEM FROM BEING GOOD ENTERTAINERS. THE BEST SONG ON THE WHOLE CD IS ''TASTE'', WHICH FEATURES ESHAM, JUMP STEADY, AND NATE THE MACK. KID ROCK EVEN MAKES AN APPEARANCE ON ''IS THAT YOU?''. MOST FANS OF ICP SHOULD LIKE THIS CD. BUT, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE TYPE OF STUFF THAT'S ON CDS LIKE ''THE GREAT MILENKO'' OR ''RIDDLEBOX'', YOU MIGHT WANNA DOWNLOAD THIS CD INSTEAD OF BUYING IT. FOLLOWED BY THE BEVERLY KILLZ 50187 EP AND THE 2ND JOKER'S CARD ENTITLED ''RINGMASTER''."
1,"As everyone knows, Tupac owned the rap game when he was still here.  Tupac switched his name to Makaveli, and his first album is The Don Killuminati:The 7 Day Theory.  This is a great album that mixes the slow ballads and hardcore raps that made Tupac the best.  Buy this album if you are a fan of rap."
1,"I bought this because of Muriel's wedding and I loved this record ever since. The movie was great and so is  ABBA's music: Dancing Queen,Waterloo,Money,Money,Money,Take a chance on me,Mama Mia and many others. Just in case you buy it at least start at those tracks first."
1,"There is no doubt in my mind that this is the all-time greatest album ever made! Mike broke the mold with this one. Every track on here is perfect, with a totally different style on each one. BABY BE MINE and THE LADY IN MY LIFE weren't released as singles (like the remaining seven), yet they are equally just as fine and masterful. If we could pick one person in this world with sheer musical talent, it would be Mike."
1,Parliament-Funkadelic is the ultimate master of Funk music. Any of the group's music is great. This is just my most recent addition to my CD collection. If you like Funk you'll love Parliament-Funkadelic.
1,"Now I was born to hate this album. Bloody Adam Dale, ginga ringer from Welwyn Garden City-pint size king of cool loved this tosh. He'd play it to me and I'd wrinkle my nose at the pea soup of well, dirge and sonic noise. Ok, so that was somewhere in 1971. Wind on to the 1990s and I pick up a CD of this because I was having some fond memory recesses about my old friend Adam and well just had to see what all the fuss he'd made then was about. So to speak. Well, absolutely bloody amazing what time marching on does to the ears and aural parts of the trained brain. Yeah, in the interim I'd found a liking for jazz and groan Coltrane so Soft Machine of this vintage was child's play. And Robert Wyatt had made an appearance or three in my collection. But this is just brill! From the intransigense of ""Facelift"" to the nasal thrumming of ""Moon in June"" it is out-bloody rageous. Yeah. Stupendous. What do you mean you haven't got it in your collection? You should have heard it through tin speakers and a turntable held together with string."
1,George Clinton&amp;Crew reach a whole different Level on this Must have.this Disc from start to finish is Smoking nothing but The Funk.The Vibe is so Strong thru out.you can't fake The Funk.all The Trademark sounds  are here.The Grooves Never Let up.
1,"This cd was pretty good when it came out. The only hit, that I can remember, was the joint with R. Kelly talking about can I stroke you up. Anyway, it's ok I would not suggest purchasing it though. Download the song on Itunes and save your money. NEOSOUL06."
1,I enjoyed his albums and box sets. this one is a great one to get if you like his live show.
1,"MADMAN ACROSS THE WATER was Elton John's second great album, following the Old West tales of the concept release TUMBLEWEED CONNECTION. The best song here is the title track, which sounds like a psychotic person speaking incoherent babble from the confines of a mental institution. Perhaps it shows better than any alterna-rock song what the price of excessive self-indulgence is, and I take it as a warning not to use an alcoholic beverage to toast my grandfather on his 95th birthday. This CD, along with TUMBLEWEED CONNECTION, HONKY CHATEAU, GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD, ROCK OF THE WESTIES, and CARIBOU, is one of Elton John's must-own individual CDs."
1,"THIS RECORD WAS SO SLEPT ON WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE HIT &quot;STROKE YOU UP&quot; FEAT/R.KELLY.THE ONLY REASON I COULD THINK OF IS THE FLOODED R&amp;B MARKET,BECAUSE FIRST OFF THEY CAN SING,THERE ATTRACTIVE,AND THE  MUSICAL CONTENT AND SONG IDEAS R STRONG.THIS CAME OUT IN 94 AND I CAN SAY  NOTHING BETTER HAS CAME OUT SINCE NOT EVEN CHANGIN FACES 2ND ALBUM.THATS  WHY 6 YEARS LATER THIS STILL GETS MUCH PLAY.THERE ISNT A SONG ON HERE I  DONT LIKE EVERYTHING ON HERE IS TIGHT.THE ONLY RECORDS THAT CAN EVEN  COMPETE WITH THIS IS MICHEL'E &quot;MICHEL'E&quot;, KEITH SWEAT &quot;MAKE  IT LAST FOREVER&quot;, GUY &quot;THE FUTURE&quot;, AND MARY J BLIGE  &quot;WHAT'S THE 411? THIS RECORD SHOULD GET A TEN BUT AMAZON WILL ONLY LET  ME GIVE 5.I HAVE REVIEWED A LOT OF RECORDS AND FEW HAVE GOTTEN 5'S BUT THIS  THIS IS A 5.SO IF YOU HAV'NT HEARD THIS GET IT IF YOU HAD IT AND LOST IT  FIND IT OR BUY A NEW ONE LIKE I HAVE 3 TIMES....."
1,"In my opinion, &quot;Elton John&quot; was the best album in 1970.Elton and his band make a best work in songs like&quot;Your Song&quot;, &quot;Border Song&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll Madonna(in the remastered edition)&quot;.The strings of &quot;The Greatest Discovery&quot; was wonderful, &quot;Your Song&quot;, was a massive hit when the album was released.The album makes the Billboard Top 10.This Elton first America album(second in UK) was great."
1,"OK, I've finally gotten around to reviewing one of the most popular albums of all-time.  I've had this for a while but... Definitely Carole King's masterpiece, the thoughtful, comforting, inspiring, and richly-woven Tapestry shows not only her songwriting powers at their best, but proves she was able to turn out inspiring tunes for herself instead of sundry others as she did in the 1960's.  She even does a few of those songs here as well.  And behold the result.  Tapestry yielded no less than four Grammy Awards for 1971:  Album of the Year, Record of the Year for ""It's Too Late"", Song of the Year for ""You've Got A Friend"", and Pop Female Vocal.  But I see in Tapestry, with its jamming piano and rolling rhythm a template for the sound of the 70's that influenced countless others, such as the Eagles, James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt, and Karla Bonoff.That familiar jamming keyboard starting off ""I Feel The Earth Move"" whose catchy rhythm will make one feel ""as mellow as the month of May"" if it catches one in the right frame of mind, of course.  It maintains an upbeat jamming until the song's end, when the tempo gradually winds down.  Martika and more recently Mandy Moore are at least two artists who have covered this song.""So Far Away"" is a slow, thoughtful, introspective song, well, ""one more song about the highway"" asking ""doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?""  Carole is on piano, and her friend James Taylor on guitar.Then comes the Grammy-winner ""It's Too Late"" which is basically about how two people tried, but ""something inside has died,"" and all from being ""light and breezy"" down to ""look[ing] so unhappy.""  The key here is that something inside happened to one of the party, ""or maybe we've just both stopped trying.""  Gloria Estefan covered this on her cover songs album, Hold Me Thrill Me.One of my favourites here is ""Home Again,"" about wanting to return home and having someone to talk to after being on the road.  If Carole King was my psychiatrist, she'd give me an F for not following the mindset adopted in ""Beautiful.""  She's clearly wondered why people are always sad but she believes that one is as beautiful as one feels.  In that case, I'm ugly down to the bone at times.  However, she comes up with an answer:  ""maybe love can end the madness/maybe not, oh, but we can only try.""  I'm still skeptical at her belief that a smile will get people to treat you better.""Way Over Yonder"" is a search for a true utopia without troubles, a place of ""the sweet tasting good life.""  The sun shining down is nice, with the rivers of honey having some biblical connotations.  ""A garden of wisdom from long ago dream"", huh?  When's the next train?The universally ever-inspiring ""You've Got A Friend"" would definitely have a place in my top 100 songs.  This came out the same year as James Taylor's version.  Apart from Carole's piano and Taylor's guitar, there's  an accompanying string quartet.  Ofra Haza did a cover of this on her last album but it didn't top this rendition.  The words of the chorus are immortal, but my mind latches on to this particular verse:  ""Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend/when people can be so cold/they'll hurt you and desert you/and take your soul if you let them/oh, but don't you let them.""""Where you lead I will follow"" goes the chorus on ""Where You Lead"" on this nice number on emotional fealty.  Simple but comforting lyrics.The oft-covered ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"", originally done by the Shirelles, is done in a mellowed piano ballad, again with help on guitar by James Taylor, without the polish and extra sugar of the original.The most uptempo song here is ""Smackwater Jack"" of someone who loses his head and shoots down the people in a church, only to be captured by a posse, but is hung instead of being brought to trial.  While I note her belief in law and order and the injustice of justice without trial, I wonder if King embodies more traditional values.  What would today's society think of ""You can't talk to a man with a shotgun in his hand?""  And if one thinks about it, isn't that the mentality which the US had in Iraq last March?  The live version, one of two bonus tracks for the remaster, isn't bad.It's only Carole here on piano with the title track, where she uses a tapestry as a metaphor for her life and that of a man of fortune whose ups and downs she sees in that tapestry.  There's a degree of sadness when the tapestry unravels, just as the song starts to end.  She does her own take of ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman"", making it less brassy than Aretha Franklin's rendition.With a sound that matches the rest of Tapestry, the bonus song ""Out In The Cold"" is a nice afterthought which doesn't spoil an album that's one of the most popular of all time."
1,"Late 1997, Spice 1 delivers us with his 5th album, and his 5th classic in a row.  Intact is his awesome wordplay and thuggish ruggish maniacal flow over great beats.  This album rates high in his discog.  Producers include Ant Banks, Paris, Clint ""Payback"" Sands, Hen Gee, Ali Malek, Rick Rock, Mike Mosley, and Femi Ojetunde, and the beats are a mix of syrupy and melodic G-Funk and mobb music.  Lyrically, he has a neat array of thug joints and a few deeper songs.  ""The Thug In Me"" is a nice dedication to late homie, 2Pac (RIP)over a melodic sample and whiny synth.  Spice fires the cheeba on ""I'm High"" over a heavier, more mobbish beat.  Spice 1 calls up WC and Big Syke from LA to kick some game about cali, the bay to LA anthem, 510, 213, named after major bay and LA area codes.  Spice 1 flosses a little, but still keeps it hard on ""Diamonds."" The beat is different, bass heavy, but softer on the foreground beat with a faint whiny synth.  ""The Boss Mobsta"" reminds me of 1995's ""Mind Of A Sick N---a,"" partly because the beat pattern is similar, a Whodini ""Friends"" Sample, and the lyrics and Spice's flow are crazy like in the 1995 joint. Ant Banks' beats on the banger street joints ""Recognize Game"" (f/ Too Short, Ice-T), and ""Fetty Chico And The Mack"" (f/Mack 10) are among the best on the album.  ""Down Payment On Heaven"" is awesome lyrically and musically too!  The beat has neat soulful samples to give it a laidback, melodic, and deep feel.  Spice 1 contemplates on life, death, and the things he has done, does, and may do.  The drama in the hood and senseless killings that take place there are emphasized in a intellectual fashion.  ""2 Hands And A Razorblade"" is another maniacal Spice 1 joint about life in the county jails of Cali.  The beat has a whiny riff reminiscent of Snoop Dogg's Murder Was The Case, but the beat is some slick G-Funk that is subtle but with hardcore overtures.  There is so much to like about this album.  Spice 1 ruled the 1990's, and this classic is a testament to that."
1,"The great Roy Orbison was on the brink of a MAJOR comeback when he was taken from us, much too early.  God decided he wanted the angel in black by his side.  Released posthumously, the ""Mystery Girl"" album lived up to the promise that this great artist would show us much more.  The CD opens with the hit ""You Got It"", which was a breath of fresh air on the airwaves at the time.  The lyrics to the next track, ""In the Real World"", turned out to be so prophetic, if this song doesn't move you, you're made of stone.  ""(All I Can Do Is) Dream You"" is a slice of rockabilly harkening back to Roy's mid-50s roots, punchy and raucous.  ""A Love So Beautiful"" tells of a love gone wrong, one of the subjects Roy sang of with authority.  ""California Blue"" is an ode to the home he was spending an increasing amount of time away from, the song soaring and satisfying.  The ""title"" track, ""She's a Mystery to Me"", tells of a love not quite as sunny as one might want, but nonetheless accepts on its own terms.  ""The Comedians"" is so close in form and subject to ""Running Scared"", but ends differently than that classic, in performance just as satisfying.  Of the last three songs, only ""Windsurfer"" stands as a ""throwaway"", but to my ears, it still satisfies with Roy's soaring vocals (how to describe his voice without using the word soaring??)and some sprightly guitar.  ""The Only One"" tells of a breakup, and Roy was the expert on breakup songs, but on this one, he is looking on, and comes across with some sage observations.  The CD ends with ""Careless Heart"", this time Roy is on the receiving end of a heartache, and of course, delivers hindsight as to why.  There was one more CD cobbled together after this, ""King of Hearts"", but it is only a collection of songs finished in the wake of his untimely death.  ""Mystery Girl"", though only 37 minutes, is one of the most satisfying albums ever made by ANYONE, and certainly hints that Roy had a lot more in him, had he lived.  If you can get it on the cheap, more's better, but if you loved Roy, this is a stellar example of his craft, easily sitting in the company of his classic Monument albums of the 60s.Addendum:  Lately, this album is offered for download with an additional track, ""You May Feel Me Crying"".  This is no ""from the archives"", previously unreleased track, but is included in the wonderful boxed set ""The Soul of Rock and Roll""."
1,"PET SOUNDS.....hauntingly beautiful,stunningly majestic,fantastically..oh look wait a minute!!lets cut to the chase!!REPEAT AFTER ME.I MUST OWN THIS ALBUM,I MUST OWN THIS ALBUM....or sadly yes youve guessed it it means booking an appointment in the funny farm.Youve probably got SGT PEPPER right?well this came before and it was instrumental in THE BEATLES recording said masterpiece.BRIAN WILSON never really came near to this quantum leap project again bits of SURFS UP are ok HOLLAND has a few gems but this is the ONE.So.....REPEAT AFTER ME I MUST OWN .................."
1,"Still in a period of transition, Cockburn's music and lyrics were moving from the contemplative to an engaged Christianity. ""How I Spent My Fall Vacation"" foretells the observational analyses of US politics that would reach an extraordinarily angered pitch with STEALING FIRE. Here, though, Cockburn is just beginning to assess the political fallout from the overeaching by developed nations upon the world's poor.Musically, Bruce continues on the trajectory of incorporating more world influences beyond European, Celtic, that was certainly present on DANCING. While this is not quite as strong as DANCING, it is nonetheless full of terrific songs: the aforementioned ""How..."", ""Tokyo"", ""Fascist Architecture."" Bruce had also by this time assembled a crack band: Hugh Marsh on violin, Dennis Pendrith on bass, Bob Di Salle (who, with Pendrith, came from Murray McLaughlin's remarkable Golden Tractors band)on drums, Kathryn Moses on vocals and reeds, Jon Goldsmith on keyboards. Live, they were formidable! They gave Bruce that push to examine new textures and to take more chances with his own guitarcraft. There is a lot of greta and subtle displays on this disc. The bonus track is a great out-take from the trio tour with Ferguson Jemeson Marsh on Chapman Stick, and Michael Sloski from the Ontario Place concert that was the source material for his live CD of 1989. Perhaps, Rounder will convince True North, Bernie Finkelstein and Cockburn to release a DVD of that show. It was incredible - perhaps the best show I've ever seen in Toronto. In any case, another triumph for the remastering team!"
1,This was my first purchasing time Wham cd and I enjoyed it if I would have bought it when I was young It would have made my day. You should buy this if you are a wham fan and add it to your collection it is a great cd.
1,"I give it 5 because it brings back great memories and because it rocks from start to finish.This release was hard pressed to follow the massive success of the Budokan release. However it held it's own and made Cheap Trick a house hold name for years to come.This remaster has one big advantage over the original release in that the sound as one reveiwer said, jumps out of your speakers. It really brings this classic to life. The entire mix is louder and the bass is firmer and more supportive.The extra's are alright, but nothing fantastic!It's a great listen, pick it up!"
1,"Along with Steamin, Workin, and Cookin, &quot;Relaxin&quot; offers an up close and personal look at Miles' group ca. 1955, in their transition phase between Prestige and Columbia records.From the opening chimes of &quot;If I were A Bell,&quot; Miles dominates the proceedings as only he can- his tone, sense of time, style, and the use of his famous Harmon Mute never better. He was definitely a man on a mission, and his leadership on his trumpet is simply astounding.The band also cooks on saxophonist Sonny Rollins' staple &quot;Oleo&quot; (as in oleo margarine, for the kids out there..a simple form of clarified margarine), with Chambers' fast walking bass complimenting Philly Joe Jones' incomperable drumming, complete with his famous &quot;Philly Licks&quot; (playing rim shots versus the snare to keep the beat going).&quot;I Could Write a Book&quot; is highlighted by great interplay between Miles, drummer Jones, and bassist Paul Chambers.The rest of the lp comprises slower, more laid back numbers, right for, well..relaxin, I suppose.A wonderful lp of great material, &quot;Relaxin,&quot; like the other 3 lps of the series, showcase Miles and the group enjoying themselves greatly. The results show as much."
1,"Declan Patrick McManus (as he was known to his parents) is a genius.  This album, released in 1978, was his second album, and his first with his backing band The Attractions.  What a mighty fine album it was back then.  And what a mighty fine album it is today.Being a huge Elvis fan (I'll confess, I've even bought a pair of prescription glasses which are Elvis-esque), choosing my favourite Elvis album is like trying to choose a favourite child.  I know this is a typical album review cliche, but it's a serious dilemma, simply for the fact that he has released so many brilliant albums.  Imperial bedroom, Trust, King of America, all superb albums in their own right.I see This Year's Model as Elvis' real debut album.  His debut &quot;My aim is true&quot; had its fair share of superb moments (Red shoes, Alison, I'm not angry) but I always felt it was a practice for what he achieved here.  Even though this is Elvis' heaviest and most punk-influenced album, his music doesn't fit into the category of traditional punk.  For a start, Elvis can sing.  His lyrics are highly original and out of this world.  He has a vision.  He knows what he wants to say and he says it.Did I mention how good it all sounds?  &quot;The beat&quot; is one of Elvis' most infectious pop-punk offerings.  &quot;Living in paradise&quot; starts with one of his best guitar riffs and only goes up from there.  &quot;Lip service&quot; is foot-tapping heaven.  &quot;This year's girl&quot; has one of Elvis' best sentiments in a perfect 3 minute pop song.  And I haven't even mentioned the brilliantly executed singles &quot;Pump it up&quot;, &quot;(I don't want to go to) Chelsea&quot; and the superb stand-alone single &quot;Radio, radio&quot; which has been added as a bonus track on the re-issue of this CD.Who needs Elvis impersonators?  The real Elvis is alive on this album, and he has never sounded better."
1,"This is still a good CD, but not one of my favourites, his music from the Bad album was better, but there are a few good songs on this album, like black and white."
1,"This album never turned Rick Derringer into a superstar but it should have!The songs on this album MAKE you want to catch a Rick Derringer concert.All the firepower of a Derringer concert is captured on this studio CD.It starts off with Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo which has become such a classic it has been played on the radio more than 1 million times!Two insturmentals are on this album;Joy Ride and Time Warp.Neither of them diappoints.Rick has always had a special knack for writing these kinds of songs.Another charted song Teenage Love Affair is here as well and years later it still sounds invigorating and fresh.The thoughtfulness of Hold,the class of Jump Jump Jump,the atmosphere of It's Raining...it's all here folks.A person could go on describing this album forever and a day.It is one of those albums which captures exactly the musical vibe that was going on in the 70's.Gemstone after gemstone with a special mention going to Slide On Over Slinky which can only be described as a mature version of Hang On Sloopy.If you want to know what Rock and Roll is all about buy this album!!!!!!!!"
1,"While ""Bookends"" had many great tracks, this album for me is the better one in that it is much more coherent and flows better from track to track and has the bigger hits.  The title track is simply one of the best songs ever written while ""The Boxer"" is very good as well.  No fillers on this great album except for the live version of ""Bye Bye Love"" which I really wish was left out but in keeping with the larger theme of giving hints as to the duo's imminent breakup, I guess they had to have that track somewhere on the album.  ""So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright"" is so obvious a message to Art Garfunkel, an architecture student, that Paul Simon wanted out that it's just a priceless track on this album and is one of my favourites.There are two bonus tracks here which are actually very good and unlike in most albums where the bonus tracks either do little or even take away from the overall enjoyment of the disc, this is not the case here as we get a very nice track: ""Feuilles-O"" in French and a very good demo version of ""Bridge Over Troubled Water."" The remastering job is quite good too resulting in a good sound quality recording as well.Now this version of the album comes in a mini-lp sleeve replica with thin and not so good quality cardboard which is strange given the quality of the ""Bookends"" version is far superior and you would think it a simple matter to do at least the same with this album.  It also includes a 20-page booklet printed on glossy paper with all the lyrics and a 10-page booklet with all the lyrics in Japanese as well. As far as mlps designs go, this one isn't all that great but I've seen even worse. Okay packaging, good sound quality makes this good value as well.Highly recommended for Simon & Garfunkel fans and definitely worth the ""upgrade""!"
1,"Billy Ocean fused R&amp;B/soul with pop/rock and ended up with an excellent album. &quot;Carribean Queen&quot; and &quot;Loverboy&quot; are both must-have 80's hits, and this album is the best place to hear them, because the versions here are much longer than the radio edits on his greatest hits CD! But then again, every song on this album is great, and the heartfelt cover of the Beatles' &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot; should win over people who don't normally appreciate 80's music. But if you are a fan of the 80's, you definitely need this album, and if you aren't, get it anyway!"
1,Never did I ever think I'd be listening to a female vocalists that has the sound in her voice I'd been looking for the past 2 decades...20 years too earlythis sounds like today but it was yesterday.One of her best worksevery song is a jewelafter buying it once - I'd buy it againA definite must have!
1,"I like this, but it is not a southernplaya.....  It's hot and a must have if you like the OLDSCHOOL OutKast.  Not this Roses, Prototype bullcrap they got out now."
1,"The musical world was really going through a transition in 1986.  Oh, and so was I, as I just graduated high school, and one of the things that surprised me was that Wham! was breaking up.  I bought their swansong album, Music From The Edge Of Heaven, which seemed more a prelude to George Michael's solo career, as two songs are credited to him rather than Wham!.The catchy title song shows less soul but more straight pop overladen with trumpet, trombone, and sax.  Deon Estus's throbbing bass also contributes heavily.  This song veers towards the lust end of the spectrum rather than the love songs on Make It Big.:  &quot;I'm a maniac at the end of the day&quot; and &quot;There's a place for us in a dirty movie/'Cos no-one does it better than me and you.&quot;  And I can barely hear Elton John's piano here.The frustrated love song &quot;Battlestations&quot; is accusatory, as the girl is accused of hiding behind her answerphone, and the guy even goes as far as opening her diary.  A real relation on the rocks.  And the cold finishing touch has the girl saying in French that money is her new best friend, so goodbye.  Charming story, huh?&quot;I'm Your Man&quot; is presented in an eight minute plus extended version instead of the single-version.  It's a return to the funky soul that characterized Make It Big.  After about 1:22 of synths, drums, and even racing car noises, the single proper begins.  It's got a catchy and fun beat, but there's a great amount of braggadocio and no love involved:  &quot;I don't need you to care/I don't need you to understand/All I want is for you to be there/.../I'm your man.&quot;  Really romantic, huh?A really case of a partying slacker with bad attitude who'd rather have fun than a job characterizes the bass and horns funk jam of the immature &quot;Wham! Rap '86.&quot;  Michael raps some verses, and sings on the chorus.  And who would imagine George Michael would sing &quot;C'mon everybody, don't need this cr*p&quot;?George Michael's first solo single hit #7 in the US and either #1 or #2 in the UK, showing he had potential solo career potential.  &quot;A Different Corner&quot; is one of the best things I've heard from him.  It's a haunting regret song with bass and light airy keyboards and shows his vulnerable side.  &quot;Take me back in time maybe I can forget/turn a different corner and we never would have met&quot; he sings at one point.  Tie that with &quot;And if all that there is is this fear of being used/I should go back to being lonely and confused/If I could, I would I swear&quot; and you get the gist of this song.  Lonely and confused is something I'd pick given my sensitivity.The next number that's very personal to me,&quot; says George in introducing the live &quot;Blue.&quot;  The narrator here is a hollow husk after being deserted, saying he laughs and smiles less, and even needs someone to tell him where his heart is.  He repeats &quot;Can't you see I'm falling apart?&quot;The nightclub European jazz-like cover of Was (Not Was)'s &quot;Where Did Your Heart Go&quot; is another standout cut, due to Andy Hamilton's wailing sax.  Things really sink to despair, when the river &quot;calls out my name/Says 'put your troubles down beside me.'&quot; and the narrator jumps into the river's beauty.Another song about a delicate and crushed heart set to a well-paced bass and keyboard beat, &quot;Last Christmas&quot; is another George Michael solo.  As he says, &quot;This year, to save me from tears/I'll give it [my heart] to someone special.&quot;Despite some upbeat and heartfelt numbers, there's nothing charming or romantic here on this album, nothing like &quot;Freedom&quot; or &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go.&quot;  It's just one case of bad love, frustration, and loneliness after another, and it mirrors the dissolution of the duo's partnership.  George Michael made a few more significant marks in pop history, while Andrew Ridgeley married Keren Woodward of Bananarama, and backup singers Pepsi &amp; Shirlie released one solo album which spawned two big hits in the UK, but Wham! primarily served as a vehicle for George Michael's career."
1,"A lot of people are gonna tell you this is awful, or at the very least that it's not one of Elton's better recordings. Well, it isn't one of his better recordings, but in no way is it awful. Some of it is for sure: ""Island Girl"" was a big hit, which is interesting because it's also offensive faux-reggae and #1,234,567,890 in a long line of Bad Elton John Songs about Hookers; ""Dan Dare"" is a space-funk flop; ""Hard Luck Story"" is a rote Elton rocker. The other single, ""Grow Some Funk of Your Own"", is much better, a lighthearted funk stomp with a funny chorus; the band rocks out on the ""Saturday Night""-like ""Street Kids""; ""Feed Me"" is a nice little subdued melodrama with a screaming guitar part; the Bo Diddley/heavy metal fusion ""Billy Bones and the White Bird"" is so weird you have to hear it at least once. Not overly brilliant, but pretty good."
1,"When &quot;Beauty and the Beat&quot; was first released in 1981, it was considered revolutionary because the &quot;girl&quot; group members not only wrote their songs and played all their instruments. And they also happened to top the charts doing their thing.In my opinion, this release is even more relevant today than it was in 1981, because it simply rocks the beginning to end and is not a factory line product. Forget that they are an all-girl group and listen to the amazing songs that just keep coming.The music industry has changed a great deal since this release came out, but I venture to say that it would top the charts again if it was just coming out today. This release manages to be artist-driven and not masterminded by an ubberproducer, with an obligatory Dianne Warren song, and a guest hip hop artist. On the other hand, it's not self-indulgent like many releases from artists who think that meandering without cohesion is any better than mass production.If you are a Go-Go's fan, this review may not be necessary, if all you know from them is &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot; give this release a try. Sometimes, I recommend that people who don't know an artist head straight to a greatest hits collection, but in this case I would highly recommend the purchase of this CD as a first step as it sounds like a greatest hits collection.When I get around to doing my very first list of must-have CD's this one is sure to be at the head of the class."
1,"Starting with September Morn, all of his CDs have been very uneven and this is no exception.  This CD does have its share of very good tunes but also several that are AWFUL!!  I wish they would put out Greatest Hits Vol. 3 with all of his  great songs since September Morn that aren't on Vol. 2 including That Kind, The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore, On The Way To The Sky, Right By You, The Drifter, First You Have to Say You Love Me, Front Page Story, Heartlight, In Ensanada, Turn Around, You Make It Feel Like Christmas, Sleep With Me Tonight, The Man You Need, Story of My Life, It Should Have Been Me, (I'll See You On The Radio) Laura, Me Beside You, Best Years of Our Lives, This Time, If I Couldn't See You Again, If There Were No Dreams, Don't Turn Around, Hooked On The Memory of You and a couple from Tennesse Moon and Three Chord Opera.  Now that would be an AWESOME CD and you wouldn't have to waste your hard-earned money on awful CDs like this with only 5 or 6 good songs!!!!"
1,"This fantastic album appealed to so many sectors of the music business from its day of release.  It is a superb mix of catchy pop, gospel, soul  and a touch of jazz fusion.  At the time of its release, I was a grumpy  teenager, into progressive and West Coast rock, and highly resistant to  soul music.  But along came this perfect double LP -- early copies came  with a free EP containing four tracks that frankly aren't quite as great as  the rest -- and suddenly all the DJs I respected were playing it.  I  remember even the UK's John Peel dumping his normally punk-laden agenda, on  his late-night Radio 1 programme, in order to devote a couple of hours to  this gorgeous record.  I cannot highlight a single track -- all are  magnificent.  This remastering means that I've now bought two CD versions  of this album.  Should I give the earlier version to my brother?  No, I'll  keep it for the car!"
1,"One of the best rock albums of all time. ""Key to The Highway"" and ""Have you Ever Loved a woman"" are Two of the best songs of all time. A classic for All people to enjoy."
1,"Come on now, admit it, you really like Abba. This compilation is a great addition to your music collection.  With 19 tracks this is a bargain.  Excellent."
1,"CAMEOSIS IS THE JAM! This album was hittin' back in the summer of 1980 and to this day it is still groovin'. The music of today just can't compare. They don't make albums like this anymore! This album is among the most amazing of Cameo's career.The Album's Sound is a Solid & Sensational mixture of Soul & Funk Styles. Song Selections vary from Sizzlin' Funk Slammers toSweet Slow Jams. And it's a formula that works well for Cameo on this album. It's the perfect balance of musical styles and it features such percolating jams as 'Cameosis','Shake Your Pants' & 'Please You'. It also contains the Melodic,Midtempo Dance Smash,'We're Going Out Tonight' and the emotional funk ballad,'Why Have I Lost You?'. If  ever there was a Sentimental & Stunning Slow Jam,This is definately it. It's just a Classic Song,Period. Out of all the Funky Jamz & Groovez this disc has to offer,I would say that my favorite would be the Throbbin' Funk Cut,'Please You' because it's just down & dirty,Sweat Til U Drop Funk. That Joint is Raw Funk Sexuality with no shame and a Relentless Groove that's just Nasty! But seriously, if you're  looking for a Classic Funk Album to Vibe to then without question this is the CD for you!"
1,"Off the Wall has nothing but excellent music by the King of Pop, Michael Jackson. I am absolutely shocked and saddened to hear of his death earlier today. I want to write this review to remember him and honor him properly as one of the best entertainers we ever had; and I hope he rests in peace. The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent and I like that artwork, too.There's so much good music here; there's not a single dud in the bunch. ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" has a great beat and Michael handles this extremely well; his voice is in excellent form and the percussion really enhances the arrangement, too. Great! ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" makes a powerful beginning number for this album. ""Rock with You"" is catchy and great; this is classic pop that will always sound good--Michael delivers this flawlessly like the pro he always was! He sings with a great deal of passion in his voice and I'm very impressed.The album then takes a turn for the faster and somewhat more energetic ""Working Day and Night."" ""Working Day and Night"" has some pretty awesome musical effects and Michael sings this as effortlessly as if it were mere breathing. Of course, we know it really wasn't all that easy--Michael's talent always carried him through. ""Off the Wall,"" the title track, is absolutely mesmerizing; I loved this song from the very first time I ever heard it and I always enjoy listening to this! ""Off the Wall"" is first-rate music and a prime example of Michael's very fine artistry.If you like your pop music somewhat softer, no problem--listen for ""Girlfriend"" and ""She's Out of My Life;"" these two numbers have a softer flavor even when the lyrics aren't all that happy. ""She's Out of My Life"" works well and it's a major highlight of this album, too. ""I Can't Help It"" gets the royal treatment from Michael Jackson who delivers this faultlessly; Michael never lets go of a single superfluous note and that's grand.""It's the Falling in Love"" is truly special. ""Burn This Disco Out"" is another excellent song; it sticks in your head long after you hear it for the first time--this music is all THAT good. In addition, it's very interesting to hear Michael's original demo recording of ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough."" We get the original demo recording of ""Working Day and Night;"" and the album ends well with an interview featuring Quincy Jones and Rod Temperton.This edition of this CD comes with a special booklet; and I assure you that the restoration of the main tracks is magnificent.Michael Jackson died today; but of course he lives on through his music. I'll need time to truly comprehend our loss; it's tough to take and very shocking. This CD is one of Michael Jackson's great albums and I highly recommend it."
1,"I first heard of Celly Cel on E-40's In A Major Way. Then a certain music company(who I'm not at liberty to say their name)had his album for sale so I purchased it and was pleasantly surprised. Celly Cel can flow and the production team behind him is serious. What U N****z Thought is the hard edged opener as Celly Cel drops some good rhymes over a hard beat. In Tha Bullet(creative concept) he talks about being a bullet and all the damage it causes. He has two songs with guest appearances 4 Tha Scrilla(featuring E-40 and B-Legit) and Redrum(featuring Spice 1)both of which are standouts. He also drops you a gem on Remember Where You Came From as he tells the consequences of what happens when you forget where you came from. There is no fillers although I dont like the screwed up voice in the hook for Funk Season. Bottom Line: Celly Cel's Killa Kali is his best album and is definetly a highlight underground album for 96. Celly Cel can be added to the long list of underrated MCs from the west coast(Yukmouth, C-Bo, Xzibit etc). Standout tracks: WHAT YOU N****Z THOUGHT, 4 THA SCRILLA, ITS GOIN DOWN, THA BULLET, REDRUM, SKANLEZZ AZZ B*****Z, KILA KALI and FUNK SEASON."
1,"This incredible album helped to propel Dan Fogelberg's popularity in the  late 1970s, and represented a terrific follow-up to his best-selling  ""Souvenirs"". All in all, it provides terrific testimony to his talents, and  proof positive of the incredible talents of one of folk-rock's most  under-appreciated artists. From the stirring and dreamy opening  instrumental of &quot;Aspen&quot; to the segue into the complex and quite  accomplished lyrics of ""These Days"" describing today's romantic dysphoria  between modern couples, this album showcases Dan's wide range of  songwriting, musical, and arrangement skills. Fogelberg tends to favor a  very full ""wall of sound"" approach to his music, and sometimes tends to  somewhat overproduce arrangements by having too much going on  simultaneously in his works. In this case, however, the songs are clear,  crisp, and simply terrific, from &quot;Comes And Goes"" to ""Captured Angel""  to a memorable arrangement in ""Old Tennessee"" to a terrific performance of  ""Man In The Mirror/ Below The Surface"". My favorites here are the last two  songs; ""The Crow"" and the haunting &quot;The Last Nail"" a look back at a  love gone wrong, and his regret years later about what had occurred. This  is a wonderful album, folks, and a splendid example of Mr. Fogelberg's  considerable skills and talents. I highly recommend it. Enjoy."
1,"Before starting my review, let me state something to everybody.  This is not &quot;Lil' John get crunk&quot; or &quot;NoLimit I'm a thug&quot; music (though I guess they have their place), but this is a funk inspired journey through the lives and thoughts of Outkast.  This CD is one of my favorite albums of all time.  And just to think, they were only 18 when they made this album. Backed by Organized Noise, this CD can do no wrong.  Every song is on point (yes, every song).  I won't go on and on (Badu reference) about the CD, but it is unbelievably dope.  If you like this CD, you'll love Goodie Mob's &quot;Soul Food&quot; (another ground-breaking, thought-provoking album)."
1,This is just as solid as his first and then them.B-legit is showing the world that the Clicks sucsess was no fluke and how bright the future for him and the sickwitit family really is...From E-40 and the Click to the  Mossie this is the team thats been here since 92 and I don't see that  changin any time soon....(I was at Philly Blunts studio in Vallejo back in  September of 98 and a heard a new B-legit song that was recorded for his  new album and it was off the hook..I hope it makes the album.....)Watch 4  the new album cuz he keeps gettin better.....
1,"Unlike the masses who bought Thriller after Motown 25,the Thriller video,and the infamous Pepsi commercial incident,I got my copy before the mass hysteria.Thriller justified what i've been telling people about MJ,the  man is amazing.The album was nothing short of amazing as well.Billie Jean  was both funky and grandoise and Beat It melded hard rock and funk kicking  in the door that separates both genres(which also keeps closing  again).Wanna Be Startin' Something was the ultimate opening track,PYT once  a slight track sounds even better today,Human Nature and Lady In My Life  show his gift with ballads.On the other hand The Girl Is Mine stands as the  weakest track(an obvious ploy for crossover airplay that actually  worked)and the title track is more of a novelty.Unfortunatly over the years  along with multiple airplays Thriller lost a certain freshness.Where Off  The Wall was his breakout album,Thriller is where he wanted to go all the  way to the top and he played it somewhat safe,sacrificing the soul that  makes the previous album so alive.Even after almost two decades,Thriller is  a tough act to follow even for MJ who seems more concerned with topping  Thriller than embracing the raw talent that makes him so great."
1,"Just in case his work with Big Black and Rapeman didn't provide him with enough indie cred, in the mid-90's Steve Albini made a triumphant return with Shellac, a noise-rock agglomeration that continued Albini's exploration of the darker sides of both music in particular and human nature in general. In contrast to the compelling if diffuse rage and perversity of Big Black's legendary swansong Songs About F***ing, Shellac's debut At Action Park is a devastatingly precise and intelligent battering ram of an album. Coupling the raw, indie-centric ethic that made Albini notorious with tricky rhythms, mathy arrangements, and winding song structures, At Action Park is a prime distillation of the years of underground rock history that preceded it. Everything here is carefully measured for maximum visceral impact, with the end result being a lean, ruthlessly efficient piece of aural abuse that's as intelligent as it is abrasive.The opener My Black Ass is a perfect summation of Shellac's musical mission, with the violent stabbing motions of Albini's guitar married to Todd Trainer's halting drumbeats and the doomy chug of Bob Weston's bass. The next track, the scathing, pseudo-industrial Pull the Cup, continues in the same vein, except the lack of vocals makes it sound like something Don Caballero's evil twins might do. The Admiral is a metallic, headbanging number that manages an odd catchiness, but as the rest of the album makes clear, Shellac were more concerned with gut-punching you than making you move. The Crow is a more typical piece: pure menace, Albini emotionlessly intoning his ominous vocals over a disemboweling rhythm section, with shards of guitar noise only occasionally intruding on its evil atmosphere. Another classic, Song of the Minerals, is built on a hypnotic, unsettling drone that burrows its way deep into your subconscious while Albini's vocals become steadily more unhinged before exploding into shouts of ""It's alright if it makes you feel better!"" The band does show some aptitude for the eerily minimal thing as well with The Idea of North, a (relatively) subdued mood piece whose guitar noise and drumbeats lull more than pummell. Of course, the band quickly returns to malevolence with the lurching metal-on-metal scrape of the delightful Dog and Pony Show. The brief Boche's Dick wavers and staggers like a drunk before kicking into full dementia mode about halfway through, while Il Porno Star is high-end musical math whose sparse guitar lines and steamrolling bass rhythms are augmented by the jazzy complexity of Trainer's drum work.By the time the album ends with one of Albini's pointed screaming fits at the conclusion of Il Porno Star, it's clear he had another classic album on his hands. I'd even submit this album is superior to Songs About F***ing: smarter, more mature, and even scarier for it. I don't have the other two Shellac albums, but At Action Park has guaranteed them a spot at the top of my ""to buy"" list."
1,"&quot;Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy&quot; has always been my favorite Elton John album, simply because it's one of the few albums that could be described as perfect. There is not a single clunker on this whole album, and the production is flawless.Kicking off with the comforting and sophistsicated acoustic pickings of the title track, which depicts Elton and lyricist Bernie Taupin as cowboys and the record company executives who rejected their early material as bandits who they must defeat before riding off into the sunset. &quot;Tower Of Babel&quot; and &quot;Bitter Fingers&quot; are two more denouncing diatribes against the music industry that are very good tracks, and &quot;Tell Me When The Whistle Blows&quot; features an eloquent orchestral arrangement by Gene Wood, who arranged some of Barry White's biggest hits in the early to mid '70s'. Next comes one of Elton's best - known and most - loved compositions. &quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&quot; is a true classic with its simple, haunting piano intro, strong percussion, and Beach Boys - like harmonies on the tag. &quot;Gotta Get A Meal Ticket&quot; is a strong rocker featuring a screaming guitar intro. This is followed by the simple, almost funny &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;, which preceeds my favorite track, &quot;Writing&quot;. This perfectly sums up the way Bernie and Elton write a song. Following this is the luscious &quot;We All Fall In Love Sometimes&quot;, which perfectly sums up the relationship between Elton and his faithful companion Bernie. Lastly, there's the haunting &quot;Curtains&quot;, which denounces the early songs that they wrote together.Like all of Elton's '70s' reissues, this one has several bonus tracks added. Included are two of the three number one hits he scored in 1975, the soulful &quot;Philadelphia Freedom&quot; and his superb cover of &quot;Lucy Sky In The Diamonds&quot; featuring John Lennon singing and playing guitar. Also included is &quot;One Day At A Time&quot;, a beautiful song that Elton recorded with Lennon that was included on Lennon's &quot;Mind Games&quot; album.Overall, this is an excellent album that captures Elton in his prime. It also marked the end of his creative energy. Although he scored one more number one album (&quot;Rock Of The Westies&quot;), things were never the same after this album was released. As a matter of fact, it would be 20 years before Elton would release an album of this merit again."
1,"many different versions of this CLASSIC album are available....this is the one to get.Bonus tracks , a near complete concert, two different mixes of the actual album.....snatch it up before it goes away."
1,"I was fortunate enough to be working at a free-form rock station in Missouri when this album was released.  You better believe it got a lot of play on my shift.  The music is mostly tighter and faster than AC/DC, a similiar band, and their lyrics tended to be not as dark.  Wherever I've played it since for friends, the band has won a new fan here and there, and often the comment is made (as in reviews here) &quot;Why have I never heard of these guys?&quot;  Take our advice and take a chance by picking up a copy of this hidden hard-rock gem."
1,"Probably the best quality about this release is that it rocks pretty hard.  Yell Help, Street Kids, Grow Some Funk Of Your Own, and a few others have gritty styles.  Dan Dare is probably the standout piece here because of the  funky wah wah guitar lines and Elton John's elaborate vocal stylings.  However, as songs go many of the melodies are quite forgettable.  Its funny  that this record debuted at number 1 when it was released back in 1975.  Now this release just pales in comparison to many of Elton's other releases  before and after."
1,"An energetic raw introduction to this eccentric trio. An unusual combo of piano &amp; vocals (Ben Folds), bass and drums works surprisingly well, with Folds hammering-chords more than compensating for the lack of  guitar.Many pianists will be trying to play his cunning riffs... Put  this in the car and you'll soon be bashing the dashboard rather than  playing air-guitar at the traffic-lights. Whilst their later offerings have  been more polished (and with the exception of &quot;Whatever and Ever,  Amen&quot; less satisfying), none have been as frantically engaging and  down-right fun as this little stormer.A perfect summer record - crank it  up, open the windows and find new friends. Everyone seems to like this  stuff, but they don't know who it's by. Educate them!"
1,"Let me just say that I am so glad I found this CD! I am a late thrities individual who remembers every one of these hits, some of them performed with the Jackson Five.  For those of you who don't know the rest of them; Wer'e almost there, Just a Little Bit of You, Cinderella Stay Awhile, and a few others were from a album called FOREVER MICHAEL, which I bought when I was 8 years old (and still have, scratches and all, I wore that sucker  out!)  I had wanted the powers that be to put all of those songs on CD and they have minus 1 or 2 cuts (Where is the song DAPPER DAN?)This brings back great memories, songs that were cute, simple this was Michael they way most of us remember him.  If you have an ear for nostalgia, when songs were simple get this CD!"
1,"i had this review completely written when my power went out a few hours ago. and you know how frustrating it is to try to write something over by memory, so i won't. basically, i was disappointed by this album because i love self and was expecting their debut to sound really fresh and exciting and creative, but it's frankly not as good as their &quot;breakthrough&quot; album--if it can be called such--breakfast with girls. and of course, nothing tops their recorded-using-only-toy-instruments off-the-wall masterpiece gizmodgery, which everyone in the world should own (i recently sold my copy for 27 bucks at half.com...it's out of print, and i'm counting on it being rereleased relatively soon). anyway, subliminal plastic motives sounds like a fifth album, tired, uninspired, and while self had definitely already established the roots of their unique electropop sound, it wouldn't achieve ultimate fruition until the 2nd or 3rd album."
1,"I love this JB rules man and the payback is one of the most sampled songs in history and the rest of this cd has some funkdafied tracks on here special props goes to the jb's who are very underrated alongt with the legendary fred wesley, and maceo parker. ya'll keep the funk alive..."
1,"The album cover, one of the best examples of mid-60s psychedelia, and the quirky title, are only two relatively minor examples of why Cream's second album acheived and maintained the status of a classic.The fact is that Messrs. Clapton, Bruce, and Baker found Cream's true voice on DISRAELI GEARS. As tight as any band could be, when they are not trying to replicate an aural hallucination they are laying down electrified jazz riffs and blues themes, more and better.Totally in control at all times, from the opener ""Strange Brew,"" the archetypal opening riff of ""Sunshine of Your Love,"" and the odd lyric poem of ""SWLABR"" aka ""She Walks Like A Bearded Rainbow"" Cream proves they can rock harder than almost any band ever has.""World of Pain"" and ""Dance The Night Away"" are guitar-stretching numbers that prove once and for all that God, er, Eric Clapton knows his way around a fretboard.""Blue Condition,"" ""Take It Back,"" ""We're Going Wrong,"" and the cover ""Outside Woman Blues"" are, as their names imply, solid blues pieces that establish the band's comfort level in that genre.Probably the all-around best acid rock song on the album is ""Tales of Brave Ulysses,"" Homer's The Odyssey redux with it's image-laden lyric wedded to a driving, screaming beat.""Mother's Lament"" is a Cockney drinking song that closes DISRAELI GEARS on an up note.The underpinning of each song on the album explores the band's heavily jazz-influenced style. DISRAELI GEARS is neither hard rock nor blues nor jazz. It is an examination of rock music as art, and can well be considered the first Fusion album presaging bands such as Weather Report and Special Efx.Yet another album that came out of that year of nexus 1967, DISRAELI GEARS more than stands the test of time."
1,"I'll be honest with you.  I thought this soundtrack destroyed most of what Fritz Lang was trying to do (SILENTLY, mind you) by taking his message and slamming it into the audience's collective heads over and over.  But hey...  so what?  This soundtrack redeems itself as a collection of the most  singable songs ever.  I would have fallen asleep in European Lit watching  this film, but the soundtrack kept me alive and pumping, screaming  &quot;De-STRUC-tion!&quot; as the False Maria waved her arms in glee.  Okay, so maybe it does synch with the movie.  My point, though, is that  this album is even better if you don't connect it to Lang's original work.  Just buy it and give it a listen or two (or twenty, or two hundred) for its  undeniably Eighties charm."
1,"If you just stumbled across this album and gave it a listen, you might be forgiven for thinking that it's a greatest hits CD. At this point, AK already had a couple of albums under her belt, and it shows. The music is straight bluegrass and country, you won't find any of the later pop infusions (which is fine music itself!), and the song selection is first rate. The instrumentalists are in fine form, and her voice still has most of that thin,reedy quality that you associate with bluegrass. But if you listen, it's just beginning to warm up some and lose that young-girl quality ...So if you're already an AKUS fan, you can scoop this one up and enjoy every lick! And if not, this is as good a place as any to test the waters."
1,"The messy break up of Alternative British Rock duo Tears for Fears in 1991 was like a shot heard round the world, after releasing two phenomenally successful albums back to back (Songs from the Big Chair, Seeds of Love). When I first heard the single, ""Elemental"" the funky title track, then later the album-for a moment, it made me forget about the breakup-in other words, it's THAT good. By all accounts, this should have been titled, Roland Orzabal's ""solo album"" but for reasons of his own, kept the name alive, by releasing Elemental under the Tears for Fears moniker. This album is different from anything released before, with elements of Peter Gabriel-sounding synths, electronic drums, stylings of funk and soul, and edgy, subtle, appropriate atmospheric guitar courtesy of Orzabal. In fact, Orzabal performs many of the instruments and all lead and backing vocals on this album. Much of the recording and production, done at Orzabal's home, is slick, polished, surprisingly focused, and well-executed. As difficult and meticulous as Orzabal may be in terms of being hands on during recording and production according to his co-member Curt Smith's complaints, his production and songwriting skills are phenomenal throughout this album. This album was not well-received upon its original release, only going Gold instead of the mega-platinum success the band had before; thankfully, all is well between them and have rekindled their friendship and realigned their musical relationship, having toured and released several albums since. I highly recommend any TFF fan who may have originally skipped this release out of protest due to the absent Curt Smith, to give this album and another shot. In my humble opinion, it's worth checking out."
1,"During that musically confused decade, the eighties, an artist who debuted twenty years earlier renovates his style, adapting to new technology and a new lyrical approach after a long period during which his work received little attention. It sounds like a recipe for absolute ruin. Surprisingly, cult hero, Leonard Cohen, undergoes this process and comes out as a shining success, creating one of the best albums of his career with 1988's I'm Your Man. Despite introducing significant changes to his form, such as a polished, synthesizer-infused sound and a darkly ironic approach to lyrics, similar to recent work by alternative rock pioneers such as the Pixies and REM, the songs of I'm Your Man emphasize many things fans have always loved about Cohen: the wryly confrontational attitude (""First We Take Manhattan,"" a sinister song about Cohen's disdain towards the placid, yuppie fashion and music industries of the era, ""Everybody Knows,"" which echoes disappointment at the post-civil rights era), the glum self-depreciation (""Jazz Police,"" the magnificent ""I Can't Forget"") and the helpless romanticism (""Ain't No Cure for Love,"" the title track, in which Cohen sounds like either Allen Ginsberg attempting to woe a woman or Dean Martin trying to creep out his usual audience). Cohen does not come off as desperate and he does not sell-out. On I'm Your Man, he merely reevaluated his musical persona and was ready for the exceptional second phase of his career."
1,"Too $hort is the biggest pimp ever and always will be. Even though he doesn't rap about much else, for some reason it never gets old listening to Short dog. Possibly because Ant Banks provides some of the funkiest beats, or maybe it's Too $hort's delivery and voice, but I will never get tired of listening to Too $hort. This album is his best, edging out Life is Too Short and Cocktails. It has the best production and Too $hort and company drop hot lyrics over the beats. Bay Area rap doesn't get much better."
1,"Jackson struck out on his own here and you can hear the stirrings of the King of Pop already. Uber-producer Quincy Jones pairs with Michael here on an album that would spawn 3 huge hits in ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"",""Rock with You"" and ""Workin' Day and Night"" and that still holds up well more than 25 years later.HIGHLIGHTS:Michael's at his best when his songs are just barely contained sexfests and nothing illustrates that better than the intro to ""Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough"". A fairly non-descript R&B; comeon gives way when Michael explodes ""OOOOOOOOOH!"" and the song kicks into overdrive. An early home demo of the tune reveals that Michael isn't having his strings pulled by puppetmaster 'Q': the rock-solid percussive groove is fully formed in the version with brother Randy and sister Janet helping out on cabasa, glass bottles (probably pop bottles that were laying around) and other assorted stuff being banged on. Comparing it to the released version though also demonstates how much Jones brought to the table: imagine ""Don't Stop"" without the cascading strings soaring like an eagle through the mix. Sex again is the subtext on the slinky ""Rock with You"" with the drums and bass combining to undulate like bedsprings. Frenetic ""Workin' Day and Night"" was custom-made for the club right after a long day at the office. The title track is another insistent club anthem. Outside of the dance jams, ballad ""She's Out of my Life"" stops short of maudlin thanks to a nicely restrained performance from Jackson.LOWS:Nothing outright bad but ""Burn this Disco Out"" is nondescript. Those who are apt to toss the disc on random play will probably be irked by the bonus interview with producer Jones and Heatwave's Rod Temperton who wrote a couple songs on the disc. There's SOME interesting info there but it might have been better as an included ""bonus"" CD since you won't be listening to it a lot.BOTTOM LINE:A great collection that still holds up. The home demos are a nice extra though only as a curiousity because of heavy distortion (particularly on ""Workin' Day and Night""). Regardless of Jackson's personal problems, the music speaks for itself."
1,"R. Kelly really stepped things up with this his debut solo effort without the support of Public Announcement. The previous LP had showcased moments like ""She's Got That Vibe"" but had a lot of room for improvement and self expression.The focus here is almost totally on the 90s party/romance ""R&B;"" sound (He pauses only to honour his mother) and is full of classics in this respective genre. ""Bump N' Grind"" was the big hit and a definite anthemic highlight as he lays down his manifesto. Other well known material includes ""Your Body's Calling Me""  and ""It Seems Like Your Ready"", both are beautifully structured and performed. Tracks five to nine bring a more uptempo feel with a slight new jack twist carrying on from 1992's ""Born Into The 90s"". The album reaches it's climax on the final two numbers: the bedroom suite of the near twelve-minute opus ""Sex Me Part 1 & 2"" and ""12 Play"". It's all really well done, you can tell he had really studied the epic nature of Marvin Gaye's 70s work.Which leads into the one minor complaint, he didn't seem to have found his own distinctive sound at this stage. His vocal echoes Aaron Hall while the production at times Teddy Riley. That said this problem isn't as acute as on the last LP and the material is great on it's own merits. Even though he would go on to find his own voice and style on his next album (1995's self-titled effort), don't sleep on ""12 Play"", it's full of gems..."
1,"One of the very first songs that caught my ear as a child was ""Down Under"", and now it sounds even better. I also really like ""Cargo"", but there's no doubt this is the album to own. I guess it's really nothing more than great pop/rock, but man they did it well. ""Who Can It Be Now?"" was the other major hit, but almost everything else is as good. I also love ""Underground"", ""Helpless Automation"", ""Be Good Johnny"", and the excellent ""Down By The Sea"". The bonus tracks are all decent, but it's the original ten that make this a must for the early 80's fan. This reissue will go great with your ""Sports"" and ""She's So Unusual"" albums."
1,"The debut album ""A Flock of Seagulls"" is a riveting work by a band who truly strove to craft a music for the ages.  Mike Score, along with his brother Ali, Paul Reynolds and Frank Maudsley had made an album of substance, style, and wit, truly the bane of anything MTV wanted to promote, which is why their fortunes quickly waned in the US.  The CD reissue is identical to the vinyl with just one small complaint: Why did Jive Records have to take the intro off of the Live B-side version of ""I Ran"" (found on the 45 of ""(It's Not Me)Talking"") and tack it onto the studio version of the song?  BLASPHEMOUS!!!  I had the good fortune of seeing the band at Radio City in NY in August of 1983, and they did, indeed, rock the house!!"
1,Good album from Johnny. Once again he brings it as only he can. With soulful ballads and funky tracks. This album is one of my favs from him.
1,now i just like parts of it alot. im older now and ican see its not perfect. the hits of course are greatand a couple other songs. its sometimesa little faceless and boring..there is filler. thriller is better. :)
1,"Having survived the tragic loss of Charles Stepney and the recording of their following album without himSpiritin good spirits,Maurice White took a much needed vacation with his wife to Brazil and became deeply emerged in the Latin rhythms he heard out of Rio and Sau Paulo. He also became acquainted with the famous local singer-songwriter Milton Nascimento. Milton and Maurice began to come to the conclusion that a combination of their sound would be a potent element to extend on within Earth Wind & Fire-especially since Afro-Latin percussion was already an enormous aspect of their sound. Flash forward to the mid 1990's and I am just getting into the albums of EWF. I remember riding my bike seven miles or so across a lot of traffic to get to the local mall area where there was a record store called Strawberries. Browsing through their cassettes I came across this album on tape. Though the cover was much tinier,it touched on a deep interest I'd had in ancient Egypt and the pyramids of Giza since before I even learned how to ride a bicycle to begin with. Recognizing at least one song on it,and seeing it was in my price range? I decided to purchase it. When I got home,I put it in my portable cassette player and...found myself travelling in a musical world I am going to try my best to explain to you now.Beginning with a somewhat Michael McDonald sounding clavinet riff from Larry Dunn,""Serpentine Fire"" kicks into high gear with clinging Brazilian percussive funk of the most meaningful order. I could write paragraph after paragraph about the lyric's seemingly flexible meaning,but the slithering rhythmic nature of the music may tell the story even better. I've heard it said that ""Fantasy"" is rhythmically deep into the ""4 on the floor"" disco beat. But something about the cinematic atmosphere transcends anything else for a song celebrating romantic imagination. The Kalimba interlude ""In The Marketplace"" goes into the furious horn funk of ""Jupiter""-probably one of their cleanest played and most under heralded funk numbers they ever made. ""Love's Holiday"" is a quintessential EWF mid-tempo groove that is more verse oriented when it comes to Maurice's lyrical approach than his usually melodic style. The first part of Milton's ""Brazilian Rhyme"" is next-concluding in a stomping,funky jam with Verdine's bass bopping brightly.  ""I'll Write A Song For You"" could be viewed somewhat as ""Reasons"" part II instrumentally-with the songs eloquently romantic lyrics building into a fantastically orchestrated climax. ""Magic Mind"" is another excellent uptempo funk number-with some of the most elaborate soloing from the Phenix Horns.""Runnin"" is one of my favorites here. Starting out as a vocalese led melodic jazz-funk/fusion jam from Philip Bailey,the already heavy Afro-Latin strains in the rhythm come to a percussive frenzy by the songs second half-with Larry Dunn's kinetic synthesizers bridging the two sections together. ""Be Ever Wonderful"" is really the only fully gospel/soul derived song on this album-ending with a triumphantly sung mid tempo ballad. The bonus tracks are a more piano oriented demo of ""Love's Holiday""-showcasing Maurice's rich vocal and a more instrumental (and of course even more Brazilian) take on ""Runnin"" in the ""original Hollywood mix"". The finale is a live version of ""Brazilian Rhyme""-recorded live in Rio during the bandsFacestour and built around Larry Dunn's glistening,sparkling synthesizer textures. These only increase the potency of the original album. Its an album that embodies a certain quality that...I cannot effectively put into words. The only way I could even try to explain this is that the way in which the Brazilian rhythms and bouncing melodies on this album are carried out? The entire quality of the music on this album has the feeling of a journey,the feeling of motion towards a compelling knowledge outside oneself. And its all tangible and makes sense when heard on these songs. This album brings mystery into focus,and brings time to a slower crawl. Its funk that is both spiritually deep and commercially successful. And is very likely (at least to me,it already is) the definitive Earth Wind & Fire experience from a purely musical perspective."
1,"Ok first of all, I'm very cautious on throwing 5 stars out. But this album, Rage's first album from 1992, deserves each bit of these 5 shiney stars for their debut album.First off, this is the best Rage album out there. It's obvious everything by Rage is good (even ""Renegades"" and they didn't even write those songs) but the self-titled debut stands out as the funkiest, most aggressive and most meaningful Rage album out of their catalogue. The songs are complex and well timed, each song is brilliant, each song is just as angry as the next(especially the closer, ""Freedom"" where Zach is absolutely screaming ""freedom"" from the bottom of his heart) and Tom's guitar playing is superb. This album probably shows Tom at his best, crazy unique solo's, great riffs, he's all over the place on this album. Tim's bass playing is excellent as well, funky, and aggressive, sticking tight with the drums (as the way it should be). The cover of this album means serious business as well, remember, this was Rage Against the Machine's first album, and looking at this cover added drama and suspense to who these guys were. You take a look at the cover and your first impression of this masterpiece is anger and (obviously) politics. What you hear, is what you get, violent, pissed off, meaningful, and straight from the heart. Especially with some lyrics, like Zach's veiw on ""Fistful of Steel"", ""Silence, something about silence makes me sick, 'cause silence can bring violence sorta like a slit wrist.""This is an excellent album, one of the best in alternative rock music. If you settle for this album now, you'll settle for it later."
1,"The tone that Clapton used here, very 'woop-woop' with the treble turned down, (ironically, the exact opposite of the trebly-toned Albert King, although much of Clapton's work here uses King's riffs), became the currency of the day among every rock lead guitarist under 25. In fact, it is my -least- favorite Clapton tone, as it washes out all of the high-end string noises that lend to expression,(it's 'easy' on mistakes, which explains why every amateur had this tone within days of the original release.) Nonetheless,  the songwriting and playing harkens back to a time when everything wasn't done with sales numbers in mind,  poetry and improvisation making it to the top 40."
1,"THE ROMANTICS: Detroit's leather clad, carefully coiffed ROMANTICS practically defined power pop in the early 80s, welding the pristine vocal harmonies and jangly guitars of BADFINGER and THE RASPBERRIES to a hyperactive punk beat. Hard hittin' drummer JIMMY MARINOS also happened to possess a crackling, soulful shout of a voice, which, along with WALLY PALMAR's killer harmonica solo, helped propell supernova single WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU, a dance floor classic that's only grown more popular with each passing decade. Every track on their explosive debut disc boasts similar loud 'n clear high energy antics, from ""shoulda hit big"" band originals WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES and TELL IT TO CARRIE to the lone cover tune, a catchy recasting of RAY DAVIES' SHE'S GOT EVERYTHING. THE ROMANTICS eventually veered off into a more mainstream direction and were rewarded with the lean, mid-tempo hit TALKING IN YOUR SLEEP...but they forged their fire-in-the hole reputation on this, their first and best self-titled party platter.RATING: FOUR RED SUITS"
1,"4 and 3 and 2 and 1...and when i'm on the mic, the suckas run.  And so it began.  As fresh today as it was way back in 1986, 'Licensed To Ill&quot; presented rap music to white audiences everywhere, through it's exploits of beer drinkin', girlie chasin' and White Castle eatin'.  RUN DMC and LL Cool J's albums at the time weren't recorded in any language that made them difficult for mainstream audiences to understand, for whatever reason they didn't captivate young white America like the Beastie's did.  'Licensed To Ill' is like a fantastic expansion of DMC &amp; Aerosmith's &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, with some non-crossover rap thrown in for good measure.  Synthesized beats, sampled guitar riffs, and all-too-catchy lyrics all compose this fantastic record, and not much else can be said about it that hasn't been said already.  If you haven't yet, GO BUY THIS ALBUM."
1,"The only thing that could make this otherwise perfect album better, would be for it to be remastered. Simon and Garfunkel are one of the best loved and talented duos of all time. Their blend of folk and pop, with their delicious harmonies will never grow old. 100 years from now when the world has forgotten the Britneys and Rickys and Christinas of the current pop radio airwaves, Simon and Garfunkel will still be listened to. The lyrics are intelligent and poetic, and the music catchy and well arranged. What could be better? Too bad it was the last album they recorded as a duo."
1,"Jeff Lynne, headmaster of Electric Light Orchestra, has a well known love affair with music.  It is evident in A New World Record, ELO's sixth album.  This is especially noteworthy with the song, &#34;Rockaria!&#34;Lynne's styles range from toe tapping fun, again nodding to Rockaria! to melancholy sounds of Mission (A New World Record).  Chart toppers such as Telephone Line, Living Thing and Do Ya.  Telephone Line was responsible for the group's first US Gold Single.Mik Kaminski, still in the line up, is the group's violin/fiddle player.  While an unsung member of ELO, Mik was responsible for their strings sound until Lynne decided to do away with that section years later.  Mik would later appear in '83 on Rock 'n' Roll is King, a song in the same vein as Rockaria! and touring with ELO II.A New World Record is a must have in any format for lovers of Electric Light Orchestra."
1,"What can I say about this classic hip hop album that hasnt already been said!!!!!  to be honest..... not much.  But this is my Favorite 2pac album ever!!!!  In my opinion, 2pac isnot only the greatest rap artist ever but also the greatest writer in hip hop!!!!!  This album is just an example of what he can do with his incredible talents in a short amount of time.  Every song on here gets at least 4.5 stars......  I would go in more detail... but so much has been said by so many other people........ Its the GREATEST!!!!!"
1,"This incredible album helped to propel Dan Fogelberg's popularity in the  late 1970s, and represented an announcement of his arrival as a major  figure in the folk-rock pantheon. This was the follow-up album to a string  of successful efforts that started with ""Souvenirs' and went on to  ""Captured Angel"" and ""Twin Sons Of Different Mothers&quot;, leading up to  this instant smash release. All in all, it provides terrific testimony to  his talents, and proof positive of the incredible talents of one of  folk-rock's most under-appreciated artists. From the stirring and dreamy  opening instrumental of &quot;Tullamore Dew"" to the pulsating segue into  the complex and quite accomplished lyrics of ""Phoenix"" describing  Fogelberg's near submersion in a negative relationship and his rise above  its pain to recreate himself, this album showcases Dan's wide range of  songwriting, musical, and arrangement skills.Of course, the album was  also helped along to the top of the charts by the inclusion of the hit  single ""Longer"", which was a number one song. Fogelberg tends to favor a  very full ""wall of sound"" approach to his music, and sometimes tends to  somewhat overproduce arrangements by having too much going on  simultaneously in his works. In this case, however, the songs are clear,  crisp, and simply terrific, from &quot;Gypsy Wind"" to ""Last To Know"" to a  terrific performance of ""Face The Fire"", Fogelberg's personal contribution  to the ""No Nukes"" anti-nuclear power movement. My own personal favorites  here are ""Face The Fire"", with its intricate, amazing, and powerful  electric guitar arrangement, ""Along The Road"", a dreamy recolelction of  life on the run, and ""Wishing On The Moon"". This is a wonderful album,  folks, and a splendid example of Mr. Fogelberg's considerable skills and  talents. I highly recommend it. Enjoy."
1,"There's no doubt this album, ""Meantime"", was influential to many of today's bands. The band as a whole are very influential, and almost created a whole genre on it's own with their own brand of creative riffing and drumming. Page Hamilton's vocals aren't the greatest, but they definitely suit this brand of music as they're equally as aggressive as the riffs on their angriest songs. On the slower, groovier songs, his vocals can even be surly at times and just relaxed. The riffing is unique in that they're so distinct. When you hear a Helmet riff, you KNOW it's Helmet. This also applies to bands like Meshuggah, Entombed, Strapping Young Lad and Crowbar, just to name a few.This album i think is their second best, behind ""Strap It On"" which to me is totally flawless. My favourite tracks on this album are ""In The Meantime"" which they did a video for, ""Ironhead"", ""Unsung"", ""Better"", ""You Borrowed"", ""FBLA II"" and the awesome ""Role Model"". Each track really has a memorable riff in it, and such songs like ""Better"", ""In The Meantime"", ""Role Model"", ""FBLA II"" and ""You Borrowed"", are just unforgettable and you'll be coming back to them over and over.This is a 90's Alternative/Hard Rock classic, and is a must for fans of the genre. The songs and lyrics are so catchy, and the riffs are memorable enough to have stuck in your head days after hearing them. Even Page Hamilton's vocals, though not the best, are somewhat creative for how he sings the lyrics. Helmet are full of talent, and have recently rejoined and released a new album titled ""Size Matters"" which i personally find isn't up to the sort of greatness they found on albums like this and ""Strap It On"". But it's nice to know they've rejoined, and if you see that they're touring anywhere near your home town, be sure to check them out. It would be a memorable experience."
1,"This album, which held the #1 spot on the UK chart for most of 1981 (though only reaching #44 on the US chart), is simply Adam & the Ants' greatest achievement. It starts of with the fantastic, upbeat & ecstatic 'Dogeatdog', a UK #4/US #15 smash. The song takes a while to get used to, but when you finally get it, it will blow you away.'Antmusic', a UK #2/US #14 single, was Adam & the Ants big breakthrough, & the only single that was able to reach a respectable chart position during the post-murder Lennon craze of christmas 1980. Being kept of the top spot by the songs of the tragically murdered prophet of his generation, 'Antmusic' nonetheless, broke Adam & the Ants internationally, & desrvedly so, for it is among his best & catchiest songs. New listeners, start with that song, for it will get you in the first listen.After these two songs, the record suddenly gets very dark. Actually the album is a pretty dark affair, with 'Los Rancheros' & especially 'Feed Me To The Lions' bringing visions of a Bowiesque post-apocalyptic landscape to mind. 'Press Darlings' is another catchy classic followed by 'Ants Invasion' & 'Killer In The Home', that follow up the apocalyptic tension. 'Kings Of The Wild Frontier' itself, a UK #2 hit following the #9 placing of the non-album 'Young Parisians', is the strangest song on the strangest record. Indeed. There is nothing else to say about that song (later `Ant Rap' would follow up on this tradition of taking Adam & the Ants' weirdest songs into the UK top 3).`The Magnificent Five', `Don't Be Square (Be There)' & `Jolly Roger' (the name signifies the direction Adam & the Ants would take on their next record) are somewhat average Adam & the Ants songs (though such a thing doesn't exist). `Jolly Roger' jumps from brooding to a parody of singalong every 15 seconds or so. They are all great songs, & carry the hilarious/apocalyptic mood up to `Physical (You're So)', a #19 hit in the US, but never released as a single in the Ant homeland of the UK. Truly one of his best songs, it is also one of his darkest, carried by a paranoid guitar feedback. It leads into `The Human Beings', another misty dark song, which scares you into laugter... or?... well, it sounded good. A strange chorus carries the tune & ends this most fascinating & brilliant album."
1,"As my title implies, this is the Misfits' 2nd best ablum overall (right behind Walk Among Us), and it definitely a must-have in any respectable punk collection.  This album is very very different, but extremely good.  Instead of the more &quot;punk&quot; sound of Walk Among Us and Earth AD, Static Age leans more towards a slow, stripped down kind of rock 'n' roll style.  The songs aren't played very fast, and there aren't a lot of Danzig's famous &quot;Wooooahooooahs&quot;s, but still, I consider this album essential.  The songs are nice and rockin' and are always a good listen.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because sometimes it seems to drag.  The song &quot;Come back&quot; lasts about 5 minutes and doesn't really seem to get anywhere.  However there are plenty of good songs (&quot;Bullet&quot;, &quot;We are 138&quot;, &quot;Last caress&quot;) that totally make up for the one stinker.  Here's how I rate the songs:1. Static Age (3/5): A bit too slow, not one of the album's high points.2. TV Casualty (4/5): A similar sound to Static Age, but better.  Cool lyrics.3. Some Kinda Hate (5/5): One of my favorites.  Catchy as hell.4. Last Caress (5/5): An undisputed Misfits classic.  Awesome lyrics, catchy as hell.  Been covered by Metallica and NOFX.5. Return of the Fly (4/5): Cool song about a horror film.6. Hybrid Moments (4/5):  Sounds similar to Return of the Fly.  I like Glenn's vocals on this track.7. We are 138 (5/5): Another Misfits classic.  My favorite track off the album.  It gets stuck in your head like you wouldn't believe.8. Teenagers from Mars (5/5): Another classic.  Just plain awesome.  &quot;We're teenagers from Mars, and we don't caaaare!&quot;9. Come back (2/5): Only skippable track off the album.  Drags on for too long and doesn't seem to get anywhere.10. Angelfuck (4/5): Cool song with cool vocals.11. Hollywood Babylon (3/5): Ehh, not the best song they've ever done, but still good.12. Attitude (5/5): I LOVE this one.  Superb vocals.13. Bullet (5/5): Another classic.  Possibly the most irreverent song ever written.14. Theme for a jackal (4/5): Uses a piano, and makes for a cool sounding song.15. She (4/5): Just a good song.16. Spinal Remians (4/5): Ditto17. In the doorway (5/5): This one's really good.  It's hard to explain.  It's just awesome.Bottom Line: If you're into punk at all, get Walk Among Us, then buy this."
1,"Dangerous continues Jackson's mainstream success in the pop scene worldwide. It is a great follow-up of its predecessor Bad. Dangerous contains the elements of pop that have a distinctive sound that resonate with the 90s music. This clearly shows Jackson's awareness of making his music more approachable to the 90s musical scene. It is arguably one of his best albums of all time. But sadly, Dangerous is considered to be last of some of his great albums as he's subsequent albums were slowly declining in popularity."
1,Love the album.  Love the mix.  I just wish there were more multi-channel SACDs on the market.
1,"While Out Of The Blue hinted at the new direction for the band, Discovery grabbed the wheel and forcibly steered ELO toward a more dance oriented sound.  ""Shine A Little Love"" and ""Don't Bring Me Down"" received major airplay, but also heavy rotation at discos all around the world.  Long time fans were left feeling abandoned, and the band's fortunes began a slide that slowly ate away the foundation that had been built on Face The Music and A New World Record.  After this, things would never be the same."
1,"I used to listen to this album all the time when I was in the Army.Been looking for a remastered version for years,but it just is not available.At $6.99 I decided to go for this analog version.Glad I did,'cause this cd sounds great.I guess this music was recorded and played so well the first time,nobody sees the need for a digital remastering.Great singing,great easy listening songs!Worth all $6.99 (plus shipping) ha ha:)"
1,"This album is good, but lacks the excitement of Johnny Gill from 1990. I liked the stomping feel of The Floor, the funky I Got You with Boyz II Men and the rapidly paced song Provocative.  But my favorite is the ballad Tell Me How U Want It, which I still like to hum along to. It's really my second favorite ballad from Johnny after My, My, My. Very soothing and comforting song in its lush relaxing sound.  The rest of the album is mostly filler and would have been better sung by an underrated R&B male singer struggling to get his single higher than No. 54 on the singles charts.  But that's what it's like, when a stylistic artistically done song gets passed on by a commercially slick keep it to 3 minutes song.  Johnny has made better songs than the filler that takes about 5 songs. It will take you days to figure this album out because of its unevenness."
1,"I don't have a lot of Tom Waits albums (not yet anyway) but Rain Dogs is the one that I listen to most often and I love it from start to finish. It is a tour de force both lyrically and musically and everything works. It's also strong enough to listen to in one setting and you won't skip any tracks. To the uninitiated, the most well known song would be ""Downtown Train"" which Rod Stewart would later have a big hit with in a fine version. Everything is great, whether it's a tearful ballad like ""Hang Down Your Head"" or ""Time"", a swinging jazz tune like ""Big Black Mariah"" or the instrumental ""Midtown"", or just something oft-kilter (""Cemetery Polka"", ""Singapore"", ""Gun Street Girl"" among others). A lot of different instruments here too, it's certainly not the piano in the bar sound of Closing Time or Small Change (also great albums). When you're a restless music lover, eventually you turn to Tom Waits. When you do, this is the first one to pick up."
1,"There's music in the air and oh yeah, the music can be heard from across the waterway, the lagoon- It procrastinates out over the buffet table and the bar and the dessert table, through the lanai and over the gentle  undertow where the bridge crosses, over the rustling of the green swamp  water grass, the reminiscing of the beauty of the life of music lingers on.  It was early and people began to drift in at a slow and leisurely pace,  Freshly showered, perfumed, lazy days of life sustain without regret, White  linen pants and summer dresses all year round.  The employees came first,  then the aroma of mesquite grilled abundance which was professionally  marinated and cooked full moon for the party goers, smoked out over the  embankment. Slow cooking-a whole days process in homage to this very night.  Then came the young fresh energetics, more than ready and willing to  celebrate the beauty of their existence, their diversity, their lives on  this planet. The language of the music was not always their own but the  emotion of their music was universal. There was mingling, laughing, and  frivolous celebration of good things in life yet to come. Her real name is  Betty, but we call her June.  And when it was all said and done, couples  walked slowly away from there, hand in hand, stopping every once in a while  with their eyes glazed over, to make a point of remembering that particular  moment in time.  They had said, &quot;We should really do this more  often&quot; and meant it.Tristan Tom"
1,"It just never ceases to amaze me how KRS-One stayed on top of his game in the late 80's and early 90's. With BDP's final album Sex And Violence, Kris was going through a lot of problems with his personal life, which included a divorce from his wife, Ms. Melody (many know her from the ""Self Destruction"" single), and apparently was reducing the people in his BDP circle (according to the linear notes). Not to mention what he did at the P.M. Dawn concert. So there was some stuff going on while recording this album.When I first heard this album, I was damn near blown away. Everything here is on point. Every song here is amazing in its own way, as it has it's own message. ""Drug Dealer"" is a song about doing something positive instead of selling drugs. On ""Questions and Answers"", Kris goes at those fradulant magazines and does his own self interview (Don't diss The Source though. Their chief editor give him 4 1/2 mics for this LP.) Even ""13 And Good"" is a interesting story about hooking up with an underage girl, with an unusual ending to the plot.When he is not kicking messages, Kris' mic skills are still on point. On the amazing ""Like A Throttle"", he goes with a vingence over a dope beat. The next ""Build And Destroy"" he gets a lot off his mind, going towards if rappers who are true to the Islam nation are legitimate in their rhymes. The final track ""The Real Holy Place"", Kris questions Christianity and the credibility of the Holy Bible. Even Freddie Foxxx shows off on ""The Origonal Way"", and drops a long facinating verse on ""Ruff Ruff"".With producers like himself, Kenny Parker, Prince Paul, D-Square, and Paul Joey, along with Willie D and Sidney Mills, help create this great album. It's very unfortunate that this was BDP's least selling album. I guess everyone's ear was heading out to the west coast, because they were dropping classic albums aroung this time. Sex and Violence should be enjoyed by all fans of east coast or early 90's rap. In the words of Kris himself, this album is ""Fresh for 1992, you suckas!!""

1,"Though I have always had the deepest of respect for Mr. Clapton, this album was the album that really showed me what was so special about him. While mostly known for its stunning title track, each and every track on this album is more than worth the entire price. Clapton not only shines on the guitar, but he also gives the most passionate and moving vocal performance of his career. Duane Allman and Eric Clapton bring out the absolute best in each other's playing, and the rest of the band is also breathtaking. Anyone who likes blues, classic rock, or just good music should thoroughly enjoy this musical landmark. I never understood why Eric Clapton was considered among the Gods of rock until I heard this album. Anyone who has ever had any doubts about him should truly check this out."
1,"Upon its release PARSLEY, SAGE, ROSEMARY & THYME was regarded as a landmark recording; time, however, has taken a toll.  In the wake of the many artists Simon and Garfunkel inspired, their mixture of folk-rock and electronics no longer seems as fresh as it once did, and the album is beset by two youthfully pretentious songs and a number of cuts that have become distinctly dated.Even so, this remains a remarkable recording.  Few duos have had such a remarkable vocal marriage as Paul Simon, with his high baratone and emphatic yet casual delivery, and Art Garfunkel, with his more disciplined yet absolutely angelic tenor.  And this recording offers quite a few selections of the duo operating at the height of their powers.  The opening ""Scarborough Fair/Cantile"" is a superlative mixture of folk-inspired yet delicately socially-concious lyrics sung in a lovely counterpoint against guitar and harpsichord; ""Homeward Bound"" was a popular hit, and deservedly so; and ""The 59th Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)"" has been often interpreted by others but never so beautifully as it is here.But the real winners are the lesser known selections.  The stand out is easily ""For Emily, Wherever I May Find Her,"" a dreamy, free-form balland that provides a stunning showcase for Garfunkel's somewhat underused powers as a lead vocalist; ""The Dangling Conversation"" and ""Flowers Never Bend With The Rainfall"" are also brilliant pieces of work, blending astute observation, self-awareness, and subtle social commentary into seamless wholes.  It is music such as this upon which the Simon & Garfunkle reputation rests.But there are two missteps.  The first of these, ""Patterns,"" is sheer youthful self-indulgence and pretentiousness; the second, ""A Poem on the Underground Wall,"" never really forfills its promise and leaves one feeling that the piece ended before it should.  And then there are the dated selections.  ""The Big Bright Green Pleasure Machine,"" a clever slap at consumerism, is very much of its place and time and might well have been done by any singer of the 1960s and 1970s; ""A Simple Desultory Philippic,"" with its parade of names and acid take on Bob Dylan, is likely to mystify any one who didn't actually survive the 1960s; and although it remains remarkably powerful, ""Seven O'Clock News/Silent Night"" is also uniquely of its own period.  In terms of execution, all these songs--including the two I consider ""missteps""--are extremely well done, but contemporary listeners without a frame of reference for them are likely to find them problematic at best.Final thought: for all it's charms, this is not really the recording I would use to introduce a newcomer to Simon and Garfunkel; those unfamilar with their work would do better to select a ""Greatest Hits"" compilation.  But for established fans, PARSLEY, SAGE, ROSEMARY & THYME is an essential."
1,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...""Levon"" is one of my all time favorites and ""Tiny Dancer"" is also a classic. While there are some other good songs shuch as the title song and ""Razor Face"", overall there are too many forgettable tracks mixed in to make it a four star album."
1,"When you've heard all of Hendrix a thousand times and are desperate for more, but not the same, you must turn to Cream's psychedelic bluesy classic rock! Great tunes, great solos, by the best rock stylists of their time. One great thing about Cream is that whether in the studio or live, they remain fresh and this album is proof. I realize that saying Disraeli Gears is the best Cream album (over Wheels of Fire) is setting myself up for a fight, but there it is. Every song is a major one, with the most immitated rock guitar tracks of all time (the only exception being Stairway to Heaven). Plus, it is most distinctively Cream, whereas the other albums have integrated many licks and styles that can be found on Hendrix and other blues and rock artists' albums. That doesn't stop me from owning and playing the heck out of them, but establishes, for me, that Disraeli Gears is the supreme achievement of the band."
1,"Welcome to ""the place where they take your spine & turn it into soap flakes"".Costello has always been angry, he built his reputation on it. But on BLOOD & CHOCOLATE, all kid gloves are off. Those great pop hooks & bitter turns of phrase are there, but here he deliberately keeps things as ugly as possible. Playing almost in mockery of stuff like ""Oliver's Army"". It's the sonic equivalent of burning oneself in effigy. Smothered in decidedly claustrophobic production, the whole album sounds like a bar brawl in a broom closet.""Uncomplicated"" clangs in like a ringside bell. One immediately gets the sense that everyone's playing in the dark, pissed as hell, determined to beat any semblance of melody into a pulp. Steve Neive hits the Wulitzer like a drunken carny. Pete Thomas seems to be pounding on the decapitated heads of those he hates. As if in spiteful opposition, Bruce Thomas plays as if he's creeping up to push the shiv in. As for Costello, he gleefully lives up to the self-deprecating nickname ""little hands of concrete"", spitting out his lyrics as if he couldn't stand the taste of them.Throughout, they seem intent on flogging the same dead horse, especially the likes of ""Tokyo Storm Warning"" & ""Honey Are You Straight Or Are You Blind?"" Elsewhere, the atmosphere could only be described as perverse.A major highlight is ""I Want You"". Easily one of the creepiest & most powerful songs he's ever recorded.  I suppose the whole album could be summed up with the lines, ""the truth can't hurt you, it's just like the dark/ it scares you witless but in time you see things clear & stark"".The most epic number has to be ""Battered Old Bird"". Despite it's maudlin tone, never has the boardinghouse come so close to Bedlam. The characters are more like inmates from an asylum than tenants. He's never recorded anything like it.As for the bonus disc, 3 tracks stand out among the debris. Costello's fondness for Burt Bacharach is obvious in ""You'll Forgive Her Anything"". A vastly superior take than the one found on the Ryko reissue. There's also a furious assault on ""Leave My Kitten Alone"" that puts the Kojak Variety version to shame. Lastly, a lost classic can be found in ""New Rhythm Method"".In the liner notes Costello confesses that B & C sounds like a bitter 33 year old divorcee's answer to THIS YEAR'S MODEL. It also could be considered the sound of Costello not only breaking up with The Attractions, but with himself as well. One listen to later albums like BRUTAL YOUTH & USELESS BEAUTY & it's evident they were far more than a mere backing band.This album is definitely not for beginners or fickle fans who could never get beyond the first three albums. It's his TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT or SONGS OF LOVE & HATE. Separating the connoisseurs from the tourists."
1,"Many of us REAL hip hop heads are knowin' that All Eyez On Me was the 1st of it's kind and that on this particular release we 1st saw 2Pac meet Makaveli(and lyrical West Side representation at it's best f/m 'Pac and the collabs), the production was HOTTT from start to finish(Death Row's production was hip hop's finest back in the 90's), and this album set a trend for the infamous double LP. I'm not even gonna list my fav's cause they were all some of the HOTTTEST joints Pac ever released since gettin' outta fed, but to the critics sayin' he was evil, sexist,wack,etc...you either didn't know or inquire of the man behind the music, and probably were among those who considered Pac hip hop until he started cappin' on Biggie, Bad Boy, Mobb Deep, Nas, Jay-Z, and the rest o' them. Pac was just bein' Pac...the Realest and the Greatest Of All Time. Makaveli,R.I.P."
1,"Never have been much of a rap or hip hop fan, but I loved this thing when it first came out when I was in high school way back in '86...when rap was still somewhat new.  I liked the harder edge and how it married guitars and rap, especially in songs like ""Rhymin and Stealin"" and the hits ""Fight For Your Right"" and ""No Sleep to Brooklyn"".  Kerry King even threw in some guitar work on 'No Sleep to Brooklyn'.  Thanks to Rick Rubin's production.Other great songs are ""She's Crafty"", ""Girls"", ""Paul Revere"", ""Brass Monkey"", and ""Slow and Low"". There is a fair amount of variety in these songs, and that's why it's less of a traditional rap album as compared to their later stuff.Yeah, the lyrics are adolescent at times, but in the end License to Ill is a fun album with fun lyrics and music.  And isn't that what it's all about?"
1,"I've been KANSAS fans for over 20 years.They had ups and downs.I think this CD is a best introductory for the beginner for AMERICAN PROGRESSIVE ROCKS.This band's pop sides are strongly stressed in this hit collection.If you are a DIEHARD fans KANSAS,dig another fulllength albums.So many long time complex pieces are omitted here.This GREAT BAND can't be told with only this CD.This is a good main gate  for the AMERICAN PROG-ROCK SEEKERS."
1,"A minor musician sued Joel over the rights to ""My Life"".  The musician claimed he had written the title, and Joel settled out of court.  As he worked on and promoted 52nd street, Billy faced a whole host of legal issues.  He also had to fight hostile critics, and often responded by tearing up his bad reviews on stage before a mob of cheering fans.THE STRANGER was a fantastic album, so it would be a daunting task for any musician to deliver a follow up release equal to or better than his previous work.  Billy had to undertake the task and turn out another smash hit release to maintain his popularity.  He came out with 52nd street, an album noted for its Jazzy appeal and catchy tunes.  Though he did not qualitatively beat THE STRANGER, he kept up his huge popularity and boosted his standing in the music industry.52nd STREET begins with the hard rock tune ""Big Shot"", one of Bill's live performance favorites.  ""Honesty"", an overplayed radio song, came next.  ""Honesty"" honestly lacked the range and depth of ""Just the Way You Are"", a STRANGER release.  ""My Life"", the hugely popular hit, came next, and provided the focus of the album.  ""Zanzibar is an intresting song.  ""Stiletto"" and ""Half a Mile Away"" show some of Billy's finest musicianship.  Those two songs show his skillful piano playing.  The rest of the album is decent filler material.52nd STREET is niether his best or worst album.  Indeed as said before it has the unfortunate fate of being cronologically in between THE STRANGER and GLASS HOUSES, Joel's two finest albums. It is overshadowed and sort of left in the dark.  But it still makes good listening, and is one of Joel's better works."
1,"Characters is one of the lesser known albums in the Stevie Wonder catalog.  It would be a great album by most artist's standards, but it is a notch below what we've come to expect from Mr. Wonder.  There some great songs including &quot;Skeletons&quot;, &quot;Dark 'n' Lovely&quot; and &quot;You Will Know&quot;.  &quot;Get Up&quot; is a duet with Michael Jackson and the beat of &quot;With Every Beat Of My Heart&quot; is built around a sample of an actual heartbeat.  Stevie Ray Vaughan also guests on the album.  The album didn't sell well and became his first since 1972's Music Of My Mind to not hit the top ten and not contain a top ten single.  That streak included nine top ten albums (two number ones) and fourteen top ten singles (seven number ones)."
1,"Not sure why it is not listed as such but wanted to confirm that this $6.99 Elektra release is HDCD Remastered and sounds fantastic.

0,"This is a case in point about what was wrong with the 80's, my least favorite decade musically. In the 70's, you could trust a union of musicians of this magnitude to produce scorching, jaw dropping prog rock.  But in the 80's it only amounted to overproduced, manufactured for mass  consumption, calculated FM corporate rock. There is nothing prog about  Asia. Anyone who thinks this is prog needs to listen to these musicians in  their better days of glory with UK, Yes, ELP,King Crimson. My opinion on  this one will never change with time. File with GTR under 80's bad idea  supergroups."
1,"A very strong effort from vetern song writer/performer Joni Mitchell.The collection starts with, in my opinion, the best track on the CD, ""My Secret Place"". The lyrics and musical track provide the listener with a scenic vision of ""the secret place"", one we all dream of and relate to. Add in Peter Gabriel as Joni's vocal partner and the track is complete.Track #3, ""Lakota"" has drummer Manu Katche taking charge. The beat, so hypnotic, makes it easy to become trapped in the story and fell like they are sitting at the camp fire listening.Track #5 features none other then Billy Idol playing the supporting role. Mitchell plays off Idol's cliche hjowls and sneers to make this song work wonderfully.Willie Nelson joins Joni for Track 6, ""Cool Water"". Yet another fantastic vocal collaberation.Track 9, ""The Reoccuring Dream"", allows Mitchell the opportunity to take issue with ""the decade of greed"". The song features several out takes from advertising spots as the backdrop to Mitchell's lyrics.The CD closes with a snappy track featuring legendary sax man, Wayne Shorter. Shorter's quick riffs add yet another demension to this very diverse and enjoyable recording."
1,"This is probably LL's most under-rated albums in his vast collection. With production duties again lying with Marley Marl with abit of help from QD3 and Bobcat the beats are at a very high standard. Although there are afew weak tracks such as ""Stand By Your Man"", ""A Little Somethin'"" and ""Soul Suvivor"" the majority of it is barn storming. As with all the LL albums the subject matter is pretty much rap ballads and battle raps galore over exceptional beats. Although lyrics-wise LL at times is abit mediocre in comparisin to his other albums, its still a great listen. The best tracks here out of the remaining 11 tracks in my opinion were ""How I'm Comin'"", ""Buckin' Em Down"", ""Pink Cookies In A...."", ""Funkadelic Relic"", ""No Frontin' Allowed"", ""Diggy Down"" and the finale ""Crossroads"", an anthem with a full orchestra, rainstorm sound effects and thunder. You've got to hear it to appreciate it. This is a brilliant addition to any LL collection, especially at such low prices for his past works. Cop it!!"
1,"Both of Stevie Wonder's previous two albums to this were one of the few in pop history that can truly be called musical masterpieces. From beginning to end they were highly consistant and original. But this was something different. Yes it was all those things too. But also it was an enormous labor of love,taking a than unbelievable 2 1/2 years to complete. With musicians such as Michael Sembello,Nathan Watts,Greg Phillinganes,Ronnie Foster and the late trumpet man Raymond Maldonado,along with a great many inspirational figures listed proudly in the album jacket this album spawned so much quality material that it sprawled a bit over the original double album lengh,including four songs that were originally included on a 45 inside the vinyl LP jacket. On this CD edition it's all in here in all it's glory. And it is glorious. The concept was the cycles of life,love and observation of the world and Wonder himself really put it all out here,no matter how long it took for the album to make it's appearance to the world. It was apparent that the lengh of time it took for this to come out was the result of how to the broad reaching subjects presented here accessible to most people. Also as previous musical ideas of Stevie's were being polished,arranged and combined into sleeker,more demanding sound ideas the end result was solid prood this was something worth waiting for.Because of the amount of material I'll use two seperate paragraphs to describe each disc. The album starts out with the excellent,optimistic gospel styled pop/soul of ""Loves In Need Of Love Today"" and as nice a tune as it is it's STILL one of the weaker songs here if you can imagine. On other songs such as ""Have A Talk With God"" and the amazing (and fondly remembered) ""Positive Paradise"". On these songs,the latter of which doesn't feature a drum track give a go at everything;hare krishna bells,atonal polyphonic synths (the Yahama CX-1 ""dream machine"" to be precise) and lyrical content dealing with facing ones inner conscience and living in a time as if it was in itself a whole world. They are seperate songs but are part of a similar idea taken together. ""Contusion"" brings the band together for an uptempo jazz-funk/rock fusion instrumental jam and,if I may say so one of the most melodic of that form. Interestingly aside from the romantic midtempo grooves of ""Knocks Me Off My Feet"" the two hits on this part are two of the most compelling. ""I Wish"" marries pensive nostalgia with this great,playful shuffling funk while ""Sir Duke"" captures the flavor of..perhaps how Cab Calloway or Mr.Ellington himself might've sounded had they been recording at this time. The wistful funk groove of ""Summer Soft"" and the ballad/hard funk hyrbrid of ""Ordinary Pain"" are presented here in medley form,the former song talking of seasonal changes as living entities and the latter Stevie talking with his mascochistic female counterpart (as sung by Shirley Brewer).On the second half we start out with ""Isn't She Lovely"",the bouncy celebration of birth and life that...yes has a well camouflaged goof in part of the harmonica solo. But Stevie's melodicism is so strong it totally disguises it from most people. ""Joy Inside My Tears"" and ""If It's Magic"",the latter featuring the late Detroit jazz harpist Dorothy Ashby both celebrate loves power to heal inner wounds married to two of his most dynamic arrangements in the form. ""Black Man"" is up to this point Stevie's most musically complex funk tune ever,a history lesson in song regarding the contributions of different people of different racial backrounds to American history with a likeminded musical array of different electronic synthesizer,early drum machine and vocorder effects that,to a degree predicts the electro funk movement of a few years from this point. He uses similar style in a more mambo soul style with ""I Am Singing"",where he sings the songs theme of musical as unifying force in Swahili,Spanish and English. It's in keeping with Stevie's concept of peoples differences being a cause for celebration. The midtempo jazz style soul of ""As"" is one of Stevie's most melodically complicated numbers,a personel favorite of mine and many and ""Another Star"" is a full band,uptempo latin funk celebration of love in all it's forms.""Saturn"",originally meant to refer to Stevie's home of Sagginaw is a dynamic midtempo ballad about the idea of an escape to ones private heaven whereas ""Ebony Eyes"",a jaunty and funky piano-soul tune celebrating a sort of school yard crush deals with a more worldly interest. On ""All Day Sucker"" Stevie again delivers a stuttering funk,with synths that sound a lot like turntable scratching in a proto hip-hop sense dealing with the preception of one as a sexual object. The instrumental ""Easy Goin' Evening"" is...well sort of a throwaway but again LOOK WHAT IT'S PART OF. It's sort of a cool down to this musicaly workout. From this point up to today Stevie Wonder's musical output slowed significantly-from an album a year to between five and even ten years sometimes between releases. And it's easy enough to see why. Here Stevie committed so many different lyrical,musical,meloldic and plain sound ideas onto his pallet that this could've actually served as his final album ever and he's still be a legend by the 80's. This album and many of these songs seperately have since become modern day standards. And even though MJ'sThrillerhad higher sales figures this album achieved it's success,unlike that one not by premotion but rather by how it's related so heavily the listener-appealing to how our differences in love,life and consciousness made us what we are as people. And honestly that's why I believe this will become a work of art and classic the more it ages with time."
1,"will be my automatic rating for anything stevie wonder does past,present and future..i love this album I got most of his collection you just buy it without looking at the reviews..who needs them ."
1,"So many artists in music from many different era's can only dream of a debut album as self defining as this turned out to be. It's hard to imagine that Barry White was a total unknown,merely a marginally successful producer before this album came out and afterward almost everyone knew his name. One of the reasons for such early recognition is simply that usually it takes at least two or three albums into ones career before an artist really developes a name for themselves. On this debut there was absolutely no tenative nature to the sound. As with Isaac Hayes five years earlier with his landmarkHot Buttered Soulthis set the pattern for the next few albums to come from White. Interestingly enough that is where the comparasin ends with Isaac really. White's style of cinematic soul doesn't possess the psychedelic and gusty soul flavors Hayes had been dealing with during his breakthrough period. There is a more Northern urban sophistication to the arrangements here that have a lot of Philly/Gamble & Huff flavors but nonetheless Barry White is still one of the funkiest people around. Even though this album is almost entirely made up of slower songs such as ""Bring Back My Love"",""I've Found Someone"" and the title song each of these songs possess this strong blacksploitation era slow funk groove where the rhythm section,the orchestra and backup singers all keep the dramatic progression forward from start to finish. Interesting thing is these songs were never intended for Barry himself. He wrote them for someone else and they were only designed for reference but when he heard himself singing these songs Barry realized he'd unknowingly established how he'd sound as a solo artist. These are extended romantic soul symphonies as only Barry could deliver them. The other two songs on this album give up the funk a lot more obviously. TheShaft-like wah wah's and the building arrangement of his version of ""Standing In The Shadows Of Love"" brings the Holland/Dozier/Holland original into a whole new era and more than does justice to the famous Four Tops hit by successfully updating it for the 70's funk era. The one song that could've easily made this album even if the album hadn't otherwise been that good was ""I'm Gonna Love You Just A Little More,Baby"". It's one the first songs even non fans have flash into mind when they think of Barry White and has been used in as many modern Hollywood movie sex scenes as ""Let's Get It On"". What's amazing about this song to me is the energy it builds up and what a constructivist arrangement is;the drums,keyboards and Barry's jazzy piano stylings all gradually worm their way into the song. So believe it or not it actually musically implies the act of sexual intercourse itself and actually that's quite an accomplishment. This album was issued on CD and went out of print later so happily Hip-O Select had it reissued on CD again now with bonus tracks. One is a brilliant instrumental take of the song I was just discussing retitled ""Just A Little More Baby"" with some multi tracked echoed backup vocals of Barry thrown in for effect. The other is a total instrumental of the title song,showing how musically inventive and elaborate Barry's music was even without the drama of the spoken word narrations and bass voiced vocals. It's a great honor to the late Barry White that this album is now available again so that current and future generations will have the opportunity to view him in his rightful musical rather than cultural context."
1,"Billy Joel's fifth album, ""The Stranger"" was a landmark album for the man known as ""The Piano Man"".  It established him as not only a critically acclaimed artist, but one that could be a major commercial selling one as well.  Top to bottom, ""The Stranger"" was as good an album as any in the 1970s.  The question would be whether or not Billy Joel could follow it up.  This question would soon be answered when Billy Joel's ""52th Street"" would be released.  Billy would use much of the formula that worked well on the ""The Stranger"" and produce a product that would be another legendary album.I look at Billy Joel's career as having three phases.  The first phase is what I call ""Old Billy Joel"".  This basically includes all of his material from ""Cold Spring Harbor"" through ""Turnstiles"".  These are perhaps the strongest days as the piano sound, but they also contain most of Joel's least heard material.  The next phase is what I call ""Middle Billy Joel"".  This was his most successful period and covers from ""The Stranger"" to ""Billy Joel Greatest Hits Volume 1 and 2"".  Joel would go through a transition during this phase - expanding his musical horizons and exploring different avenues.  The final phase is the ""Later Billy Joel"" phase - this covers ""The Bridge"" to ""River of Dreams"".  In this phase, Billy would start to incorporate some of his older styles of music while not abandoning his desire to continue to explore new avenues.  ""52th Street"" definitely is a Phase 2 album that continues Billy's desire to broaden things beyond just the piano.On ""The Stranger"" Billy Joel incorporated two main themes:  1) An ""Old New York"" style of music that can best be described as a street-sounding jazz sound;  2) A Melting Pot Theme - a mix of various cultural themes (Latin, Italian, Viennese, etc).  From a musical standpoint, Billy provided a balance to his trademark piano playing with guitars and horns.  In a lot of ways, ""52th Street"" continues these themes - without any loss of quality.  Like its predecessor , Billy's ""52th Street"" will also provide the same high quality lyrics for the songs.  The big difference I find between the two albums is that many of the songs on ""52th Street"" don't get the attention like the ones from ""The Stranger"" got - and that just isn't fair.Here is a review of each of the tracks:""Big Shot"": This is one of the better-known songs.  This has more of a guitar edge than a jazz sound, but it still has a ""New York"" sound to it.  There are some nice horns in it.  Billy provides almost an Italian-American/New York (""melting pot"")  sound when mid-way through the song he sings ""You had be a big shot, didn't you"" with a heavy accent.""Honesty"":  This is a very powerful song that builds up as it goes along.  This is more of a piano based song and can easily fit into it.  The one thing that gets overlooked is some of the powerful percussion later in the song - especially some of the crashing cymbals.  Lyrically, this song is as good as any Billy Joel song.""My Life"": This is a signature Billy Joel song.  Billy piano is the more dominant instrument, but there is some nice guitar work.  Many people forget this became the theme song for the TV show ""Bosom Buddies"".  Many people don't realize that one of the terrific background vocalists is none other than Chicago vocalist, Peter Cetera.""Zanzibar"": After the first three songs, most of the songs are forgotten about.  This song is in this category and is probably one of the best on this collection.  This song has a terrific ""Old New York"" flair to it.  There is is almost a piano bar feel to this song.  I love Billy Joel songs with ""characters"" (i.e. ""Piano Man"" and ""Anthony's Song"").  This song introduces us to two characters - Ali and Rose. It starts out as a fast paced song.  There is a beautiful soft interlude almost 3 minutes into the song with some horns, then the pace picks up again.""Stiletto"": This is also one of the best on this collection.  This is another overlooked song.  Once again - a definite ""New York"" feel to it.  It starts out with some nice horn work, then has some of Billy's best piano work.  There is also outstanding percussion in this song.  A Stiletto is some sort of a ""dagger"" and this song deals with backstabbing.  Terrific track.""Rosalinda's Eyes"": This song is a Latin influenced song - keeping with the ""Melting Pot Theme"".  References to ""Herald Square"" keep to the ""New York"" feel.  Ralph MacDonald who performed on ""Saturday Night Fever's ""Calypso Breakdown"" provides percussion.  Billy does a great job giving the vocals a Latin feel as well. Another great track.""Half a Mile Away"": This song has a great balance of piano and guitar as well as horns.  It has some terrific background vocals.  It definitely has an ""New York"" sound to it.  Ralph MacDonald also contributes percussion""Until the Night"": This is perhaps the most underrated of all the underrated songs.  It starts out with a retro sound - something Billy Joel has always been interested with.  This is one of Billy's first songs with a true late 1950s sound to it.  This is a sign of things to come (i.e. his 1983 ""An Innocent Man"" album).""52th Street"": The title along is New York sounding and the song lives up to this.  This is almost the perfect New York/Street sounding jazz song - perfect way to wrap up the collection.The liner notes include all of the lyrics as well as musician and production credits.  This is truly a magnificent collection.  If you like ""The Stranger"", this album is sure to equally satisfy - as well as provide some ""forgotten"" Billy Joel tunes.  Highly recommended."
1,"After reaping huge success , both commercial and critical, with &quot;The Beach Boys Today&quot;, leader and producer Brian Wilson set out to make an album even better than that. What he came up with has been called the greatest album of all time.1966's &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; was the least successful Beach Boys album up to that time, barely hitting the top 10 (it peaked at 10) and not going gold. So it's no small irony that it remains their best and popular album of all time. Under Wilson's guidance, the group became more experimental, moving out of their signature &quot;surf rock&quot; realm and writing songs that dealed with real - life issues such as maturity (&quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;), love (&quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)&quot;, &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot;), rejection (&quot;Here Today&quot;, &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot;, &quot;Caroline No&quot;), even death (the ethereal &quot;God Only Knows&quot;, with Carl Wilson's angel - like vocal and Brian's stunning production). The only song that seems even remotely like their earlier work is &quot;Sloop John B&quot;. But while this one has to do with the ocean they loved so much, it is more of a distress call than an ode to summer fun. The two instrumentals, &quot;Let's Go Away For Awhile&quot; and the title track are great. The former is carried on by the gentle, slightly mysterious vibraphones and great strings, while the latter is a sidewinding instrumental workout. &quot;I Know There's An Answer&quot; is a crackerjack keyboard workout with a fierce chorus and scorching lyrics. The bonus track, another version of the song entitled &quot;Hang On To Your Ego&quot; is just the same song with just the title line changed.&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; now comes with a beautiful booklet filled with pictures and track information. Brian Wilson provides a wonderful inroduction, and the essay is beautifully written. verall, this is what I conisder the greatest album of all time. For me, to be a great album, the album has to really speak to you, and &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; speaks to me because, as I mentioned earlier, it talks about the issues in our lives. If you want an album, look no further than &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;."
1,"While this 1991 LP hardly needed remastering, the newly cleaned up sound and production is very welcome and makes an already great album sound better. &quot;She Drives Me Wild&quot;is a Teddy Riley masterpiece that makes broken glass, car horns and heavy percussion all sound insanely musical and funky,while &quot;Dangerous&quot;(the brilliant title track also produced by Riley) still slams as hard as it did a decade ago and Jackson's deep, spoken word delivery haunts you long after the track is over. Now is the perfect time for a new generation to discover the last truly great New Jack Swing LP of the 90's."
1,"Jay-Z, Jigga, Jahova or whatever you call him he have what you're looking for.  The moment I got to track 3 ""I Know What Girls Like"" it has been well worth picking this up.  For a successful artist, ghostwriter and  business man, I was glad to hear ""Imaginary Player"".  This song he goes for the throat to all emcees/rappers that talk that bling, bling talk by questioning where's all that you say in your rhymes.  On this release you can finish listening to the previous release ""Who You Wit II"" with an extra verse.  In My Lifetime goes through his life and Jay's accomplishments.  ""You Must Love Me"" is probably the best song ever recorded by Jigga that no one pays attention to.  The ""Face Off"" featuring Sauce Money is a great collaboration how the both of them oppose all competitors, including women. As a great comparison of ""Rap Game/Crack Game"" in conclusion I'll tell you this...In My Lifetime, Vol.1 is dope!"
1,"just a first class &#34;classic&#34; album from E.J.  especially love, &#34;rocket man,&#34; &#34;salvation&#34;, &#34;mona lisa and mad hatters&#34;, &#34;honky cat&#34;.  for anyone who appreciates someone who writes with gifted melody like e.j.  you will not be dissatisfied."
1,"&quot;Fantasy&quot; was the Carole King album after &quot;Tapestry&quot; that most broke the mold.  Of course, the fact that in 1973 &quot;Tapestry&quot; was till high on the Billboard charts when this album came out.  The productions are more polished that before and the tone is more soulful than warm and cozy, which is rather surprising since Lou Alder is still the producer.  There is even a touch of the Latin with &quot;Corazon.&quot;  The two best tracks are &quot;You've Been Around Too Long,&quot; which has nice guitar work by David T. Walker, and &quot;Believe in Humanity,&quot; which is as overt of a message song as King ever wrote or recorded.  Ultimately, because this is the King album least like &quot;Tapestry,&quot; it is my second favorite because the comparison is no longer inevitable (and therefore not automatically fatal)."
1,"Many of us are very familiar with ABBA's songs because we have heard them often over the years. Personally, I knew of them from a distance and never researched them until recently. Living in Germany placed me in the thick of the ABBA Fan Club as they are revered here in Europe. There are enough ABBA fans here to pack any venue where they would perform, believe that. Already familiar with tracks such as ""Dancing Queen"", ""Take A Chance On Me"" and ""Mamma Mia"", I can now associate ever so closely with their string of hits. As a DJ, it's imperative to have a worthy compilation such as this on hand at all times. Best believe if you are doing an old school set, an ABBA fan will reveal himself to you. More importantly, this music is nostalgic and full of great, feel good vibes. For that reason alone ABBA Gold is worth having in your collection. Maybe you already do or maybe, like me, you already loved them and didn't even know it.EnjoyDJ Come of Age"
1,Really enjoyed listening to this CD. I purchased because of a MP3 sale for $2.99. I only knew that I knew 1 song from Mr. Withers but after listening I was surprised that I actually knew 6 of the songs on the album. A real deal!!
1,another early classic years.... &#34;winner&#34; from e.j.  the gifted melodies of e.j. and lyrics by Bernie taupin make this another must have e.j. album.
1,"'Hotter Than July'...The 1980 album by Stevie Wonder,was a shockingly swift release.Released less than a year after his 1979 double soundtrack album,'Stevie Wonder's Journey Through The Secret Life Of Plants'a souvenir to a movie film that most audiences never had a chance to see,was panned,criticized and scorned by Motown and Wonder's fan base.When Wonder turned in the 'Secret Life Of Plants'tapes to Motown,they said to Wonder,'What the hell is going on here?'The music from the 'Plants' album confused and alienated Wonder's audiences.Stevie's response was the most becoming gesture of a consumate musical genius:he cut years off of his habitually lengthy gestation period of years in between albums and unleashed the powerful 1980 album,'Hotter Than July'/Wonder invites special musical guests greats such as the beautiful Angela Winbush,Betty Wright,The O'Jays,Michael Jackson and a few members of the Gap Band appear as background vocalists on the album.'Did I Hear You Say You Love Me'the album's opening cut is a funk r&b; rock workout.It is the only funk track in Wonder's career that starts quietly,then explodes into a funk explosion with Wonder's high energy vocals.The track's title questions a lady in the song who may have love for a man she wants to be with.The track has lyrics detailing physical desire:'I've been standing on the outside/Trying to get on the inside'...The track is a non stop funkfest with strong backing'I Love You' vocals.'All I Do' a track whose origins date back to 1966 was co-written by Stevie with Clarence Paul(Wonder's mentor of the 1960s)and Morris Broadnax.Stevie Wonder was a 15 or 16 year old teen in 1966 when this track was written.The very beautiful Tammi Terrell sang on the original 1966 session version of the track with her beautiful warm vocals.One can only imagine the beauty of Tammi and Stevie working together in the Detroit Motown Hitsville Studios during the era of the mid sixties.Tammi's original version of 'All I Do'(Is Think About You)is included in the 2002 double CD compilation,'A Cellarful Of Motown!'(A collection of rare unreleased Motown tracks recorded by Motown artists of the 1960s.)The song is also on Tammi's recently released double CD of solo material.Wonder recorded an updated lovefunk version of 'All I Do'14 years later on his 1980 album 'Hotter Than July'/Stevie glossed the track over with his usual great musicianship and classic vocals with raved up passionate adult intimacy about a sensual lady of his dreams.For good measure,I recorded Tammi's original 1966 version alongside Wonder's 1980 remake of the song on a cassette tape from the eras that they were recorded in:The 1960s&1980s.A beauty of a song with lyrics detailing desire and love from the heart:'You've made my soul a burning fire/you're getting to be my one desire/you're getting to be all that matters to me/and let me tell you girl/I hope and pray each day I live/a little more love I'll have to give/a little more love that's devoted and true/'cause all I do is think about you...'Rocket Love'is a soulful beautiful out of space ballad about betrayal from a woman.The song's lyrics details the fraud of love:'The passion burning in your heart/would make hell's fire seem like a spark,where did it go?/just why that you would overnight/turn love to stone as cold as ice,I'll never know/but you took me riding in your rocket gave me a star/but at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me down to this cold,cold world.Stevie's summary of love is that it can be a heart of gold,but it can also be very cold to the heart as well.'I Ain't Gonna Stand For It'(along with previous Wonder classics such as 'Happier Than The Morning Sun'/'Big Brother'/'Too Shy To Say' and 'Game Called Love' which was written for The Originals in 1974,have shades of c&w; elements)finds Wonder traveling musically into country&western; territory.Unlike the previous songs that were listed,'I Ain't Gonna Stand For It'is the first song of the bunch that Wonder fine tunes and transforms his classic vocals into the 'twang drawl' of country&western.The; song centers around a funny 'hillbilly affair'about another man rubbin' on his woman(his good luck charm.)(This track brings back memories of my dad.My dad used to love to sing that line in the song:oh,oh,oh,oh,my,my,my,my,my,my...)'As If You Read My Mind'is one of my favorite tracks on this album.It is this album's hidden gem.The song's message is simple in being highly in love and a toast to love's simple pleasures.Wonder's ex,the beautiful Syreeta Wright provided sweet backing vocals.Stevie's piano playing is upfront in this mid tempo fast paced track and Wonder's classic harmonica solo.'Master Blaster(Jammin')'the album's lead off single was Wonder's funk political reggae tribute to the legendary Bob Marley.The track's Black Political Message was the theme of the times in the early dawn of the new decade of the 1980s as Zimbabwe won it's independence.The former British colony of Southern Rhodesia then flashed into the independence of Zimbabwe in the spring of 1980 when Zimbabwe(under the rule of Robert Mugabe)won it's war of liberation against the British.Wonder was highly aware of Zimbabwe's winning it's independence.In a key verse of 'Master Blaster(Jammin')'Wonder addresses Zimbabwe's freedom for justice:'Peace has come to Zimbabwe/Third World's right on the one/Now's the time for celebration/Cause we've only just begun/You ask me am I happy,well as a matter of fact/I can say that I'm ecstatic/Cause we all just made a pact/We've agreed to get together/Joined as children in Jah/When you're moving in the positive/Your destination is the brightest star/Didn't you know that you/Would be jammin'until the break of dawn/We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin''Do Like You'is Wonder's funky dedication to his young son,Keita and the track is a nod to 'Isn't She Lovely' which was dedicated to his daughter Aisha(from the classic 1976 double album 'Songs In The Key Of Life')/The track opens with Keita's baby talk as his dad sings about his baby son entering a dance contest at school.The cut ends playfully with Aisha excitedly exclaims to her baby brother Keita,'Oooh you done broke momma's lamp!'with Keita responding back excitingly:'No I didn't!''Cash In Your Face'is the second song in Stevie Wonder's career where he addresses the master-slave relationship.Wonder first addressed this issue in 1971 from the classic album 'Where I'm Coming From'with the track 'I Wanna Talk To You'...'Cash In Your Face'is a racial rave up that details housing discrimination about a Blackman tryin' to achieve the american dream.No matter how much a Blackman achieves in his life,doors are still being slammed in his face.No where is this more evident in this angry cut as Wonder delivers this powerful piece of musical sound bite to the amerikkkan social order of society:'Well I thought the bill was passed that said you could not discriminate/but I know some excuse you'll find/I know your bottomline is:say you might have the cash/but you cannot cash in your face/we don't want your kind living in here...(While 'Happy Birthday' is Stevie's tribute to MLK,'Cash In Your Face'is indirectly tributed to MALCOLM X,the Black Nationalist Leader of the 1960s who preached that most of white amerikkka was against intergration.Wonder's 'Cash In Your Face' is a truth telling example detailing racism and discrimination.)'Lately'is a soulful but painful sad eyed tearful ballad about the premonition of love ending in heartbreak.Stevie is the lone musician on this track,playing just the piano and bass synthesizer.'Happy Birthday'is Wonder's tribute to Martin Luther King,Jr.A beautiful message song with Wonder on the drums,arp,bass melodian,synthesizers,keyboards.The track details Wonder's own vision dream of Dr.King's birthday becoming a national holiday a reality.Thru the power of Stevie's music and political activism from 1979-1981,Wonder's dream along with Dr.King's own dream for racial balance,a holiday was finally realized.The crystal glowing track backed with radiant background vocalists ending the album in upbeat mellow joy to the heart.My only gripe about this CD reissue of this classic legendary 1980 album is that Stevie and Motown omitted extensive musical treasures from this 2000 CD reissue.Inside the original album/lp release,there are additional lyrics for three songs with longer versions:'Did I Hear You Say You Love Me'(of which wonder released in 1984 as the b-side to the 12 inch single of 'Don't Drive Drunk'of which I own.'Did I Hear You Say You Love Me'is 8:40 long compared to the over 4 minute album version.'I Ain't Gonna Stand For It'also has additional lyrics and is a longer version than that of the album version.'As If You Read My Mind'also has additional lyrics and a longer version than the album cut.'Master Blaster(Jammin')'and 'Happy Birthday'are slightly longer 12 inch versions that were finally released 25 years later on Wonder's 2005 CD single 'Positivity'(from 'A Time 2 Love')/The question is why weren't these 12 inch versions of these songs included on the 'Hotter Than July'2000 CD reissue? By having these 12 inch remixes of the 5 songs mentioned would've certainly enhanced this 2000 CD reissue of the classic 1980 album 'Hotter Than July'/(Some Wonder fans have never heard the longer version of 'Did I Hear You Say You Love Me')It's going on 30 years and I've yet to hear the longer versions of 'I Ain't Gonna Stand For It'and 'As If You Read My Mind'"
1,"This album is exactly what the title implies, a collection of Mellencamp's singles recorded during his first decade.  For what it is the album is a decent enough collection.  You get no album cuts here, just the big hits and as the title implies there is nothing from any of his albums after 1988.  So, there is a lot missing here.  If you are just looking for the hits this is ok, but Mellencamp's work goes much deeper than this."
1,"38 years after 'Blood on the Tracks' was recorded in 1974, it still stands by common consent as the all-time masterpiece in a life-long career of excellence rarely equalled by any other performer. The songs are as poignant and powerful today as they were in those long-gone Nixon-Ford days when in 1975, this - the original 33rpm vinyl record - hit the streets to the delight of Dylan's millions of devotees and won new converts to his lyrical songwriting and powerful delivery. It's a great, great album, and it hasn't even aged.Much has been made of the marriage break-up of Dylan and Sara Lownds in 1974 as the background to the extraordinary writing on BOtT and it's even been stated that several of the songs are specifically about her. Dylan - and other people close to him - deny this. But for sure, something in 1974 caused him to give birth to his most poignant, poetic, extraordinary and enduring lyrical writing.The follow-up album 'Desire' contains a track called `Sara': they even considered re-marriage in the 1980s.Most fans would agree that Bob's career, though always interesting, contains a few best-forgotten moments. If you're of a later generation and don't know Dylan's work very well, this is a good place to start and might be a revelation: there's not a mediocre track on the album. BOtT is best listened to as a complete work of art from beginning to end.There's humour too, especially on `Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts' with a catchy, upbeat rhythm as backdrop to the unfolding narrative told through the eyes of Bob-the-storyteller, Bob-the-observer as he wryly describes the life-changing consequences a cleverly planned bank raid in a small town have for three characters as their lives are impacted by the gang-leader, the `Jack of Hearts' - an unlikely premise, but one which works. Economy of lyrical writing, witty and clever, it will likely bring a smile to your face every time you hear it and showcases Dylan's literate, clever observational storytelling to balance out the anger and heartache which accumulates through many of the other songs.`Rolling Stone' lists BOtT as number 16 in the 500 greatest albums ever in history, by any artist. You bet."
1,This album is one of Cohen's greatest achievements both lyrically and musically.  Featuring some of his best songs this great record only gets better with time and still holds the same if not more significance as it did when it was first released.
1,"This is the peak accomplishment of Isaac Hayes' career.  In 1971 he took 60s soul music and made it sleek, symphonic and refined, paving the way for so much of what became 70s soul, including, most obviously, Barry White's boudoir romps and some of the long instrumental forays of disco.  Was this a good thing?  Well, as one who generally prefers 60s soul to 70s, I say yes.  Soul needed to evolve, and Isaac Hayes' albums of 1969-1972, of which this is the best, came as a needed shock to the system.  But Isaac did it without compromising the raw emotion found in the 60s greats.  Here is a blow-by-blow:""Ike's Rap"" and ""Our Day Will Come"" (joined tracks).  ""Ike's Rap"" is a young man's tender words over the phone to a forbidden lover, telling her ""I got my greetings today"" and will soon be off fighting a distant war.  Gentle strings and the rat-a-tat of a military-style snare drum provide ominous backdrop.  He then dedicates ""the words of this song"" to his lover, and suddenly we are into ""Our Day Will Come"", a radical updating of the early 60s hit by Ruby and the Romantics.  Unlike Ruby's breezy optimism, Isaac presents it slowed way down, as a courageous affirmation of faith against terrible opposition.  When the orchestral arrangement swells in the climax, if your eyes are still dry, you haven't really been listening.  ""Our Day Will Come"" is my favorite track on the album.""The Look of Love"".  What is took Sergio Mendes two and half minutes to do, Isaac gets done in 11 - just long enough to.... well, to generate the wish that this be ""just the start of so many groovy nights like this"".  It ends with an ""ahhhhhhhhhh"" from Isaac that is sheer theater!  This is much closer in spirit to Dusty Springfield's version than Sergio's.""Ike's Mood"".  This an orchestral mood piece, but don't let that description fool you.  It starts with a light-funk bass line, staccato brass, and girls singing ""brr-ring it back"" (suggesting the ""lovin' feeling"" of the next song).  Then it morphs into a sweet melody played by oboe and flute, then gaining momentum until the whole orchestra throbs with it.  All class.""You've Lost that Lovin' Feeling"".  A good rendition, but at 12 minutes, maybe a tad too long.  To me, the least interesting track.""Running Out of Fools"".  Second best track on the album, and most faithful to the old 60s definition of soul.  A very effective slow-burn of revenge against a woman who had played Isaac for a fool, and years later actually calls him up.  The words are priceless.  ""Go ahead with all your sweet talkin', go ahead for all the good it can do - Have yourself a dime's worth of talkin', cause in 3 minutes I'm gonna hang right up on you.""  Isaac's singing is magnificent throughout the album, but this song was made for him.  He delivers all the shock, the tears, the anger, the sting and the manly pride that it calls for."
1,"Joan's voice couldnt fail during this period and this album contains many famous songs, Once i had a sweetheart, don't think twice its alright, etc. I believe Marianne Faithfull was very inspired by this album at the time. A must have!"
1,"Okay, I am a teenager now, that means I wasn't lucky enough to be alive when this was out (if I did, I probably would have liked bag pipe music or something).. anyways, what I was trying to say was that I probably don't appreciate everything about this album. Infact, it sounds real dated to me.  But I sure do enjoy it.  It massages my ears when I am listening to it right.  Even though I don't go crazy for it, I know this is one of those albums that is absolutely perfect and you are missing out on it.  the only thing I can say bad about this is that track ten gets a little slow in the beginning, but it gets unbearably good if you sit through it. but that isn't bad at all.  I am just to young to fully appreciate this.  so all you cool grownups and twenty somethings need to get this."
1,"This album was released during the new wave resurgence of 1980.  Disco was still king and the pop charts were infested by the likes of Styx, Foreigner &amp; Journey. Those were dark days indeed. This album was a welcome  respite from all that stuff and it made the warm summer of 1980 seem even  warmer. This album contains approximately 40 minutes of 3 part harmony,  melodies that could haunt you, ringing guitars and a back beat that would  make Dave Clark envious, plus you had to dance to it, there was no sitting  down while this record was on. It could wake the dead.  I rate this a  strong buy."
1,"As a strong supporter of the Moody Blues, i'll  buy most anything of their's, good and bad. Orig- inally i bought this release a year after it appeared and thought it rated a four, because i  didn't like songs 4-6, but  after hearing the re- mastering(?) here, it lost another star."
1,"I found James Brown fairly boring back in the day, and I must admit I still find him fairly boring. Back then though I couldn't have predicted that this kind of music would evolve into fusion or Steely Dan pop. It's probably a large exaggeration to say that James Brown and his musicians invented funk, but it may be reasonable to say that they were its chief--or most visible at least--exemplars.The instrumental parts are of much more interest than James Brown's quasi-parlando, repetitive vocals. The sound quality is generally better than I expected, and the instrumental parts are generally performed cleanly, but the horns are a bit off in ""Make it Funky"". There is another tune here in which it sounds as if a horn section crescendo is achieved artificially by riding the faders (on the mixing board)--a disagreeable effect.These must be some of the silliest lyrics ever written, and I find ""It's a Man's, Man's, Man's World"" especially amusingly ridiculous. ""Try Me"" is supposed to be James Brown's breakthrough tune, but it sounds to me like an utterly conventional, undistinguished fifties recording. At least three of these tracks are essentialy one piece with differing lyrical snippets."
1,"""Great Radio Controversy"" (1989) #18.Great hard rock music here, and a few nice peer ballads, there's plenty of meat and potatoes on this disc.  ""Hang Tough"" # 34 MSR, ""Heaven's Trail (No Way Out)"" #13 MSR, ""Lazy Days, Crazy Nights"", ""Did It For Money"", ""The Way It Is"" #55 hot 100 and #13 MSR, the ultimate classic ""Love Song"" #10 hot 100 and #7 MSR and ""Party's Over"".  Best Tesla album of theirs on the market.  Due for a re-master.  Out."
1,"After the twin triumphs of having ""The One"" peak in the US top ten and scoring a number one single with ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" fromThe Lion King,"" Elton was charging through the nineties on a renewed wave of success. In 1995, he released ""Made In England,"" and the first single, ""Believe."" There is a sense of deep seriousness about that song, and Elton delivers it with a great deal of emotional force. Paul Buckmaster's strings accent the song perfectly. It is one of his best anthems in a long career and is the highlight of the album.There more than a few change-ups on ""Made In England."" After several albums with Chris Thomas, new producer Greg Penny (former Elton cohort dating back to mixing ""Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy"") lightened up the sound to a point where it came closer to classic Elton than anything prior to ""21 at 33."" Bernie Taupin's lyrics were sharper than usual, a fact underscored by their terse single-word titles. And as they did on ""The One's"" ""The Last Song,"" they took on a more serious topic in the lovely ""Belfast.""It is a more jovial Elton that belts out the title track, which lives up to the line ""here's my middle finger."" A brief biography of Elton's childhood, it would have fit nicely on both ""Captain Fantastic"" or the recent ""The Captain and the Kid."" Along with the less interesting ""Pain,"" it's the most upbeat song on the CD.My personal favorite song on the album is ""Blessed."" With a lyric to an unborn child, it conveys all the love you can muster, cliches and all, for a baby to come. Bookending the album from the anthemish ""Believe"" (""Without love, I wouldn't believe in anything that lives and breathes"") to the swelling expectations of the love for a life to come, it brought the album to a perfect close for me. Even though his output had slowed considerably since the glory years, Elton and Bernie proved again that they were capable of delivering quality music on ""Made In England."""
1,"All the press oversaturation and rumours of bizarre behaviour really hurt Michael Jackson's public image, thus obscuring the fact that Bad, hokey cover and all, is a very strong album and another jewel in Jackson's  crown.Jackson contributes more songs to this album than ever before,  penning four out of the album's five record-breaking #1 singles:  &quot;I  Just Can't Stop Loving You&quot;, a duet with the wonderful Siedah Garrett  that is probably Jackson's last great ballad performance; &quot;Bad&quot;,  funky and weird, very catchy, with its signature &quot;How Now Brown  Cow&quot; rhythm; the gyrating &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;; and  &quot;Dirty Diana&quot;, a metal song with great production and a  cacophonous guitar performance by Steve Stevens.  The fifth chart-topper,  &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;, is an undeniable classic.  Taking Jackson's  save-the-world sentiment and translating it into poetry, strong melodies  and evocative imagery, songwriters Garrett and Glen Ballard created  Jackson's best &quot;We Are the World&quot;-type song, complete with an  appropriately booming gospel choir and dynamics to spare.The less  popular songs are equally good:  The Stevie Wonder duet &quot;Just Good  Friends&quot; is heavenly, &quot;Liberian Girl&quot; is breathy and  sensual, and &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; is Jackson at his most  hard-hitting, a killer groove with crisp beats, synth work, perfectly  placed sound effects, and Jackson's vocals going into manic mode.  The  lyrics verge on the nonsensical, but the energy is devastating and  intoxicating.  Even the CD bonus track &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; is  worthy, a funky keyboard riff opening the song which is Jackson's protest  for privacy, yet with enough of a sense of humour not to make it too  self-pitying.  And the music videos (available on the Moonwalker home video  as well as ) were groundbreaking -- &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; a cinematic  dance masterpiece with killer choreography and &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;  an animation breakthrough.Bad was the first English-language album I  ever bought (in 1988, at the height of its popularity).  Needless to say, I  have an unusual affection for it.  To be fair, Michael Jackson's music is  distinctly a product of the '70s and an emblem of the '80s, accounting for  its dated sound in the context of the '90s and in the first decade of the  21st Century.  On Bad, though, Jackson was still at the top of his game in  songcraft and charisma, making Bad an essential listen."
1,"Man, I really love the first two Europe albums. OK, I love all of Europe's albums, but Wings of Tomorrow and the 1983 self-titled debut hold a special place in my heart. Like most people, I discovered Europe when ""The Final Countdown"" hit the airwaves, but it was the budget-priced cassettes of the band's first albums that I played to the breaking point.Far from the super-polished melodic rock sound ofThe Final CountdownandOut of This World, Europe's self-titled debut album sounds more like a regionally displaced NWOBHM band than anything else. The band combined the charging riffs and vaguely sci-fi/fantasy lyrics of British power metal with elements of progressive rock and added a wild energy that only a band this young can provide. There are traces of the superstar melodic rock powerhouse the band would become, but at the time Europe was definitely a metal band. Songs like ""Seven Doors Hotel"" and ""Children of This Time"" wouldn't have been out of place on a Demon or Diamond Head album, and the rest of the album maintains that metal feel. Some of these songs may seem a bit cheesy in retrospect, but when you consider the language barrier and the band's obvious passion for the material, you have to give them credit.I wouldn't call Europe a must-have album, as I'm sure there are some casual fans who will be content with The Final Countdown or one of the band's many greatest hits compilations. It is however a must-have for all serious Europe fans, as well as being one of the decade's more underrated metal albums.Edition Notes: Wounded Bird reissued Europe (as well as 1984's Wings of Tomorrow) in 2009. Unlike most Wounded Bird reissues, the Europe albums actually have been remastered, and sound noticeably better than the original issues. It's not as impressive the average EMI remaster (their reissues of Saxon, MSG and Scorpions sound amazing), but I replaced my older version of and am quite pleased with the improved sound quality."
1,"Just giving Mtume props for the eternal 80's classic &quot;Juicy Fruit&quot;. Love that song with all my heart. I'm paying homage to them for that song.Note: the 5 stars is only for Juicy Fruit, not for the other songs."
0,"Finally Tupac Shakur has came down from cloud 9, only this has happened after Tupac Shakur has actually visited cloud 9 (Heaven).  This double LP sounds more like a compilation of 2Pac's early work, most tracks were made around the times of ""2Pacalypse Now"" and ""Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z..."", and it shows.  Although Tupac (as always) comes with it lyrically (for the most part), this album - like his old albums, suffers from poor production.  But this LP is still a solid buy, it is just below average overall as an LP.  Records like ""Do 4 Me"" and ""I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto (remix)"", alone are an overwhleming excuse to buy this album."
1,I can remember being younger and listening to Brian and never getting tired of it.  I'm still not.  His self-titled debut is not his best but it established him as a not just a great voice but a great writer.  The teary  and dreary &quot;One Last Cry&quot; and the very fun &quot;I can't go for  That&quot; aren't even the best songs on the album but they are still  awesome but if you are a huge Brian like me you need to listen to this one  first.
1,"I'll start off by saying that I've never _loved_ this albummusically. While it's better than 99% of all the contemporarypunk stuff that was coming out when it was issued, it's reallynot a musical challenger for the betterpost-punk/new-wave/whatever music that was soon to push punkaside (think Clash ""London Calling"", Elvis Costello's ""ThisYear's Model"", the best of the Buzzcocks, any of the Ramonesalbums [which were never really punk], etc.)That said, of its time and place, it was head of its class.The Vibrators were much more musical than their punkbrothers...The lyrics are fairly one dimensional (and sexobsessed), but did anyone care? Naw...it was the sound, rush andbounce...always the sound, rush and bounce. That's why thisalbum was a keeper in 1977 and is a keeper in 2002.If you were of the right age and ran in thecorrect circles in 1977, you will recall this album as theperfect soundtrack to many a mind-altered, pogofested party.And ... if doesn't sound exactly that way today. Put it onyour CD player, crack open a keg, and let the good timesroll! If you weren't old enough (or even around) in 1977, nowyou can understand what it was like.This album won't change your life. But it will surely makeyou smile.David"
1,"Let's not forget, among the accolades for her songs, that Joni Mitchell really invented a new way to play the guitar with her use of exotic tunings and her signature playing style.  Others have rightly praised the music and the poetry, but ""Night Ride Home"" is an also amazing guitar album.  With her guitar is mixed right out front on NRH, you realize just what a singular musician she is.In fact, the musicianship throughout is top notch.  Let's face it: Joni never plays with slouches, and NRH is no exception, with Larry Klein, Wayne Shorter and Alex Acuna pitching in.  Joni has always made great use of good bass players, and Klein's playing syncs with her music almost (just almost!) as well as Jaco's did.Joni also made albums that were sonic wonders, wonderfully recorded and engineered, and here again NRH is a delight.  Her restrained, tasteful use of synths reminds me somewhat of Daniel Lanois with that spacious, shimmering sound.  Her use of her voice, layered many times, as a background ""instrument"" continues to amaze me after 30+ years.  She truly towers over the landscape.  If you like Joni but don't have ""Night Ride Home"", you're missing out."
1,"This is Heart's third album (although many consider it to be their second).  It also might be their third best album.  Nothing can touch their monster debut album, Dreamboat Annie.  And their fourth album, Dog and Butterfly is slightly better than this one.  This album is certainly better than anything they have done after the seventies.This is an album from 1978, so it is just at 40 minutes long.  The sound quality is excellent.  CBS records has always done a wonderful job of putting old records on CD.  (Other record companies have done a horrible job of convertion old records to CD).The ""professional"" reviewer of this record is very far off base.  He writes that this CD is not very accessible.  That is ridiculous, as is all of his other commments.  There were 4 hit singles released from this album. How could that be inaccessible?  This reviewer is obviously a fan of juvenile hard rock and does not like softer or more artistic music.The two best songs on this CD are the accoustic ballad Cry to Me and the rocker Love Alive.  Heart is at its best when it mixes folk music with hard rock.  But there really isn't a bad track on this album.  At the same time there is really no monster track either.This is really Heart's third album.  After Heart released it's first album, Dreamboat Annie, it got into a contract dispute with its record company at that time, Mushroom Records.  Heart's second album, Magazine, was released, and then quickly pulled back.  You could still buy Magazine in Canada.  After Little Queen was released, Magazine finally got an official release in 1978.  But, my Canadian copy of Magazine has a copyright date of 1977."
1,"I have a lot of Brazilian music and love it.But I just got this one and find a subtlety in both the music and Regina's singing that is stunning.Jobim wrote all these songs.He sings very little on it, but his vocal style paved the way for Veloso and others.His composing though even surpasses his sensitive singing however and they fit each other like a glove.But Elis's vocals are what makes these songs IMO.There is so much variety from track to track and Elis's interpretations ingeniously vary.This is not just your straight Bossa Nova.It is profound and musically goes where very little music goes."

1,"Brian Wilson once said of this album he wanted to write songs on ""more than one level"". And since the term ""classic album"" is often overdone and often used without care,Brian's own terms seem to define this album very much. And there are very few full lengh albums over the years that I can say exist on more than one level. The works of Marvin Gaye,Stevie Wonder and The Beatles come to mind. This is one of those records I can put on with absolutely no urge to skip over any songs. The key to the entire success of this album was arrangement. Inspired by the vocal harmonies of pop and doo-wop groups along with the wall of sound production of Phil Spector Wilson created this,which basically amounts to his debut solo album co-staring The Beach Boys on vocals and harmonizes. Aside from that Carl,Dennis,Mike and Al had precious little to do with the music on this album. That's where the name comes from. These were,in fact Brian's ""pet sounds"". Based on musical influences that impacted on him personally.This album is home to some truly wonderful songs. Much heard and well known hits such as ""Would'nt It Be Nice"" and ""God Only Knows"" being among them. And interestingly enough if those songs excite and amaze you,than the rest of this album will be right up your alley. Much as The BeatlesSgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Bandwas supposed to be (but which even John Lennon admitted it actually wasn't) this album is completely musically and thematically unified. This is not the work of an adolescent celebrating California surf culture. This is the work of a reflective and yearning 20 something who'd by this point already experienced physical abuse,mental illness and was now married with a baby on the way. Speaking for a generation obsessed with the eternal youth,this sets the record straight on that. On ""I Know There's An Answer"",""Caroline No"",""Here Today"" and beautifully chorded pieces such as ""I Just Wasn't Made For These Times"",""Don't Talk"" and ""That's Not Me"" there's this prevailing sense that the singer-songwriter who once mused about the delights of being ""in my room"" now saw the music world as forcing him to pay a big price for non conformity.Musically? Well on this you here an album that goes for redefining what rock and roll was. Rather than having a lot of distorted guitars in the mix,playing three noisy chords you have elaborate organ/piano/horn/rhythm based songs that are more about melody,harmonic and chordal invention that making noise and ""rocking out"". On the instrumental title track for example you realize this album has a lot more in common with types of Northern soul recordings from Dusty Springfield or Georgie Fame for example. It's not by any means a guitar rock album. Bands such as the High Llama's would later make music very much based on this sound. But it definitely extends off the Beach Boys surf sound into something that comes very directly from Brian Wilson's soul. He would in fact suffer something of an emotional breakdown whilst attempting to outdo himself with the follow up album to this. That also mixed with the fact the blood and sweat perfectionism Brian put into this product wasn't fully appreciated by every member of the Beach Boys. But that's another story."
1,"1982 compilation released in Japan around 1987 missed my favorite Dan Fogelberg song ""Language of Love"". So I searched the original album the song is included and finally got one. The album relased in 1984 includes two hit songs Language of Love which went to #13 and Believe in Me which went to #48. In this album Dan Fogelberg tried to modernize his sound to fit mid 80s trend when Michael Jackson and Madonna dominated the charts. Language of Love featuring crunching guitar solo in that regard was successful. ""Gone Too Far"" is also a fine rock track. But to me ballads or country-flavor tracks such as Believe In Me, or Sweet Magnolia remniscent of his hit song Same Auld Lang Syne impress me more.Verdict: Nice try for rock approachRating: 91 out of 100Recommended for: Late 70s to early 80s pop rock fans, country rock fans who love the Eagles, Jackson Browne and Willie Nelson."
1,"Rage Against the Machine were definitely one of the best bands from the 1990s, and their debut remains their strongest effort. When RATM made it big in the early 90s, they were a breath of fresh air. They borrowed sounds and styles from other bands, like the MC5 and Led Zeppelin, but were also distinctly groundbreaking and original.First and foremost, they were just such a killer band. Drummer Brad Wilk and bass player Timmy G were an exciting and dynamic rhythm section. Guitarist Tom Morello came up with some of rock's best riffs and solos in years. Singer Zack De La Rocha singing/rapping was intense and urgent, and his lyrics were intelligent and insightful, yet never simplistic or pretentious. The lyrics will make you think, will make you question your life and your values, and societal values and norms. The band sounds raw and intense, yet the production is clean and crisp, so it's easily assessable.Rage Against the Machine is band that should appeal to all different types of people. There's definitely an element of rap/hip-hop, punk, as well as classic rock. This album never lets up. From the opening ""Bombtrack"" to the closing ""Freedom,"" every song is intense, and has an infectious groove and catchy riff. It's really impossible to choose any standout, because really the entire CD is quite excellent.Rage Against the Machine's other two albums ""Evil Empire,"" ""The Battle For Los Angeles,"" and the cover album ""Renagades"" are also quite good, but I'd start off with the classic debut. Easily their best album and one of the decade's best CDs."

1,"It doesn't get much better than this. I am still making my way through all of his CDs but there is no doubt at all that this is a statement and one that is hard to top. Suzanne, Winter Lady, Marianne, etc. and a great bonus cut in Storeroom to boot. The remastering is fabulous. I wouldn't even think twice about picking this up. It's that good."
1,"After making the tragic error of listening to some of the ""great"" music from my high school and college days, and scratching my head wondering how I could have actually liked that crap, it was with enormous trepidation that I approached Copperhead Road. I was so relieved and excited to hear it again and find that it sounded better than it did back then. I wish Nashville had been listening back then instead of manufacturing bands to sing generic lyrics geared to appeal to people not quite bright enough to realize that Larry the Cable Guy is making fun of them.Anyway, back when I first listened to this in high school I couldn't realize what agreat song writer and all around talent Steve Earle really was back then and is today. ""Wow"" is all I can say, and damn am I glad I took the chance to listen to this one again. It's nice to know I had a little good taste in music way back then, and it's good to know that Steve is still putting out great music. Bichen!"
1,"Two takes of the title track open this minor classic. Milt  &quot;Bags&quot; Jackson on vibes, Thelonious Monk on piano, and bop  pioneers bassist Percy Heath and drummer Kenny Clarke join Miles' cool  toned trumpet to give both takes definative treatments. This is the  infamous session where Miles asked Monk to lay out, or not play behind, his  solos. Whatever the studio controversy may have been, the music certainly  did not suffer as everyone is in top form. The last five tracks come from a  session recorded six months earlier and features a pair of future legends  in Sonny Rollins' tenor and Horace Silver's piano. Heath's bass and  Clarke's drums remain as the rock solid rhythm section. This set features a  trio of Rollins' originals and one standard. Rollins is already displaying  the form that would make him the top young tenor through the late fifties.  He delivers masterful solos on his future standards &quot;Airegin&quot; and  &quot;Oleo&quot;, infusing a spark and a swing that picks up the pace from  the more laid back title cut. Silver displays his genius with a funky piano  solo on &quot;Oleo&quot;. Miles' tone is typical of this period. His  parched mute, and laid back middle register solos the very definition of  cool. This cd is another underrated gem from the period between &quot;Birth  of the Cool&quot;, and his break through quintet sessions with Coltrane,  Garland, Chambers, and Jones. This music is easily recommended to fans of  the &quot;Cool&quot; school of jazz as well as those of the artists  involved. Anyone who enjoys this cd is encouraged to check out its  companion set, &quot;Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants&quot; which  features more of the session with Monk and Bags."
1,"The famous lyrical rant of ""Feel the wrath of my bombast"" appears a couple of minutes into This Nation's Saving Grace and sums up the aesthetic and drive of this band. Frontman Mark E. Smith is quite the little ball of bile-spewing fury, and he spits out his disgust over the course of eleven grimy little numbers. The Fall was unlike a lot of their peers, though, and took the time to expand the UK punk sound in different ways than before. Other than the quick workouts of the early ""Mansion"" and ""Bombast,"" these songs are almost all four, five (even six) minutes long. Most sneering snots today can't find the proclivity for extended rants anymore (its all close-fisted hate and short blitzkriegs), but Smith makes it all seem almost artistic. The art notion is boosted further by the synth-driven ""L.A."" and the layered pastiche of recordings on ""Paint Work."" Other strong moments include the raucous pogo punk of ""Barmy,"" the somewhat gentler, Lust For Life-era Iggy Pop exercise in ""My New House,"" and the aforementioned stomper, ""Mansion."" Some debate rages over whether this is the most essential Fall album, but it's almost certainly one of the best places to start getting into them.Best cuts: ""Barmy,"" ""What You Need,"" ""L.A."" ""My New House,"" ""Bombast,"" ""I Am Damo Suzuki,"" ""Gut of the Quantifier"""
1,"Elton John-Honky Chateau ****By the release of Honky Chateau Elton John was still a young song bird just starving for stardom. He still meant the things he was singing about because he was actually feeling and going through them.His confused sexuality comes through in tracks like 'Amy' as does 'Honky Cat' a song about a soulful boy who in one way or another is fed up with being concidered a black poser. But the scary thing is tracks like the satire fueled 'I Think I'm Going To Kill Myself' while meant to be upbeat, funny, and trite was eerily biographical of Eltons own thoughts at the time. Then there is 'Mellow' which might just be the best none single on the album. But it is the poetic beauty of Taupin's lyrics on 'Mona Lisa's And Mad Hatters' mixed with Eltons georgious melody and all time best vocal that carry the album to classic status.While it might not be his best album ever, or ever his best from the time period, it might be his most personal even though he wrote none of the lyrics. Honky Chateau is a moment of beauty and despair for a true pop genius."

A song comes to mind, ""Leaving on a Jet Plane,"" whose powerful melody and insightful words have lingered in his consciousness since he heard his friends Peter, Paul, and Mary sing them. He ponders the chords, lets his own experience resonate to the words, and crafts a brand new bag of tricks--a temporary home for his neverending restlessness, something to fiddle with and while away the time, a masterpiece for millions to cherish on their own.""Leave-ing,"" from the chorus, provided the chord relationship for ""Tangled Up in Blue.""The melody has a native son in ""Buckets of Rain.""Between these bookends, a library of leavings: of love lost, missed, yearned for, investigated, denigrated, and given.Tribute albums don't come any better than this. There have been tribute songs, of course, like Lou Reed's ""Sweet Jane,"" a commentary on (and revision of) T. S. Eliot's 'The Waste Land.' But nothing that I know of in popular music on such a subtle, significant scale.Gut gemacht, meine Herrn!"
1,"You can play this album all the way through without skipping.  All songs are good.  Singles back in '82 were ""Who Can It Be Now?"", ""Down Under"" and ""Be Good Johnny"".  Solid, creative song writing.  ""Who Can It Be Now?"" has one of the most memorable Sax melodies EVER!  You can't go wrong here."
1,"As far as pop music is concerned, Depeche Mode is one of my favotites (The Pet Shop Boys is my other favorite).  Ever since Black Celebration (i am not a big fan of their earlier material) they have been creating great  songs with memorable music and good, at times very dark lyrics.  Although  many songs on this CD  have a sad tone, most  of them have positive themes  like hope,love, and gratitude.  Occasional touches of electronica are nice  too."
1,"And it was good.  I'd heard the hits from the album and was especially taken with She's out of my life.  I thought 'the kid has grown'.  Quincy Jones and Michael make a very safe yet bubbling over with potential album.  Michael was budding into quite the songwriter on through his untimely passing.  His understanding in mastering disco and turning it into pure funk and soul.  I like Thriller, but this one remains my favorite.  This is an evolutionary record and it should be in everyone's collection just because."
1,"After listening to Redman's first two album you will be amazed at how consistent and good Reggie Noble is. Could he bring that same effort into his third album. Yes, he creates another album that is so good that it sparks a difficult debate about which of his first three albums is the best. Really there is no correct answer as Redman establishes himself as one of the most consistent and best emcees ever in the history of hip-hop. His crazy, no nonsense, and hysterically funny lyrics continue to flow endlessly throughout his third album. Redman has the ability to do and say whatever he wants without sacrificing any credibility. The production on this album is outstanding as the majority of it is produced by Erick Sermon. Redman has become a really good producer as he produces eight songs on this album (many of the skits). This would not be a Redman album without surprises along the way. The skits again continue to be hilarious and the track listing lists 23 songs, while the CD contains 20 songs, so the listener gets to sort out which song is which as some skits appear after the song, rather than taking up a whole song as suggested on the back cover.The album starts off with ""Iz He 4 Real"" and ""Rock Da Spot"" both great P-Funk songs. The latter contains a nice Notorious B.I.G. sample. This is a reoccurring theme on the album as Erick Sermon uses outstanding samples. ""Pick It Up"" is a really funky song where Redman really shows off his lyrical ability:(""Your whole vocabulary's played out, admit itStill wack if it came out my mouth and I spit itYou remind me of school on a SundayNo class"").""Whateva Man"" is a solid song, featuring the outstanding Erick Sermon. ""Do What You Feel"" produced by Pras has a Wu-Tang vibe to it. The song features Method Man and this is the best song these two have made together next to ""How High"". ""Creepin'"" has a funky bass beat by Redman. ""It's Like That"" features K-Solo and his deep voice perfectly matches with the beat that has a bass line that hits hard. Like all Redman albums the third part in the ""Soopaman Luva"" series is on here. It is extremely funny as usual and shows Redman's superior creativity over other artists. ""Rollin'"" samples ""Microphone Fiend"" by Erik B. and Rakim and Redman uses it well as this song is crazy. ""Da Ill Out"" features the always entertaining Keith Murray and is a good way to end the album.Like all Redman albums no review can say enough about his albums. His lyrics are extremely underrated as he is very clever. He always has outstanding production with Erick Sermon behind the boards. This album will definitely satisfy all Redman fans and if you have not heard Redman before than this album is definitely worth getting as there is no one like him out there."
1,"that this was one of the best bands of the Disco Era.  And if it weren't for the fact that the mainstream public turned on the genre starting in 1980, HEATWAVE would have been better appreciated.  This is their best work.  A great mix of uptempo(&quot;Groove Line&quot;), midtempo(&quot;Mind Blowing Decisions&quot;) and slow jams(&quot;Happiness Togetherness&quot;) that still sound great today. Johnnie Wilder's voice is soothing and Rod Temperton had a feel for the &quot;groove,&quot; that made him one of the best R&amp;B writers/producers of the day.  A GREAT CD, and a must have for anyone who loves music."
1,"you gotta understand at the time this came out deathrow's reign was over and dre was gone and snoop did'nt stick arounbd too long either, this was released just so suge could cash in during incareration still not a bad project from rage herself she was very underrated and deserved more exposure than just 2 songs on early deathrow classics she was tight 4reel."
1,"A truly &quot;American&quot; album, very spiritual, ethereal, sort of like a thunder storm.  &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; has the dignity, insistence, and defiance of an unbroken man, &quot;Big Sky&quot; is one of the most dramatic songs I have ever heard; I have seen two hour movies with less emotion, drama, conviction, action, and passion than this song.Robertson's voice is a unique instrument.  I kind of like it, not only because it sounds unique, but because Robbie forces you to understand what he tells you, almost like a griot.Clearly one of the best debuts of the 1980's, and undeniable confirmation of Robbie Robertson's stature in music history."
1,"there're several tunes (tracks) deployed for radio station programswhen I start listening this CD, several tracks are pretty familiar, and this album recalls me another concept album: Skyedance (Fraser and Machlis)I likeSince You've been askedParis NoctuneI read a story about this album, that the last track IS NOT ""The Power of Gold"", it's piano tune, but it made a mistake, and it's too late to remake, and Dan decided to make a quickie, that's why the last track brings us a surpriseit's good concept album, with familiar sounds, and an ending surprise"
1,"I bought this on 8-track tape back when it came out in the mid 1970s, later got a copy on vinyl, and upgraded to a CD version in the 90s. Not sure what's going on with this latest version to register complaints about the sound quality and remastering, but my old copy sounds just fine. Then again, I'm not a picky audiophile, just a listener that appreciates good music. And it can be found in abundance on this stellar album. ""Souvenirs"" remains my favorite Fogelberg album. I like every track on here, and some are totally knock-out classics. Fogelberg was really at the top of his game for this album, surrounded by his posse of famous musician buddies, and delving into rock, folk, and country type arrangements. There is real artistry in these songs, and they have stood the test of time. He got a bit too mellow a decade or so later, at least for my tastes, but on ""Souvenirs"" he really showed his chops. Great album."
1,"another reviewer said this: &quot;I'd advise picking this one up sooner than either of the two indie releases.&quot; I assume he works for Geffen like whoever put Mutations in the 'essentials' list which I heavily disagree w/, anyhow he's not totally wrong as these here are all fine funky tunes, Corvette Bummer is Bek's vision of ultrabassy hiphop complete w/ whacked out rhymes: &quot;all my days I had mouldy bread... gonna leap like a worm, gonna take my shoes right off &amp; smell my socks&quot;. In a similar style is the version of Soul Suckin' Jerk which I thought was thouroughly full of grooves enough on Mellow Gold, but I'm not complaining about the existence of this as it goes even further w/ the funk [sorry I have to live up to this name]. Fume is a funny yet disturbing true story of a couple of kids who got in their car &amp; breathed in nitrous oxide &amp; died. Alcohol is one of several drinking odes he had around this time [the lovely Whisky Can Can off the K 7&quot;, Whiskeyclone/ Hotel City off MG, BEERCAN, Crystal Clear Beer off Stereopathetic, etc] &amp; is a nice hymanl sounding tune. Then of course is everyone's introduction to his world of wonder, Loser which is still brilliant, both in amusing verse &amp; creative multilayered sounds. &quot;In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey&quot;, yeah he was never 1 of the sheep..."
1,"I was hoping to get my socks knocked off like the other Sonic Fidelity discs I gave recently bought, but this one is not a huge improvement over the other pressings available, at least the ones I have heard. I am sure it is all because of the original recording, and we have not technically gotten to the point of being able to restore some. Or maybe it cost too much...This version has an underlying grit to it, to the point I thought that it was a bad cable or some other issue with my system so I changed the disc over to my other player, also HDCD capable, but the grit remained. Same results on another system.Like most of the SF discs I have heard, the bass is punchier, and the imaging is good, but with the Simon and Garfunkle, some of the instruments that were buried in the mix are now up front and their poor recording is evident.Leaves That are Green, cut 2, has a shaker or some sort of percussion instrument that sounds more like crackling plastic wrap. I don't remember ever hearing that before but it is not pleasant.I hope that someday these  great old albums can get to a point of full restoration, but this version definitely comes up short.I will continue to try the other Sonic Fidelity discs.I have Songs in the key of Life, Hell Bent for Leather, Walking Man, and all are fantastic discs."
1,"This album is the last of Stevie Wonder's 80's projects. This album was preceded by hit albums such as HOTTER THAN JULY,THE WOMAN IN RED movie soundtrack and IN SQUARE CIRCLE. YOU WILL KNOW would later appear on the 1996 compilation SONG REVIEW. GET IT,a duet with Michael Jackson is a reciprocation for Wonder collaborating with Jackson on JUST GOOD FRIENDS from Jackson's BAD album,released in 1987 as this album. All the other songs are good."
1,"There's a reason this is often called one of the best albums ever - it really IS one of the best albums ever.It's virtually flawless. The music, lyrics, and fantastic harmonious vocals make this an incredible listening experience.Mostly everyone knows the big hits on here like ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" and ""God Only Knows."" I held off on getting ""Pet Sounds"" for years because I already had those and a few of the other songs on other Beach Boys' compilations. BIG mistake on my part!One of the great things about ""Pet Sounds"" is hearing it in it's entirety. The songs flow together perfectly. Also, there are some great songs on here like ""That's Not Me"" and ""I Just Wasn't Made For These Times"" that weren't popular radio tunes and don't turn up on the countless Beach Boys ""best of"" compilations that are out there. The songs are totally worth hearing and there's no better place to get them than right here!Believe all the hype you've heard - ""Pet Sounds"" is a fantastic album. If you love great music (and who doesn't?) then you'll love this album."
1,"I have a special place in my heart for this quirky melding of synth-pop and sci-fi. To me, it ranks with the Alan Parsons Project's ""I Robot"" and Kraftwerk's ""Man Machine"" as the perfect mesh of human and android musicality. Given that the novelty status of The Buggles will forever be secured by ""Video Killed the Radio Star,"" that may come as a hard pill to digest. But there was much more to ""Living In The Plastic Age"" than that wonderful single.There was a fair amount of imagination involved with the making of this album. Horn and Downes obviously, in retrospect, had a lot more ambitions than making cotton candy new wave. If you listen to the lyrics, you'll find fear of the Reagen/Thatcher power mongering of the time (""Clean Clean""), wariness of technology isolating people from humanity (""I Love You Miss Robot""), and the title track's cynical look into a future of replaceable parts and governmental control.Unfortunately, the album did suffer from the fact that neither Horn nor Downes was much of a singer. While that lends a certain charm to a song like ""Elstree,"" it does suck the power out of ""Kid Dynamo,"" which really would have been more convincing if the vocal had more muscle. (In fact, I remember the shock of many of my friends when it was announced that Horn and Downes had been recruited for Yes...how the heck could the singer on this record possibly stand in Jon Anderson's space?) Regardless of the performance weaknesses, ""Living In The Plastic Age"" sounds better after the 20 plus years since its release than, say, A Flock Of Seagulls, and, as a document of Men Vs Technology, still stands strong.PS: I also recommend Bruce Wooley and The Camera Club's ""English Garden"" CD in addition to ""Living in The Plastic Age."" He was a founding member of the Buggles and cowrote some of their best songs, but broke off before they hit. His versions of ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" and ""Clean Clean"" are played as straight ahead power pop and can be found on his album."
1,This album is excellent. Michael Jackson's best. This is a must for any Michael Jackson fan. The 80's memories will come flooding back when you pop in this cd.
1,"Jay-Z is one of the most influencial artist out right now. Volume 1 proves my logic to be correct. Even though it did not recieve the commercial success as Vol. 2, nor did it have the dictoinary skill as Reasonable Doubt, it was one of the most well rounded cd's of 1997. Following the wake of Biggies death, Jay-Z released his thoughts on wax. Wheter it was personal ( U Must Love Me), party time (Always Be My Sunshine), or just releasing some built in anguish (Lucky Me) Jay-Z had a song for every situation. This is a must have for every cd collection."
1,"The mix sounds a little different for this edition -- which is something I haven't quite made up my mind about just yet -- but the real find here are the rare tracks found on the bonus disc, which range from brilliant (an early, more vemonous take of ""You Little Fool""; a completely altered ""Little Savage""), to weird-but-enlightening (""The Land of Give and Take""; rough, early run-throughs of ""Man Out of Time"").  All things considered, this is essential listening for the Costellophile and a great way to kill a few hours.  Or years."
1,"Traffic (self titled):  This album is very much in the same vein as their first album (Mr. Fantasy) although there is some growth in their selections and production.  Once again, there are a couple of big hits here (and a couple that should have been hits) but they have yet to make their best albums.  This album is very enjoyable and certainly worth owning but it is still a Four-star effort.  However, I would recommend that anyone interested in the group would be infinitely better off buying the original albums of Traffic instead of going for a `hits' CD because (as of 2011) the `hits' CDs for traffic have been very poorly organized and poorly produced.This CD is very good and it has the bonus tracks, which are nice to have, but they add little to the album itself.Several years ago there was a Gold disk released of this album (with no bonus tracks) by Mobile Fidelity and for those who Love this album, that CD might be worth seeking out."
1,"Thriller and Bad were back to back enormous hit albums that cemented Michael Jackson as the 80's undisputed king of pop. Both albums made his debut Off The Wall a thing of the past. Now, it's 1991 and Michael has entered a new decade. Dangerous was released by the end of the year and its first single Black Or White shot straight up to number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart. The song caused controvery with its spectacular video featuring Michael transforming into a panther and causing havoc in a vacant street with nonstop dancing.Keeping the controversy aside, Dangerous is a collection of above average songs. Remember The Time is a sweet R&B; ballad, Why You Wanna Trip On Me is one of Michael's earliest and best responses to the media, the album opener Jam, a viciously outstanding foot stomper, Heal The World reveals Michael's interest in changing the world to a better place and is one of his finest moments, Who Is It for its strange but wonderful music and a very catchy chorus, Give In To Me with some cool solo guitar by Slash and a song that just kills, Will You Be There with its sweet lyrics and a song that blows up into epic proportions, Keep The Faith with its feel-good vibe, Gone Too Soon an ode to an AIDS stricken deceased young friend, and the title track, the uptempo Dangerous and an awesome way to close up the album.Dangerous is Michael Jackson's last best effort. Since this 1991 multi-platinum selling album, Michael's albums declined in quality, falling in a trap of self repetition (attacks on the media), however, HIStory did have some golden moments as well, and Invincible just did not reach his old glory.RecommendedA"
1,"I love the intensity and strength in Barbra's voice, and the melodic way that Barry Gibb arranges music.  This is a beautiful combination, and this combination produced this wonderful set of music.A little R&amp;B/Soul enhanced Barbra's voice, and proved that she could sing anything, and make it sound like it's her own style.  She has a wonderful singing style, just as Barry has a wonderful gift for producind and arranging music- he always has.If you like good music, you'll like this one."
1,"I remember this album. the only track that really recall is (girls just wanna have fun). after maybe true colors.. I love cyn still today I got to see her here in san diego last year she really good, this old songs brought back the 80's for me, But i cannot stand how this album (shes so unusual) to madonna, Look face it, once Madonna broke out with like a virgin Cyn was done, So please do not compare theses two ladies work, it makes me sick.. Britney and christina ext... Look up to madonna they want to be her but will never have it, cyn pave no way they possibly dont recall cyn then.... thanks  but i really love cyndi luaper."
1,"This was Foxy's best album, the 2 single's &quot;I'll Be&quot; with Jay-Z & &quot;Get Me Home&quot; with Blackstreet were 2 classic songs. &quot;Ill Na Na&quot; a colloboration with Method Man was also a very good song because of the catchy hook. &quot;Fox Boogie&quot; a song with Kid Capri was very good and &quot;The Promise&quot; with Havoc of Mobb Deep was the album's hottest song."
1,"After establishing himself as a strong solo presense on12 Playthis album really does distance R.Kelly from any semblance of New Jack swing that remained on his earlier recordings. Much as with Mary J'sMy Lifethis album is part of a series of recordings that swing the genre of hip-hop/R&B; into more of a fluid groove that showcases a mixture of modern touches as live instruments. As with the ""sermon"" on the intro this is an album where R.Kelly really began to involve himself in the age old soul music tradition of blending the spiritual with the secular-consistantly pulling a very Al Green style lyric tag throughout this album at the drop of a hat by pleading to jesus and pleading for romance all at the same time. During this era this comes as something of a surprise as often enough the two concepts seemed to play out more seperately than together. Overall,from song to song there's a strong similarity to most of the cuts on this album. Except for some very shallow lyrics on ""You Remind Me Of Something"" this album largely focuses it's attention on on midtempo songs with light hip-hop beats. It worked dynamite in the day and usually,aside from occasions where it worked better as a single the songs on this album all kind of flow together as one statement. Some songs such as the intricately textured ""Religious Love"" feature an interesting mix of percussion and modern beats wheras ""Trade In My Life"" really bought the pretty full on gospel out of the box completely. Of course,to me the strongest cuts on the album are the full blown disco-funk arrangements of ""(You To Be) Be Happy) with Notorious B.I.G and that excellent ""Thank God It's Friday""-both of which showcase the type of sound that R would begin to explore to a far broader degree (and with a huge creative leap ahead in his musical career) in the albums to come. R Kelly is still not at the apex of his career with this album. There's still a bit of (mildly) dated hip-hop productions here and there but when this album cooks it char broils and is an excellent,if quickly executed beginning to the second phase of R.Kelly's musical career."
1,"To those who may have missed it when it was originally released, just imagine how thrilled we all were to have the sounds of revolution captured by THIS California soul family...I always did love SATFS' version of &quot;Somebody's Watching You&quot; and if you are not mesmerised or mind blown (as Sly himself is laughing about) by &quot;Sex Machine&quot; even now then you are amongst a small minority. Sounds of the revolution and the Summer of Love by Stewart and family...."
1,"Hard not to return to the ""Stay alive"" refrain of this wonderful band's only big U.S. hit without appreciating its sad irony.  Still, it's never too late to appreciate both that song and the rest of the album (and on from there) as a work of heartfelt melodic genius."
1,"Every track on this album is bangin' ...there is absolutely no filler.....Redman got the perfect beats to match his witty,clever rhymes....Get this album, its definately a hip hop classic"
1,"Carole King wrote or co-wrote many classic songs that defined several eras of rock n roll.  On Tapestry Carole proves that she is quite an adept performer.  Every song on this collection is a winner.  I Feel The Earth Move and So Far Away may be the radio favorites but Home Again is the real hidden gem.  Will You Still Love Me Tomorow is an alltimer.  Danny Korchmar makes some nice contributions on guitar and James Taylor contributes some good vocal harmonies.  For those who like the softer sounds of the seventies, pick this one up at once."
1,Every year you could count on a great album by the OP's and there would always be a woman on the cover...most of the time she we be good looking too!
1,"Lots of hammy photos of Streisand in revealing shorts decorates this slick, glossy package of pop numbers. Streisand gets down on mid-tempo rockers ""Don't Believe What You Read"" and ""Cabin Fever"", though she sounds even more comfortable on Billy Joel's bluesy ""New York State of Mind""(a so-so song enlivened by Streisand's meticulous delivery) and on the disco-lite 'I Found You Love""(which has some great lyrics). Features another one of those classic, lost Streisand performances in Rupert Holmes' ""Lullaby For Myself"", which looks at a single woman's life with such clarity(and sarcastic humor)that it is almost stunningly precise; Streisand's performance here, and on the amazing ""Love Comes From Unexpected Places"", ensures this CD with a long shelf life. A-"

1,"This is one of the best punk CDs I've heard, probably ever. NOFX's catchy tunes with their clever lyrics really show on this album. Their topics deviate a bit, especially if you've listened to thier other CDs, which have frequent references to their favorite topics, booze and lesbians. They range from being political (Perfect Government, Dying Degree) to party anthems (The Brews, Don't Call Me White) to their love lusts (Lori Myers) to some downright craziness (Jeff Wears Birkenstocks, Punk Guy &amp; Happy Guy). Every track is awesome. This is one of those few albums you can listen to as a whole from the first track to the last track without pressing the skip button. The best songs on here are The Brews, The Cause, Linoleum, and Don't Call Me White. If you've never heard a NOFX album, I suggest you check this out first, then get White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean, and Pump Up The Valuum, and the other NOFX albums."
1,"Jazz, R&B;, Rock, Soul, Funk, and Pop music had all existed before 1982, but when this album came out, it literally combined all the elements and paved the way for what music is today. From recordings to performances to worldwide sales and recognition, Jackson set the standards for it all. Hundreds of years from now, this will still be looked back on as quite possibly one of the finest albums ever recorded.While Quincy maintained his masterful touch on all the recordings, Jackson lent his to the timeless compositions of ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"", ""Beat It"", and ""Billie Jean"", songs that have literally become signature songs of the 1980s, and showed the world just how musical Michael could be. Aside from those recordings, master songwriter Rod Temperton (""Rock with You"", ""Off the Wall"", ""Always and Forever"") and R&B; soulman James Ingram contributed their own unique tracks, as well. From ""Thriller"" to ""P.Y.T."", every song here literally changed the course of music as a whole.While some have maintained that there are far better albums in music history's catalogue, I have yet to come across any with as much quality, energy, diversity, and versatility as this one. A masterpiece."
1,Good Album Boomin System and one of my favorite songs of all time Around the way girl is on this one I like it so go get it!!!
1,"Sunshine Superman was Donovan's best selling album in the sixties, not least because it included the single Sunshine Superman (For John And Paul), a huge hit both in America and the UK. It marked an important turning point in Donovan's career as he had changed managers, producers and record labels, and developed his sound with the addition of a band of musicians. He also had a brilliant new arranger in the person of John Cameron, whose work on Sunshine Superman was such an integral part of the record.As the booklet essay describes, these changes turned out to come at a cost due to complications at the British side of the business end, as the new arrangement had been negotiated in America and had contractual complications in the UK which led to huge delays in records coming out, if at all. This seemed especially perplexing in Britain as whereas in America there was a clear change of label from Hickory to Epic, in the UK he remained on Pye.Sunshine Superman (For John And Paul) had been recorded in December 1965, when it was ahead of its time, but things were moving so fast that by the time it was released the following summer it already sounded as if Donovan was trying to catch up with the times, especially since during the delay Pye had been damagingly releasing older unrepresentative material on singles, such as Josie and Remember The Alamo, and when the album was released that September it was in America only. Sunshine Superman was never released in the UK in its original form, and not at all until June 1967, months after Donovan's follow-up album had been released in America.If Donovan had been considered to be no more than a folk singer, this album burst out of the folk confines to dumbfound those preconceptions. The songs were based on Donovan's personal experiences and observations, and included Legend Of A Girl Child Linda, about Linda Lawrence; Bert's Blues, concerning a love triangle involving Donovan, the singer Beverley and Bert Jansch; The Trip, about a jazz and folk-rock club in Hollywood where Donovan had been playing; Fat Angel, allegedly inspired by Cass Elliott of the Mamas and the Papas, and soon taken up in live performance by the Jefferson Airplane, who are name-checked in the lyric; and the brilliant Season Of The Witch, best known in the UK in its version by Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger and the Trinity. Most of these were recorded in Hollywood in Spring 1966 with a set of hip L.A. musicians including Shawn Phillips on sitar and Cyrus Faryar from the Modern Folk Quartet. They used an array of instruments including harpsichords, celestes and all manner of percussion, creating a palette far removed from the days of pure acoustic guitar and harmonica, and showcasing Donovan's development as a maturing songwriter, adapting and embracing change and experimentation.The British version of Sunshine Superman dropped three of the songs (Ferris Wheel, The Trip, Fat Angel) and substituted five fromMellow Yellow(The Observation, Writer In The Sun, Hampstead Incident, Sand And Foam, Young Girl Blues), which was also permanently absent from the UK release schedules, and so this CD probably marks the first time the original album has been for sale in the UK.Mono masters have been used throughout for the album, though among the bonus tracks is a longer stereo mix of Sunshine Superman (For John And Paul) that was prepared for the album Donovan's Greatest Hits in 1978 (available asDonovan - Greatest Hits & Morewith extra tracks). There are six other bonus tracks including a couple of out-takes, early versions of Superlungs My Supergirl and Museum (a song he gave to the aforementioned Beverley) and finally two October 1966 demos for songs on Mellow Yellow."

1,"Billy Joel is a gifted composer and musician. ""52nd Street"" shows Joel at the peak of the mountain in both ways.

1,"HERE IS THE NEWSEpic/Legacy has now given us this stellar re-mastered edition of FACE THE MUSIC, and it's a real treasure.  It's one of those documents that vividly illustrate why ELO leader Jeff Lynne is considered on of the leading lights in popular music history.The original 1975 classic by ELO is a bracing collection of some pretty hot tunes; on this re-mastered edition, these songs sound better than ever, and the graphics are wonderfully expanded, with a booklet full of rare photos and insightful commentary by Lynne and ELO historian Rob Caiger.THE SONGSHere is a song-by-song review...""Fire On High"" is the ultimate progressive rock instrumental...Jeff Lynne packs more drama and punch and verve into this 5:31 minutes than many composers acheive in a lifetime. (Drummer Bev Bevan more than lives up to his ""Basher"" moniker here, with deft, speedy, and powerful work on the skins.) The drama builds majestically until it all finally explodes into a searing acoustic guitar riff--a symphony of guitars that dive and soar like a downhill skier.""Waterfall"" is the definition of ""achingly gorgeous""--so pretty it almost hurts. The lyrics are sad, but cathartic, and the melodic vocal interplay is fantastic.  It's a fine example of ELO's ablity to wash a song in strings without it all becoming sappy or soupy.Then there's the decidedly funky ""Evil Woman,"" one of the giant, enduring hits of the decade...that pounding piano motif is instantly recognizable and the background ""hey hey hey's"" stick in your brain long after the song ends.One of ELO's better--but oft-forgotten--songs is ""Nightrider,"" a clever little tribute to Jeff Lynne's earliest days in rock and roll, and it moves at a nice gallop.  It acheived minor success as a single, and features some intriguing and engaging mood shifts, plus some fine vocal work from bassist Kelly Groucutt.Another track that is sometimes unjustifiably overlooked is the rollicking ""Poker,"" which is a dizzying duel between crunchy guitars and the swirling synths of Richard Tandy, and some amazingly Beatlesque harmonies.  Why this was never released as a single is beyond me, but it's a real corker.The band cools down for the massive hit ballad, ""Strange Magic,"" which is beautifully atmospheric and engaging with mysterious imagery and yet more patented Lynne melodic brilliance.The comedic country detour, ""Down Home Town,"" is no joke musically--well-played, shifting rhythms and moods, and a sing-along chorus that--while humorous--remains memorable.ELO always closes well, and ""One Summer Dream"" is no exception.  It wafts along like a river flowing into Autumn, with some lovely chord changes and vocals and Bevan's deft drumming.BONUS MATERIALIn this re-mastered edition, we get an interesting alternate take on the intro to ""Fire On High,"" plus the U.S. single edit of ""Strange Magic,"" and the beautiful instrumental mix of ""Waterfall.""  But the real attraction is a ""stripped down"" mix of ""Evil Woman,"" with a great vocal from Jeff and energetic playing from the band.Again, it should be noted that the restored and expanded graphics are topnotch and the liner notes are outstanding.  Hail to Rob Caiger, Lynn Hoskins, and all of those ELO fans/historians who helped make this project happen!  Well done!RECOMMENDATIONThere are days when this is my favorite ELO album.  And while I generally rate it barely behind A NEW WORLD RECORD or OUT OF THE BLUE, I still believe it is one of the best and most important album releases of the 1970s--by any artist.  It's not as ""tied together"" or cohesive as many of ELO's albums, but it is an outstanding collection of individual tunes.In short, there are no weak songs here--only great songs, greater songs, and greatest songs.  Somewhere on the radio right now, ""Evil Woman"" or ""Strange Magic"" is playing; and ""Fire On High"" remains the finest rock instrumental ever recorded by anyone.Don't miss this re-mastered edition!  If you already love ELO or have earlier editions of FACE THE MUSIC, you really owe it to yourself to hear the much-improved sound, check out the updated graphics, and enjoy it all over again.FACE THE MUSIC would qualify as a BEST OF collection for most bands. Pick it up and discover why!"
1,"I know,it's easy listening but is that matter!? I have no words to describe this perfect album! This album is magical. Live Like Horses is one of the best songs ever. The End Will Come is something new and different from other Elton's work and is just great. There is no weak song on this album. This is like the best kuschel rock album ever! If you like Mozart you will also like this.This is prove that captain is always captain!"
1,"this album is a classic!genius gza is one of the best wu members out of the whole clan the best songs on liquid swords are (4th chamber,liquid swords and swordsman) i highy recommend this album!"
1,"From the huge sounding orchestral intro to ""Where Did We Go Wrong"" Jean Paul ""Bluey"" Maunick and company serve ample notice to the listening audience that this is no ordinary soul album. Bluey writes real songs and his gift for crafting gorgeous melodies, funky, Latin-flavored rhythms and setting it all to some of the most lush arrangements is proof that someone still makes music with a true passion for the art form, popular music is all the better for his mere existence. While current black pop wallows in the mire of cartoonish male crooners, tired & silly hoochie-fied female performers (can you say GLORIFIED PROSTITUTION?) and black radio programmers play it so safely that they actually think the garbage of the past few years (are ya'll listening Jill, Alicia, Angie et. all?) is ""new soul""!What a travesty! Here to save the day are true music makers with actual talent, that play instruments and arrange huge, gorgeous pieces of soul paradise! ""100* And Rising"" was released almost 7 years ago, but virtually nothing has come out since then to rival it.  Every track here is flawless, the dance raver ""Everyday"" incorporates live, jaunty horns for a boundless, energetic feel, ""Too Far Gone"" is a REAL ballad sung by a man and woman with warm, accomplished voices that actually complement each other, not just two wannabees singing all over each other (hear that KeKe and Avant?) and the instrumental ""After The Fall"" has become a jazz classic that fairly drips with melodies and terrific band interplay, buliding from an understated guitar solo by Bluey to a great synth solo and trumpet figure that builds to a stunning crescendo, breathtaking!Picking any one or two tracks from this is impossible, but my current fave, the spicy, Latin jazz/funk of ""Barumba"" just brings tears to my eyes, you'll play this one over and over and over.If you don't own any Incognito, first of all, shame on you, secondly, stop what you're doing immediately and go buy ""100* And Rising"", it's money well spent. Besides, isn't it time you stepped up and heard some real music? The finer things in life aren't limited to wine, food and clothes, there's also Incognito!"
1,"Olivia Newton-John's career can neatly be encapsulated in a few separate phases: early pop/country hits (""I Honestly Love You,"" ""Have You Never Been Mellow""), a big splash in a cheesy movie (""Grease"") with the corresponding hits, the sexy pop hits that followed (""Physical"", ""A Little More Love"") followed by a gradual exit from the charts. (Sounds a lot like Sheena Easton - I suppose ""Miami Vice"" could substitute for ""Grease"").I could easily put together two or three CDs worth of chart hits from Newton-John, but Geffen Records didn't offer me the chance, so this one-CD mishmash, featuring virtually no liner notes whatsoever, will have to suffice. It's missing some pretty good songs (""Suddenly,"" ""Heart Attack"") and some not-so-great ones (""Soul Kiss,"" ""Tied Up""), but they bagged most of the good ones, including ""Twist of Fate,"" which had basically been unavailable to those who didn't think to buy the ""Two of a Kind"" soundtrack on CD. Four nondescript songs recorded for this CD are included as well. This covers virtually all of her career, and most fans will accept it as such.Late note: Universal's ""Magic - The Very Best of Olivia Newton-John"" now supercedes this set, as it includes all of these songs (save the four newly recorded tunes) and adds ""Let Me Be There,"" ""Heart Attack,"" ""Make a Move on Me,"" ""Xanadu,"" and ""Suddenly."""
1,"From 1986 to 1991, I listened to Top 40 radio CONSTANTLY. Paula Abdul's Forever Your Girl was one of the first CDs I ever purchased, and, listening to this album over a decade later, I am still surprised at how good it sounds. The music is slick dance-pop, but the grooves have a little bit of a funky R&amp;B edge to them, which gives the music extra oomph. There is even a contribution by Babyface on the excellent single &quot;Knocked Out&quot;, and this was back in 1988, long before Babyface was well-known in the pop community. Other standout hits from this album are &quot;Straight Up&quot;, &quot;Cold Hearted&quot;, &quot;Opposites Attract&quot;, &quot;The Way That You Love Me&quot;, and the title track. Quite a setlist of pop classics! Paula Abdul also had a certain amount of dignity that today's bubble gum pop queens do not. She appeared fully clothed in her videos, and her sound and style came across as cute and sexy without ever crossing the line to vulgarity. Today's dance-pop has a tendency to bombard the listener with bombast and over-production. However, on Paula's first album, she kept it pure, simple, and &quot;Straight Up&quot;! So, if you are looking for a fun, energetic pop CD that doesn't overdo anything, this album is the one! Great for its 80s nostalgia value, too!"
1,"I just recently got this cd and it is a very good cd.The songs are Wanna be startin something,Baby Be mine,The Girl is Mine,Thriller,Beat It,Billie Jean,Human Nature,Pretty Young thing,The LAdy In my life.The song I like most out of this cd is Pretty Young THing because I like the rhytm.I only gave this cd a 4 because it has a lot of songs that the History has on it.But If YOu are a Michael Jackson fan I reccomed you get this cd or youll miss out on something magical."
1,This album is one of the most wicked metal albums ever made. The Scorpions  were out to tear it up and they do it in spades on &quot;Blackout&quot; .  &quot;Dynomite&quot; rocks so hard that it feels like Godzilla is stomping  down your house until there's nothing left. &quot;China White&quot; comes  on like a modern day &quot;Kashmir&quot; in its groove yet it is completely  original in terms of lyric and melody. The band sings a dedication to their  fans on the raucaus and fun &quot;Can't Live Without You.&quot;  &quot;Blackout&quot; is a tidal wave of bonecrunching mindmelting metal  that ends with Klaus Meine producing a teutonic scream that would have made  Richard Wagner proud. &quot; When The Smoke Is Going Down&quot; is a  beautiful ballad that is melancholly in its melody yet powerful in its  spirit. This album also contains the fantastic &quot;No One Like You&quot;  which was The Scorpions first top ten hit. This is a great song with a  irresistable melody and a guitar solo that is devastating in its precision  and passion. What can i say except that this is The Scorpions tour de  force. Buy a copy and drive your neighbors crazy with this buffet of  crunchy metal. Cheers!
1,"This edition of Kool & the Gang excelled in the uptempo songs that crossed over to the Pop Charts, and this CD features everything you need to hear from this era. The group changed direction in 1979 when J.T.Taylor came on board for 'Ladies Night'. After that 1979 hit, Kool & the Gang seemed to always be on the charts, and the notable hits are here!I'd also recommend Kool & the Gang's 1969-1976 Funk Essentials CD (featuring 'Jungle Boogle', 'Open Sesame', 'Summer Madness',  and more from the 70s!). This way , you can have the entire Kool & the Gang story. They're much more than 'Ladies Night' & 'Celebration'..they are without question, some of the founding fathers of funk music!"
1,"After splitting up with Jim Messina. Kenny Loggins was asked to do an unusual chore write a song for A STAR IS BORN with Barbra Streisand. The song was ""I Believe in Love"" co-written with Alan and Marliyn Bergman and Loggins does his own cover here. While he seems to be emulating Barbra (whose then husband Jon Peters would produceCaddyshackhis first real outing into the world of movie music.The album was co-produced by Bob James who also wrote the title song which recently won acclaim when Ruben Studdard sang it on the season farewell of American Idol. The other tracks are somewhat too jazzy for Loggins, but he was of course exploring new territory."
0,"Dre means well with introducing new artists to the populace, but these ones try to hit it hard and not to present the wow to us...Dre does well with his songs."
1,"As many people know this was the last album the band would release untill Octive's release in 1978. Apparently there was alot of friction going on during the recording of this album but lucky for us the album still comes across very well indeed. Back in the days of lp's side one was one of my most played Moodies sides-Lost In A Lost World, New Horizons, For My Lady, and one of their biggest hits Isn't Life Strange. Side two starts off with the Justin/Graeme rocker You And Me which is nice as is the next tune The Land Of Make Believe. Mike Pinder's When You're A Free Man is great and raises the second side as does I'm Just A Singer In A Rock And Roll Band). This isn't quite up to the overall level of say Every Good Boy and the overall energy seems to be disappearing slightly. This really does feel in some ways like a last album. Interestingly enough this album and Days were played by astronauts on many space missions between the early 70's and the late 90's. Those cassette copies were given back to the band framed by Chuck Yeager at a special ceremony and the band then donated them to The Hard Rock Cafe in Hollywood."
1,"A Question of Balance has always been my favorite Moody Blues album.  I love the ""new"" more live-sounding instrumentation.  Of course, with the 2008 remastered version, the instruments are more clear and bright as well.  One reviewer talked about straining to hear the bass on the new remaster of AQOB, but I must disagree.  I think the bass is quite apparent, and I don't even have the rhythm ax of my stereo turned on, which would increase the bass.  Another reviewer discussed the notion of distortion.  Well, I don't hear it.  One thing about the new remasters is that you don't need to have the volume cranked up nearly as much to enjoy the music.  Anyway, as I've already mentioned in other reviews of the 2008 remasters, they are far superior to any previous release or remaster of the ""core 7"" Moody Blues!"
0,"Tried really really hard to like this but there are just way too many really bad songs here - it is really hard to listen to these 2 discs all the way through.  Over blown, pompous, self righteous tone of the songs is very tiresome and gets old quickly.  Most do not even have a decent melody and are full of cliched, sentimental lyrics and maudlin boring vanilla arrangements!  I cannot believe the positive reviews here -- masterpiece???  Magnum Opus???  How about Over Rated!!!  The singles are great, but the rest is pretty worthless really - get Very Best of instead.  Barely enough quality material for a single disc but probably not quite."
1,This has got to be his best collection.  Lots of memories listening to this one.  All good ones.  Great sound.
1,"Tapestry is one of those albums, like another 70's landmark, Whats Going On (see my review), Tapestry not only has stood the test of time, but it's truly a gem that is always fresh and new.Carole King made a name for herself as a songwriter, and a number of musical superstars owe her and them some for the great songs she has composed. On Tapestry Carole kept the songs for herself, and let her beautiful, unique voice interpret them.  Carole chose wisely here, and each song flows with a natural vibe.So Far Away, It's Too Late, You've Got A Friend, and Tapestry are my personal favorites, and in many ways these songs delt with the changes society was experiencing in the early 70's coupled with a yearning for comfort and security.  In particular, So Far Away delt with the mobile society we were becoming, and have continued to become.Where You Lead, and Will You Love Me Tomorrow were completly updated by Ms. King, and Way Over Yonder and the song she wrote for Aretha Franklin, Natural Women,  showed that her versatility was not limited to her songwriting.  As a bonus here we are treated to a live reading of Smackwater Jack, and a previously unreleased track, the haunting, Out In The Cold.Timeless and more!Ken"
1,"It is amazing that after over 20 years, &quot;Guilty&quot; is still Streisand's largest selling album.  Barry Gibb and his brothers have worked wonders with many female artists, but this is probably their best writing and production work (Grammy winners).  Garnering 5 singles with 2 going to #1, this is Barbra's essential &quot;pop&quot; album.  From the R&amp;B laden title track to the softly, sultry &quot;Run Wild&quot;, Streisand's voice is relished.  The Gibb's really know how to focus on Barbra's strengths.  The two duets are some of Barry Gibb's strongest vocals to date and all the songs are bouncy, pop masterpieces.  Finishing off nicely with the extravagant &quot;Make It Like A Memory&quot;, you'll just hit the 'play' button again.  Great album.  Great songs.  Great memories."
1,"This CD is fantastic,not only do you get Olivia's greatest hits,but 4 wonderfull new songs.I first heard &quot;I need  Love&quot; driving back from Florida.I thought this song was so different,about not having sex  untill you truely love someone,and also being worried about Aids.I really  believed this record was going to be a huge hit for Olivia.She was ready to  tour untill she discovered she had breast cancer.&quot;Deeper than a  river,&quot;was a hit in the Adult charts,and&quot; Not Gonna Be the  one,&quot;that sounds alot like the Bee Gee's, are fantastic new songs  also.This one CD has it all,from Olivia's begining when she was into  country music,to one of the greatest musicals of all  time,&quot;Grease,&quot;to Olivia's biggest hit,&quot;Physical,&quot; and  these four beutifull new songs.You have to get this CD if your a Olivia  Newton John fan."
1,"From the gorgeously drawn album cover, to the lush synthe-sizers to the songs themselves, this is one of the MOODY's bestsounding albums..and one of their most overlooked. PATRICK MORAZnever got the credit he deserved for his work with the M.B.s, hissynthesizers really gave them a new sound that really comple-mented and enhanced their music. JUSTIN HAYWARD, as usual, comesup with the album's best songs with BLUE WORLD and the almostfunny, but still very romantic love song IT'S COLD OUTSIDE OFYOUR HEART. JOHN LODGE does his ELO thing on SITTING AT THEWHEEL and RAY THOMAS's cosmic I AM is a bit too pretensious andtoo sixties-like( STAY AWAY FROM THAT LDS, RAY!), but the restof this is quite..well..NICE! Both GOING NOWHERE and SORRY endoff with some good jamming from the group and even the album'sweaker tracks are redeemed by the album's top notch productionand by MORAZ's keyboard playing.NICE!"
1,"I was very surprised to learn recently that Heartbreak Hotel only made it to No. 22 in the US and No. 44 in the UK at the time. Can You Feel it did better in the UK (No. 6.) but worse in the US (No. 77). Unbelievable! They deserved so much better! Maybe it had to do with the anti-disco backlash of the late '70s, early '80s, even though these songs are not really disco. However that anti-disco sentiment affected rhythm-driven black music in general.Whatever the reason was then, these songs are now classics and still a joy to listen to. Heartbreak Hotel (This Place Hotel) is often cited as a prelude to Billie Jean and given the dark, paranoid, menacing tone of it one can understand that. But also because it's a song that showcases Michael Jackson's brilliance as a composer. In the year 2012 I just cannot stop playing this song over and over again... Right now it's at the top of my favorite songs list.Can You Feel was written by Michael and Jackie Jackson and is a very inspiring anthem. If Heartbreak Hotel is a prelude to Billie Jean then this song is a prelude to all the songs that Michael later wrote about making the world a better place and uniting people instead of making war. But this one is an uptempo song, not a ballad. Its infectious and triumphant beat and horns were sampled numerous times since then, which alone shows that is a lot more worthy song than what its chart position showed and that it's a classic. The video, which was based on Michael's idea, was selected among MTV's best 100 videos of all times in 2001. It just shows how ahead of its time it was in 1980, when most videos were still very boring and non-creative.I also love Time Waits for No One with Michael's great vocals and Walk Right Now which makes you wanna dance."
1,"This is one of my all time favorites.  I sleep to this at times when I can't sleep.  It brings back many good memories of my growing up in the 60's.  Yes, I'm a boomer and this is just one fantastic CD."
1,these cd is awesome shaggs and j really make the juggalos and lettes pround on there first jokers card  i got all icp cds and dvds there the best band live i really mean that buy these cd its worth  every buck you spend on it
1,"this album is great!The songs are top notch,and the remaster sound great.Much more dynamics than the 1990 version which wasnt that bad anyway.If you like pink floyd get this.Great guitar and vocals and drums and writing.alot of space for everyone to show there talent.And this goes for the the one who mastered it!  Great job!im amazed that there is still people who care about dynamics and dont crank the volume."
0,"The only reason to buy this CD is for ""I've seen the saucers"" and ""Dont let the sun go down on me""....in my personal opinion...the only 2 songs worth listening to.....This album was a complete flop...compared to the epic GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD and everything that preceeded it.....I think the falling out between Elton and Bernie contributed to its failure......Elton is a great musician and performer but his song writing ability leaves alot to be desired."
1,"Billy Ocean.  If you call him the poor man's Michael Jackson, you should be smacked upside your head!  Despite &quot;Caribbean Queen&quot; having a keyboard part that sounds a little like &quot;Billy Jean&quot;, Billy manages to diversify to cutesy dance pop, funky R&amp;B to smothering slow jams.  Take the get-up anthems &quot;When The Going Gets Tough&quot; and &quot;Get Out of My Dreams&quot;, both fast paced grooving pop tunes.  With peppy sing along tunes like those, it s nearly a crime that he wasn't crowned the King of the era.  Then there are adult contemporary gems, which are sang sweetly and lightly like &quot;Suddenly&quot; and &quot;There ll Be Sad Songs&quot;.  Billy's funkiest track that hints of the islands is &quot;Love Zone&quot;.  &quot;Loverboy&quot; is a stomping rock beat dancer.  &quot;Tear Down These Walls&quot; is a good combo of a pop song in a slower more romantic way.  &quot;Mystery Lady&quot; is a romantic tribute.  Also, Billy gives us guests like the Fresh Prince  (now known as Will Smith) and Robert Lange (who produced heavy metal monsters AC/DC and Def Leppard before this and country queen wife Shania Twain after).  Then of course, there is &quot;Caribbean Queen&quot;, the blessing and the curse.It's kind of sad that the despite being known before the breakout hit &quot;Caribbean Queen&quot;, a funky fusion of dance pop and R&amp;B suavness, that none of those tracks are included on here.  Billy Ocean's &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; starts off with that unforgettable eighties jam (career wise, not by tracklisting) and touches on all 3 of his Jive albums, but nothing before or after that.  Look at the date on this disc.  1989.  Is that an omen?  Unfortunately, all of Billy's other stuff appear to be out of print or only available as costly imports. When you listen to this disc, you will fell something, whether it is joy or sorrow.  I almost second-guessed the man and thought the only songs I liked would the upbeat well-known radio staples.  I didn t even remember the adult contemporary staple ballads.  This album is essential 1980s!  I guess some people have a time period in which they do their most successful work (not a real revelation by any means).  But Billy Ocean wasn't just a part of the music scene during his run.  Billy owned it!  Here s To You, Mr. Ocean."
1,"I was at Michigan State when I picked up this album in the discount bin (don't ask) across the street at the local [store]. I bought it for [$] and I was blown away, I mean I was expecting a somewhat cheesy album to buy just for camp value but I was pleasantly surprised. The tracks especially ""Hypnotize"" were pretty good. I understand it's pretty hard to find this album now. I just checked out the discount bin, imagine that."
1,"Judas Priest's 9th studio album released in 1984. Defenders of the Faith is yet another great album.Many fans consider this album to be Priest last great album or the band's finest hour. It's not quite Priest's best (the title goes to Painkiller) but it's still excellent. In fact this is in my opinion the band's only great album from the 80's, everything else from this era (yep, including Steel and Vengeance) didn't cut. You may ask why. This is basically the album where Glenn and KK became real guitarists, unlike on the band's 3 previous efforts where the riffs were repeated over and the solos were mediocre, here it's not only the guitarist's best work but also some of the best dual-guitar attack I've ever heard, what also makes this the band's 2nd heaviest album (next to Painkiller).The album starts off with one of the best Priest album openers, 'Freewheel Burning', which is heavy, thrashy and has an excellent solo. 'Jawbreaker' is pretty good also. The 3rd song is my favorite song on the album, 'Rock Hard Ride Free', while is not that heavy and pretty slow everyone is phenomenal here. It's basically a song about a Harley rider, it has also the best riffing on the album. Then comes a fan favorite, if not somewhat overrated, 'The Sentinel' where Rob does a great job here. 'Love Bites' & 'Eat Me Alive' are groovy and catchy despite what Rob Halford is. Then comes the hit off the album 'Some Heads Are Gonna Roll' which has great chorus but maybe a bit repetitive. The last 3 tracks are 'Night Comes Down', 'Heavy Duty' and the title track, they are okay although I never really cared for them, still great way to close the album.It could have been better. Therefore I took a half star from the rating. First the production is not great, I don't know if the original version sounded better since I've only recently got this CD. Rob Halford while he did here a decent job on the vocals, this is his worst work and that doesn't say much when it's Halford, but sometimes he uses high-pitched vocals that sound raspy and this is somewhat annoying. The drums here are still mediocre. But despite these flaws it still worths the price.Favorite 3 songs:Rock Hard Ride FreeFreewheel BurningThe SentinelLong live Priest!!"
1,"As noted by a multitude of previous reviewers, this album was the last of the classic 7 from the Moodies from the period 1967 to 1972.  It was also, like the 6 preceding it, different from the others; ""Seventh Sojourn"" is the most middle-of-the-road rock album of the bunch.  Very little progressive rock, no real experimentation, just plain, solid rock.Clearly the Moodies had become better and better at orchestrating their style of music throughout the six classic years period.  By the time they reached this album, they were fully mature in a rock style all their own, and yet fitting with the times.Looking back, it is difficult to see how they went from ""Every Good Boy Deserves Favour"" to this album.  EGBDF was progressive rock with a fair amount of fantasy and science fiction.  Seventh Sojourn is very down to earth, reflecting a more mundane and earthly orientation.The synthesizer is a fully matured instrument in ""Seventh Sojourn.""  In the Moodies' previous albums the mellotron was used for novelty and to enhance the unusual nature of their albums.  In ""Seventh Sojourn"" the Chamberlain replaced the mellotron, and became part of the orchestration.  The use of the Chamberlain is sometimes so subtle that I find it difficult to know when the Chamberlain is being used.With all these differences, the change to a more earthly orientation, a middle-of-the-road rock sound, and a new instrument, with some groups you might worry that the album was so different that it is no longer true to the group; not correct in this case.  When you listen to the classic 7 in order from ""Days of Future Passed"" to ""Seventh Sojourn,"" there is a feel of evolution, and perhaps, a feel of balance.  Sometimes I become sad when I listen to this album because I knew the group would never be the same group again.  However, as we all know, the group has continued to evolve while trying hard to stay true to their roots.  The results continually amaze me.Of the classic 7, this album is the least cohesive in terms of a common theme, and yet there are themes.  As noted earlier, the principal theme is the orientation back in the world as we know it.  No dreams, no people from other planets helping us; merely a recognition that this is the place and time in which we live, and darn, while we wish it would be better, it's us that has to make it better, and we can only do so much.  What more of a theme do you need?This album is excellent.  The themes are excellent.  The Moodies for the first time came back to earth and said:  We aren't magic; we have to focus on the real world; we are just a rock and roll group, we are as lost as you are.  These thoughts were sobering for those people that somehow thought the Moodies were gurus for a new world order.  The weren't, and didn't want to be.  ""Seventh Sojourn"" is a reality check.Given all the positive comments about the album, which should be one of the best 100 rock albums of all time (and isn't, according to those narrow-minded people at VH1), it does have one flaw:  It is too short!  There are only 8 wonderful songs.  Two each from Mike Pinder, Justin Hayward, and John Lodge, one from Ray Thomas (""For My Lady,"" my favorite Ray Thomas song from any album), and one that was a collaboration between Graeme Edge and Justin Hayward.""Seventh Sojourn"" is the most polished of the classic 7, and would rank as one of the best Moodies albums by some people.  Of course, there are others that didn't care for the melancholia and mundane topics and got all bummed out and gave it a bad review, which just goes to show, you can't please everyone all the time.  I read one reviewer who hated ""Every Good Boy Deserves Favour"" and loved ""Seventh Soujourn.""  Another reviewer described EGBDF as being original and true to the group while ""Seventh Soujourn"" was too much pop and not the Moodies best work.  Who do you believe?  Listen for yourself.  When I'm in the right mood, this album is awesome.  Other times I need something uplifting, and I listen to another group completely.All good groups generate controversy.  The Moody Blues are no exception (which by definition should make them a good group).  They have always defined their own path in a unique way.  ""Seventh Sojourn"" closed the second chapter in the story of The Moody Blues, counting ""Go Now"" as the first chapter.  Enjoy this album for what it was and what it is:  a good album by a great group."
1,"This is the second album, yes, album, that I bought by Thin Lizzy, with the first being NIGHTLIFE. The local Rock station was playing ""Rosalie"" and ""Fighting My Way Back"" regularly and I enjoyed the guitar work and the emotional vocals of Phil Lynott. Other interesting songs that I enjoyed were ""For Those Who Love to Live"", ""Suicide"", and ""Wild One"". There isn't what I would call a bad track, but some songs just don't grab me like others. Starting with JAILBREAK, Thin Lizzy wouldn't even record a song I didn't like ever again. It's hard to say this is the band's roots, but it is their second shot with two guitarists and the third time would be the charm.After 3 albums and assorted singles with Decca/London Records, the original guitarist, Eric Bell, left Thin Lizzy and Lynott decided to replace him with 2 guitarists, Scott Gorham [California] and Brian Robertson [Scotland], so the band would never be caught without a guitarist again starting on the preceding album NIGHTLIFE. The band was also eager to shed its ""one hit wonder status"" caused by the success of Whiskey In the Jar in the UK. Thin Lizzy was hard to label at this point because you got hard rock, folk music, blues, pop and even some poetry set to music. If you are looking for the best Thin Lizzy I would suggest releases such as Chinatown, Bad Reputation, Jailbreak or Thunder and Lightning. If you are actually wanting to try Thin Lizzy for the first time take a look at Dedication, Lizzy Killers, or their new greatest hits package. I, personally, had to have all the Thin Lizzy releases, except for the greatest hits, because there are no new songs on them.If you are into hard rock roots or the 70's, this is a... sleeper album and would only help out any CD collection. There is a variety of music here, but this disc may not be for everyone, so, try a better release or anthology pakage first, then go crazy buying the rest!"
1,"Nineteen of ABBA's best songs are plenty, but you won't tire of them.  It is amazing that four Swedes (Benny Andersson and Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus as writers and Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Agnetha F&auml;ltskog as the main singers) could take such simple English cliches and turn them into pop music magic.  Despite sometimes maddeningly simple lyrics, the song arrangements were unnervingly catchy and the multi-level layered compostions are fascinating.  The keyboards and synthesizers were used in some of the more ingenious ways during the seventies to produce that unmistakeable ABBA sound.  The energy and nearly anthemic enthusiasm eminating from each song marked them all as instant classics, no matter how jaded or synical the listener.  It is doubtlful if you read the song list here that you would not know the melody.  The one ironic thing about this groups phenomenal success, is that of over 400 million album sales, they only had one number one hit in the US - ""Dancing Queen"".  But it is one heck of a great song."
1,"You know you like it. And you know you don't want people to know you like it. But they like it too. If they were teenies back then, male or female, they liked Wham! hits like Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go, Freedom or  Everything She Wants (the maxi version of the latter is much better  though).The ultimate masterpiece is the George Michael ballad Careless  Whispers.You know you love that one too. So buy it!"
1,"All guitarists should explore work outside their genre to fully appreciate the remarkable diversity their instrument holds.  In the case of Montgomery, his is the quintessential bebop flavored jazz guitar player, and in my estimation, the best ever, and that's in some pretty heavy company.Joined by Mel Ryne on Hammond B-3 organ, &#34;Boss Guitar&#34; has a unique sound, as Ryne plays a wonderfully smoky and smooth organ, which compliments Wes' playing brilliantly.  &#34;Besame Mucho&#34; starts the album off with a Latin flavor, and the CD just seems to float by.  Another favorite is &#34;Canadian Sunset&#34;, a slower but delicate song that features some of the best chord work on the CD.  Fans like to comment on Wes' famous octave picking, which has been copied by tons of players out of admiration, but his truly strong suit, besides being capable of mind blowing solos, is his chordal knowledge that few ever equalled, adding breadth to the playing and more color than any single note solo could hope to do.Wes Montgomery's late '50's work and early '60's albums are his best, where he stays true to his love of bebop, whereas later albums were more commercial and lacking in his usual technique.  While they aren't bad, it's the early stuff to go after.  &#34;So Much Guitar!&#34;, &#34;Far Wes&#34; and &#34;Wes Montgomery Plays The Blues&#34; are all must haves, along with &#34;Boss Guitar.&#34;  It is a tragedy this genius only lived to 43.  Perhaps no single guitarist's death had more of an impact except for Jimi Hendrix, who was known to do a little octave picking himself.  It's how jazz guitar is supposed to be done."
1,"in this era of protools, perfect pitch, programmed pop, it's easy to forget the stevie wonder championed the one man band concept in black music as early as 1972.  he absolutely can be credited with helping usher in a new era of technology with the use of synthesizers, drum machines and programming to flesh out his sound.  the ingredient that was not lost was the human touch.  a musician first, stevie always included the musical elements of chord structure, rhythm, and melody in his work.  By the 80's black pop was less melody and story driven and more beat driven and stevie's music was no exception.  in service to the beat, it seems most of the musicianship was getting lost in the mix.  his 80's output ""in square circle"", and to a lesser extent ""characters"" seem like contractual obligation projects.  there are some gems here.  ""free"" and ""skeletons"" are the socially conscious stevie we expect.  ""free"" especially, with it's crescendo building chorus, is a joy to listen to.  the ballads are also good but nothing we haven't heard from stevie before.  i suppose after innovating for 20+ years, stevie can't be faulting for coasting a bit.  not my favorite stevie cd but fun to listen to."
1,"Note:  This is a re-issue until Rhino Records releases the Remastered Expanded version.After their unique introduction on ""Bee Gees 1st"" and a more somber 2nd album, ""Horizontal"", the Bee Gees are far more confident in their writing, singing and performing on this CD. Barry Gibb's guitar work is exemplary and his voice is strongest on ""When The Swallows Fly"" and ""Swan Song"", as well as Robin Gibb on ""In The Summer Of His Years"" and the huge hit, ""I Started A Joke"". Maurice experiments a great deal with his bass guitar on the bouncy ""Kitty Can"", the pensive ""Down To Earth"" and strong pulsating bass notes (and piano) on the massive hit ""I've Gotta Get A Mesage To You"". Lead guitarist Vince Melouney writes the only Bee Gees song never written by the brothers; ""Such A Shame"", an upbeat, harmonica driven rocker with his Mickey Dolenz sound-alike voice. It is the last strong group effort of an album, before the Bee Gees, temporarily went their separate mucical ways."
1,"Okay, yes this seems to be a stereo only SACD but in my humble opinion, it has never sounded better and I know the MFSL versions as well as just about every other version out there. Having grown up around this album, I can honestly say that there are things on here that I've never even noticed before. The echo that Tony Clarke uses on here gives this album an almost ghostly feeling that really comes through on this version. the backing vocals on Voices In the Sky sound like a heavenly cosmic chior. Justin's acoustic has never come across better than it does on this version but really the same can be said for every thing else. Ray's flute on Visions Of Paradise reminds me of light drifting through the cosmos. One of my all time favorite Moodies songs, the Actor sounds so clean and the drums are so crisp that I think I've fallen in love with it all over again. the bonus disc is a wonderful addition and I'm glad that they aqdded Michael's A Simple Game as this was the only problem with the original version of the album as it was only a single B side to one of the songs here. It's also nice to hear Justin try it although Mike's is the keeper. The two outtakes that originally appeared on + 5 actually fit better here What Am I Doing Here and King And Queen have never sounded better. the live stuff is wonderful. It's a shame that the SACD format has gotten such a bad rap with some as I myself  would love to see other artists and bands put out more SACD's. Imagine SACD albums by artists like King Crimson and Traffic."
1,This album shut my neighborhood down for a long time! No one came out to play that Summer. Everyone was in the house listening to this album over and over...me included! This album changed things musically forever.
1,"this Album just Sizzles Period.""FUnky Drummer""alone is the kind of Track that if you have any kind of Groove about you you have to have it ASAP.this is one of the Golden Era's in the Great Musical Evolution of James Brown.Grooves are tight on a Dime.THe Man&His Musical Vibe are truly One of a Kind."
1,"Little Queen is significantly less heavier and rocking in comparison to Dreamboat Annie, but thankfully the songwriting is still at the same level of quality so it actually doesn't matter HOW much energy these songs lack.  Don't be fooled though- other than ""Barracuda"", the rest of the album doesn't contain the same kind of aggression or heaviness so in a way, it's a minor disappointment.""Treat Me Well"" reminds me of the Carpenters a little bit thanks to the vocal delivery, and ""Cry to Me"" is perhaps reminiscent of Joni Mitchell's Court & Spark days.  However BOTH of these songs are quite good songwriting-wise (especially the latter) because the vocal melodies are really delightful.  They work on a highly emotional level too, meaning, they almost make me shed some tears on a couple occasions.I immediately enjoyed the upbeat ""Say Hello"".  A great song that one is.  Alright you got me- the title song DOES rock pretty hard and will probably remind most people of ""Magic Man"".  The similarities between the two songs is noticeable right away.  Another highlight.I really love ""Sylvan Song"" which is basically a little instrumental introduction leading into the pleasant vibes and mandolin-soaked ""Dream of the Archer"".  Together these two songs provide a beautiful, fairly complex portion of the album, and perhaps even a comparison to the song ""Dreamboat Annie"" wouldn't be totally out of the question either.One song that feels a bit weaker than the rest is ""Love Alive"".  The second part of the song is good, but the first half feels pretty average to me with a fairly weak vocal melody taking up too much time.  Not a bad song though.  Not at all.  ""Go on Cry"" is perhaps just a disappointing way to conclude the album because it does eventually let loose and rock, but it takes four whole minutes to get to that point.  Until then, you're just treated to a fairly funky and nearly ambient sounding soft jam.Overall, Dreamboat Annie still remains Heart's overall best album, but Little Queen is a pretty good follow-up.  Just pay attention to the songwriting and forget about the fact it doesn't rock very hard and you'll find yourself getting into it much easier."
1,"This album has two minds:  The first is a rock-out fest including Barracuda, Love Alive (to some extent) and Kick It Out.  The other is a rather melancholy affair more in keeping with the cover art (pastels and pastiches of country wooing and musings).  Dare I say I'm hearing some prog-rock?  Shades of Genesis between the guitar licks songs?  What I'm not hearing is the emotive power so consistently displayed on Dreamboat Annie."
1,"I remember buying this album in 1987 when I was sixteen.  I love this album.  My favorite track is ""I Can't Stop Loving You"".  This is a beautiful duet with Siedah Garrett.  I also love ""Dirty Diana"" and ""The Way You Make Me Feel"".  Another part Of Me and The  Man In The Mirror and the title tracks are also monster hits off this album.  There are some lesser known songs on this album that I love.  ""Speed Demon"" has a great beat to it.  ""Liberian Girl"" is a smooth sexy cut.  ""Just Good Friends"" is an upbeat track.  ""Leave Me Alone"" is a personal song about Michael's yearning for privacy.  This is a good tune.  This is an excellent album overall."
1,"....was 'the cut'. But watchout for &quot;Talkin' Out the Side of Your Neck'! Overall, a verry good ol' skool CD."
0,"I remember how big a deal this disc was back in the late 80s, but I just never got it...or her. The &quot;Straight Up&quot; and &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot; songs were awful pop tunes and that &quot;Opposites Attract&quot; video was just plain awful with the obnoxious animated cat. Then the allegations surfaced that she never really sang leads on the album. I did like the &quot;Way That You Love Me&quot; song. Now that was pretty sweet."
1,"This is Kast's second offering. Their first album,  Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, was a classic, and this picks up where  that left off, literally &quot;Elevating&quot; them to other-worldly  levels. The title track is designed to get the party crunk, yet still  maintains a smooth feel. 90% of this album is nuthin but stand-out trax,  including Two Dope Boyz (In A Cadillac), Wheelz Of Steel, Jazzy Belle,  Elevators, Mainstream, Decatur Psalm, and 13th Floor/Growing Old. All of  those are beautifully constructed trax, which succeed on all levels. That  being said, the album does have it's low points. Babylon drags slightly  with its lackadaisical beat. Ditto for E.T., which is an odd track in which  chiming noises and heavy breathing comprise the beat. I guess they were  trying to capture that odd &quot;alien&quot; type feeling. Overall,  however, this is a must-have album. With hooks that will have you singing  along subconsciously and beats that will keep your head nodding. Combine  those elements with Big Boi and Andre's stutter-stop flows and lyrical  wordplaying, and you get that signature Outkast sound, which has yet to  produce anything less than classic music."
1,"Okay,okay now I am a STONE Heatwave fan.I have every studioalbum they made and listen to them every chance I get.I have this CD too and here's what I think-this is Heatwave's debut.It's probably the first time this hard core live band ever stepped into a recording studio and it features several of thebands classics-the brooding dance-based ""Boogie Nights"",therhythm based funk of ""Ain't No Half Steppin'"",the unforgettablesweet soul ballad ""Always And Forever"" and the chunky title cut.What's interesting though is how much,on the rest of thisalbum,Heatwave are trying to copy KC & The Sunshine Band,BrassConstruction,Rufus and other funk and disco groups of the time.It's not nearly as individual as as brilliant albums such as'Central Heating' and 'Hot Property' were because Heatwavedownplay their jazzier leanings in favor of simple party music.And while tunes like the slinky ""Lay It On Me"" and the mean funkof ""Super Soul Sister"" are very good they're not as transcendantas the sound this band would later develope,and I will point outI'm highly biased in this opinion too!And the album closer,the silly ""Beat Your Booty"" is justplain embarrassing-the only real Heatwave clinker due to it'sunbelievably stupid lyrics.So I suggest to anyone interestedin Heatwave's music (and you should be) pick up 'Central Heating' first and then go chronologically from their until1982's 'Current' (that is if you still own a turn table) and get'Too Hot To Handle' last because it just isn't a complete portrait of Heatwave's dynamic dance-funk hybrid usually is.Notterrible but not a classic either."
1,"You just can't be a Marvin Gaye fan and not own this one!  This brother was soooo before his time.Nobody has a voice like his. (....though Sam Cooke does come to mind, actually.  Not that they sound alike so much, but there is a PURE MUSICAL QUALITY to their voices that few others had then or have now.)This project is the bomb!  Though written several years ago, the message in the musicis still very relevant today!  And Marvin delivers like no one else can!FABULOUS"
1,"Man this is one great blues guitar album! It may be listed under Albert Collins, but this is a true collaboration. Robert Cray really shines here and is much bluesier then you will find him on his own albums. All three share in the vocal duties and the guitar solos.  No one plays over each other - it's a great collaboration that results in a great album.  Just listen to the first cut and you will get a good taste of what is in store.  Buy it and enjoy."
1,"In 1971 I lived in a very well integrated neighborhood. We had the Romants who were Puerto Rican who lived a few doors down from us, the Sakai's, who were Japanesese, lived next door to the Jones and the Jones who were a black family lived next door to us. Mr. and Mrs. Jones were my mom and dad's best friends'. we did everything together. I'm sure we got stared at quite a bit because I guess there were still a few people who couldn't handle seeing black and white people being friendly with each other and even letting their children play with each other. I can assure you, none of us were hurt in the process. In fact, we learned a real ""silly thing"". We learned that all people are pretty much the same. That no matter what you may look on the outside, your soul still looks the same to God who made you out of ""His"" Colorless Self...because as my mother would say, Love has no color...But anyway, flashing back to 1971, we were at a barbecue at the Jones' house, and Alicia, their oldest daughter, who was 15 at the time (and who I had a mad crush on)came out of the house wearing this pretty yellow sundress and holding this record. She carefully took it out of its cover and put it on. I just remember it getting very, very quiet. It was like each and every song took our breath away. I remember after the record played, Alicia wanted to play it again, and Mrs. Jones wiped a few tears from her eyes simply said, ""Another time, dear...another time...""This album is heavy. It's not party music. It really makes you think and feel about your place in the world. We have become such a plastic coated society. It is like we are numb to everything that is going on in the world. Oh, I see North Korea has a nuclear weapon that they want to test, ho-hum...pass the butter...WHAT? PARIS HILTON GOT ARRESTED FOR DRUNK DRIVING! OH, THE INHUMANITY! It's a weird world in which we live in. There are somedays I am just thrilled to the bone to be a part of such a lovely world and then there are other days when I just want to stick my head in the sand.I consider Marvin Gaye a prophet, a very unlikely prophet, but if you really think about it, all the truly great people didn't look like they would amount to much, at the time...""Oh, you didn't invite that Jesus kid from Nazareth over, did you? He's always making the water taste funny..."" But Marvin sang about what we all wanted to sing about. He talked about the war, about the ecology, about people that felt oppressed and lost and confused and I don't think he was just singing to people of his own race, I think he was singing to all of us.This record will be 36 years old in 2007 and it is still just as relevant. And even though I haven't lived in that old neighborhood of mine in years, I still feel very lucky that I lived in a ""world"" where I was exposed to different ideas, different beliefs, different ways of being in the world because it just makes me realize that the only thjing that we all have in common is that we are all so diverse and it's a beautiful thing.Peace and Blessings"
1,"The late 70s was probably a time of artistic low for Barbra Streisand.  Sure, she was releasing hit song after hit song, and her movies were huge hits, but they were pretty much more about the money, and not the art.  That all changed when Guilty was released in 1980.  Not only did she have a huge success with a dying music trend, but she also recorded what is arguably her best album ever.01.  ""Guilty""- possibly the strongest track on the album, this is a mid-tempo number that not only has a fantastic rhythm, but a great chemistry between Barbra and Barry Gibb.  It gets an A02.  ""Woman In Love""- another mid-tempo number (though actually closer to slow), this was a huge hit for Barbra, and with her great phrasing and beautiful voice, it'll be easy to hear why.  A-03.  ""Run Wild""- a very pretty song, only added by the fact that is has a goosebump-inducing guitar rift between stanzas.  Pretty sexy too.  A-04.  ""Promises""- a great song to gear you up after the slow pace thus far.  A really fun track, especially if you want to dance.  A05.  ""The Love Inside""- a very sad, but very touching song.  Prime example of Barbra singing movingly without oversinging.  Not the greatest song, but pretty good.  B+06.  ""What Kind of Fool""- another duet with Barry Gibb.  Not as good as the title track, but still a good listen.  B+07.  ""Life Story""- a lovely mid-tempo track that finally has Barbra in a more feminist voice, than a weak I-need-a-man voice.  Very Nice.  A-08.  ""Never Give Up""- another fun fast song, which will have your foot tapping in no time.  Should have been released as a single, but what's done is done.  A09.  ""Make it Like a Memory""- perhaps the only song on here that I can say is just okay.  Not too memorable (no pun intended), a bit overlong, and the instrumentation is rather overblown.  But still, a powerful song, that isn't totally unmoving.  B-An album that every fan will want, but even self-proclaimed haters of Barbra Streisand could probably find a few songs that are very enjoyable on here.  Aside from the Broadway Album, this is Barbra's best album.  And the 2005 sequel, Guilty Pleasures, is a great listen as well."
1,"Call her voice close to the likes of Carole King or Carly Simon, with a sound that veers on country at times, King-like pop on the other.  I finally decided to check out Karla Bonoff after hearing ""Somebody's Eyes"" from the Footloose soundtrack and found out she went back as a songwriter and artists from the late 70's.  Plus, my esteemed friend Alexandra recommended her, as she went to some of her concerts, so that finally got the ball rolling.What I also did learn was that Linda Ronstadt covered three songs from here on her Hasten Down The Wind album, the first of which is ""Someone To Lay Down Beside Me,"" which features Karla on piano and Waddy Wachtel on guitar.  It's a portrait of loneliness set in ""a world that can be sort of heartless.""There's a light skipping beat in ""I Can't Hold On"" that reflects the Eagles and James Taylor-kind of sound prevalent at the time.  Waddy's guitars enhances this song.The sad piano-only ballad ""Lose Again"" is the second song covered by Ronstadt.  Bonoff's voice is at its haunting best here, as she describes her ball-and-chain relationship.  She likens it to missing the train and staying behind.  The best song by far here, made all the more poignant with ""But you're keepin' me goin'/I know it's insane/Because I love you and lose again.""Ronstadt does make an appearance here, as a backup singer on ""Home"", whose acoustic and steel guitars give this a country feel.  Producer Kenny Edwards does the mandolin here as well.  She describes home as a liberating influence:  ""My life there has it's own wings/To fly over the mountains/Though I'm standing still.""  ""Faces In The Wind"" is lullaby-type country ballad.The electric piano and bass really forms the framework for the upbeat ""Isn't It Always Love,"" which I can picture Carly Simon covering.  In the course of a reflective walk, Karla sagely says of the two faces of love:  ""Isn't it always love that makes you hang your head/Isn't it always love that makes you cry/And isn't it always love that takes the tears away/And I wouldn't have it any other way.""The third song Ronstadt covered from here is the gentle acoustic ballad ""If He's Ever Near"", which gets backing vocal support from Glenn Frey and J.D. Souther.  Yes, it is hard to find that someone who's the right one, isn't it?""Flying High"" is a mid-paced country-ish song that again tells of the ups and downs of love, told to her by a gypsy fortune teller.  The story has a happy ending, so that's good.Missing someone was never made so painful than in the acoustic ballad ""Falling Star,"" where she realizes ""that love can leave a scar.""  She does have a good high note when she sings how she's going down like the title object.  It's so bad, that ""when the birds fly south for a while/Oh, I wish that I could go/Someone there might warm this cold heart.""  One of the best songs here.The final ballad displays an analogy between a rose and love.  Like the ""Rose In The Garden"", ""It will bloom if you're sure/That you pay close attention/but leave it room.""Linda Ronstadt helps out with backing vocals here, as does Waddy Wachtel with his guitar.A wonderful debut, highlighted by Karla's melodic vocals.  And a big-up to Alexandra for telling me about her."
1,"the debarge family musically has been long overshadowed by comparrisons to the jacksons in more ways than James Debarge&Janet jackson of being together. but Debarge was able to write some of there material unlike the Jacksons. El Debarge was not only the Lead singer,but also the main songwriter of there classics.""I Like it,all this Love are played all the time at Quiet storm radio, the song ""a dream"" has made Careers out of Biggie,Ashanti,Mary J.Bliege amongest others. for a whole on Radio alot of songs were sampling some parts of debarge songs. I was hit&Miss with the More Cross-over stuff they did,but as far as Songwriting,Singing&Playing El Debarge is a really good talent that is vastly underrated.this is a good collection."
1,2pac's best album. I love his music and this album is a classic. combining gansgta rap to his angry voice. Buy this one if u r a BIG fan of 2pac. also reminds of good times with Biggie (B.I.G)I tried to get it from different stores when it came out but this album was always OUT OF STOCK finally i got it (along time ago) and It is still in my CD player. Never got out from there.For me this is the best rap album EVER! and also 2pac's greatest work.
1,"This album was very popular when released.  The music is very melodic.  It was played on Smooth Jazz stations in edited formats (they cut out parts that didn't fit the smooth jazz format).  That would make some classify this as smooth jazz.  They are sadly mistaken.This recording is underrated and filled with so much subtlety that the point would be missed by many.  Contained here is recording that contains some excellent pieces which are melodic, but effectively convey a vibe, with excellent soloing and arrangements.Pat's displays a virtuosity in his playing without running away with himself.  This recording's influence is world beat.  First class world beat seamless woven throught the Mays/Metheny conciousness.""Have You Heard"" is simply one of the best pieces the group has composed and performed.  It has aged well over the years.  It has one of Pat's very best solos and some impressive vocal work by Pedro Aznar who holds an impossibly long note toward the end.  Pedro has to perform these difficult octave leaps throughout and he does so in good voice.""Spring Ain't Here is one of the pieces where the subtlety factor comes in.  Pat's solo here is excellent. He so beautifully embellishes the melody and also makes great use of space. This one has an intangible element for me that I can't lend words to.  It so effectively conveys not a relaxed mood, as much as a languid vibe.45/8 is this short little piece that so effectively conveys a South American feel that you wish that it had been much longer just to see what they would've done with it.5-5-7 is also is also another elegant piece which has an arrangement anchored by Steve Rodby's amazing bass playing which fuels Metheny's imagination throughout. Pat's lead here is remarkable.""Are We There Yet/Vidala"" is amazing the way they tie a modern electric piece to a folkloric and plaintive piece. They do this seamlessly and to perfection.  ""Are We There Yet"" is for you Guitar Synth fans of Pat's.  The interplay between Pat and Lyle is if full force here.  It's one of those quirky pieces whose pacing makes it somewhat unique.  The segue portion is ethereal.""Dream of the Return"" is unique in that Pat rarely features a vocal with words. Aznar is the composer of these lyrics and they are thankfully, thoughtful. Good lyrics are hard to come by and often in instances where instrumental groups attempt them, they usually are pretty goofy.  Not in this case though.  This one has that patented tension and releast thing that the group does so well. A moving piece of music.My one complaint is that Pat tends to use the vocables a tad too much on certain songs like ""Better Days Ahead"" and ""Every Summer Night"" when the pieces don't need them at all.  Pedro Aznar is a talented multi-instrumentalist. Perhaps one of these other talents could've been lent to these same pieces.  He has a very good voice, but there is such a thing as too much of a good thing.The group showed yet another fact of themselves and of a particular aspect of their exploration of world-beat themes.  This one different than the preceding ""Still Life (Talking)"" and ""First Circle"" both of which are excellent, which embraced similar but distinct themes."
0,"Well, I have to admit I had to buy it after hearing &quot;Walking In the Sun&quot; and &quot;The Fonz&quot; , which still are accessible after a while even though I hate the rest of the album, really. Anyway, I did have  som high expectations about this one. so, there are those two tracks, which  are nice, then there are four songs, which sound good for the 3-5 first  times, but which slowly start to irritate ( Let's rock, Why Can't ...,  padrino, Flo). Then there are a couple of songs which are prettty neutral,  but lame. And then there are the ones that have irritated me since the  first listen; for example, &quot;Disconnect The Dots&quot; is disgusting  teen punk. Yuch!. Well, anyway, to sum it all up, I'd have to say, that ska  may attract you at first, but in the long run it's simply one of the most  efficient vomiting tools. This album is just another commercially ambitious  record with few catchy tunes, but not a bit of durability. And it sure  ain't real ska, is it?"
1,"This is a really good album from a group I'm just discovering. The main thing that attracted me to Helmet was musical [guitar-riffs in this case] comparisons to Trust Company, Metallica, and even Pantera. I borrowed this album from a friend and I must say that I'm impressed. The riffs are very heavy (I can see where comparisons of aforementioned bands can be noticed), the drumming is above-average, and the bass is very low-tuned. I really like the lyrics as well. They weren't even close to what I was expecting. Some of it is kind of dark, but just about anyone can deal with that.There are some flaws with this record. The production isn't really that good, giving the instruments a bizarre sound at times. The guitar-""solos"" are awful, and little more than feedback. Page Hamilton (although a good frontman guitarist) has an unintentionally goofy voice that is nothing more than a shout (emotionless). There is a huge space for improvement. Plus, there is little variation in the songs here, so it's pretty indistinguishable to tell if a song has went on to the next one or whatever. Not that it's a big problem with me, but it just annoys me.But it's one nice, 35 minute+ song for everyone to enjoy. Great metal to behold. I'm definetely checking out more stuff from these guys. Also try Pantera, Iced Earth, and Trust Company. Peace...Standouts: All of them."
1,"One Upon a Time Kenny ""Babyface"" Edmonds and Antonio ""LA"" Reid formed the record company La Face, they wrote a song ""Love Shoulda Brought You Home"" for the Boomerang sountrack with Eddie Murphy as the star, the song was first suppost to be made for Anita Baker but that didn't work out so they gave it to the young Toni Braxton instead. Toni had been part of the sister group The Braxtons but had never had a hit before, ""Love Shoulda Brought You Home"" became a smash and Toni was the first female artist to sign for La Face records, she soon got alot of attention both from soul and from pop fans and when her debut album finally was released it became a smash, and eventually sold 10 million copies and The album hit #1 on both the pop and R&B; charts. Was it worth all the attention?. Hell yes.Other then the hits she got from the Boomerang movie, that also appears on this album, she had 3 more top 5 singles on the charts. ""Another Sad Love Song"" ""Breathe Again"" and ""You Mean the World to Me"". A star was born. The Majority of songs here are a mix of Soul and Ballads. ""Another Sad Love Song"" is a soulish mid tempo ballad and ""Breath Again"" is a vulnerable slow ballad, my personal favorite Toni song. I still recall the music video where she's trapped in a labyrinth. ""Seven Whole Days"" is a melancholy ballad and ""Love Affair"" is a midtempo ditto with ""Candlelight"". ""Spending Time With You"" however is unique, considering that it's a soulish uptempo, few Toni songs sound like that. ""Love Shoulda Brought You Home"" needs no further presentation, a great midtempo. ""Belong To You"" remind me of all those R&B; groups of the early 90's like SWV for example, it also a uptempo. ""How Many Ways"" and ""Best Friend"" were both co-written by Toni, first a midtempo the second a piano ballad, the hit ""You Mean the World To Me"" is also a ballad, surprise surprise.What makes this album so good?, The fact that Toni reached so many diffrent audiences and that her voice was suited for all kinds of songs, but especially the emotional hearbreaking ballads like ""Breathe Again"" and later ""Un-Break My Heart"", Back in 1993 she was also a welcolmed new solo artists in a era where there were lots of decent girl groups but few really good solo artists. This 1993 debut stands as one of the best debuts from the 90's and perhaps Toni's best album aswell."
1,"Though I've always fully recognised her talent, I've never been a huge Teena Marie fan. (For instance, I like songs like ""Behind The Groove"" and ""It Must Be Magic"" but not enough to buy them. And though it was one of her most popular songs, I could never get into ""Square Biz""). But I've always loved this album. Or, more accurately, I've always loved the opener, ""I Need Your Lovin'"". The way the tune starts off with that solo bass line before the rhythm section and strings kick in, has fascinated me from the first day I heard it back when it was first released. For some reason or the other though, I never got round to buying the album.Well, better late than never and even though I'm 27 years late, I'm totally happy and satisfied now that I have it. ""Young Love"", ""First Class Love"" and the title tune are all great songs, well played and well sung. Credit to the lady, who wrote and produced the whole album herself. ""Chains"" I can take or leave but I'm rewarded fully towards the end of the album with the sweetly jazzy ""You Make Love Like Springtime"", ""Tune In Tomorrow"" and ""You Make Love Like Springtime (Reprise)"". As I didn't own this album on vinyl I am unable to report whom the brilliant musicians were, who played on it. Once again, (as with Grover Washington, Jr'sFeels So Good, which I reviewed recently), Motown has seen it fit not to include this vital information on the inner sleeve notes. I wonder what they're thinking?Anyway, there's great singing and great music on this great album. It doesn't sound dated at all so you don't really have to be a great fan of music from the 80s to enjoy it."
1,"Glen Danzig and his friends have simply made the best punk cd ever.  And it would be this cd.  I guess I'm not too much into the politics of punk, but this is a truely great cd.  With its cheesy B-Horror movie lyrics, traditional punk riffs, and 50's esque vocals, this band is, in general, just a fun band.  They are by far the #1 Halloween band ever.  They don't care what anyone really thinks, so they basically do whatever they please.  Some people may be offended by some of their lyrics or something, but oh well.  Glen Danzig should have never left this band, or they would be by far one of the most respected bands ever.  Wait, they already are!"
1,"Through my childhood, teen years, and most of my adulthood, Iwas under the impression that DONOVAN was pretty much aboutbubblegum music(sorry about that Mr.Leitch). Now, in my middle-age, of all places, I find that this talented musician is amaster of psychedelica, right up there with SYD BARRETT, earlyPINK FLOYD, and other of my favorites. Heres to him. I wish Ihad discovered all this great music earlier in life. But not toworry, I'm making up for lost time, buying all I can get myhands on by this guy. I find that this release is a very goodone, and for '66, well before it's time. There is not a badsong on this c.d. I did not give it a fifth star due to the lackof information on the packaging, and I think that in this dayand age, they could have done more with the sound production quality.Thanks and keep on keepin' on,Tom"
1,"Each track on this handy compilation embodies all of the genuine elements that made Kansas one of the all-time greats, consisting of the Topeka-homegrown innocence (without the cliched naivety) combined with weary-eyed looks at the past, present, and an uncertain future. Springing from the virtuous, innocent American heartland, Kansas was a band that remained honest in their hopeful-sad-determined subject matter, and became one of the premier supergroups of its time (and remaining unmatched in their genre to this day). They proved they could pull off their love of British progressive rock without sounding overblown or overproduced, while keeping an authentic Southern jam essence. This slightly made-over version of the original release showcases examples of the things that made Kansas stand out; whether it's the doleful realizations of 'Dust in the Wind,' the power of 'Point Of Know Return' or 'Carry on Wayward Son,' or reflections of Kerry Livgren's search for redemption through Christianity, every song here remains some of the best work released during their respective times. However, it should be noted that &quot;The Best Of Kansas&quot; is not necessarily a place to start for new fans; rather, Kansas is one of those bands whose immense creativity is best experienced with each individual album, and no compilation completely does them a significant amount of justice. Nonetheless, it's still a relatively sturdy overview, and a fascinating musical biography."
1,PREMIER POP MUSIC AT ITS PEAK. CRITICS ARE SOMETIMES WITHOUT A CLUE. THEY WERE WITH THIS BAND. 19(!) GREAT SONGS ON ONE CD.
1,"Right or wrong, I tend to compartmentalize Elton John. Those albums from his first through Goodbye Yellowbrick Road, when he was a writter expermenting with styles, and the drug fuled specticles of Caribu and after.But of those fantastic early albums, Honky Chateu is by far the best. As a writer and musician, Elton here was able to take all the experiments going back to his first album and synthsize them into an amazing, unpretentious album of fantastic music.Look at him! Beard, glasses, looking down thinking. This is a musician that we can all relate to, and hang out with. You get no hint of what is about to come as Elton's act became 1970s stage cheese.""Honky Cat,"" is one of the best funk singles of the 1970s, bar none. ""Rocket Man"" is Elton reaching melodic heights that compete with the Bealtes. ""I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself"" is both funny and frightening: the kind of confessional satrie that Ray Davies matered. Is he kidding, or not.All of this is done with a great back up band, and no showmanship--a good thing. It is great music by a great writter.Had Elton made more albums like Honky Chateu, he may not have sold as many show tickets, but he would be up their with Paul, John, Ray, some of the best/Remembered only for the music."
1,"I bought this CD three years age, long after this group's heyday and I became a fan of them instantly. This is the best hits compilation I,ve ever bought. Many people think of Shout or Everybody Wants To Rule The World when they think of TFF. While I love these songs their music spans beyond just these two songs. You'll be surprised at the changes in their sound from their Hurting Days. Pale Shelter, and Mad World are your typical but above average early 80s new wave songs. Change is a standout song from this period. Such a well produced pop song. The fuzz buzz running from 2:38 to 2:57 is amazing. The new single on here is a hard rock edged Laid So Low. This song is a rerecorded version of Tears Roll Down from the brilliant yet underrated Saturnine Martial Lunatic CD. The next surpise is the Beatles sounding Sowing The Seeds Of Love. Rolands songwriting` producing, and Curts voice and musicianship all come together to create a brilliant 6 and a half minute song. This is their most colorful song they,ve ever done with lots of horns and trumpets. The other surprise is the soulful Woman In Chains and Advice For The Young At Heart. Woman In Chains is a beautiful song with Oleta Adams singing backup and emotional well written lyrics. Her voice is breathtaking. The Final Cut on this compilation, Advice For The Young is a great closer to this album. It's very soulful with the Jazzy pianos mixed with guitars and organs it's my favorite on this album. I highly recommend that you get this CD. It will be in your CD player alot. Even if you have the parent albums this CD is still worth getting just for the new single Laid So Low(Tears Roll Down). It's worth the money."
1,"After the death of King Of New York superstar Biggie Smalls aka The Notorious B.I.G, questions were circling about who was going to take his spot. Many suspected Jay-Z to fill in that position, unfortunetly this album didn't convinence many listers. Personally that album wasn't that bad, although more commercialised than this pervious LP ""Reasonable Doubt"". The album has a few gems that it could done without, like ""I Know What Girls Like"" and ""Sunshine"", but with cuts like City Is Mine, Friend Or Foe '98 and Streets Is Watching along with many more, you can't go wrong with this one"
1,"I'll admit, this is a great album, but you're just being foolish if you sit around and say this is the greatest album of all time.  My favorite song on here is &quot;Billie Jean&quot;.  It just as cool lyrics and a really cool video(especially considering it was made in like 1983).  I like the song &quot;Beat It&quot; almost as much as &quot;Billie Jean&quot;.  I think the video for it is corny though.  &quot;The Girl is Mine&quot; feat. Paul McCartney is a cool ballad, but I've actually never seen the video for it.  I'm not a huge fan of the song &quot;Thriller&quot;, but the video is so cool that you have to like it.  &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot; has cool lyrics about Michael's life.  I also like the song &quot;PYT&quot;, which has Janet singing background vocals.  My only complaint about this album is that it only has 9 songs on it.  The 9 songs are pretty much perfect though, so you have to buy this album.  I know that Michael's recently released Invincible, but I think his new music stinks, so if you want the good stuff, buy this and his other album that's almost as good, Off The Wall."
1,"...P>Lenny Kravitz has the amazing ability to take elements of 60s and 70s rock and make them sound completely modern.  There is no Jimi Hendrix imitation on ""Are You Gonna Go My Way.""  Kravitz and his musicians have no aspirations of being Hendrix...they KNOW there's only one.  Some of the songs are driving and loud, others are soft and sweet, and Heaven Help is simply gorgeous.  I bought this album as soon as it came out in the spring of 1993 and it has traveled with me everywhere I've gone.  Whether I'm on a plane, train, long car journey, I can pop in this CD and know that I'll be entertained by an absolutely perfect rock album.  They are truly few and far between, and this one is a masterpiece."
1,"I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of Diana Ross. Truth be told, there are not many songs that she did that I like. But I guess that is what makes this review honest. I don't like the lady much! But nerver mind the rumors of how she may have treated the other Supremes on her way to her solo career, the music is a whole other matter. Ms. Ross' time with the Supremes did give us some of the most memorible music to date. That is why I love this c.d. There are only two songs on this c.d. that I want this disc for, ""Love Hangover"" and ""Ain't No Mountain"". Of the two, ""Ain't No Mountain"" is the all time classic. Originally done by Marvin Gaye and Tammy Terrell, the Supremes took a different route on this song. With Diana Ross speaking the lead, it made the song that much more emotional. I had been used to hearing the 45 version of this song for so long that it never accurred to me that there may be a long playing version to this song. It wasn't until 1978 that I finally heard this version. I loved the song before this. After hearing the long playing version, it is a MUST HAVE!!! The orchestration of this song is something of Motown lore. From the strings to the horns, this is almost the perfect song. The way the song cresendoes when Diana starts to recite ""If you should ever need the arms that used to hold you so close or the lips that used to touch yours so tenderly. Just remember what I told you the day I set you free!"" It is at this point that the song takes off. This song never hits the wall. It just keeps you until the last echo of the song. I don't say much about the other songs because they don't match up to ""Aint No Mountain"". The song ""Reflections"" is tossed into a medley of Supremes songs that really don't do this song justice. The entry theme for the t.v. show ""China Beach"" ""Reflections"" caught my ear as a good song. And as it stands, my second all time favorite Supremes song. ""Love Hangover"" is one of the few songs that Diana did during her solo career that I did actually love. Released in 1976, It was a catchy song. It starts out slow , then changes tempo and takes off. There is another version of this song (12 inch d.j. special) that will knock you out on the ""Diana Deluxe Edition"" c.d.Diana (Deluxe Edition). But for me ""Ain't No Mountain"" is well worth buying this c.d. This is my honest opinion."
1,"Goldie was one of the biggest artists of Drum&amp;Bass or Jungle as it also is called and this is his life work. A real Drum&amp;Bass classic, it's meliodic and beautiful with great samples and female voices on some songs, far from the hardcore stuff you might think of when you hear about Drum&amp;Bass. &quot;Sea of Tears&quot; is a good example of that. Another good song is &quot;Sensual&quot; with a female voice and slow sound mixed with fast drums. The real classic is however the 21 minute long masterpiece &quot;Timeless&quot;. Actually it's 3 songs in it but anyway, if you just like parts of it then just listen to &quot;Inner City Life&quot; which was a quite big hit for him. It includes female voices, haunting sound and ofcourse the obvious drum sound. Not all songs sound the same, and that's why i like this album. If you want a rougher song, then you'll like &quot;Saint Angel&quot; with a weird electronic sound and fast drums. Many artists have been influented by this album, Roni Size is probably one of the biggest Drum&amp;Bass artisst out there right now with another good album in &quot;Life Forms&quot; on ATB's new album there was a song called &quot;Cabana Moon&quot; with clear influents from this album. &quot;Timeless&quot; is indeed Timeless."
1,"This is Insane Clown Posses 1st and 1 of thier best c.d.s. I like this, the amazing jekel brothers, and the wraith tied for the best.I own all 6 jokers cards + bizzar, bizaar, and forgotten freshness vol's 1 and 2, so i know alot about these guys. This along with every other (icp) CD is reccomended."
1,"I really think Punk in Drublic is one of maybe two near-great albums by this band (well, I haven't heard Two Heabs, or Pump Up the Valium yet). This is the NOFX that I loved; they kept things simple, and the lyrics were more personal than the dragging ""political"" lyrics of NOFX today (which aren't ""political"" so much as they are ""fat mike trying to be as punk rock as possible no matter how hypocritical it'll make him).I think the songs here are consistently good, and their very fun too; you get none of the emotional baggage of later NOFX releases, and they can sometimes make a point without trying to lecture you (though most of the time they're just having fun).best tracks: Linoleum, Leave it Alone, Jeff Wears Birkenstocks?, Fleas, Lori Myers(even for the subject matter alone), and The Cause."
1,"When this was was released, my friend loaned me a copy. During a get together, someone said that the album's ""all trash!"" But another giggled and admitted that he liked it. So it became the well loved trashy dance album of the 80s, giving Madonna and Janet Jackson a run in the pop dance market.The songs are very groovy. Besides the No 1s like Straight Up, Forever Your Girl, Opposites Attract and Cold Hearted, I especially like Knocked Out and I Need You. My only beef with this is that they did not put in the version of Cold Hearted which had Paula rapping.Many of of us ended up getting the accompanying VHS too to learn to dance like Paula."
1,"I am a big Pat Metheny fan and have most of his work on CD. I am also a very picky musician when it comes to recording quality.Even if you already own this title, it is definitely worth purchasing again. The dynamics are new and wonderful! I estimate an increase in ""Gain or Loudness"" to be about 25%...even more improvement on quiet, pensive tracks such as Letter from Home or Vidalia. The balance is maintained and not overly compressed.The reappearance of the stand-up bass and the dynamic sweetening of Pedro Aznar's vocal stylings is what you'll notice right away. Turn up your subwoofer a little bit and enjoy Steve Rodby's masterful upright bass. The remaster also makes Pat's adventures to the higher guitar octaves more smooth and less screechy than the older pressings.Ear candy at it's best! Get It!"
1,"If for some reason you're interested in only a selection of the songs herein, the same recordings of ""Anywhere Is"", ""China Roses"", ""The Memory of Trees"", and ""On My Way Home"" have been collected on PAINT THE SKY WITH STARS.Enya composed all the music, sang all the songs, and provided all the accompaniment;  Roma Ryan wrote the lyrics; Nicky Ryan helped with the arrangements and handled the engineering and mixing. Except where noted otherwise, each song is sung in English.Enya is one of the best composers and performers I know to unwind with; another in this category is Ryan Miller, who composed the soundtracks for the video games MYST and RIVEN.""The Memory of Trees"" (instrumental and voices, no lyrics) Waltz tempo, opening with electronic keyboard, joined by piano. Enya joins in vocally but without words partway through. The main theme is about six notes long, continually repeated with variations. One of my two favourites on this CD, ranked only after ""China Roses"".""Anywhere Is"" Unusually staccato for Enya, mainly string accompaniment. No percussion, some piano. The lyrics are very distinct and easy to follow except during the chorus, when the louder volume of the accompaniment and softer singing obscures the words a little. (""You go there you're gone forever / I go there I'll lose my way / if we stay here we're not together / Anywhere is"").""Pax Deorum"" (sung in Latin) Noticeably deeper pitched-chorus and accompaniment than usual. The accompaniment includes some percussion, in this case base drum, although the beat is mainly carried by the keyboard.""Athair ar Neamh"" is sung in Gaelic, with very quiet keyboard accompaniment so that Enya's voice carries the main lyrics very clearly. During the chorus, a multiple-track arrangement wherein she appears to sing with herself blurs the effect a little. Very clear and bell-like, on the whole.""From Where I Am"" (instrumental only) Specifically piano. As usual with Enya, her piano solo here makes me think of water imagery.""China Roses"" Waltz tempo again, opening with electronic keyboard, but most of the accompaniment is covered by piano. ""I know that if I have heaven / there is nothing to desire; Rain and river, a world of wonder / may be paradise to me."" Most of the verses contain a reference to heaven, the night sky.""Hope Has a Place"" I would tentatively call this waltz tempo again, but it's very slow, and the beat isn't quite regular. Enya's singing comes through very clearly herein (except for the more complex choruses, as usual). The accompaniment consists of very simple chords on an electric keyboard so as not to drown out the singing. The refrain is ""Hope has a place in a lover's heart.""""Tea House Moon"" (instrumental) Unusually electronic feel to the keyboard carrying the melody in this one. Doesn't seem typical of Enya's work.""Once You Had Gold"", 'once you had silver / Then came the rains / out of the blue. / Ever and always, / always and ever,"" with the refrain ""Time gave both darkness and dreams to you."" Waltz tempo again, almost a lullaby in this instance, Enya's singing dominating the piano and keyboard accompaniment with a wordless chorus.""La Sonadora"" - Sung in Spanish, very drowsily, waltz tempo again. The quiet accompaniment is primarily voice with some very deep string, with organ joining in after a couple of verses.""On My Way Home"" - Opens with organ accompaniment, as in the later part of the previous song, but then switches to a very staccato keyboard accompanying Enya's singing. ""On my way home / I remember / only good days."""
1,"2PAC could have lived a story of success in the music world or in Hollywood, for that matter. Talented, presentable and above all else, Socially Conscionable. A tragic and forceful figure of the modern era able to put it all into lyrics. Prison term certainly adding the final touch, I think. 2PAC was not a congenial kind of guide to a lot of people and I am certain that is why he was finally killed. This guy was a ""creative force"" to be reckoned with, the language of the streets his most decisive weapon. His fertile mind his source. But the music sucks! If you take all the words out and just play the music this album is below par. A lot of sequenced sections, same notes played over and over with very rare exceptions. Rap is mostly a beat, I think I understand, and all it requires is the delivery of the words. Truly a world onto itself and God knows there are some monster rappers! But very few create their own music and play it with passion and skills. To the point that the music could stand alone if necessary if only to prove that music and rap can and should go hand to hand. How long can you repeat the same background music, or listen to drum machines before you start missing great sounds?! That said, 2PAC is undoubtedly one of my heroes for here is a man that had it going on and chose to keep challenging the forces that be. He could have sold out and age gracefully but he opted to be a Revolutionary! His Bros must be very proud of him and his enemies can probably kiss his ass for they were not the ones who were on the Spotlight! 5 Stars for his Talent but the music no more than a 3 Stars equals 4 Stars? PS Everyone in the album with him sounded so awesome, he must have been surrounded by Excellent Bros'!"
1,"En este &aacute;lbum de Barbra Strisand grabado en vivo en The Forum por los a&ntilde;os '70 para una conmemoraci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica, nos encontramos con una jovens&iacute;sima cantante que ya era una gran promesa del canto. En este concierto podemos escuchar la voz vehemente y potente de una cantante que influir&aacute; en el canto popular norteamericano en los a&ntilde;os siguientes. Muy interesante ademas notar su excelente afinaci&oacute;n a pesar de cantar en vivo ante un gran p&uacute;blico siendo tan joven. Esto lo podemos notar en los temas ""Make Your Own Kind of Music"" y ""Starting here, Starting Now"".Un &aacute;lbum con excelentes acompa&ntilde;amientos musicales."
1,"This album is sometimes overshadowed by the glorious 'Screaming For Vengeance'.  But honestly, I like 'Defenders Of The Faith' a little bit better.  In my opinion, 'Screaming' has two weak tracks (""Fever"" and ""Devil's Child""), whereas 'Defenders' doesn't have any weak tracks.  Both albums represent Judas Priest at their 80's peak.  As a point of reference, I have listed my top 5 Judas Priest albums in order:1. Defenders Of The Faith2. Screaming For Vengeance3. Painkiller4. Stained Class5. British Steel"
1,Philip Baily has a awesome voice for the right songs but only ones that were awesome is one written by Phil Collins & one after that.The rest of the songs were just so so.I believe on his next cd if he makes another without E.W.F. it could be awesome with Phil Collins & him writing together on a whole cd.
1,"Was it really 19 years ago that this album thundered across the airwaves?  Yeah, it was.  As great as the original cd was ( I have it ), the remaster is made that much better with the edition of 4 terrific tracks from that period.  I'm really amazed that they were not album tracks as Heart and Soul, Angle Park, and The Crossing were staples of the early shows.  All that is missing is Balcony.  We all know it was Stuart's guitar playing that made this music jump out of the radio.  But, I think the lyrics are just as good if not better.  These lyrics would be great over the top of almost any music.Stuart has left us now, but the echoes of this cd and so many memories for the fans will sustain their place in rock history, I hope.  Though they will probably never be a Hall of Fame band, they joing other great bands with similar legacies such as Mott the Hoople, Free, ELO, and Thin Lizzy."
1,"I was a new EC fan a few years ago, coming in with 1996's &quot;All This Useless Beauty&quot; and hanging around since then. A longtime manic fan gave me two words of advice: &quot;Get 'Brutal Youth' and 'Imperial Bedroom'!&quot; I did.Great songs here with &quot;Man Out Of Time&quot; and &quot;The Loved Ones&quot; being my favorites. The liner notes are wonderful as are the extra tracks. (This of course is in reference to the 1994 Demon re-issue.)Wonderful."
1,"This is the album that started it all for the Moody Blues. They were a band that was rising to the top, but had reached a plateau, when Justin Hayward and John Lodge joined as lead singer/guitarist and bass/ vocalist. As they were discovering their sound, they decided to write a show that was conceptual. The songs described a day. At the same time that this show was developing, the record company asked them to record a ""rock"" version of Dvorzak to showcase the new stereo sound record players. Finding it too difficult, the band decided to play their show instead. It was an epiphany. The songs are marvelous! Each member of the band contributes to the writing and singing of the songs. And, of course, this is where we were introduced to Justin Hayward's ""Nights in White Satin""."
1,"Few artists can match the impact that Dylan has had on the music industry and Blood On The Tracks is simply on of the best albums ever made.  No one before or since has been able to match the passion and the brilliance that Dylan demonstrates on this record.  &quot;Idiot Wind&quot; is one of the best written songs of all time and &quot;If You See Her, Say Hello&quot; still manages to stop me in my tracks whenever I hear it...possibly my favorite of all Dylan's songs.  This record should be a cornerstone in every music lover's collection and is the perfect place to start for those who are new to Dylan.  Quite simply the perfect album."
1,"The best way that that I can describe this album in a nutshell is basically as, an airy journey through the heart and mind of an observant soul searcher as he responds to his social surroundings... for the most part anyway :-).  This album is unbelievably coherent both sonically and thematically, and just incredibly even in tone all throughout.  ""What's Going On"" is a true concept album in every sense and is the first great one that Motown produced. It is probably the first great one in all of soul music.  This particular piece of work is special even when compared to most concept albums because while most great concept albums present a strong, unified statement or vision, few embody such a grand idealism.  Gaye is the ultimate idealist all throughout, which is really what defines this album, and why it still resonates so well today.  It is almost unbelievable that Barry Gordy did not want to release it.  I guess that Gordy didn't think that this album was kitschy enough for the public; ""oh no, oh no, all of these unfamiliar words and grand ideas, not on my label!"" (Note: this is not an actual quote from Gordy, just my own feeble and unapologetically sarcastic attempt at regressive mind reading).  I've read that Mr. Gordy asked Marvin Gaye, ""what in the world is Ecology""? (Now that really is close to an actual quote).  Well Mr. Gordy, Ecology is basically the study of how organisms interact and interrelate with their environment, and it was brilliant of Gaye to use that as the core idea for a song here because the idea fits into the album's concept perfectly.  The lyrics of ""Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)"", all of the lyrics on this album in fact, are so incredibly effective because they are so convincingly heartfelt.  It is a blessing to all of us that Gaye finally got this album released.  Story has it that Marvin Gaye had recorded the first version of this album, but decided to change it because he was unsatisfied with the final results.  There was just something missing.  That  ""something"" was bass virtuoso James Jamerson.  James Jamerson was simply B-R-I-L-L-I-A-N-T, and he could embellish within a set song structure magnificently enhancing the melody, all while being absolutely impeccable rythmically.  Story has it that Gaye went out looking for Jamerson, and found him playing in a local club in Detroit.  He convinced Jamerson to come back and play on the album, and he ended up giving some of the best performances of his career.  Legend has it that on the title track, Jamerson plays bass on the whole song while lying on his back on the floor in the studio because he was simply more comfortable there !!!!!(Listen to the title track picturing that, focus on the bass, and simply sit back and marvel at Jamerson's genius).  It should also be noted, and this is something that I rarely hear mentioned, that this album is probably the greatest example of the influence that the influx of jazz musicians crossing over to the soul and R&B scenes had on the increase in the level of sophistication of the musicianship, and the overall spike in the quality of the material coming out of these scenes in the 60's, with their influence remaining strong throughout the 70's. The Funk Brothers (the in house musicians for Motown), we're all local jazz musicians who used the skill and savvy that they had acquired in that arena, to become an almost immeasurable influence on popular music in general; from R& B to Soul, and from Funk to Rock & Roll (a certain well-known British invasion group spent a large portion of the early part of their career trying to imitate these guys).  This album is their greatest single work.  And last but certainly not least, Marvin Gaye is one of the greatest pure vocalist ever.  His extra smooth tenor is one of the most distinct voices that I have ever heard, and it adds immensely to the effectiveness of his interpretations of the material here.  This album works brilliantly as a cohesive whole, and the sum total is about the most genuinely transcendent album that I've ever heard.  This is one legendary album that truly does live up to all the hype, and it should be a part of every music lover's collection!"
1,This is classic 80's hip hop at this time Krs was God this album came out when I was 15 and is probably even more relavent today because Hip Hop has died a thousand deaths already....For real hip hop pick this up....
1,"Dont beleive the hype. this isnt the ""best"" Dylan album like many here are calling it. Is it an excellent album? Definitly. Is it his best album? Definitly not. The acoustic sound of the album can get boring, plus there are 2 not very good songs. The album opens with three fantastic songs. ""Idiot Wind"" is a good song but loses its replay value quick. Musically, this is one of his poorest albums. Lyrically, yes it's a masterpiece. But, lyrics are not all what makes an album. Recommended but I dont see the hype that this is the best Dylan album. See ""Highway 61 Revisited"" for that title."
1,"Madman Across The Water.  Wow! This is an essential Elton John album.By now, most are familiar with the opening track, Tiny Dancer.  Beautiful piano and a melodic falseto set the tone for this, my favorite Elton John tune (and I have many!).  Levon and the title track are also two huge standouts of this album.  This is less a collection of singles with filler as E.J. has been accused of creating later in his career.  Taken as a whole, this album is simply a masterpiece.Madman was created before the flashy Goodbye Yellow Brick Road days, with all the pomp and ceremony that came along with it.  Here's you get the feeling of a new artist, hungry and clawing to get to the top of the pack.  He's succeeded with this effort and hasn't looked back since.If you're a partial E.J. fan and are looking for some of his slightly more obscure work, Madman Across The Water would be a perfect and thoroughly enjoyable choice!"
1,"Yes,this is the album that put stevie wonder on top of the entertainment world back in the mid 1970's this double disk features a collection of just wonderful songs each one is great."
1,"Blood On The Tracks is incredible. It is one Of Dylan's best albums, possibly his second or third best. It is just outstanding. Tangled Up In Blue is one of my all time favorite Dylan songs. Simple Twist Of Fate,  Idiot Wind, and Shelter From The Storm also stand out. Every song, however,  is incredible. Buy this album immediately."
1,"Ahh, yes.  The good ol' days when rap was interesting and had some creative skills behind it instead of a bunch of over-hyped rappers bragging about how rich they are or how many cars they have.  Cypress Hill's ""Black Sunday"" is a classic rap album with some great songs, great beats, and most of all, catchy lyrics that had a nice flow to them.  They sure don't make anymore gems like these anymore... or it's very hard to come by one in the game of rap these days.While following the ""gangster rap"" format, this album isn't as vulgar or as offensive as most rap albums.  Don't get the wrong idea and think that these guys are ""squeaky-clean"" or anything like that.  They have their fair share of profanities and violent/drug references.  What I mean is that the album's a lot more milder than most rap albums, but while it is milder it has a better structure to it than most.  The songs are very gun/drug oriented, but the songs do a great job of flowing and appealing to those who don't find the two topics all that interesting.  In other words, you don't have to be a druggie or a gun fanatic to enjoy these tunes.This is an excellent album with some great songs.  My favorites are ""I ain't goin' out like that,"" ""insane in the brain,"" ""when the (explicit) goes down,"" ""lick a shot,"" ""what go around come around, kid,"" ""hand on the glock,"" and ""break 'em off some.""  While I enjoy the entire album, those are my favorite songs.  The album has a very high replay value and never feels outdated.""Black Sunday"" is able to achieve what many of the new rap albums of today fail to do.  It's a great listen with songs that are simply about more than bragging about ""bling-bling"" or that type of nonsense.  If you're not a big fan of rap, then chances are you may not take a liking to Cypress Hill.  If you're like me and have been disappointed with many of the new rap acts, then pick up ""Black Sunday"" and take a trip down memory lane."
1,"First off, George Michael's voice is one of the best in the buisness and it is perfectly showcased on this album. &quot;Make It Big&quot; was one of the biggest selling pop albums of the 80's going multi-platinum and it was well-deserving. With four huge hits, it was an instant smash. The album begins with the fun and upbeat pop of &quot;Wake Me Up&quot; and it's no wonder this track went to #1 on the pop charts as did &quot;Everything She Want.&quot; &quot;Freedom&quot; was also a massive top 5 hit and is a definite highlight. Very catchy and fun. &quot;Credit Card Baby&quot; and &quot;Heartbeat&quot; could've both been hits if they were released. Both are very fun pop songs. But the standout track on here and of George Michael's career period and quite possibly 80's soft rock period is the beautiful ballad &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; which is a classic in its own right. From the sweeping sax to Michael's gorgeously smooth vocals, this song should make you want the album alone.Anyone growing up in the 80's will remember these tunes, but for the younger under 20 crowd who missed out the first time, this is worth checking out."
1,"Alison Krauss has done much to popularise bluegrass in recent years. Her early recordings were pure bluegrass - this (from 1990) might just be the best album of that phase of her career, although they are all brilliant and it's hard to choose a particular favorite. Her more recent albums have included other influences but I enjoy those too, in a different way.There are no really famous songs on this album, but the quality of all the songs is high. Sidney Cox (of the Cox family, a noted bluegrass group with which Alison recorded a gospel album) wrote four songs including the title track (a bright, upbeat song) and Tonight I'll be lonely too (an outstanding ballad). Other favorites of mine include Steel rails (a brilliant train song), Endless highway, Will you be leaving and One good reason, but there are so many great songs here and it may be that your favorite is one I haven't mentioned. The overall feel of the album is bright and upbeat.If you are unfamiliar with Alison's early music, I recommend that you buy Now that I've found you - A collection, which I've already reviewed. That includes one track from each of her early albums, plus tracks not available on any of her other albums so far. If you have that collection and you are looking for more of Alison's early music, you will enjoy this."
1,"Forget what you hear on the radio today from Elton John.  If you haven't heard this, you haven't heard *true* Elton John.  Classic!Indian Sunset is the sleeper hit.  Great story that starts slowly and builds wonderfully."
1,"In terms of hit singles and album sales, Wham! were the most popular group of 1984, bigger than Culture Club and Duran Duran.  Its second album, the fittingly-titled ""Make it Big,"" made George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley pinup boys and MTV regulars.  For all intents and purposes, this could very well be a George Michael solo record, as he produced every song on the album.  Sure, Ridgeley did co-write one song, but he's still forever known as the ultimate rock and roll sidekick whose contribution to Wham! still remains questionable.  By now, most of us are familiar with these Motown-lite pop hits (""Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go,"" ""Everything She Wants,"" ""Freedom,"" and ""Careless Whisper"") which are as frothy as a tablespoon of Cool Whip.  But beyond the singles are some album cuts that aren't half-bad: a respectable cover of the Isleys' ""If You Were There,"" the Elton-esque ""Heartbeat,"" and the ballad ""Like a Baby.""  This CD went Number One and multiplatinum, but the union turned out to be short-lived, as George and Andrew would release one more album before breaking up.  ""Make it Big"" is a record that not only lives up to its name, but it's one of the more fun pop records of the 1980s."
1,"These were the days when Michael Jackson was wholesome and innocent, and black, not some bleached skin [...]. Nevertheless, this is still the biggest selling album of all time, and Michael Jackson is a controversial celebrity. Billy Jean Beat it and the title track are highlights on a dated album that brings back memories of the 1980s like they were yesterday. The videos for Beat it, Billy Jean and Thriller were staples on MTV through most of the 90s. You can't really dock Michael Jackson- he's out of the spotlight dealings have been well documented. Now that it's years later I can appreciate this album as good music while the rest of his albums dated even worse."
1,"While considered light pop by some, Beauty and the Beat stands out among the best albums of the 80s and retains all of its fun and energy even today.  The music industry had never really seen a genuinely all-girl group, but the five talented women who joined together to become the Go-Go's did much more than sing--they wrote their own songs and played their own instruments.  I personally would not call this music punk rock, but it is fresh and brash.  Not only were these ladies having fun, they were boldly announcing to everyone that they could do whatever they wanted all by themselves.  I personally love Belinda Carlisle, and I think the less developed, rough edge to her voice works very well on these earliest recordings.  Charlotte Caffey is a terrific songwriter, guitarist, and backup singer, and the remaining players (Jane Wiedlin, Gina Schock, and Kathy Valentine) play a pivotal role in making this an enthusiastically successful team effort.There are some great tracks on this album.  Is there anyone born before 1975 who could not spontaneously sing every word of the infectious &quot;We Got the Beat?&quot;  This was one of those rare songs that never grew old, no matter how often you heard it on the radio.  The second prominent single, &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot; was also a big hit.  &quot;Lust to Love,&quot; a tune about a fun relationship unpredictably turning into a serious one, is probably my personal favorite.  The first half of this album, featuring songs such as &quot;How Much More,&quot; &quot;Tonite,&quot; and &quot;This Town&quot; is terrific.  The album loses a little steam after its midway point, though, especially when the group slows down the tempo on &quot;Automatic.&quot;  It is the only track that cannot be said to have &quot;the beat.&quot;  &quot;You Can't Walk in Your Sleep&quot; and &quot;Skidmarks on My Heart&quot; have the beat, but they don't have the energy of the earlier tracks; in addition, the lyrics of the latter song, comparing love to auto repair, have never won me over.  &quot;Can't Stop the World, &quot; written by Kathy Valentine, ends the album on a high note; the song really seems to exemplify the spirit and message of the Go-Go's.  This is just a fun album to listen to and sing along with.  Since &quot;Automatic&quot; and &quot;Skidmarks on My Heart&quot; are somewhat weak songs to my ears, I am only giving this CD four stars.  I do, however, think the first seven tracks are five stars all the way."
1,i really like rod stewart's cover of broken arrow but i much prefer robertson's version and it means even more when you know he wrote it.
1,"So, it was the 70's - and, although I admit I never was really there, I've heard it was a time of outrageous fashion, free drugs, poets, rock n roll and every outlandish thing you could think of! And they thought by 2001 we'd all live like kings and be waited on by robot-servants! Ha!But for all the fun of the 70's, this has to be 70's pop at it's best, joyous, exuberant, and just generally well crafted. This is the album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road should have been; unrelenting fun, great song after great song, while being able to whip out a heartfelt ballad or two along the way. Unlike the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road album, there is not a weak track, not any filler at all, only the last song 'High-Flying Bird' is a bit lesser than the others.Everyone beats up on 'Midnight Creeper'... I don't know why, it's SO much fun, and the sly Americana dig 'Texan Love Song' is so funny, with lyrics about wanting to shoot them 'long-haireds' and all... it's great to be able to pick up a pop record where all the songs are as good as the hits. Rating ****1/2"
1,"First of all,let me just say I am only sixteen-years-old,but I know a masterpiece when I hear one and tapestry IS one. I know,I should be off listening to Backstreet Boys and Christina Aguilera(who happen to be two of  my favorite artists/groups)but I love all music. This has to be the best  album of the seventies. Tapestry is amazing. It's no wonder that it spent  15 weeks at number 1 and stayed on the charts for a fantastic 6 years!  Carole King's voice is unmistakable and powerful. Her jamming piano  completely makes the song &quot;I Feel the Earth Move.&quot; Then there are  such gems as &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;It's Too  Late&quot; which also make the album outstanding. All music lovers have to  have Tapestry in their collection. It can appeal to everyone of every age."
1,Bruce has never been afraid to mix politics and love together. He shows it in this album..his humanistic style and compassion toward the human race show through with multi-colored success!
1,"Coming off &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; movie and soundtrack on a high note, comes Neil Diamond's Autumn 1981 release &quot;On The Way To The Sky&quot;. It is here where you'll find the major AOR/pop hit &quot;Yesterday's Songs&quot; and the major-minor hits &quot;Be Mine Tonight&quot; and the title track. &quot;Right By You&quot; should have been a major AOR/pop hit in it's own right, with its mellow, infectious bluesy rhythms. &quot;OTWTTS&quot; features rockin', semi-up-tempo numbers as well, in the uniquely titled &quot;Fear Of The Marketplace&quot; and in the melancholicly titled &quot;Rainy Day Song&quot;, which will give you a quick pick me up on a cloudy day. &quot;Guitar Heaven&quot; will literally and figuratively have you floating on Cloud Nine upon the first listen! Tom Hensley's and Alan Lindgren's orchestral arrangements and talents are really extraordinary and tastefully done in the compositions &quot;Only You&quot; and &quot;Save Me&quot;, among other selections featured on this CD. &quot;The Drifter&quot; and &quot;Love Burns&quot; are fine tracks as well. With all these brilliantly arranged cuts to choose from, and with the never-ending listening pleasure &quot;On The Way To The Sky&quot; is sure to bring you, and at around ..., is cheaper than most round-trip airline tickets. Buckle up, and have a pleasant flight!"
1,"Carole King may not be remembered only as a 70s Superstar for her overwhelming masterwork in ""Tapestry"". This album is quite a good one too!Please pay special attention to ""Nightingale"", ""You're Something New"", ""The Best Is Yet To Come"", and of course the superhit ""Jazzman"".  To be included in any 70s serious music collection, of course!"
1,"Well, I did not order this one from Amazon. Actually, I picked this up way before I was even shopping on Amazon. But Amazon is still the bomb! Anyway, I picked this cd up when it first came out in the 90's and it is STILL on rotation in my cd changer. The ladies love it and so do I. Now, I realize that R. Kelly is in a little trouble but hey, no one is perfect and we've all done things we are not proud of so, I'll continue to support his music. I'm not sure what he does in his personal life but I'll say this; what he does inside the studio allows me to do what I gotta do inside the crib. YMMV! Neosoul06...."
1,"This is another band that early on meshed genres for a good and unique sound. When I think of &quot;Vivid&quot;, I think pop, funk, metal, punk, and meaningful lyrics. But most of all I just think it rocks. Between &quot;Corey Glovers&quot; singing, and &quot;Vernon Reids&quot; guitar, it's a really impressive and tight album. I suspect their best. Plus now we get it with bonus tracks, and remastered. Other than the huge hit &quot;Cult Of Personality&quot;, this includes &quot;Open Letter (to a landlord)&quot;, &quot;Glamour Boys&quot;, and &quot;Memories Can't Wait&quot;, which is a &quot;Talking Heads&quot; song. Overall an excellent album, and now even better than before."
1,"Dangerous is one of my favorite Michael Jackson albums along with Off the Wall. Even though they are two very different albums, more than 10 years apart, but they are both excellent. Off the Wall marks the start of Jackson's adult career, but Dangerous is the album where he really becomes an adult.The album has two main parts. Track 1-6 is the so called ""New Jack Swing part"". New Jack Swing was a branch of R&B; that ruled the early 90s but then was blown away by the much more pessimistic and violent gangsta rap later. But make no mistake, Dangerous is NOT a New Jack Swing album - it's an album with NJS influences and elements, but I would not call it a NJS album. Even though I have seen it being cited as the best selling NJS album of all times. Well, except it's not a NJS album. But the first part of the album is heavily influenced by NJS - and who better to co-write and co-produce that than one of the fathers of NJS, Teddy Riley?The collaboration resulted in international hits such as Remember The Time, In The Closet and Jam. My favorite of this branch is perhaps In The Closet - a steamy, sexy, brave track -, but Remember The Time is close too. Jam sounds like a fun dance track on the surface, but pay attention to the lyrics! I also adore She Drives Me Wild. It took me time to really get this song - for a long time it was one of my least favorites on the album, but recently it became one of my favorites. I guess I just love the way MJ is talking about his girl on this track. My least favorite track on the album is also in the NJS part - Can't Let Her Get Away. I often skip this one.The second part of the album, track 7-13, is more a classic MJ sound. Here we have gems like Who Is It, which I seriously consider one of Michael's best songs EVER! In my book it's up there with Billie Jean, even if it's less of a dance song. I love its richness, the whole structure and composition, the passion, the darkness of it, the beatbox - I just LOVE everything about that song.Since Beat It Jackson made sure to include a rock song on every album (Beat It on Thriller, Dirty Diana on Bad). Dangerous' rock song is Give In to Me, featuring Slash on guitar. I love Beat It and its video, I also love Dirty Diana, but to me Give in To Me is arguably MJ's best rock song. I just love the emotions expressed in Michael's vocal delivery.There are also two gospel songs on the album: Will You Be There and Keep The Faith. The former was the bigger hit (well Keep The Faith was not released as a single). I love both. So much soul, emotion and passion in MJ's delivery! The poem at the end of Will You Be There is kind of prophetic, considering MJ's later life.Then there is Black or White, which was the albums lead single and biggest hit. I do not think it's one of the albums strongest songs, but it was a popular song, so it definitely has its place on the album. Gone Too Soon is an emotional song about Ryan White's passing. Heal The World is often scorned as cheesy and I can understand that, it's not one of the best songs on the album, but the reason why I can accept such songs from MJ is because he clearly meant them. The song's message, as optimistic (or corny, cheesy according to the cynics in us) as it is, was a part of MJ, so while it's not one of his greatest songs I'm not bothered by having it on the album.The last track on the album is the title track, Dangerous, which kind of summerizes the two main parts before it. Teddy Riley returns on this track as a co-writer, co-producer, but Bill Bottrell (who co-produced several songs of the second part) appears as a co-writer as well. So this song kind of unifies both big parts. I think this song should have definitely been a single. Too bad it wasn't.Overall the album is full of hits, very versatile musically and lyrically as well. It never gets boring and more than 20 years on it's still one of my favorite albums."
0,"Like always with AF releases, the sound is just so bad and lifeless. As ususal a reverse remaster job by the ""great"" Hoffman or Gray. The plot is suck the life out of the music and make it sound dull. Take away the sparkle and details. Why are not this company exsposed yet? Why do people use USD 30 to buy these discs? It really annoys me that this company still releases discs. It is an offense to the artists."
1,"No big social commentary here, no intellectual thoughts, no harding hitting politics...JUST PURE FUN.  The world needs more pure fun.If you are looking for a party CD, this is one."
1,"One of Billy Ocean's best releases, this album features a nice mix of funky upbeat cuts (&quot;Stand And Deliver&quot;, &quot;Gun For Hire&quot;) and romantic &quot;Quiet Storm&quot; ballads (&quot;The Colour Of Love&quot;, &quot;Here's To You&quot;). The highlight of the album is the FULL-LENGTH version of the huge hit &quot;Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car&quot; (the version on his Greatest Hits CD was a shorter radio edit). This album is filled with fun pop music, but there are enough sophisticated touches to keep it interesting (such as a trumpet solo on the uptempo song &quot;Pleasure&quot;). For fans of elegant 80s music, this will be a nice addition to your collection."
1,Bon JoviCrossroad (Icon/14 classic grooves)Bon Jovi is a terribly over-rated band but they did make a handful of nice pop-rock hits and this CD has all of them.
1,"Yeah, you.  You know you went to at least one REO concert in the '80s, assuming you were born by then.  And as much as you may consider yourself an upstanding citizen who now listens to more legitimate talents such as Dave Matthews -- okay, I make little joke -- you and I both know that there's a place in your heart for this stuff.  It's okay: I won't tell anyone.Maybe you had to be there, but if you were, I'm betting that you'll know what I mean when I say that there's something that's just plain timeless and fun about this one.  It takes itself so very seriously, but it's not *entirely* unjustified in doing so -- especially considering that these were fairly dark days for music, and folks like Styx were running around instigating much greater crimes against humanity than were on display here.  _Hi Infidelity_ shows melody and exuberance and overproduction and fairly atrocious lyrics slammed together into one big piece of something that I persist in believing is actually fairly decent, all things considered.  Your mileage may vary."
0,"I think this is a very over-rated artist getting by, for the most part, on her looks. Many of her songs are based on the same heavy beat, reminiscent of Queen's &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, so they sound the same. Also, her  lyrics are usually silly &amp; superficial (&quot;Man! I Feel Like a  Woman&quot;, &quot;That Don't Impress Me Much&quot;, &quot;Rock This  Country&quot;...). Her first CD (before she started writing her own  material) was her best."
1,"Makaveli, Tupac Shakur's alter ego, was hot. This is a great album. Songs like 'Bomb First','Hail Mary' and 'Life of An Outlaw' set this album off. The only song on here that I really dont like is 'Just Like Daddy.' The rest of the album is hot (as always). Tupac was the greatest artist of my generation. He was a poet. RIP."
1,"When I first bought this Tupac album in 1996 I was at a different mindset in place spiritually. Now I make it point not to buy explict albums.  I have always been a fan of Tupac he was a evolution had he lived he would have been Living Legend in his art form of writing a creating his words into music you really felt his fun, pain, sorrow and sadness.  I blieve this album was a defining moment from him released from Prison and new label and coming out with this album was reflection a soul so ahead of his time his music will live on for years, years to come.  Thanks to his mother developing and keeping his vision and mission alive.  Some of my favorite songs are Califoria Love.  Just some other songs I really like.12. California Love (RMX) [Remix] - Dr. Dre13. I Ain't Mad at Cha - Danny Ray14. What'z Ya Phone No. - Danny RayI truly believe Tupac was one the Greatest Rapper, Lyrictist at the time of his death and still now with his death.  The sadness is he is not here to put his touch on those songs he wrote.Sure, the other great rappers but none that will compare to Tupac he was of a class of his own.  To bad there are no clean version that I am aware of.  But, at the time this would have been lost and translation of a Young Man finding his self with a world of conflict, struggles and growth.  I would encourage a person who does not have this album to go a purchase to find out the real tupac before his death.  If I could give this album a 10 stars I would.  It is Simply a Essentially Fine Piece of Art Work with Tupac Words.May he Rest In Peace-Tupac -"
1,"Bruce is from Ottawa, although a major part of the early days and his management company are focused on Toronto. Celtic-Islamic? What?!!?Cockburn's guitar sryle is blues-jazz based with a strong roots element to it, but I've never thought of him as Celtic, and certainly where Islamic came from, Allah only knows. Can he please be called quintessentially Canadian, which should mystify the great labelizers of the music world enough to give Cockburn the room he needs to create extraordinary music.Those quibbles aside, this is rightly one of BC's absolute gems, particularly this far into his career. There is a wild range of emotions running through these songs, and Bruce's fretwork (I still can't believe celtic-islamic) is dazzling, Allah and Ossian be praised. The chugging train rhythm of the opening track sets an authentic roots tone to a deeply personal statement, and back up vocals from Jonatha Brooke and Ani De Franco give this CD an urgency.""Pacing the Cage,"" written in the dismal environs of Philadelphia, is as dire an assessment of fate as I have ever heard. It absolutely breaks your heart. ""Coming Rains"" rejoycefully rebounds the spirit, and ""Birmingham Shadows"" is one of those brilliant Cockburn epics, part poem, part lyric that hint at a love, perhaps illicit, at least dangerous, yet determined to flourish and become consummated regardless of the potential for oppression. ""Mines of Mozambique"" returns Cockburn to the political arena. Throughout these 9 songs, Cockburn presents intoxicating landscapes and passionate human dramas. He is far and away one of the very greatest of North American writers and a crafter of melodies that live with the listener a very, very long time.Cockburn is his own man, certainly an exitentialist and christian kind of hero, and as he addresses his topics, he very willingly breaks the bonds that any label might impose upon him. You would be better served taking the man on his own merits. These merits are extraordinary. This is one of his very best collections."
1,"This is one of my favourite albums! I don't know why, but I just started liking the Go-Go's earlier this summer and bought this CD. I wasn't dissapointed one bit! My favourite songs are &quot;We Got The Beat&quot;, &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot;, and &quot;How Much More&quot;. The rest of the CD is equally awesome. I really recommend this CD to anyone. I love 80's music and this is some of the best of it! They're pretty much a rock version of the Spice Girls (or, rather, the Spice Girls were a pop version of them). Except that the Go-Go's write their own stuff and actually play their own instruments, which is the way it should be anyways. I love this CD start to finish, and I know you will too! Just have a listen and you'll be captivated! I really recommend this purchase. ENJOY!!!!!"
1,"Their first project of new material in six years, the Moody Blues reunion album ""Octave"" was the last  studio recording featuring original mellotron man Michael Pinder, whose heart wasn't really into staying with the Moodies anymore, and was somewhat disappointed with the results of this album.  I can understand why.  All the songs have a more muddled, murky and unfocused sound quality to them compared to the Moodies previous works, and even more so in comparison to their ""Long Distance Voyager"" album which bolted up to #1 on the Billboard album chart three years later in 1981.  ""Octave"" sported two singles in ""Steppin' In A Slide Zone"" and ""Driftwood"", and compared to previously released singles from years earlier, neither charted very well. ""Top Rank Suite"" has the cheesiest lyric on any Moody Blues album; how does ""a good bowl of chili at the jazz club"" grab ya?  Seriously, it's there! It's not a great Moody Blues album, but no doubt Moodies fans were overjoyed just the same to see the band back together and more importantly, STAY together as a group for many years thereafter despite the eventual departure of Pinder. And Pinder's last musical testament as a member of the Moodies, ""One Step Into The Night,"" is included on this CD.  Worthy of 3 1/2 stars.Now how about nominating The Moody Blues for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame???"
0,"The stupid album title is an indicator of greater lameness to come. This album made me want to vomit. Actually, I'm ashamed to admit I ever owned it, even if only on vinyl."
1,"In 1992, everything was about grunge and flannel. Enter Rage Against The Machine. While everyone was finding a way to rip off Seattle bands, RATM were smelling revolution instead of teen spirit. RATM weren't the first ones to rap over riffs (see: Anthrax's &quot;I'm The Man&quot;), but they were the first to really do something with it. Melding Black Sabbath-esque guitars, Public Enemy political raps, and a punk rock tinge in both their music and intensity, RATM gave birth to an animal known as &quot;Rage Against The Machine&quot; that would forever change music. RATM's anti-government political stance in their songs is as relentless as Tom Morello's riffing. Just look at the names of these songs: &quot;Take The Power Back,&quot; &quot;Wake Up,&quot; &quot;Know Your Enemy,&quot; &quot;Freedom&quot;--this isn't your typical rock album here, folks. Everything hear has a meaning, and it doesn't stoop down to the level of sticking cookies up your girlfriend's ... Zack De La Rocha's furious vocals are nothing short of amazing. Every lyric, every gasp of air he takes, and every scream shakes the skull like only Fat Freddie could dream of. &quot;Instead I warm my hands on the flames of the flag&quot; goes one line, &quot;So called facts are fraud, they want us to allege and pledge, and bow down to their God&quot; goes another. Then, there's Tom Morello--my personal pick for the greatest guitarist ever. Taking a page from Tony Iommi's book (Black Sabbath--maybe you've heard of 'em?), Tom's guitars are dark and sludgy--but with that extra punk rock kick that guitarists in Iommi's era were missing. But while Iommi had those dark, sludgy, demonic riffs, Morello has dark, mean, ugly and nasty riffs that are fueled by punk rock rage. And who could forget Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk? Hands down, one of the best rhythm sections in rock history. Tim and Brad alone are amazing musicians--Tim's bass playing rivals Flea's, and Brad's drumming is fast, powerful and devastating--but together, there's no stopping them. They're funky, they're awesome, and they never fall victim to being redundant. As a whole, RATM are unrivaled. Limp Bizkit, Taproot, Papa Roach, etc. couldn't get the rap-metal formula right with hand-written instructions from RATM stapled to their foreheads. It's easy writing a review were you disect a song and talk about its good or weak points. But not here. You see, ALL these songs are top-notch, rock classics. From the religion bashing of &quot;Killing In The Name,&quot; to the goverenment bashing of &quot;Know Your Enemy,&quot; to &quot;Freedom&quot; which is about Leonard Peltier, this disk is perfect anyway you look at it. But my personal favorite was &quot;Freedom.&quot; Saving the best for last, RATM create a relentless rock song that is up there with &quot;Bulls On Parade.&quot; The way the song rolls and stops, then kicks into high-gear, and then builds up with so much tension and explodes like the atom bomb is just perfect. &quot;Rage Against The Machine&quot; is sheer perfection, any which way you look at it. It's aggressive, it's defiant, it's intelligent, it's groundbreaking, and it's a masterpiece. Just like all the classic albums, this one will forever stand the test of time."
1,"The GZA is a complex, but hardcore artist who put out a classic in the making. Liquid Swords is a must get for any Wu-Tang fan. Songs like &quot;Cold World&quot;, &quot;4th Chamber&quot;, &quot;Shadowboxin'&quot;,  &quot;Swordsman&quot;, &quot;Investigative Reports&quot;, and my favorite  &quot;Duel Of The Iron Mic&quot; makes this album historic. This is  definately a must get. Peace to the Wu."
1,"Comin out of Texas, UGK's third full-length Jive album ""Ridin' Dirty"" is contradictious, because the rhymes are dirty, but the beats are clean as hell!!  The album is bumpin' from start to finish.  The production is some of the best I have ever heard from any region, south, north, west, east, whatever.  Production is held by Pimp C, 3-2, N.O. Joe, and Sergio.  Beats are heavy Southern G-Crunk and deep-fried funk, with some smoother joints. The lyricism is awesome.  I love the way these two flow and complement each other.  ""One Day,"" produced by 3-2, is a deeper song about the unpredictable ways of life, and how some heads are really trippin' over a gorgeous, faster, twangy Isley sampled beat.  ""Murder"" is a crazy and awesome crunk type joint with heated flows; check the bass on this one.  ""Hi-Life"" is smoother, slow rollin' G-Funk dropping street sociology about the drug trade cycle, a classic!  A cool street jam is ""That's Why I Carry"" over a heavy N.O. Joe (he also raps the hook); this one explains why they stay strapped.  ""Good Stuff"" is a danceable, twangy sex joint.  ""Pinky Ring"" is a dope pimpin' joint with deep twang; just listen to those guitar riffs, a nice joint to roll in the cady with the fuzzy dice hangin' off the mirror!  You can hear the DJ Screw influence in ""Diamonds And Wood,"" beat by Pimp C, a slower crunkish joint, an awesome rider anthem for flossin' your whip.  3 In The Mornin' is perfect for the late night cruise; the beat is relaxed G-Funk influenced, but with less melody.  This has to be their best album.  It just has an awesome vibe to it, and is one of my favorite albums in my collection, and the album is a pinnacle and a standard setter for southern rap!  This is my first UGK album, and it solidified me as afan of theirs."
1,"In the late 1970's Grace Jones became something of a Disco Diva as she burst onto New Yorks club scenes with Disco hits such as I Need A Man and Do Or Die. However in 1980 following a new record deal with Island Records, home to various Reggae acts, Jones achieved further mainstream recognition with the superb Warm Leatherette album.Grace Jones shifted musical direction for the Warm Leatherette (1980) project, divulging into a diverse blend of sounds and styles ranging from Reggae, Rock, New Wave, Funk and Soul. The finished results were some of Jones most compelling recording work.This album was not least aided by the excellent production skills of Chris Blackwell and Alex Sadkin as well as the startling muscians behind her with Sly Dunbar on drums, Robbie Shakespeare on bass guirtars, Barry Reynolds and Michael Chung alternating on guirtars, Wally Badarou assuming keyboard duties and Uzziah Thompson jamming away on that pounding percussion. Jones inserts effectively through all eight of these inventive recordings as well as providing her own backing vocals.The title track Warm Leatherette is an electric affair combining a striking mixture of Rock, New Wave and Reggae. Jones sounds even a little playful on the tracks chrous consisting of thrashing guirtar riffages.Jones fantastic cover version of The Pretenders, Private Life is given a more definitive and unique working over where Jones seemingly scowls through the duration of each verse whilst then singing gently in that raw (though narrow) vocal style she became accustomed to on her next pair of albums. Private Life, encapsulating Reggae and New Wave vibes, deservedly became one of Jones' biggest hit singles in the U.K where it climbed its way to No.17 on the main U.K Top 40 Charts.The bouncy, Funk-driven A Rolling Stone (which Jones co-wrote) featured Jones delivering a surprisingly more soulful performance whilst her rocking interpretation of Bryan Ferrys' Love Is The Drug is masterful with Jones delivery strong and assertive.Jones' cover of an old Motown track The Hunter Gets Captured By The Game is instantly infectious with a sturdy lead by Jones and contagious musical arrangements that makes this one of the projects highlights.Bulls*** is a little bland and silly and is the only real let down of the album though Jones does manage to slightly redeem it by delivering a spirited performance though of far stronger musical merit was the mellower tone of Breakdown, where Jones delivery is seemingly cradled with mixed emotions shifting from shining self-assurance to points of dispair and moments of vulnreability.Pars conveys the more breathy, seamless quality in Jones voice that rarely surfaced on a lot of her earlier work at Island Records. The mood is more mellow and atmospheric with Jones becoming immersed into the swirling orchestrations.Warm Leatherette (1980) alongside her subsequent release Nightclubbing (1981) contains some of her the very best tracks Jones ever recorded in her relatively short and somewhat erratic recording career and incidentally also became one of her biggest sellers. Without doubt, essential Grace Jones to fans of this extraordinary and off-the-wall Diva.Ian Phillips"
1,Who doesn't like Clapton? Derek and the Dominos music has always been some of my favorite Clapton and this album of great classics doesn't disappoint!
1,"The Jam's Sound Afects, although hardly punk, is a great album. It is more  like pop rock. Paul Weller was a great song writer and this album shows  that. The highlights of the album are Monday, Start!, That's Entertainment  and Man In The Corner Shop."
1,"Although It's not as Heavy as his other songs I've Heard. Nor as Good As 1-800-C.o.l.l.e.c.t., It's good , It has ICE T on it, Mack 10, but thats not what makes it good, despite it's shortcomings compared to previous works, Spice 1 still does it gritty. Spice is a Good Story teller."
1,"You know the one thing that's quite unusual about Caribou is how the bonus tracks are organized.  I mean right after the depressingly downbeat ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"" and the tragic and sad story of a man who walks into a bar and shoots several people in ""Ticking"", we're treated to a more upbeat and positive atmosphere with Elton's cover of ""Pinball Wizard"".  Right after the grim nature of ""Cold Highway"" that mentions a story concerning a dangerous road where one of Bernie's friends was killed, we're treated to the upbeat and happy ""Step Into Christmas"".  After this song -if you happen to have your CD on repeat- it goes back to the beginning and ""The Bitch Is Back!""  The order of the tracks is just really strange, haha.Well to be honest with you, perhaps since I love everything Elton John has done in the 70's anyway (with the exception of the disastrous disco sellout that is Victim of Love which I pretend doesn't exist) I truthfully can't find any really major faults with Caribou.  While it's true the average music fan would find tracks such as ""Grimsby"" and ""Dixie Lily"" as pure filler, the gigantic Elton John fan in me believes otherwise!  These are just innocent, colorfully arranged simplistic country songs that are actually totally appropriate for the month I'm writing this review- mid-April when the flowers are growing and spring is in full blossom.  In the case of ""Grimsby"", you can definitely tell it's a rushed effort thanks to the lazy way Elton sings the chorus.  When you buy the remastered version of Caribou, you will read that the band only had a little more than a week to make the entire album.  With THAT in mind, isn't it quite fascinating that the music is as good as it is?I used to HATE ""The Bitch Is Back"".  It took many years for me to warm up to the horns and the funky style that seemed unnatural to me for the longest time.  I love it now.  Funny how our tastes can change so dramatically as we grow up.  ""Pinky"" is a wonderful ballad with... oh alright I'll put aside my Elton fanboy ways and admit that the arrangements are fairly standard.  I still love it though.  The chorus is especially beautiful with the pleasant ""ahhhhh"" humming in the background that's an Elton trademark.  I love that sound.  I never could figure out if that's Elton singing that way or another band member.  Nobody can understand a single word from ""Solar Prestige a Gammon"" and guess what?  According to the notes you're not supposed to, haha.  I thought it was German!  I don't know WHAT it is- all I know is that the chorus is wonderful and reminds me of sitting outside an Italian pizza place.  ""You're So Static"" contains a REALLY good chorus- it repeats quite a bit, but I love it anyway.  The horns give it character.""I've Seen the Saucers"" is another example of quality writing that should have been more well-known when you listen carefully to the vocals- they are definitely hit-worthy.  ""Stinker"" used to BE really stinky to me but now that I've warmed up to the funky horns that occupy a good portion of the album, I don't find a track like this nearly as annoying as I once did.  It's probably a couple minutes overlong, though.  We all know the hit ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"" and I'm probably the only person on the planet that believes the verse melody and the dramatic and decorative piano arrangements are the moments that *make* this song so darn good.  Most people will say this is Elton's way of warming up before getting to the chorus, but the way Elton stretches his range really is a fascinating thing.  Who knows, perhaps being left-handed makes me think the wrong way, lol.""Ticking"" as I mention above, is a compelling song with lyrics that seem to predict the troubled minds of the young generation and the way they create unexplainable violence with guns and revenge.  Back in 1974 lyrics like these were probably considered an unlikely tragedy but nowadays?  This stuff happens all the time, I'm afraid.  Just turn on the news and see.  I love how Elton REALLY gets into it- as the song rolls along even the piano playing takes an aggressive and angry turn as Elton builds his emotions and expresses the surreal lyrics as chillingly as possible.  A VERY haunting song.The bonus tracks... well I definitely like ""Step Into Christmas"" the most.  It seems lately that it's cool to bash a song like this.  I'm not sure why either.  I mean, when Christmas comes around I always though ""Step Into Christmas"" was right up there with a certain John Lennon and Emerson, Lake & Palmer song in terms of ""Best Christmas songs by rock artists"" but I guess most people think otherwise these days.  I love it though.  ""Step into Christmas, the admission is free-e-e!""  I never really thought too highly of Elton's version of ""Pinball Wizard"".  He seems to take his vocal range to a REALLY unnatural and helium-voiced level and it's definitely not as good as the Who's version, that's for sure.  ""Cold Highway"" has very good vocals and ""Sick City"" has a memorable chorus for the way the jazzy arrangements give it some juice.Overall, I love Caribou, and it's honestly only one small step down in quality compared to Goodbye Yellow Brick Road."
1,"I was introduced to E-40 and The Click with ""Mr. Flamboyant"" and 40's flow was so tight I had to get it.  Though it's not the original copy/release from 1991-1992, Down & Dirty is still tight.  Sick Wid' It Records was the first independent rap label to get at least a million advance.  Studio Ton did a mojority of this release that was quickly picked up and imitated by southern producers.  ""Mic Check"" is a good display of the talent of the fast, slang filled rhymes of the crew.  The original funk on ""On A Mission"" about retaliation on another click having game being told instead of a hook.  ""...I'm sideways, doing about a buck fifty / took another exit to another part of the city...""  how 40 water started on ""Let's Get Drunk"".  The Hillside of Vallejo, California family that started a lot of the slang that we now say and need their due recognition on this dirty release."
1,More Joan Jett and the Blackhearts are awesome. This is rock and roll.
1,"I don't know if I could pick one album to be the clear best, but &quot;What's Going On&quot; is definitely a strong contender. Everything about this album is spectacular. The lyrics are always inspiring and beautiful, and the vocals are wonderful throughout the entire album. Also, the production is incredible, with dense layers of instruments, vocals, and percussion making for a symphonic blend that's so deep you hear new things every time you listen.With all parts of the album combining into a wonderful whole, it's no surprise the album is so addictive. It can be listened to daily, over and over again, and never once wears out its welcome. &quot;What's Going On&quot; is a masterpiece that anybody who likes music should have to own. Brilliant."
1,"Acquired solely to duplicate my vinyls-to-digital collection, but a &#34;must have&#34; for MJ collections (before all the contraversy).  blah, blah."
1,"I was about 14 years old when I heard this album for the first time--and then as now, what blew me away about it was the conviction, and the songwriting.Melody beats bombast every time--refer to Van Halen's early albums for this lesson--and song for song, ""The Great Radio Controversy"" is arguably Tesla's best album (others give that title to ""Psychotic Supper"").  ""Hang Tough"" (not to be confused with NKOTB), ""Lady Luck"", ""Lazy Days, Crazy Nights"", and ""Makin Magic"" all sway from verse/chorus/verse in various tempos but never vary in quality.Besides, the harmony vocals are what set Tesla aside from their contemporaries--see them as a smart Poison with better chops and even better taste in influences.  Check out ""Love Song"" (one of the best power ballads of all time), and ""Paradise"" (note the G'n'R homage in the 2nd half of the song) for proof.It's aged a little--I have to be honest--but it still holds up."
1,"1966 was an annus mirabilis for rock music. The greatest bands of the British Invasion - The Beatles, The Stones, The Kinks - began to reliably deliver sets of all original material instead of dividing their LPs between covers and originals. (The Who's first great album was released in 1967.) Moreover, the LP became more important as a complete artistic statement, resulting in great records (Revolver, Aftermath, Face To Face) rather than simply great singles. While great but fairly simple pop music had been produced prior to this year, 1966 was the year in which rock bands began to challenge themselves, and their audience, with more sophisticated songcraft.The Beach Boys' 1966 release Pet Sounds was the best example of an American band making this leap. Inspired by the previous year's Rubber Soul, Beach Boys mastermind Brian Wilson,along with lyricist Tony Asher, was determined to make a record that would keep them on par with the Fab Four commercially and artistically. Many - including Paul McCartney himself, maybe - would argue that Pet Sounds surpassed Rubber Soul's achievements, only to be outdone itself a few months later by Revolver. (I flatter myself to think that people have read my other reviews, but I make it clear time and again that Sgt Pepper was just another Beatles album, so I am going to disregard it here.) Whatever the case my be, Pet Sounds turned out to be a huge critical smash on both sides of the Atlantic. Strangely, it was less of a commercial hit in America not only than it was in Britain, but than its predecessors in the US had been.I will try, even if I have already partially failed, to avoid rehashing everything that has already been said about Pet Sounds, and attempt to review it strictly on its musical merits and how well it has endured over the past 40 years. By these standards, it is factually a great and  truly unique record. One would search in vain for Chuck Berry-style riffs and solos that were a trademark of their previous records. In fact, the closest thing one finds to guitar riffs at all are the plethora of plump, high-pitched bass lines. But not to worry about the trademark vocal harmonies. They are as plentiful and as gorgeous as ever. The singles are clearly the pillars of the album, and are enough by themselves to make this a worthy record. But while ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"", ""Sloop John B"", ""God Only Knows"", and ""Caroline No"" are all great, ""Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)"", ""That's Not Me"", ""Here Today"", and ""I Know There's An Answer"" are also exceptionally vital numbers. The remaining songs are not quite as great, but they are good enough to help earn Pet Sounds the reputation that it has. Even the two instrumentals are quite strong, and serve as highlights for the unprecedented variety of instrumentation throughout the disc, including tympanis, horns, tubas, Christmas-y bells, and of course, the Theremin. The overall sound of the record is wholesome and magical, and finds kindred spirits in late-Sixties LPs such as Love's Forever Changes and Odessey and Oracle by The Zombies, and in more recent releases like The Flaming Lips' The Soft Bulletin. Hence, Pet Sounds was not a traditional rock record at all when released in May 1966. Rather, it was the origin of what would come to be called baroque or chamber pop.Influence and endurance are essential to an album's ""greatness"". However, it seems to me that sometimes influence and endurance are overemphasized and used to hide the fact that a given record's songs are not really all that good. Ultimately, what good is a great record if it doesn't have great songs on it? Pet Sounds needn't worry about lacking any of the necessary elements. But most importantly, it is the songs themselves that would earn this record the high rating that I have awarded it even if it were not so influential and enduring. In terms of its standing in the Beach Boys catalog, it is obviously their best record, but it is also something equally important: the point at which the sun began to set on these California boys' endless summer. Gone are the surfboards, fast cars, and hamburger stands. That isn't to say that they wouldn't return, but at this time Brian Wilson was dealing more with the fleeting nature of the pleasures of youth, embodied by Caroline, who said she'd never change, but did. In doing so, he created a record that is artistically influential, historically enduring, and - with nary a weak track - truly Great."
1,"As I've discussed in my previous review of the same title,Innervision reputation preceeds it.The newly remastered version(8 of the 9 tracks appears in remastered form on At the Close Of A Century box set)also  includes a better packaging job compared to its first pressing as well as  superior sound quality that makes this sounds like listening to it for the  first time all over again.Like the rest of his 70s masterpieces(Music Of My  Mind,Talking Book,Fullfillingness...)this remastering project give his  music the respect that it has always accorded with the sound quality it  deserves."
1,"This is Dylan's most talked-about LP from his post 1960s career, and while initially the critics were unsure about it, BLOOD ON THE TRACKS rapidly became perceived as one of the most impressive albums Dylan has cut.  The song-writing is strong and assured, and Dylan is as cryptic as ever.  Yet there also seems to be a central theme here: broken relationships.  When asked about this album's reception, Dylan said he never truly understood why people enjoy that kind of pain.Anyone familiar with art know that some of the best art in the world comes from pain.  Bob Dylan's music from 1969 to 1974 was very much characterised by a sort of domesticity which was the central undercurrent to most of his music, being characterized by his familia lifestyle.  While the music found on these albums (NASHVILLE, SELF-PORTRAIT to some extent, NEW MORNING, and PLANET WAVES) are sometimes exciting (especially NASHVILLE, the best of the lot), generally they never quite rise to the level of the artistically impeccable.While the domesticity was heartfelt and sincere, it seems Dylan was too content with his life to put a lot into his art.  There was no central drive like there was in the early days, when Dylan wanted to be the next Woody Guthrie, and then the more poetic direction of the mid 1960s, and then a more mellow country direction.  Dylan was too interested in pursuing this path to make us care about the music found on NEW MORNING, etc.  Now, however, he must channel that pain through into his art so he can deal with it.  There's a real passion here that's lacking in the other albums of this period.  This is the culmination of his mellow period, driving Dylan to an artistic catharsis because of a new ingredient in the mix of domestic bliss: pain.This is the reason why BLOOD ON THE TRACKS stands as one of Dylan's most impressive LPs.However, there is a common misconception about BLOOD.  These very painful songs are oft attributed to Dylan's crumbling marriage.  As other reviews have noted, Dylan has stated that this is not a tribute to his rapidly disintegrating marriage to Sara Lowndes.  An artist can use something in their life as a springboard for their art, writing not really about the situation but using the situation as their inspiration to create art.  This may be difficult to understand, and the only reason I believe this is because I also write and I have also experienced this phenomena, which is difficult to understand but I assure you it does exist.  So, BLOOD is not about his crumbling marriage, yet paradoxically it is.Many of Dylan's albums have a central song which all the others can relate too, or you can base your understanding of that album from that one song.  This is most clearly evident on BLOOD ON THE TRACKS, as this track will not only help you understand BLOOD, but also the influence of the painters on Dylan.  There is also a key song to which you base your understanding on: Tangled Up in Blue.  This track approaches a situation from multiple points of view (povs) and chronologically is all over the map.  The past, present, and future merge into one central mass of experience in which time does not have any distinction.  The rest of the album takes its cue from this one song, playing almost like a concept album about pain in human relationships between the sexes.BLOOD ON THE TRACKS becomes a cubist affair, and &quot;Tangled&quot; gives you the direction in which you need to direct your attention if you really want to understand BLOOD.  BLOOD is about Dylan's relationships with the women in his life, and while all of them are about Sara, one is specifically about Elsie who he was seeing when he cut this album (&quot;You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome&quot;), and yet even that's about Sara, and yet, as I will discuss later, it is not about Sara at all.  But this album records various elements of their relationships at various times, floating on the lake of time rather than swimming in it as most narratives do. This facet of BLOOD shows the influence the painters have had on Dylan, and also brings a great amount of complexity to BLOOD which would otherwise be lacking.This understanding also helps better ease &quot;Jack of Hearts&quot; into its proper place on the album, telling a dense allegory in the old West which is just as relevant to Dylan's pain as the rest of this is.  Although some have looked at this track with disdain, to me it's one of the best tracks on this album and if you get it, this song fits in perfectly.A lot of BLOOD tracks were cut in 1974.  About half the original cuts were deleted from this album and rerecorded.  Dylan cops out here, with the single exception of &quot;Idiot Wind,&quot; which benefits from being recut while the others do not.  The original tracks betrayed to much of the pain he was going through.  BLOOD ON THE TRACKS is remarkable in that it should feel very disjointed, with half of the album cut with Dylan being emotionally bare and honest, and with the other half Dylan purposefully distances himself from the previous version and yet somehow this album has a cohesion which I can't explain.  The most dramatic difference in these versions is &quot;Idiot Wind,&quot; which originally Dylan sang as an sad, resigned tirade, full of pain and sorrow, and yet the released version is marked with a very real and savage sense of anger.  The anger is directed at the woman to begin with, but by the end of the song the anger is also directed against the narrator himself.  Dylan's honesty is polluted and the pain is a little more well hidden, and yet paradoxically this doesn't really matter.BLOOD is full of paradoxes.  It is about his marriage and it isn't, there's a cohesion there which shouldn't be, it is a concept album and yet it isn't.  Anyway you look at it, BLOOD is one of Dylan's must interesting albums, and also one of his best, if not the best."

1,"My native Boston based rockers The Cars released their self-titled debut in June of 1978.The Cars was formed by rhythm guitarist/singer/songwriter Ric Ocasek and bass player/singer (the late) Benjamin Orr.Prior to the formation of The Cars, Orr and Ocasek were in a popular Boston act called Cap'n Swing, along with lead guitarist and Berkeley School of Music grad Elliot Easton. They broke up in 1975 and the trio joined forces with former Modern Lovers drummer David Robinson and keyboard player Greg Hawkes in 1976.For a year they did well gigging around New England and their demo of ""Just What I Needed"" became a hugely requested song on a local Boston rock station (WBCN for those who want to know). As a result, Elektra Records signed the band and the label decided to pull out the artillery for this new band and have legendary Queen producer Roy Thomas Baker produce this incredible debut which was recorded in London, England at George Martin's AIR Studios with engineer Geoff Workman (another Queen and Journey veteran).When this album came out, it was a smash and 30 plus years later, it is still a masterpiece.The album's first three tracks were all hit singles. ""Good Times Roll"" is a great opening song on this album with a killer guitar riff and what not. Next is ""My Best Friend's Girl"" is another great song and I think of this song from the 1979 Matt Dillon film debut Over the Edge where he told a cop off as the policeman was arresting one of his friends. The song is great too with a guitar solo reminiscent to The Beatles' ""I Will"" in tone. The song that follows was ""Just What I Needed"" which was America's intro to the band and was Orr's vocal debut on a Cars track (Ben and Ric would split the vocals evenly). The track is still a staple of rock radio. This track too appeared in Over the Edge prior to the film's party scene. ""I'm In Touch With Your World"" and ""Dont'cha Stop"" are also great rockers which close the first half of the album with classic Ric vocals (Ric sang most of the first half except as noted). Those tracks ended the first half wanting more.The rock radio staple ""You're All I've Got Tonight"" kicks the second half off in a grand way and is a killer rocker (the only vocal from Ric in the second half as Ben did the rest). ""Bye Bye Love"" is next and another great rocker as well and a rock radio staple as is most of this album. We segue into the classic ""Moving in Stereo"" which is one of the band's best pieces of music and the song is forever etched in our brains as that image of Phoebe Cates in the red swimsuit coming out of the pool in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. The closing ""All Mixed Up"" is a great song as well and a great way to close this album.This album fittingly got the success it deserved and not only did New Wave fans buy and embrace this album in droves but hard rock fans did as well and sold millions and peaked in the US Top 20.This version of the album was remastered in 1998 by Joe Gastwirt and Rhino then upped the anty by issuing a deluxe edition in 1999.Highly recommended!"
1,"In my opinion, Leonard Cohen is one of the greatest singer-songwritters ever and almost everything he has recorded is gold. You really can't go wrong with any of his albums but his 1968 debut &quot;Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot; is a masterpiece. It is one of my favorite albums of all time. Every song is great and there are no fillers. &quot;Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot; is Cohen at his best lyrically, musically, and vocally. The album is overall mysterious, dark, brooding, delicate, beautiful and paints strange and amazing pictures in the mind. I have never read anything about how these songs related to Cohen's life but there is no need because Cohen makes it all so clear and you can see and feel it all happening while listening to the album. I could go on and on some more about how great this album is but I will simply say this is essential, no matter what you listen to, it's just great music."
1,"In 1980, Cyndi Lauper released an album with the band Blue Angel, which she led.  In the US, it flopped.  Then she was forced to quit because she lost her singing voice.  Doctors didn't expect her to sing again.  This almost shattered her dreams of success in music.  In the following years, she proved them wrong namely in 1984.  Those who know these events are amazed by her miraculous recovery as they listen to her sing.When Cyndi Lauper released her debut album ""She's So Unusual"" and her first single ""Girls Just Want To Have Fun"", she instantly took the world by storm.  She was often compared to Madonna, who was also newly emerging at the time.  More than just her wild image and wild antics proved that she is a true work of art.  Such quality led many critics expecting her to stay on top for many years.  She later earned the Grammy for Best New Artist for 1984.The wild pop music, which matches perfectly with her image, keeps listeners smiling through every note.  Its funky and dance additions keep the music unique and timeless.  Therefore, this is an album that capitalizes the 1980's.  The catchy beats remain catchy today.  Her throaty vocals blend perfectly with the theme and offers the added fun theme.  She never loses her edge with any song as she sings odes (...), girl power, love, and more.  Through the wildness, she rooms two ballads, which are performed beautifully: hit singles ""Time After Time"" and ""All Through the Night"".  Despite the mellow theme, the emotional value never loses its touch.Her overall musical quality have many fans looking beyond her image and crediting her rightfully as a true artist.  ""She's So Unusual"" is the essential album for any Cyndi Lauper and/ or 1980's music fan.  This will surely keep listeners dancing for many more years.  Those interested in hearing a Cyndi Lauper update should also buy her 2003 successful release ""At Last"", which launched her as the biggest comeback of that year.  This combination makes for great musical enjoyment."
1,"Life is not without ironies and this album confirms again one of rock's most interesting ones. As if his work with Genesis were not proof enough of his musical talent, Phil Collins' drumming in this album is bound to leave most drummers and non-drumming music fans speechless, as he glides through the tracks of this album by Brand X, his side project in the late seventies.One could think that something just went terribly wrong with Phil, causing him to throw his musical creativity down a deep hole when the eighties kicked in, and throw himself in the hands of commercial pop and musical recycling for a very long embrace that sadly lasts to this day. In any case, there's plenty of musical testimonies to what his musical genius was for a good decade and so, and his works with Brand X is one of them.Brand X is the brainchild of Phil Collins and Atomic Rooster's guitarist John Goodsall (same band where Emerson Lake and Palmer's Carl Palmer came), and in spite of what you'd be inclined to think, their contributions were not the only brilliant moments of this -by most considered their best- album. 'Unorthodox Behaviour' bridges the gap between jazz fusion and prog rock in a way that is unbelievable, walking a fine line (invisible, some might argue) without tumbling, and maintaining a cohesive and well crafted sound that gives the album a well deserved five stars."
1,"I have never been able to figure out why ""Fire On High"" never made it on any ELO compilation (to my knowledge). It rocks and is on the playlists of most FM stations plus it just may be their best song. Of course those stations continue to play ""Evil Woman"" and ""Strange Magic"" and they should. The biggest drawbacks of this great album is the 36 minute length and lack of remastering. Bonus tracks would be nice to add to this classic rock gem."
1,"Judas Priest's Point Of Entry was released just one year after their classic British Steel album, and the band sought to further the radio success of `Living After Midnight' et al with a more commercial sound, but failed to break big critically or commercially. The album is seen as something of a disappointment for a lot of Priest fans.Stylistically, the album isn't the fastest or the heaviest Judas Priest album you're likely to hear, the music is actually much closer to classic rock than to the heavy metal sound of the most loved Judas Priest albums.Regardless of their musical directions, all albums stand or fall on the quality of the music within. For the most part; Point Of Entry is hit and miss, a mixture of good songs and songs that are unobjectionable but just kind of forgettable, had the ratio been better then the world would have been kinder to Point Of Entry, but unfortunately the album doesn't have enough classic material to really make it a must have.The album isn't devoid of good moments, tracks like `Hot Rockin,' `Heading Out To The Highway,' and `Desert Plains,' are all enjoyable. `All The Way,' is perfectly good too if you don't mind the obvious inspiration from about five famous Kiss songs.If you like Judas Priest, you may want to check Point Of Entry out; after all you still have the guitar and vocal talent as with any Priest album, in addition to a few genuinely good songs here and there. If you are new to the band I'd advise not trying this album until you are already familiar with all the classics first.Overall, Point Of Entry is neither good nor terrible. It certainly doesn't deserve its awful reputation, but I wouldn't go as far as to say it was criminally underrated either. In summary; a decent, if somewhat forgettable album."
1,"Electric Light Orchestra is a symphonic rock band which put out huge hits during late 70s and early 80s. Their 1986 album may not be their best material for the band but it still is a fine enjoyable album enough to bring back the sweet memories during mid 80s. The only huge hit from this album is the eighth track CALLING AMERICA which went up to #18 in Billboard Hot 100 but there are some great catchy tracks such as the opening track HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS, second single SO SERIOUS, and third single in U.K. GETTING TO THE POINT. I also love SECRET LIVES, with excellent chorus. 2007 re-reissue is not only its digitally remastered edition, but it contains seven additional tracks. Among additional tracks my top favorite is IN FOR THE KILL.Verdict: Great gift for late 70s and mid 80s pop rock fansRating: Original tracks: 84 out of 100, Extra tracks: 81 out of 100Recommended for both 70s and 80s pop rock fans."
1,"It's hard to be neutral about this album, because it's been played to death over the radio, or to be neutral about this artist, who has been hyped to death by himself and others. So judging strictly the music, I'd  have to say that the album is very good. ""Beat It"" and ""Billie Jean"" are the best songs on the  album and probably the best songs Michael ever recorded as a solo artist. The title track is fun, and it was great to see it reprised in the movie ""13 Going on 30."" ""Wanna Be Startin' Something is good, if you could figure out what the heck he's singing about. The rest of the tunes don't quite hit the high standards of the previous compositions. ""Human Nature"" is a nice kiddie sounding ballad. ""The Girl is Mine"" is a dopey duet between Paul McCartney and Jackson. And the last two songs on the  album are forgettable.And since all of the great songs on this cd are available on Michael's HIStory Hits collection, I'd go with the latter."
1,"If you are only familiar with Madness' few U.S. hits (&quot;One Step Beyond&quot; &quot;Our House&quot;) this is probably the collection for you. The CD captures the basics of the sound this group put out and the influences they have had on many other bands, (Mighty Mighty Boaatones, No Doubt, Smashmouth) is evident even on this limited set. As you can read in the other reviews, this was a band that deserves a much more complete compilation. Hopefully, this CD  will make you want more Madness. If not, this is a good addition for anyone who might want to broaden their musical taste to include one of the best ska bands ever."
1,"Second time around and Rick Jame's truely gives up the funk 100%-even the two slow tunes ""Space Love"" and ""Jefferson Ball"" have enough sassy sax solo's and backup vocals for a superb late night groove!Now to the real meat-the title song is pure George Clinton-inspired P-punk-funk,if you will-all rhythm and chant.""High On Your Love Suite"" just JAMS away endlessly for over 7 minutes while ""Cop N' Blow"" is a tad smoother but grooves like mad.""Fool On The Street"" is a similar (but slightly catchier) tune that ends the album.I recommend 'Bustin' Out' as a good introduction to early Rick James-his 1978 debut had a few classic tunes but was uneven with it's halfbaked filler and disco detours.On this 19979 album there's none of that so you get the meat and potatoes of Rick's particular elan."
1,"WOW!! The Oaktown pimp really went overboard with album 8.  Just 15 months since his last album, he comes with his best and funkiest album of all 15!!!  With 13 songs of straight funk, it has 3 classics, 2 almost classics and the rest are real good or great songs.  Guests aren't all over, just on most the last half of the album, and it is mostly his Dangerous Crew clique.  The production is GREAT, in the words of DJ Quik it's ""Way 2 Fonky"".  Every song has an unreal beat and the dangerous crew posse is to thank (as well as 1 great track by QDII).  Ant Banks does 5 songs and the Dangerous Crew does 7 (no wonder this may be the best produced album I ever heard and I have over 675 rap albums! Ant Banks, Dangerous Crew and QDII -- No words here just listen and you'll understand)  A must have album for all.#1 - 8.5 (short amount of rapping and alot of talkin but tight -- nice beat as well)#2 - 9 (about him being player -- good beat)#3 - 11 (CLASSIC!!! -- GREAT BEAT and 7+ minutes of funk)#4 - 9 (dirty songa bout having no ho's -- tight beat)#5 - 8 (about money in da hood)#6 - 10 (CLASSIC and his dirtiest song ever -- nice raggae beat)#7 - 8.5 (f/ Ant Banks -- tight beat -- about how al his biaaatches are gone)#8 - 9.5 (f/ Spice 1, Goldy, Ant Banks, Pee Wee - the Dangerous Crew!! -- great beat)#9 - 8.5 (f/ Rappin Ron {R.I.P.} & Ant Diddley Dog -- dissin Pooh Man)#10 - 10 (CLASSIC w/ GREAT BEAT)#11 - 9.5 (f/ Father Dom & Ant BAnks -- tight beat)#12 - 9 (f/ Leslie Calaway -- nice beat)#13 - 8 (FM BLue f/ Too $hort)Todd Shaw -- b. 4/29/66 -- b.

1,"look at the line-up on this live recording from toronto, canada, circa the year 1953 AD. it's enough to make a jazz fans eyes bug out. charlie parker on sax, dizzy gillespie on trumpet, bud powell on piano, charles mingus on bass, and max roach on drums. holy cow! how could this not be the greatest jazz album of all-time? but amazingly, it manages not to be. go figure. anyway, if it's not the greatest jazz album of all-time, it's still fantastic; and it should be mandatory for any jazz lover to keep a copy laying around whatever one calls home. one further thing, then i'll let you get on with your life: most people seem to prefer the newer release of this concert, where the charles mingus bass work is not overdubbed, like it is on the original release. well, call me knucklehead johnson, but i actually prefer the original overdubbed release. i know, i know, i know: i'm a fool. but that's my preference, and i think that i'm entitled to one (so please don't go flying off to the unhelpful button!). if you like the undubbed version better, then i say ""God love you. Differences of opinion sure make life interesting, don't they? anyway, you can't go wrong in purchasing this recording (whatever version of it you may choose)."
1,"Many of y'all might think that ""Born To Mack"" which was released in the late 80's is hella old, and Too $hort's start at this rap sh*#. Well, you couldn't be more wrong. Too Short started rapping and releasing records EVEN EARLIER(!) -  in the earlier 80's!! He's over 20 years in the game! Anyway, in the mid/late 80's, since he was big in Oakland and the whole Bay Area, Jive Records signed Too $hort to a big contract, which made Too Short HUGE, and also added quite a few millions to his bank account throughout the years. ""Born To Mack"" was Too $hort's first album on Jive, it was released nationwide, and quickly became gold. Too $hort presented to the rap world something that they hadn't seen before - the pimp game. Too $hort was the first one to rap about pimpin', mackin', the first one to come out with nasty-a## rhymes about those ho*s, one of the first playas. All those sucker wanna-be a** pimps (like 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, etc.) act like they are some big-time pimps, but Too $hort was (and still is) the real thing. Coming from Oakland (home of ""The Mack""), Short Dog is first a pimp, then a rapper. In many ways, this music was innovative musically - some of the beats (like on Dopefiend beat) sounded VERY futuristic at that time, and defined the Bay Area sound, so popular today. Too $hort is hella young on this album, and you can see. Yet, his flow is on point (like it always is), his lyrics captivating and his storytelling skills undeniable. Add to this formula charisma , a huge ego and a great sense of humor, and you get the total package. You know the classic off this album (Mack Attack, Freak tales and Dopefiend beat) but the rest of it is extra dope too. This album symbolizes the beginning of an era. Too $hort is the one who started this pimp/playa sh**, and he is together with NWA and Ice T one of the first rappers to put the West Coast on the map. A true pioneer in this rap game. This album is a must-have to any rap fan's collection, it's the beginning. Listen to this album and see where it all started."
1,"There was no sophmore slump to be heard on Barry White's second album,following up his classic debutIve Got So Much to Givewith another album of elongated,romantic slow funk symphonies that even further bettered those featured on his previous outing. From ""Girl It's True,Yes I'll Always Love You"" on you'll realize that not only has White really beefed up his sense of rhythm but on the crawling,implicitly sexual ""Honey Please,Can't Ya See See"",""You're My Baby"" and ""Hard To Believe That I Found You"" that he'd officially mastered the James Brown derived technique of spinning off melodic,rhythmic and harmonic ideas from one song and spinning them off into another,for all intents and purposes creating new moods and flavors from different ones. One of the most fascinating aspects of this album are his extended monologues. Here Barry White comes off as a reflective yet plain talking kind of guy who wishes to let the lady he's speaking to that he not only loves them but respects their love as well. Sure there's plenty of sexual machismo behind it all but there's a mildly unrehersed quality to these monologues that totally erases any possible corniness that could've easily derived from yet. Yes I realize over the years that's become one of his signitures and is often lovingly spoofed but no matter how you cut it Barry White delivers make out funk that not only gets you in the mood but also think about the many twists and turns of love before you pull back the sheets. This is all reflect in his honeyed baritone voice,the honeyed strings and.....even the honeyed rhyhtms if you can imagine such a thing. Again in the spirit of spinning off songs into new ones ""Never Never Gonna Give Ya Up"" completely re-harmonizes and re-arranges the layored midtempo funk of ""I'm Gonna Love You Just A Little Bit More Baby"" from his debut and makes a terrific follow up. There are many people who cound this and his debut as sort of two halfs of his masterpiece and taken apart they're both masterpieces of the genre. This along with that newly reissued debut would also be the perfect albums to pick up together and listen to back to back if your just getting into Barry White's music."
1,"I listen to mostly country music.  But you would just about have to be from another planet to not know any Neil Diamond songs.  I have his original 12 Greatest Hits along with this and a few of his regular albums.  I really didn't know that many of the songs on this when I bought it on record.  I knew Forever In Blue Jeans which was about as country as anything he ever did.  All the songs are really good.  With Beautiful Noise, Desiree, America, my favorites.  Longfellow Serenade and Yesterday's Songs just a notch below them.  My least favorite is You Dont Bring Me Flowers.  I never really liked Barbra Streisand.  She's been in a few movies I liked.  And I like the cover of her Super Man album.  But her singing kind of makes me want to kill myself.  And the rest of the cd is good."
1,"I didn't get to hear the whole album until 1989, but I recall Whitesnake's impact in 1987 and 1988 with the mileage they had with it!  Dynamic rock songs here, especially Still Of The Night and Here I Go Again.  Bad Boys I also like with its attitude and fast pace! As I'm writing this, the song Is This Love might be playing on some stations.  Adult contemporary pop stations still love this record a good 17 years later!  It is a well crafted song with its reflective breaks that match with the song's lyrics and David Coverdale's longing for that woman.  I like the guitar solo, of which they play it a lot more versus the single version.  The other members such as John Sykes, Vivian Campbell and Adrian Vandenburg played an important part in this album!  I still like Still of The Night, and its rocking sections and reflective section in the middle before rocking once again. It's kind of something Led Zeppelin would do if they had continued.  This is a phenomenally done effort, one of the '80s best albums in terms of the big production and bombast!  Coverdale matched romanticism and emotional sides with aggressive rock all in one album with his band!"
1,"Donna Summer is the undisputed queen of disco. She is defintely one of THE female greats of the last century ranking right up there with Barbra Streisand, Celine Dion, and Mariah Carey. This collection represents her 70's disco material very well. All of her disco classics are here. &quot;I Feel Love&quot; is probably my favorite disco song of all time and is definitely a Donna standard. And of course you have the oddly appealing &quot;Love To Love You Baby.&quot; Of course, we can't forget her dancefloor classics &quot;Dim All the Lights&quot; and the famous last call &quot;Last Dance.&quot; The hits don't stop there. You can't have a disco/dance party without the anthem &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; and no Donna Summer collection woul be complete without &quot;Bad Girls.&quot; Donna's #1 duet with Barbra Streisand &quot;Enough Is Enough&quot; is ranked right up there with some of the most dynamic and classic pairings of all time *put two talents like them together and it's explosive.* And of course, the title track &quot;On the Radio&quot; is a favorite as is the stunning &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; which shows off her mind-boggling range and is sure to have everyone dancing.As said, this is a good compilation of Donna's 70's dancefloor standards, but if you're looking for more, I recommend &quot;Endless Summer.&quot; It includes her 80's hits as well such as &quot;She Works Hard For the Money&quot; and &quot;The Wanderer.&quot; Disco may have been a fad but one listen of this woman's music will show you Donna Summer was not."
1,"The lilting poetry of Suzanne lures the listener into Cohen's world of romantic despair while introducing the essence of his sound: a deep monotone framed by sublime female backing vocals over simple but engaging melodies. Master Song, Winter Lady and Stranger Song reinforce the desolate landscape although the melodies are less immediate. Cohen's genius shines brightly on the immortal Sisters Of Mercy, a strange mixture of the spiritual and the sensual that must be one of the most beautiful musical poems in the English language.This delicate gem is followed by the powerful and evocative So Long Marianne and the understated Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye, both masterpieces of words, melody and arrangement - the female vocals on Goodbye is especially impressive. Stories of the Street appears as a poem in one of Cohen's 1960s poetry books:Selected Poems 1956-1968and deals with a visit to Havana during of just after the revolution. Interesting fact: The line ""some girls wander by mistake"" from Teachers was later used as an album title by the goth band Sisters Of Mercy:Some Girls Wander By MistakeOne Us Cannot Be Wrong addresses the beloved in a series of strange images before moving on to melodic whistling and ending with bitter shouted la la lahs. For those interested in other artists' take on Cohen: Suzanne has been beautifully covered by inter alia Judy CollinsSings Leonard Cohen: Democracyand Geoffrey Oryema onI'm Your Fan, while Sting and the Chieftains' celtic version of Sisters Of Mercy is available on theTower of Song: The Songs of Leonard Cohentribute album. On I'm Your Fan there are interesting interpretations of Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye by Ian McCulloch, Stories Of The Street by That Petrol Emotion and So Long Marianne by James."
1,"Scandal's ""The Warrior"" is a good solid rock album with amazing vocals by Patty Smyth.  It's dark, moody, mystical and edgy with songs about those 80's break-ups which were dramatic and always messy.  My favourite tracks are ""The Warrior"" (how many times did you hear this on the radio in the 80's?), ""Less Than Half"" and ""Hands Tied"".  The lyrics speak for themselves and I relate to every line.  Love is a battlefield and Patty Smyth with Scandal know all about it.  Sing it Patti."
1,"It would be six years before another Moody Blues Album would be released, which is one of several reasons the seven albums from Days Of Future Passed to Seventh Sojourn are treated as a separate body of work. There have been some great moments since 1978, but these seven albums, including Seventh Sojourn, are a cut above.There are some great songs here ""Lost In A Lost World"" (hello ""Lost"" TV series! Buy the rights to this song. It's a natural.) ""For My Lady"" and ""New Horizon"" are all great. The original version of ""Isn't Life Strange""-just incredible. ""I'm Just A Singer In A Rock and Roll Band"" is a great finale for this chapter in their career."
1,"This is a true classic of the genre and deserves a lot more recognition than it gets. Warren G is a talented rapper and he can also put together some decent beats.Of course, the standout track here would have to be &quot;Regulate&quot;, the Warren G/Nate Dogg duet (another classic which has fallen by the wayside), with &quot;This DJ&quot;, &quot;Do You See What I See&quot; and &quot;This Is The Shack&quot; also being very strong.Warren's laid-back, Snoop-esque delivery is perfect for the G-Funk beats of this album and it contrasts perfectly with the harder tone taken by most of the other performers. The beats, as mentioned above, are typical of a G-Funk album - nothing groundbreaking but they serve the purpose. Of particular note is the sample at the start of &quot;Do You See What I See&quot; which features a man (quite possibly George Clinton) delivering a very odd monologue about the blues and apple pie.None of this album disintegrates into the problems which faced hardcore rap as the 90s wore on, there are no mindless profanities, no sex party raps, just Warren and his friends rapping about life. &quot;Do You See What I See&quot; is of particular interest to anyone interested in the history of rap as it describes how 213 (Warren's old group, with Nate and Snoop) came about and why he stopped DJing for Snoop in order to go solo.The only problem with this album is its length - far too short. Possibly Warren would have fallen off had he put anything more on to the album but it does leave the listener wanting more of this sort of thing."
1,"The Cool thing about this Disc is that it's not Part two of their first Disc which is still to me their Baddest overall even though this one is tight.I really dug the Production and the change in direction works very  Effectively here.I wasn't as crazy about their Last disc all the way thru  but Atliens hits the spot.Jazzy Belle&amp;Elevators are my cuts.Boi&amp;Dre  will last in the Biz for a Long,Long time.they are very challenging when it  comes to Content."
1,"This is the third review of an irish album I write today (the others were Cranberries) and now I'm sure about that Ireland is one of the countries producing the best music in the world. And not just commercial pop-music in the Spice Girls way. Okay, I just wanted to say something about Irish  music. Now let's say something about this album. It's great. it's  beautiful. Very good, easy listened music. If you like Enya or you just  want some easy-listened relaxing music. This is the album for you to buy!"
1,"This album took eleven months and three sessions to capture, but captures Miles' flirtation with hard bop and transition to his more pensive 'Blue period'.  For me personally this is the beginning of a window that would  encompass my favorite Miles Davis albums. Other fans may have different periods, but for me it was the Prestige years and his subsequent Quintet period culminating in 1959. Of course that reflects my personal taste and is no reflection on Miles' continuing evolution and reinvention. However, my personal tastes aside, the sound samples on this page will tell you all you need to know about this album. Listen to those and let your ears guide you.I mentioned that this album took three sessions. Here are the tracks, when and where they were recorded and by whom. The track sequence is not chronological, so I am going to provide the background info in track order.Track 1 was actually the last one recorded. It was laid down in Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio on April 3, 1954. Miles is accompanied by Dave Schildkraut on alto sax, and backed by an all0star rhythm section comprised of Horace Silver on piano, Percy Heath on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums.Tracks 2, 3 and 5 were recorded at the Beltone Studios in NYC on March 15, 1954. Miles is backed by Horace Silver on piano, Percy Heath on bass and Art Blakey on drums.The remaining tracks were the first ones recorded on May 19, 1953 at the WOR Studios in NYC. Miles is backed by John Lewis on piano (except on track 4's Smooch when Charles Mingus sits in (Mingus was a virtuoso pianist as well as a bassist), with Percy Heath on bass and Max Roach on drums.Give the sound samples a listen and decide for yourself. My copy is actually playing in the background while I write this review."
1,"Barry White's first album may be his best after all these years. The disc was a huge success for the singer who many people thought was trying to imitate Isaac Hayes. Barry's beautiful music is timeless and his arrangements and instrumentals brought the best in his rich, husky voice and made his smooth rapping style pleasant for the ladies to listen to. The opening track is White's variation of a big hit by the Four Tops and his orchestration and vocals make Barry's version arguably better than the original. The album has just five tracks but each one is an extended play with lush string arrangements and fine singing. The music here was Barry White's introduction to the soul/R&B audience and with its release, he was off and running and never looked back."
1,"first off let me praise the string arrangements by a fella named robert kirby that are amongst the most enjoyable i've heard on any pop/folk album. this album is almost sunny compared to the beautiful melancholy that prevades nick drake's other 2 masterpieces (five leaves left and pink moon, of course). bryter layter, the title track, is an instrumental that could just about fit on an antonio carlos jobim recording; buoyant spirited and fun. alto sax, viola, harpsichord, celeste, piano, flute and backing vocals all add to make this quite a different affair than the other drake recordings. l love all nick drake's work and each of the 3 albums that he made in his short lifetime are so spectacular it's hard to say which is my favorite. whatever one i'm listening to at the moment is almost always dearest to my heart. if you have yet to experience this great artist's music, just dive into it: on five leaves left, bryter layter, or pink moon, you can't go wrong."
1,"There are three reasons why you may want to buy this album and one why you may not:1.) If you're a first generation S&G; fans who copped the vinyl when it first came out and is feeling a touch nostalgic, this is definitely the disc for you.2.) If you're not a Boomer, but a Gen X or Y-er who is doing their best to recreate Mom & Pop's listening experience for yourself, and you are big on hearing what previous generations actually heard when they rushed home from the record store with this disc in hand back in the summer of '72, then this is also the disc for you.3.) Finally, if you're an S&G; completist who just has to have everything they've ever released, then once again, you're looking at your disc.However, if you're simply searching for a comprehensive S&G; collection, then buyer beware.  There are several reasons why this disc doesn't fit the bill in that regard.  First of all, the obvious: it was released in 1972, and although all of their studio releases had wrapped up two years earlier, any post-72 work you may be looking for does not appear here (think Concert in Central Park, etc.).Secondly, much of their pre-1972 work is also ignored.  At 14 tracks and just over 44 minutes, this CD simply comes up a little short. Perhaps most importantly, if you're unfamiliar with this album then you need to know that the familiar studio versions of several songs (including 'For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her,' 'The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)' and 'Homeward Bound') are eschewed in favor of live versions. If any of this is of any importance to you, then be aware that there are more comprehensive S&G; collections out there at reasonable prices, including 'The Best of Simon & Garfunkel' and the 2 disc 'The Essential Simon & Garfunkel'.Peace and Happy Listening!"
1,"This is the album that got noticed because of the hitsingle ""Mexican Radio"". So this was there best sellingalbum & the last with Stan Ridgeway as lead vocalist. Iwish they would have added bonus tracks to this alreadyexcellent album (maybe the 12"" dub mix of ""MexicanRadio"" Ummm). A excellent record & a band that stoodapart from all others in the 1980's. I highly recommendyou to get this album. After that, buy the two previousrecordings by the band, ""The Index Masters"" & the highlycollectable rare & expensive ""Dark Continent"". What areya waiting for anyway! Get um! Search ""Judemac Forever""on msn."
1,"R. Kelly's self titled third album and second solo release has everything the others have with more exploring of his boundaries and even spirituality as done on ""Intro - the Sermon"", ""Heaven If You Hear Me"", ""As I Look Into My Life"" and ""Trade In My Life"".  R. takes it to a club scene with ""Hump Bounce"" as he states ""...everyday, every night humpin' and bouncin' is all I wanna do...""  ""You Remind Me Of Something"" is a mid-tempo tune where he compares a woman to a jeep, his sound, his cars and his bank account.  She must be something especially nice then.  The mood changes to a bit more sexual atmosphere with the inviting ""Step In My Room"" and he makes offers to anything you want on ""Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby...""  The classic love or anti-love song with 70 feels about creeping on ""Down Low (Nobody Has To Know)"" featuring Ronald & Ernie Isley.  He then begs for forgiveness and wants his lover to come back with ""I Can't Sleep Baby (If I)"".  ""Thank God It's Friday"" has the same feel of his later hit ""Step In The Name Of Love"".  To the rescue, he comes in with ""Love Is On The Way"" for another mid-tempo bass filled song.  ""Religious Love"" is simple and have feelings of depths undiscovered for a single person as he prays for love.  He slows the motion to almost still as the lights turn down low on ""Tempo Slow"".  The sixteen songs which were written and produced by R. Kelly seem never-ending and on the other hand it seems too short.  But it will be kept on repeat."

1,great cd my favorite from ugk. rip pimp c this cd looks better then the original i used to own.

1,"Toni Braxton's sophomore set attempted to build on the huge success of her debut, while at the same time maybe trying something a little different here and there.  Hearing first single 'You're Makin' Me High' actually gave most(including me) hope that the &quot;different&quot; part might actually be worth  checking out. Sad to say, she fails to follow through on the promise of that track, instead padding SECRETS with many  average-at-best moments that do nothing but diminish her  unique vocal talent. Ballads abound here, though a few, like the acoustic guitar driven 'Let It Flow' and 'There's No Me Without You', though hopelessly hokey, at least allow Braxton some solid room to showcase her lower range.  But then you have 'How Could An Angel Break My Heart', replete with soulless and near-offensive Kenny G sax work and the Diane Warren weeper 'Un-Break My Heart', which has now been rendered unlistenable--I'm sorry, but Braxton manages to get the very worst of Warren's Celine Dion throwaways (I don't think I need to elaborate further).  The rest of the disc is made up of material that's not quite as offensive but does nothing to enhance Braxton's stature.  Though not nearly as bad as Braxton's subsequent third album  THE HEAT, SECRETS nonetheless leaves one wondering when Braxton will or even can live up to her far more promising debut."
1,"Yeah, we know Miles went through many phases and stages, but this is where I started with Miles after I initially heard ""Sketches of Spain"", then I went to ""Round MidNight"" with Coltrane, and then backwards to Mile's Charlie Parker days, then I went forward to ""Live at the BlackHawk"", then ""Kind of Blue"". Whew. That's alot of ground, but Miles was mercurial and great at everything he did, never stopping very long to smell a particular group of roses before moving on to the next challenge.The 'Piece D'Resistance' here is the extended performance of ""I'll Remember April"". A huge, mind-opening performance!! Arrangement-wise (very uptempo & Native-American oriented), performance-wise, it's just wonderful, and I've listened to it for decades with the same wonder and enjoyment. Kenny Clarke's brushwork is too much, and Davey Schildkraut (alto) and Miles (muted trumpet) blow wonderful, inspired solos still fresh today; but Horace Silver's two piano solos steal the show and even his piano fills during the magnificent Percy Heath 'walking bass' section are exceptional. Worth the entire CD!! Don't miss this!""Tune Up"" and ""Smooch"" (with Mingus' amazing pianism and double stops) are also great, but another gem is ""Four"". Few times in the history of jazz music has so much wonderful stuff been done in so little time than on ""Four"". Totally mesmerizing. And I absolutely love Miles' solo, the ultra hip and clever Horace Silver piano solo, and Blakey's wonderful rimshot groupings. WOW!AFTERTHOUGHT: The song ""Tune Up"" later received a legendary extended and wonderful performance by Sonny Rollins onThe Very Best. Mingus also displays more of his piano work on his solo piano CD [Mingus Plays Piano]. Buy all three and enjoy the overlap."
1,"Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel are best known for the folk rock ""oldies"" they sung from 1957 through 1970, though the duo did meet up again periodically over the later decades. This 14-track collection spands their earliest work, providing the original radio versions of their recognizable hits, except for 4 previously unreleased live concert performances. All songs rated within the top 10 on the Billboard charts, excluding ""Scarborough Fair,"" which came in at 11th place.Classics everyone should know:#1 ""Mrs. Robinson""#7 ""Scarborough Fair""#8 ""Homeward Bound""#9 ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters""This album is a great value. Purchasing the famous S&G; singles separately can cost nearly as much, so why not educate your ears with more popular 60s hits or endeavor to complete an already bursting oldies library.Other albums to consider:John Denver's Greatest HitsThe Unforgettable Voices: 30 Best Of Elvis PresleyThe Best Of The Monkees (US Release)"
1,"The Beastie Boys LICENSED TO ILL is obnoxious, loud, brash, and STOOOOOPIT! Thank God! These were the qualities that made it both a great rap album and a great headbanging album! When I heard the opening drumbeat--lifted from Zep's ""Moby Dick""--I knew these local boys (2 from Brooklyn, 1 from Manhattan) had it right! This album is the Id run wild! (I can't stop using exclamation points!)Initially, the album was wrongly perceived as a showcase for ""Fight for your right"". It was equally wrong to claim that the album was an exploitation of black music by four Jewish kids. People forget: imitation is the highest form of flattery. The Beastie Boys obviously respected and admired the burgeoning hiphop sound and wanted to be a part of it. They loved it.LICENSED TO ILL was really a forum for these three guys and producer Rick Ruben to wake America up from its spandex, hair-metal doldrums and acknowledge that rap could be as powerful as rock. The hybrid produced amazing results like ""She's Crafty"", ""It's Time to Get Ill"", ""No Sleep til Brooklyn"" and ""Rhymin' and Stealin"". This was as much a breakthrough album as (dare I say it?) Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. And nearly twenty years later, it's finding a new audience with younger listeners. That's innovation. That's inspiration. That is the power of fun!"
1,"Too bad they don't let us give 4 1/2.Anyway, one part Red Hot Chili Pppers, one part Rush, one part Monty Python. Which is awesome. Defintely their most consistent album, and the least silly. But it's still pretty silly."
1,"Who would've ever guessed that Mike Murphy coming along and serving as a replacement would actually be a really nifty move?  While T.W.O. better illustrates and captures the early period of REO Speedwagon with a taste of the arena rock they'd later find worldwide success with, the temporary mid 70's period does NOT disappoint with songwriting that's *almost* as good as the previous album.Even though this version of ""Ridin' the Storm Out"" is probably not as good as the more famous live version we'd hear later due to being restrained and better suited as a live track anyway, the vocals and guitar playing are mighty fine regardless.  Yes, I miss the aggressive and more energetic (and superior) live version, but what we here is a suitable mid-tempo version that's definitely able to stand in the same league.  My first impression with ""Whiskey Night"" is that Mike Murphy has a voice not at all appropriate for REO Speedwagon, but you know, by the second time I played the song I was already enjoying it tremendously.  Sure, it's an oddly sung power ballad with gospel vocals, and the verse closely resembles the Band's ""Life Is a Carnival"" and it's nothing like the stuff one would find on T.W.O., but I love it nonetheless.""Without Expression (Don't Be That Man)"" has exceptionally hoarse vocals courtesy of Murphy, but the melody is unbelievably heartfelt and wonderful.  Easy to sing along with as well.  ""Start A New Life"" is a soulful and downbeat piano ballad with slide guitar.  It's memorable too.  ""Son of a Poor Man"" has an intro similar to Bob Dylan's ""Highway 61 Revisited"" before morphing into an upbeat, chugging-paced tune with fun lyrics that nicely captures the party atmosphere of the early 70's (and the early days of the band).  Great song overall.  The lyrics about a woman packing her bags and starting over are really spectacular as well.  ""Open Up"" is another upbeat song with a more frantic pace perhaps.  It's just as good as ""Son of a Poor Man"" with an *awesome* guitar solo at the end.""It's Everywhere"" has an oddly sung verse melody leading into an optimistic chorus with lyrics that reveal a touch of sadness.  At least to me they sound sad.  ""Movin"" sounds a little incomplete with the less than stellar verse and tacky gospel vocals, but the lyrics about moving to California and getting a taste of the lifestyle there are really nice.  ""Find My Fortune"" has a Donny Osmond-like vocal melody but it's really melodic so nobody can complain!  ""Oh Woman"" is REO's brand of rockabilly, and the results are wonderful.I seriously wasn't expecting a near classic with this album.  I was convinced it'd be a letdown judging the reviews.  I was wrong.  I highly recommend it.  No it's not really the arena rock we associate with REO Speedwagon (well, except for the title song) but it makes up for that by laying down some really good songwriting the entire way through."
1,"Little Queen is thirty-nine minutes and twenty-six seconds and was released on May 14, 1977. Little Queen reached #9 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album Chart and went Triple Platinum. This was Heart follow up album to their debut album. Though is did not chart as well; Dreamboat Annie went to #7, commercially is did better. Much of the hard rock is gone and is replace with soft\folk rock sound instead. Three songs charted off this album including the cover song. There are no repeat songs on this one. Remember Dreamboat Annie; that song was on three different times. This gives this cassette an A+ for me.

1,"Originally released in 1986, this is generally known as the Elvis Costello album that returned to the sound of his excellent 1978-80 era recordings with the Attractions.  Listening to the CD is somewhat different from the LP.  In many cases, artists (and perhaps even record companies) sequenced LP's to deliver a certain impact.  In the case of 'Blood and Chocolate', the first side (Tracks 1-5) was the edgier of the two.  All you need to do is listen to the first song, &quot;Uncomplicated&quot;, and you get the message.  That is followed up by one of my favorite EC songs, &quot;I Hope Your Happy Now&quot;, which I would rate as one Elvis' best.  This song is great because the lyrics and melody recall the heyday of 'Armed Forces', but also show a certain evolution of both Elvis and the Attractions.  Next is &quot;Tokyo Storm Warning&quot;, which for some reason was marketed at the time as the main single off of the album.  Ending the first side was the great &quot;I Want You&quot;.  Some major emotion on this one.  Even after multiple listens it never gets old.  From that point on the rest of the tracks are on the lackluster side.  Most are solid if not spectacular, although the second to last track, &quot;Poor Napoleon&quot;, kind of drags things down.  For this reason I would rate the album at four stars.  Put into the context of the time, 'Blood and Chocolate' was a refreshing listen after the puzzling post-1981 output that was 'Almost Blue'+'Imperial Bedroom'+'Punch The Clock'+'Goodbye Cruel World' and the Attraction-less (except for one song) 'King of America'.  The second disc also contains some excellent material such as &quot;Seven Day Weekend&quot;, &quot;Baby's Got A Brand New Hairdo&quot; (another song that recalls earlier recordings), and the previously unreleased &quot;Leave My Kitten Alone&quot;."
1,"This is probably the best solo album KRS-One has ever put out. Sorry to say there are probably other good ones, but this is the best put together one. The beats, the rhymes, and the material go together very nicely. My favorites are Outta Here, Mortal Thought, I Can't Wake Up, Sound of Da Police, Uh Oh, Return of the Boom Bap, and Stop Frontin'. But the other songs are good too. I recommend this to fans of Boogie Down Productions or Hip Hop in general."
1,"This is probably my least favorite primus album, and I still love this album, I love the unique, almost experimental sound they create."
1,"Aerosmith, January 1973, the debut album in all its unpolished glory. Sophistication was soon to come but what this band did not lack at this stage was balls and the songwriting chops of one young Steven Tallarico. Stage name of Tyler, you know, future rock god, reformed addict and king of sleaze. The songs are great on this terribly underated album, easily their most unsung. ""Dream On"" is of course an undisputed rock classic played a billion times so yes I am a little tired of it, but ""Movin' Out""? ""One Way Street""? ""Make It"" and the immortal ""Mama Kin""? No way!! This record is a joy from start to finish (and what a finish - ""Walking the Dog"", could be the definitive version of this song!)The boys in the band give credible performances but I have to agree that the guitar partnership of Perry/Whitford does not impress as they would one album later. The production of the album leaves much to be desired and if the strories are true, blame it on the record company for cheaping out on this future supergroup. Who could blame them? Well all their money was going into Bruce Springsteen. Not a bad choice I guess. But Aerosmith would overcome many other similar slights and self destructive behaviors to emerge as the great American Rock n'Roll band that they are, sappy ballads asside. There is nothing sappy about 'Aerosmith', but more greatness was to follow."
0,"It is mind boggling all the hype surrounding this badly overrated CD. I like many of the Beach Boys big hits but this CD just doesn't cut it. On the version I borrowed, out of sixteen songs only the four lead tracks-Wouldn't It Be Nice, Caroline No, God Only Knows, and Sloop John B are of high quality. I Know There's An Answer, Here Today, and You Still Believe In Me are slightly captivating among the remaining songs. The problem here at least to my ears is that the songs all have a similar arrangement. Not slow and romantic like Surfer Girl or Warmth of The Sun or fast and jumpy like Fun Fun Fun and Surfin' USA. Its all mid-paced and kind of spacey with a strong lack of ooomph and too many special effects.It boggles the mind how one television broadcast ranked this CD as the third greatest rock n roll album of all time. Geeze Louise, this album barely even rocks!  There is a strong lack of guitar presence throughout this collection and way too many special ef!fects. It trudges along like a sluggish snail and you can hardly wait for it to end. The harmonies all sound the same after a while and Brian hogs most of the lead vocals.  The lyrics may have some special meanings but that's based on the fact that you have not fallen asleep listening to the music.  How anyone can compare this to even the weakest of Beatles records is ludicrous.In my opinion, stick with a good compilation of the Beach Boys. California Girls, Help Me Rhonda, I Get Around, and other early hits will always remain classics and keep any party hopping. I have three of them and they all work fine. However, when Brian Wilson attempted to get too deep and stray away from grooving surfer rhythms, the result is a stony bore. Borrow it from a friend but save your money as this music just does not cut the mustard."
1,"PLANET P is a great progressive rock/pop album recorded mostly by singer/multi-instrumentalist/songwriter Tony Carey. Unlike his albums under his own name, which are more pop-oriented and rooted in bands such as Survivor, Shooting Star, and Asia, this one sounds a great deal like the Alan Parsons Project and features extended pieces. Carey sings lead on all but one song here, and the lyrics explore a theme that would be even more pronounced on Planet P's follow-up, PINK WORLD: anxiety over Albert Einstein's work with nuclear physics being used to eliminate the human race. The songs here describe the fears of the Cold War generations, and anyone who was a teenager or adult before glasnost should own this CD."
1,"The last of Stevie's 80s albums, this one isn't as solid and robust as 1985's ""In Square Circle,"" but, like any Stevie album, still has its share of redeeming moments. Features one of his best 80s ballads ""You Will Know,"" and the funky ""Dark 'N' Lovely"" which sounds more like some of his late 70s/early 80s funk numbers rather than something from 1987. Also spawned a hit with ""Skeletons"" which is really not one of his better songs (very melodically bland). Still worth hearing if you're unfamiliar with it, as there is no such thing as a completely disposable Stevie Wonder album."
1,"&#34;What's Going On&#34; has passed from &#34;classic album&#34; status to &#34;required listening.&#34; To hear this inspired music is to feel the turmoil of those times and sense the hope for the future, still unrealized."
0,"As much as I absolutely loved Adam and the Ants' first two albums - DIRK WEARS WHITE SOCKS and especially its crossover follow-up KINGS OF THE WILD FRONTIER - I just can't heartily recommend PRINCE CHARMING.  Save for the three singles (the peerles, still heart-stopping STAND & DELIVER, possibly the ANTS best single, the campy title track, and the so-bad-its-good proto-rap ANT RAP), the rest sounds like flippant, indulgent dreck & doesn't stand up today. If you remember that KINGS came out in 1980, and this came out less than one year later in 1981, the album sounds like a rush job to capitalize on ADAM's run of radio hits - clever early MTV videos and swashbuckling image aside, PRINCE CHARMING proves that third time isn't the charm!"
1,"Carole King earned everything she's got in music quickly. Like Michael Jackson's ""Thriller,"" it is, in itself, a ""best-of"" CD, with most of the 12 originals becoming classics.What makes Carole King and ""Tapestry"" different:This is no ""Sgt. Pepper"" (Beatles) or ""Pet Sounds"" (Beach Boys). The recordings aren't complexly layered with more tracks than we have fingers. Bob Dylan's poetic lyrics don't float from the speakers. Jimi Hendrix guitar stylings do not smoke through. These are just great, simple songs that come out originally, and have survived the test of time. As classics go, King's work is on anyone's list.Carole King is as straight forward as Janis Joplin, without Janis' brusky, unfiltered cigarette tone. King's voice is as smooth as Joni Mitchell's or Carley Simon's, with more sentimentality.The songs are about the loss of love, or the worry that love may not continue, or the exultation of love. They are all a little sad, and forebode that today's love might be tomorrow's heartbreak.Either way, buy the CD, listen to these late at night as you read CD reviews, and remember, ""You've Got a Friend.""Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"

1,"As the eighth album from the original ensemble of the Moody Blues, this is the only one not to be remastered in 5.1 (actually 4.1 as the center speaker is not used).  I can only guess it is because the group recorded at the Record Plant in California and did not have the same access to the quad mixers.  However, Justin Hayward and Alberto Paroldi did a fine job remastering in stereo with this 2008 release.  The songs are more vibrant than the original recording and the five `live' songs are incredibly clear, unlike theCaught Live + 5album, which had horrible mixing.As is usual with the first song on a Moody Blues album, there is a special effect `hook' used for introduction.  However, ""Steppin' In A Slide Zone"" falls short as a single with a repetitive chorus and forced melody.  In fact, some of the songs sound terribly dated, which is unusual for the Moody Blues earlier albums.  ""I'll be Level With You"", ""Top Rank Suite"" and ""Survival"" just seem out of synch with a typical Moody Blues song.  Note that this was a tough period for the group in general, not knowing what the future held.  However, songs like, ""Driftwood"", ""The Day We Meet Again"" and ""One Step Into The Light"" (Mike Pinder's only contribution) are represented in the classic Moody Blues ethereal sound.  In Fact, Pinder's song contains lyrics that harken back to the psychedelic era and the mellotron works well without being overpowering.The additional five live songs don't make up for the lack of the quadraphonic sound most had hoped for, but at least they are crisply and clearly recorded.  Again, ""Driftwood"" (with its reverb guitar) and ""The Day We Meet Again"" are nice surprises."
1,"Cream-Disraeli Gears ***1/2How is it that Creams worst record contains their best songs? It must be how it is concidered such a classic despite the fact that it is ages worse than any other release from the legendary band. The sound of heroin runs deep in the veins of Disreali Gears which explains why the gears are hardly turning here.The acidic Psychedelic blues of the album and the band was never stronger than in the albums opening track 'Strange Brew.' The iconic track must refer to the use in which the group was bound, though very subtly. 'Sunshine Of Your Love' is the sort of groove bands are formed upon. Too bad they would never top it. 'Tales Of Brave Ulysses' and 'Swlabr' are the sort of powerful guitar rants that made Eric Clapton the guitar god he once was.Here and there the rest of the album satisfies but mostly fails because of the boring pace at which it proceeds. Most of the rest feels dull and uninspired by anything other then the drugs that destroyed the greatest power trio in history.Disraeli Gears is far from a classic album. To base the claim on the few classic songs is ignorant. Cream created and released better albums, every other one they released was better in fact. Don't base your purchases on that alone, at least give credit to the musicianship of the criminally underrated Ginger Baker."
1,"&quot;This album was MADE IN ENGLAND(in 1994) just like me.(in 1947)&quot;. recalls Elton John in an interview shortly after this album was released in March 1995. All the other titles on this album are only one word. Isn't that interesting? Hits include the title track,BELIEVE and BLESSED. BELIEVE and BLESSED were later recycled for 1996's LOVE SONGS."
1,"Barbra Streisand arrived as a credible comtemporary artist with the release of this satisfying landmark album which opens with a magically stirring vocal turning Joni Mitchell's ""I Don't Know Where I Stand"" into a haunting masterpiece!  A light and funky arrangement of Laura Nyro's ""Hands Off The Man (Flim Flam Man)"" make this a winning version while a dramatically stirring performance of Gordon Lightfoot's ""If Your Could Read My Mind"" is a delightful surprise for its rhythmically involved arrangement and great Streisand vocal.  Seductive in her own winning way with the Barry Mann/Cynthia Weill classic ""Just A Little Lovin' (Early In The Mornin')"" while Randy Newman's ""Let Me Go"" is the definitive version containing a great Streisand blues vocal. Barbra's wildly successful rocking version of the Laura Nyro classic ""Stoney End"" is the song responsible for breaking Barbra out of the conservative mold as a singer of ""yesterday's songs"" into a great singer of songs of any kind with no boundries which allowed Barbra to grow artistically by leaps and bounds. Sung with soulful conviction are fine versions of Carole King's ""No Easy Way Down"", Laura Nyro's ""Time And Love"", and the gospel edged riveting rocker ""Free The People"" is given a frenzied workout and credited to Barbara Keith. Harry Nilsson's ""Maybe"" and Randy Newman's ""I'll Be Home"" are sublime ballads which stand tall with Streisands peak work.  ""What About Today"" brilliantly showed Barbra as a credible contemporary singer to fans while ""Stoney End"" showed this to the world...credit for this incredible accomplishment must also include kudos to the amazing assortment of the ""whose who"" in the music world who are featured in this landmark work such as arrangers Gene Page, Perry Botkin,Jr., Clas Ogerman, musicians too numerous to list all but including musical legends such as Hal Blaine, Larry Muhoberac, Mike Rubini, Randy Newman, Larry Carlton, and the legendary background vocalists Clydie King, Merry Clayton, Vanetta Fields, Shirley Mathews, Jackie Ward, Toni Wine, Maeretha Stewart, Glenna Session, Eddie Kendrix, Sharone De Vault, & Jerry Cook and this amazing cast was all put together by legendary producer Richard Perry who went on to produce the equally extraordinary ""Barbra Joan Streisand"" album!!!  Bravo to Barbra and everyone connected with this stunning collection..."
1,"This is really a five stars album, the last of the five albums Simon & Garfunkel recorded for Columbia. The album is a pleasure to listen from beginning to end. I don't care at all about Grammy, but at least, if this album received a lot of them, maybe at those times the Grammy gave their prizes to real artists like Simon & Garfunkel, instead of Beyonce, Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Madonna and such..."
1,"The music here is 5 stars - the best album by a great band.  Too many great songs to mention, most of which are well-described in other reviews.  I'll mention only &quot;Dance the Night Away&quot; because it's my favorite Cream song and it simply doesn't get the attention it deserves.  It's grand, powerful and haunting, with one of the best guitar-bass riffs ever, and gorgeous harmonic singing by Eric and Jack.  But the real purpose of this review is to caution would-be buyers about the poor quality of the remastering.  It is mushy, tinny and clangy, with very poor sonic definition, and that's why I've &quot;docked&quot; it one star.  I find myself going back to my old scratchy vinyl copy to really crank this up and appreciate the music, and there's just no excuse for that.  I can't recommend that you NOT buy this because it may be the best alternative available to you, but it is not a worthy production.  We (and Cream) would be better served by a new and better remastering."
1,"Musical prejudice comes in many different forms. In my own case it came in the form of seeing albums such as this and simply assuming it was just one of the many ""new jill"" female artists that seemed to be saturating the musical world in the early/mid 1990's. Maybe to a certain degree that was true for Aaliyah in the beginning. On the other hand she was much more than that from the get go. For starters she courted controversy as being the teenage wife to the by this time very adult R.Kelly. So the obvious was on the minds of a lot of people: that her record contract came along with the engagement ring. Only R himself would know the truth about that today. At the same time,he certainly had an eye for a talent in growth and nearly ready to bloom.This album was very much a musical byproduct of R.Kelly's12-Playera. He was still musically running a bit with the crowd and hadn't established his own voice. So it's no surprise that some of these songs such as ""Back And Forth"",""Down With The Clique"",""Young Nation"" and ""Old School"" are very much artifacts of the new jack/hip-hop soul era,especially in rhythmic terms. On the rhythmically layored slower jam of the title song,representing how the ""new jack ballad"" genre stuck pretty close to a mid/late 80's sound and ""At Your Best"",a more live sounding ballad you hear a beauty and charm in Aaliyah's verstile pipes that would very much come to define who she'd be in the future. Kelly had the good sense to present her singing acapella on some of the interludes to showcase her talents.So is this an ideal debut for Aaliyah? No. The album title may have emphasized that age ain't nothing but a number. But her age was in fact at the very key of this album. While she does have a percocious manner about her,Aaliyah is still at this point coming at her songs from the point of view of a high school age person looking to be grown up. In her case on more of an urban street level. Her attitude is not particularly angsty though and that's very appealing. She tends to be enthusiastic and explorative. On a darker note she also came off as endlessly resiliant,with a perception life would be longer than it would be. And in her case,it was inhumanly short I'll tell you. But the small amount of music she released in her short time in life,starting with this told a story of creative growth and earnestness."
1,"This debut album by the legendary Bon Jovi showed right away that this band was destined for greatness.  While later albums sold better, this effort is every bit as good.""Runaway"" is the one song here that many people know, as it made a dent in the pop charts and got a lot of rock radio play.  This song still sounds fresh and exciting after all these years--a hard rock anthem classic.  ""She Don't Know Me"" is another single from the album--a catchy first ballad by this band and really the only one on this album.  Songs like ""Roulette"" and ""Breakout"" rock hard, while ""Love Lies"" and ""Burning For Love"" are over the top melodic anthems.  ""Shot Through The Heart"" is another rocking gem on this fantastic debut effort.Bottom line:  if you liked the sound of ""Slippery When Wet"" and aren't caught up in only listening to big hits, then you will like this CD.  An absolutely classic album by one of the true leaders of '80s melodic hard rock.  Don't overlook this one."
1,"I LOVE THIS CD IT CONTAINS SOME GOOD SONGS BY  BON JOVI. BUT THIS ALBUM ONLY CONTAINS A FEW HITS . IT CONTAINS MY MOST FAVORITE BY THE GROUP BLAZE OF GLORY. I LOVE THIS SONG IT IS GOOD.

1,"I have heard a considerable portion of Elton John's enormous back catalog, and as an experienced EJ listener I can say without a doubt that Made In England, despite being a recent effort, is one of Elton's very best albums. In fact, it is my favorite besides Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (surpassing my previous runner-up, Honky Choteau). Okay, so what makes it so good? Well, first off this is BY FAR Bernie Taupin's best set of lyrics ever. They are good, fairly deep, and occasionally funny. Elton is not slouch on the album either, of course. He turns in a good performance on the piano and his usual stellar vocals. Also good are the orchestral arrangements (reminiscent of early Elton John albums) and Davey Johnstone's guitar work. Sure, he's not Steve Vai (and you don't have to be, if you're in Elton John's backing band), but he can play. The best songs include Believe, Made In England, House, Pain, and the beautiful Belfast. A must own for any EJ fan, in fact get it early."
1,All I can say is that if you have never heard this cd or heard of this cd you must get off your butt and get it because you do not know what you are missing.
1,"I really appreciate all of Billy Joel's records.  However his early releases:  Cold Spring Harbor, Turnstiles, and this one are special probably because they are not so overplayed on the radio.  The title track is so haunting its beautiful.  Los Angelinos boogies along quite nicely as Billy's band adds nice support.  And two instrumentals- the subdued Mexican Connection with its accentuated rhythms and the jolly bingo hall styled Root Beer Rag.  The Entertainer may be the hit single with its catchy lyrics but overall this record is very consistent and quite varied."
1,this was when you had to be saying something in Rap to get true Respect.ANd KRS-One is one of the Greatest Teachers The World Of Rap has ever known.you got more Black History from his Records than from most  classrooms put together.His Lyrical Flow&amp;words hit home.The Malcolm  X.Take was something Refreshing&amp;much Needed.he didn't pull no punches  here.I Miss those days.
1,"The Moody Blues/ In Search Of The Lost Cord (Ultradisc II Gold)  The Moody Blues has more in common with Tchaikovsky than with Robert Johnson, but the quasi-spiritual journey they brought their listeners through always sounded beautiful and was often very entertaining.  This is one of the many quality albums they produced.  Their music is so good that I even forgive them for honoring the patently evil Mr. Leary.  The Gold disk is very good but (as is often the case) the cost of buying it outweighs its worth.  There is a more recent remastered release of the CD with several bonus tracks added.  I have not heard the added tracks, but I still recommend that release over the now overpriced (as of 2011) Gold CD."
1,"After his masterpieceMusic of My Mind,Talking Bookwas a little disappointing despite two brilliant songs in ""Superstition"" and ""Maybe Your Baby"". For the following year's ""Innervisions"", released just before a major accident that saw Wonder lose his smell as well as sight, he turned to social commentary in a manner that he would never rival on any other album. In doing so, Wonder showed clearly that he was at the time the premier soul musician.Opener ""Too High"" showed considerable melodic growth compared to his previous albums, but it is a touching sad song about the dangers of hard drugs. ""Visions"" is even softer and entirely free of electronics, even featuring an acoustic guitar that showed Wonder must have had some interest in the more experimental music of the time - yet Wonder always gives the song his own spin. ""Living for the City"", the epic third track, is a very deserved masterpiece in which Wonder maintains a remarkably steady crescendo throughout each verse and backs it up with passionate lyrics about the problems of living in the ghetto. The dense groove of ""Living for the City"" is notable in that it never seems overblown even with the bass bass drum throughout the song.""Golden Lady"", the fourth track, is a beautiful love song, but with ""Higher Ground"" Wonder returns to social commentary with an anthemic, yet delightfully melodic song about a theme he was certainly preoccupied with at the time: the striving for a better world. The groove and Wonder's voice, though, are much tighter than on his previous album, and there is an urgency lacking on parts of ""Talking Book"". ""Jesus Children of America"" continues in a slower vein of social commentary, whilst the closer ""He's Misstra Know-It-All"" is a beautiful song about the dark politics of the Richard Nixon era. The surprising thing about this song is that, like ""Living for the City"", Wonder can in a rare manner provide new energy in the middle of a song. ""All in Love Is Fair"" is a beautiful, moving ballad with an unexpectedly loud piano outro, and ""Don't You Worry About a Thing"" is a sparse, lighthearted, but quaint funk piece that showed Wonder capable of more different styles than one imagines his audience would have thought.All in all, if perhaps not quite the equal of ""Music of My Mind"", ""Innervisions"" deserves its status as one of the very best soul albums, showing a man who can master seemingly any style without effort and produce some of the very best social commentary ever put to record."
1,"Toto were known before the group's inception as back up musicians for Boz Scaggs, among others, their LA scene musical pedigree well established before striking out on their own.""Toto"" is a fine debut, similar somewhat to Scaggs' ""Lowdown"" formula in places (""Georgy Porgy"") and full of chops and hooks, courtesy of primary songwriter David Paich.Their breakthrough single ""Hold The Line"" helped define power pop with its power chording chorus and blistering lead guitar work of Steve Lukather, one of rock's better guitarists.  Others, like the aforementioned ""Georgy Porgy"" and ""You Are The Flower"" flirt with a taste of funk, while ""Goodbye Girl"" is a balls out rocker.Steely Dan fans and those music fans tiring of the over-simplified approach most pop music has adopted in the last decade will find relief in ""Toto"" and any of its predecessors.  There still is a demand for musicianship, and thankfully Toto, Steely Dan (and Donald Fagen's solo work) and The Sea and Cake are still with us.This review is, however, knocked down one star for its weak production.  Remaster this classic piece soon!"
1,"Who else but Joni Mitchell can create a song that takes you from your daylit, traffic bogged SUV to a country road at night with the stars above.  That's one of her strongest gifts--transformation.  Joni takes you places you've never been before.  ""Night ride home"" is one of her best."
1,"Daryl Hall's brief departure from the Hall and Oates duo in a British recording studio was musically dynamic.  Most of the songs on this work were penned by Daryl.  The musical brilliance warms the soul in these lyrics and arrangements.  Daryl's vocals are beyond ""blue-eyed"" soul.""This Time"" is bursting with musical variations.  ""Love Revelation"" goes beyond the boundaries of expectation.  This is a complex mix of vocals accompanied by driving percussion and bass guitar.  ""Stop Lovin Me, Stop Loving You"" is a soulful love anthem full of strings and orchestrations.  ""Send Me"" is my favorite due to Daryl's vocal arrangement having an interesting diversity (both tonally and in timing) plus the chord changes in the arrangement.  ""Wildfire"" is a passionate ballad.  ""Money Changes Everything"" is a fabulous and funky number.  This track will scorch your cd player when Daryl reaches vocal heights that are extraordinary.  And then when you hear the smoldering finale of ""Written In Stone"", you will find warmth within it.Daryl Hall's music has bridged an appreciation that is found in many generations of music lovers.  Just go to one of the Hall & Oates concerts and you will understand that this is true.  This solo departure for Daryl was obviously the proof that his muscial genius needed to continue to create, even during the hiatus of his Hall & Oates collaborations.  Obviously, for a Daryl Hall fan this is a must-have cd.  However, for those who love the Hall & Oates songs:  ditto!!"
1,"If you're looking for a random assortment of songs from one of the best of the 1980s popular groups, this is a five-star album. Compared to much of the hackneyed lyrics and synthesized murk of that era, Tears for Fears offers memorable vocals and first-rate music -- they still sound great, and the recordings were pure digital.But each of their albums seems to work more effectively in its original sequence, and there was not enough chaff on 'Songs from the Big Chair' to make the usual 'greatest hits' filter necessary or even desirable. 'The Hurting' also stands on its own, and the tracks from the 'Seeds of Love' album really do not complement any of earlier songs. If you enjoy Tears for Fears, buy 'Songs from the Big Chair'. It is probably a modern classic. I cannot say anything terribly negative about the 'Tears Roll Down' CD because I own it and listen to it on occasion.  Still, TFF is one of the rare modern musicial teams to produce albums that are especially cohesive, making this greatest hits collection sound like a sort of random arrangement."
1,"This album was in, singles wise more sucessful than &quot;Thriller&quot; Spawning 5 #1 Singles all of them released in a row! and got 8 top 10 singles. But, in sales wise, it didnt sell half of what &quot;Thriller&quot; sold. This album is a great album. In the Late '80's I think people were way into POP and not the &quot;Thriller&quot; type of music. So he made a good move, But hard-out fans of &quot;Off The Wall&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot; abandoned his music because of this album. This brang him alot of success though just one, 1 in 12 people in the U.K own &quot;Bad&quot;!. The songs released were by far the best of the album. these are the singles that went to #1:I Just Can Stop Loving You- #1!Bad-#1!The Way You Make Me Feel- #1!Man In The Mirror- #1!Dirty Diana- #1!So this was a push up for success,  though it rarely happens his next album sone something that most artists cant do these days....."
1,"In the fall of 1979, I had just turned 11 years old, and had not only just been given one record for my birthday, but also had received money which I then used to buy the first vinyl LP I ever bought.  (I had only seriously begun to pay attention to the top 40 that spring, and had only bought 45s up to that point; I owned a grand total of 3 LPs, all of which had been given to me as presents, and maybe a couple of cassettes.)  It was the very beginning of my long history (27 years now) as a collector.That first LP was ELO's Discovery.  All that spring and summer, I had been hearing the various singles from that album (""Shine a Little Love,"" ""Confusion,"" ""Don't Bring Me Down"" and ""Last Train to London"") on my favourite radio station of the time (WIGY 105.9 FM, in the Bath/Brunswick area in Maine), and so when the opportunity came to purchase this record, I jumped on it.  Needless to say, I knew nothing at the time of Jeff Lynne's Beatles influence, although I was a huge Beatles fan--still am to this day; they will always be the Gods of Rock 'n' Roll in my heart--and it probably would have raised his stock considerably for me.  In the months to come, I would buy copies of ELO's Greatest Hits and Out of the Blue (mine being a cutout copy on United Artists that cost me just $4.99; this was a bargain for a double LP in early 1980).  In the meantime, I played Discovery as often as I could, and I loved it all.Fast forward to 2001.  Sony made their first attempts at catalogue remasters of ELO's albums; along with the classic Eldorado, their three albums from 1979-83 (Discovery, Time, and Secret Messages) were also remastered and reissued.  Wishing to rediscover a favourite of my 'tweenie years, I bought the remastered Discovery on CD.  22 years on, I realised that Thomas Wolfe was right--you can't go home again...and even if you could, nothing would be the same.  Your tastes change, and mine certainly had.  Here's my adult synopsis of Discovery:Only 3 of this album's 9 tracks are truly essential--""Shine a Little Love,"" ""Last Train to London"" (which is *not* instrumental, by the way--there are vocals and lyrics) and ""Don't Bring Me Down"" all keep things moving along nicely, even if ""Shine a Little Love's"" bridge rings a bit twee these days.  Three more tracks--""Confusion,"" ""The Diary of Horace Wimp"" and ""On the Run""--are entertaining and move alone nicely, but I wouldn't rate them among this album's best tracks, just a little less painful than the other 3--""Need Her Love,"" ""Midnight Blue"" and ""Wishing.""  Of the final 3, ""Need Her Love"" is embarrassing in its twinkly saccharine-ness, which include unbearable naive-sounding lyrics and sweet synth arrangements (sweet enough to raise your blood sugar to dangerous levels!), thus making it the worst offender of the lot.  The other two are saccharine throwaways, just bad enough to be memorable.  What was forgivable at 11 isn't so at 37, when your perceptions have sharpened and your inner self hardened a bit against the depredations of the world.On the whole, this was truly the beginning of the end for ELO.  They had pared themselves down to just a quartet--Jeff Lynne, Bev Bevan, Richard Tandy and Kelly Groucutt--having dropped the string players after Out of the Blue (on which you can, of course, see trouble just over the horizon).  It makes some sense that Bev would sub on the drums for Black Sabbath on a couple of tours a few years later; perhaps even he needed some meat after this bit of cotton candy."
1,"E-40, Forty Water, whatever you want to call him is a bit of an aquired taste, even though I heard his music years ago, it took me until this year to finally check out 1 of his albums.  I first heard him on Aint Hard To Find off 2Pac's All Eyez On Me, and I was thinking who the f*ck is this guy?  His goofy voice and rapid fire flow took me quite a while to get used to, but after bumping Dusted & Disgusted for a long time I decided to pick up In A Major Way.I had to order this from Amazon as there are literally no copies of this album in England, you just can't get hold of stuff like this, and I was surprised by how great it was.  E-40 has long been known as an innovator (something hiphop is sorely lacking), both in terms of his unique flow, and his vast slang vocabulary which so many others have bitten over the years.  This album according to most people is when he was at his peak in both, though I can't comment as this is the only album of his I own (I do intend to buy more though).  My favourite track is still Dusted & Disgusted ft Spice 1, 2Pac & Mac Mall, which is a westcoast classic, but other classics include 1 Luv and the amazing Smoke N Drank.  Pretty much every other track is tight, the only reason i don't quite give it 5 stars is because of a couple of filler tracks (Dey Aint No & Bootsee, which is terrible).  Production is top notch throughout, some classic westcoast beats that really bump.Recommended to any hiphop fans, especially westcoast, if you can get past his wierd voice & flow you will see that some of his lyrics are actually pretty clever.  He raps about the same things most westcoast rappers do, but he does it creatively, if you can't follow him just get a lyrics sheet and listen up, very good album 4.5 stars, another case for half stars at Amazon."
1,"Mystikal set up shop with his unorthodox style and flow on this groundbreaking debut.  In 1995 Mystikals style was unlike any other in the rap game.  His cadence, use of swift tongue twisting flow, voice variations etc etc etc. made him an instant superstar.  His first hit, Here I Go, was THE hardest song when it dropped.  I don't care what you say, That song is probably one of THE Hardest songs, if not the Hardest song, to ever come out of the south.  This is a real battle track dedicated to who ever wanted to test.With lines like: ""You wanna battle bring a body bag, I'm gonna need it to carry yo STUPID A$$"",`Ill [mess] you up with the quickness!"",`you can bring yo whole posse punk I still wont lose, Ill stomp your whole staff, must want a bloodbath!"",""you wanna fight [punk] put em up, how that sound? Come get knocked down!""This is just a non-stop lyrical assault delivered with unparalleled aggressiveness and poise.  Definitely a classic track.Just because that song is so great doesn't mean the rest of the album is weak.  Mystikal drops some unforgettable quotables and choruses on this album.  His technique is that straight fire.  Delivering confident lines like ""I know yall [people] can't [mess] with me because I can't [mess] with my damn self!"" and  ""The only way to keep my Mfing name out your Mfing mouth is to keep yo Mfing mouth shut!"", Mystikal couldn't possibly be stopped.Every single song on here is the joint but my favorites include Yall Aint Ready Yet, Mr. Hood Critic, Not That Nicca remix, I'm, Here I Go, and Beware.  The beats are off the chain and perfectly compliment Mystikals style.  Overall you should make every effort to hear this album.  It is definitely a classic album that is nearly untouchable.  This is a diamond in the rough.  EXTREMELY recommended."
1,"Michael Jackson produced Bad to be a bigger, better Thriller. While he couldn't match the sheer phenomenon of that release, he came very close. Bad spawned some of his most memorable singles. The title track is cheesy but undeniably well-crafted and infectious, while ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" is a classic, shuffling R&B; number. ""Man in the Mirror"" is Michael at his most syrupy, gospel choir and all. Quite the opposite is ""Smooth Criminal,"" with its unsettling lyrics and equally creepy, claustrophobic beat. A recording of his own heartbeat opens the murder-themed track. ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" is a gorgeous ballad; Michael's and Siedah's voices mesh together brilliantly. An attempt to recreate ""Beat It"" with ""Dirty Diana"" fails, while a duet with Stevie Wonder on ""Just Good Friends"" seems to collapse under the weight of such a pairing. Despite a few throwaways, album tracks like ""Speed Demon"" and ""Leave Me Alone"" are gritty ventures into Michael Jackson's unparalleled imagination. As a highly produced record of immense variety, Bad represents the ultimate in pop perfection. Creating a follow-up to the most successful album of all time had to be incredibly daunting; with Bad, Michael Jackson proved he was up to the challenge. 4 Stars.The well-packaged special edition comes with updated liner notes and extra tracks featuring a few b-sides and interview clips with Quincy Jones. Aside from the remastered sound, these bonuses do little to improve the original product but are enjoyable nonetheless."
1,"Originally released in fall, 1979. I remember when this album first came out. Many patrons that I knew personally would flock to their nearby Kmart, Record Bar or Venture store to snag a cassette / vinyl copy on their next day off. A true-to-it's form classic fourth studio effort by Cheap Trick (according to some fans, THE world's best rock & roll band to see play live). Tunes that make this 'arena rock' CD reissue a keeper are the title track, an FM radio staple ""Dream Police"", ""Gonna Raise Hell"", ""Voices"", the rocking ""I Know What I Want"" and ""Need Your Love"". A should-have."
1,"A band that  deserves more credit for getting people to appreciate the power of Funk, Cameo made some great records. From &quot;Word Up&quot;, one of the best radio songs ever, to &quot;Talkin' Out The Side of your Neck&quot; this CD covers most of the bands highlights. Except for an odd version of She's Strange (the 12&quot; Rap Version? Another reviewer nailed this one) this is a great collection for anyone who wants some exposure to Funk with a capital F."
1,"I was waiting impaciently to buy this, and i dont regret the buying. In fact i will buy another copy when i can, to save it intacts as the treasure it is. the compilation of the CDs and the DVD, the cute and elegant case, the poster, everything suits perfect. Amazing gift for any MJ fan and any BAD era fan."
1,"If there were enough stars to rate this, I would rate it a big 10!  This is one of the most beautiful pieces of work that has ever been recorded.  In my opinion this could have been a #1 hit album on the charts for weeks if it was a Moody Blues album.  Justn Hayward and John Lodge work very well together on this masterpiece.  It could almost be a ""one last shot at being the Moody Blues before we go our separate ways"" type album, a Moodies swansong type thing.  This album is more than a must for any Moody Blues fan.  If you aren't a Moodies fan before you hear this, then you will definately become one after hearing it.  A beautiful piece of work here.  It's too bad Justin and John didn't team up for a Blue Jays reunion."
1,"Out of all of Michael Jackson's albums, THIS is the one that rates, for me, as being the best he ever had!  I don't know...maybe it was the collaboration of Quincy Jones and Rod Templeton, or maybe it was Michael himself, or maybe it was the magic involved.  Who knows...maybe it was all three.  The truth of the matter is that I played this disc 3 times straight in my car and I loved every moment, along with each and every song...PRICELESS!!!  It's having a cd like this that makes one wish for the art of having real music again.  Michael, we miss you totally and will always have this recording in our memory banks, along with our collection.  WE LOVE YOU MICHAEL...ALWAYS AND FOREVER!!!!"
1,"DANGEROUS is a real great album!!!! Michael brings great songs like REMEMBER THE TIME, JAM, GIVE IN TO ME, BLACK OR WHITE and WHO IS IT, with a blend of HIP HOP, ROCK and POP.....REALLY GREAT!!!!!!i put DANGEROUS in the same high level of OFF THE WALL and THRILLER....TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!WELL DONE, Michael!!!!!!!"
1,"Though ""Empty Sky"" had already been released in the UK, ""Elton John"" was the artist's debut in the U.S. And a better-constructed debut is hard to imagine. John and lyricist Bernie Taupin fleshed out their ballads and country-blues with lush string orchestrations (courtesy of Paul Buckmaster), gospel choirs and great rock 'n' roll guitars and drums. Taupin wrote lyrics whose words were indelible, even when their meaning wasn't immediately clear. John couched the words in beautifully crafted melodies, providing a yearning counterpoint to his own harpsichord playing on ""I Need You to Turn To"" and turning the lyrically opaque ""Take Me to the Pilot"" into one of the album's most memorable songs.John would craft dozens of songs and albums of great acclaim, but the roots of his 1970s musical domination of popular music can all be heard here.  Predating the outrageous stage costumes (and their attendant flamboyant persona), John's energy is fully focused on his music, his piano playing and his singing. The ballads are particularly powerful, from the radio perennial ""Your Song,"" to the spiritually charged ""Border Song"" and closing ""The King Must Die."" The upbeat tunes, like ""The Cage,"" score with John's bluesy piano chords propelled by funky bass lines and horns.This 1996 CD reissue includes three bonus tracks from the album sessions: the non-LP B-side (to ""Border Song""), ""Bad Side of the Moon,"" and both sides of the non-LP single ""Rock 'n' Roll Madonna"" b/w ""Grey Seal."" The latter was re-recorded and released on the album ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" (hence its familiarity to many listener's ears) but this is the original rendition. Song lyrics, a detailed album history and remastering from the original tapes make this a must-have for Elton fans and a terrific introduction to those who only know the radio hits.

0,"they were catchy for the 80's but mainly cool for the time.""Love in a Vaccum"" Sounds alot like a Fleetwood Mac song.the title track is still the Jam.""Voices Carry"" was the song.overall the Production&Music is dated but when they hit they did it right."
1,"I love this album, but don't get it if you like pure Antmusic. It's a softer album, but not that soft. Hey, for the girls out there, you get to here him talk in one and you'll like the picture!"
1,"It's more than likely that the single Everybody have fun tonight...&quot; is the one most people will be familiar with but this album was one of the classic 80's albums (and there were such a lot...).I managed to get this on CD last year after having it on vinyl for ages and then losing it.  Wang Chung never got the recognition in the UK that they had in the US, I remember a reviewer of &quot;Points On The Curve&quot; writing them off as too American, and that was with the class &quot;Dance Hall Days&quot; on there as well.The uptempo songs such as &quot;Everybody...&quot;, &quot;Hypnotise Me&quot; (English spelling) and &quot;Let's Go&quot; are all worth the money, but my favourite song on here is &quot;Betrayal&quot;.  This ballad is a moving song about a guy who married his child-hood sweet-heart and has realised that she's betrayed him with someone-else while he's been out working all hours trying to get enough money to live.  A familiar story to many people I think...Wang Chung always sounded to me like they were having a good time and just wanted others to share in their fun.  Go on, you know you want to..."
1,"This album's FLAWLESS. I'll always love Outkast for Southern Playalistic, ATLiens & Aquemini. But I'm thru with them now. Stankonya was a mess. Now ..... {sigh} ...... now I don't know what dem boys doin. They branched out to another fanbase. Thats all good and well, but I CAN'T stand that new stuff. {Speakerbox/Love Below}  It just ain't Outkast. Anyone who listened to them before Stankonya can tell ya."
1,"you have probably heard ""Down under"" on the radio and liked it, but not known who played it.  Well, if you have heard a song that went ""we come from a land down under...where women glow and men plunder (I think those are actual lyrics)"" then that song is on here.  Far from one hit wonders, these guys were able to put out an album chock full of brilliant compositions.  It was a career defining album, and was never really surpassed by them afterwards.  It is a fun sort of album, just having some fun with great music.  They are one of the best bands to come out of Australia, and are well worth your listening if you missed out on them back in the day.  Highly recommended 80's classic, along the lines of Pat Benatar, Cyndi Lauper, The Buggles, and the other cool musicians from that time.  I have the original version of this disc, but based on the strength of the normal tracks, I can easily say that the new ones will also be fun and brilliant."
1,"After Isaac released his first album in 1967 he shifted gears, and went from more of a jazz sound to more of a soul sound. Without a doubt he knew how to straddle the soul sound of the 60's and make it palatable for the 70's. He showed alot of genius here with a solid cover of the song ""Walk On By"". I'm now convinced there is no ""Bad"" version to this song as I've heard 2 other versions besides this one. Of course I'm talking about Dionne Warwick's, and Long Island's The Outcasts. He also does a good version of I guess this to be an original ""One Woman"", Then there's the transistion of the song ""By The Time I Get To Phoenix"". I feel Isaac did a very awesome job with this, and the style sounds like it would inspire Ike and Tina Turner to do the same with ""Proud Mary"" two years later, but I feel that ""By The Time I Get To Phoenix"" is a break-up song, and this is something I can't stomach. I would say the same thing about Glen Campbell's version too; What we put ourselves through for the sake of loving someone else. I happen to feel the man was wrong for assumming that the woman wanted fancy things; if that's what he did. I got that message from the song. I could be wrong, but yes a woman wants to know that a man will be responsible, and dilligent, but she also knows that his circumstances may not be all that good with a low-paying job, and so as a couple they must be able to talk this out, and not think that well the way to win a woman is through the wallet. That's sexually harassing, and very prejudical. There's no way that a man, and for that matter a woman should put themselves through that because it only ends up to where they are so hard, bitter, and unfeeling that they end up alone. I can only say for all you couples out there make sure you're falling, or are in love for each other for the right reasons, and not to make someone into something for yourself...e.g. A woman turning her boyfriend into her father's persona, or A Man making her girlfriend into a female celebrity because he doesn't want to give up the lustful feelings he has. To walk away 8 times, and come back that's pathetic; for both of you. You shouldn't have gotten together in the first place, and then the world wouldn't have to suffer through a real tear-jerker like this one. Mind you we all need to have a good cry every now and then, but make sure it's not because of a self-destructing pattern; because once the tears are through the next move will be suicide. Well enough of that I've pretty much exorcised my hard depressed feelings for the song, and once again it's not because Isaac did it, but the song is terrible. The other song I can't even pronounce let alone tolerate, so I'll just leave to this that it's the worst song on this album. It's not quite there to being a classic, but kudos to Isaac for being bold enough to take the step."
1,"After several promising but eclectic efforts that produced such gems as  Your Song, Country Comfort and Skyline Pigeon, with this album, Elton and  Bernie would hit their stride.  A cohesive, youthful, expertly arranged  collection of delightful pop, this recording is the first that purposely  added the glamour, outrageousness, and pure showmanship that defines the  70s, platform-shoe Elton we all remember with fondness.  Besides the  delectable retro-pop of Crocodile Rock and the opaque melancholy of Daniel  (the hits), this record also features the gorgeous, spirited and dramatic  Blues For Baby and Me; High Flying Bird, which is heartbreaking, and  Teacher I Need You, a serio-comic adolescent fantasy. Paul Buckmaster's  stirring strings add much to the arrangements, which are like confections  made for your ears, and Elton's confident vocals soar over them."
1,this is a great single. it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. if you have not listened to this album then i recommend you do or listen to the soundtrack
1,"This is one of those great, underrated classic rock albums that should have been given more of a chance.  Like Head East's ""Flat as a Pancake"" and Red Rider's ""As Far as Siam,"" people that don't know any better tend to dismiss this album as good for only that one song-- in this case, ""Rock and Roll Hootchie-Coo""-- and proceed to categorize the artist as a one-hit wonder.  But this is simply not fair.  There's plenty of other strong tracks and classic moments here:  Such as how the excellent instrumental ""Joy Ride"" segues perfectly into the tragic ballad ""Teenage Queen.""  Or the sloppy party-rocker ""Uncomplicated.""  We have another great instrumental in ""Time Warp"" and an absolutely perfect, if not slightly too short, Motown-like pop tune in ""It's Raining.""  And though dated-sounding, ""The Airport Giveth (The Airport Taketh Away)"" is just too cleverly written to not be a favorite guilty pleasure.Granted, this album is not perfect.  Some of it is too rooted in the trends of it's time to escape irrelevance.  There's also a lot of cliche, both musically and lyrically.  Like in the lyrics to the aforementioned ""Teenage Queen""-- the story's over-similar to ""Last Kiss.""  And ""Teenage Love Affair"" comes across a little too goofy for my tastes.But negatives aside, as a whole this is a great album for any classic rock fan's collection.  It's variety in style from track to track, clever production and Derringer's top-notch musician-ship, as well as some great guest appearances from Joe Walsh and Edgar Winter make it well-worth the price.  Here we see an artist who is versatile and talented-- a thing that is becoming, sadly, less and less common."
1,"Well, I would have given this a full ""Five"" star review but as a collector of their work with everything from vinyl to CD, I can't understand WHY they put the single version of ""Everybody Wants To Rule The World"" when it's the same as the album version?! Anyway, they could have used the U.S.12"" remix of this track instead of wasting time on the same track twice. Other then that, a great addition in which I had all the original sources and all collected together for this double CD set. I also recommend picking up the all there CD's up to ""Sowing The Seeds Of Love"" & the others if you really get into this band. I am also on the web which you search ""Judemac Forever"" on msn."
1,"After the massive success of the 'Screaming' album and tour, Priest went back to the studio to create what would eventually be a 'Screming' redux. 'Defenders of the Faith' released in January 1984, was my first Judas Priest record and for that reason alone it holds a special place in my heart. But after twenty-two years does it hold up? 'Defenders' is as loud a commercial metal album as you'll find from this time period, but it comes at a time in Priest's career when they had said all they could say and were far from the metal innovators of the previous decade. 'Screaming' had laid the template and 'Defenders' sticks to the formula although as many reviewers have said, there are no obvious hits. Openning track ""Freewheel Burning"" is one of the few great speed metal tracks that Priest were putting out by this point, with Halford and Tipton both at the top of their games from a performance standpoint. Other soild tracks include ""Jawbreaker"", ""The Sentinel"", ""Rock Hard Ride Free"" and maybe ""Another Thing Comin"" sound alike ""Heads Are Gonna Roll"". ""Love Bites"" is OK, not great, and ""Eat Me Alive"" is hilariously stupid. Is it just me or do the songs descend in quality as you go deeper into the album? ""Night Comes Down""? Why?? ""Heavy Duty""???? Dumbest song of all time!!!! Judas Priest were now pandering to the lowest common denominator of metal fans (hello ""Heavy Metal Parking Lot""!). The 2001 remaster brings out the loudness of the original but also includes yet another awful song from the ""Turd-bo"" sessions and an, ""Oh you've got to be kidding me"" version of aforementioned dumbest song ever! What, no great smoking version of ""Freewheel""? Terrible! While Metallica and Mercyful Fate were proving metal was still the best and most dangerous music on earth in 1984, Priest was going through the motions. Buy it for the sheer loudness quality and for four or five solid metal tunes, but ignore the mediocrity of the songwriting quality over all, especailly from ""Love Bites"" on."
1,"When Toto IV came out and had its three top ten smashes, this band's popularity was at a peak. I certainly do consider that album to be one of their best. However, it surprises me how quickly people jump off the bandwagon when a popular band trys something a little different. Toto's release of this album was accompanied by the release of the single &quot;Stranger In Town&quot;, a pretty heavy-sounding song (for them, at least) about a killer on the loose in Great Britain. Quite a change from the poppy delights that are &quot;Rosanna&quot; and &quot;Africa&quot;. But you know what? The song ROCKS. In fact, the whole album rocks. The song did hit the top 40 for a little while, but it spawned none of the interest that the fickle pop chart community had in the safer previous album. With such songs as the beautiful, sad ballad &quot;How Does It Feel&quot; along with numerous fine rockers such as &quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Angel Don't Cry&quot; and the catchy mid-tempo &quot;Holyanna&quot;, it's hard to believe that this album didn't do better. Toto to this day (yes--they did put out a few very fine albums in the 1990's that got no notice in the states) continues to reinvent themselves, and they certainly did so back in 1984 with this underrated gem. For Toto fans and fans of melodic rock, this is a recommended buy."
1,"Even though ""The Present"" didn't generate a BIG hit (or 3) like LDV had, this record/cd still sounds just as good to me. The Moodies have long abandoned the thought of playing any of these songs live, and I'm not sure why. Blue World is vintage Justin songwriting with the slick production of Pip Williams and Moraz.Take the keyboard layering and texturing, along with the sonic qualities of the drums, mix in the songwriting skills and talents of every member of the band, and - voila! That unmistakable Moodies sound. This one is worth picking up just to hear John Lodge's best song/s ever -'Hole In the World/Under My Feet'. Also, 'Meet Me Halfway' is as underrated a song as the album itself. The production quality (esp. for 1983) really makes this an enjoyable album to listen to - even 22 years later and after repeated listenings. There are only 2 songs on here that aren't 'A' material: 'Going Nowhere' gets a B , and 'It's Cold Outside of Your Heart' gets a B+.  What can I say? I love this album!"
1,"Although most of the songs on here may not be as memorable as ""Walk This Way"" or ""Sweet Emotion"",this album is a display of true,bluesy,gritty,""back to the roots"" rock and roll music.No shiny over-produced numbers here like ""Rag Doll"" or ""Angel"".Perry and Whitford's guitars are as raw as they will ever get on this LP and Joey Kramer's overlooked drumming is given the attetion it deserves.Steven Tyler sings in an almost unrecognizable voice,but still sounds brilliant in concert staples like ""Mama Kin"" and ""Dream On"".Other standouts include ""Movin' Out"",""Make It"",""Walkin' The Dog"", and ""Write Me"".All of these songs have superb guitar melodies and Tyler's style is just untouchable.This is the foot-stompin',feel good rock and roll Aerosmith became known for.But with this album,they weren't at the head-bangin' hard rock of ""Toys"" and ""Rocks"" yet.Still,anything from Aerosmith's 70's cataloge is destined to please any lover of true hard rock."
1,"This album is truly amazing. Dylan's musical opus about heartbreak, desolation and failed relationships. If you only listen to one Bob Dylan album, this is the one. Highly recommended. This is his 70's masterpiece and perhaps his best album ever in my humble opinion."
1,"The year was 1971, Marvin Gaye had been under contract with Motown for his entire career but never been able to express himself freely on his albums let alone produce them. Motwons's founder Berry Gordy wanted the music under his label to remain radio friendly and commercial and Marvin Gaye wanted more artistic integrity and more personal control over his music. At the time, singles were still more important then albums, especially in Soul and Motown had a specific sound and style that couldn't be modified. Gaye was very depressed for a while after the death of his singing partner Tammi Terrell in 1970, he took a break from music and even had a tryout with a football team (with little success). Some time later he came into contact with a songwriter from Motown called Al Cleveland that was working on a political song called ""What's Going On"" for the Originals. Gaye liked it and said he would produce it but eventually they changed their minds and offered the song to Gaye instead. Gaye went back from his hiatus, talked with Gordy who initially opposed it but eventually had to give in and let the single be released. The song became a smash hit and topped the R&B; charts and reached the #2 position on the pop charts. Berry Gordy finally gave up to let Marvin record the album he always wanted. The rest is history. The album that was called ""What's Going On"" just like the single would become an massive success with huge impact on Soul music in the early 70's and is now generally known as the greatest Soul album of all time. It serves as the blueprint for political conceptual soul albums and helped artists like Stevie Wonder to release his personal albums aswell.""What's Going On"" is the album where Marvin Gaye explain all the troubles he's seing in America in the early 70's. It's more then just a simple protest album for the Vietnam war, cause Marvin raise the issues of poverty, crime, racism and drug use. As aformentioned, this is a concept album and based on the single with the same name many songs are rather simular in arrangements and theme. It's based on the return of a Vietnam veteran to America and how he see things changing and how the experience of war changed him. Marvin tries to find shelter and soloutions thanks to gospel and prayers. Curtis Mayfield had already released a simular album one year prior calledCurtisthat is close to being flawless but Marvin's album is even deeper and wider and reached out to the people in diffrent way. Let's take a look at the songs to ge a better perspective of this albums impact and greatness.""What's Going On"" is not too surprisingly the first song. Considering that Marvin was in a deep depression at the time you can hear the sorrow in his voice when he sings the lyrics but he still shows incredible emotion and that's why it sticks out over 35 years later. The Song Is about the Vietnam war but also about the things happening in his own country with racism, sexism and so on. Marvin replied with the lines ""We don't need to escalate/ You see, war is not the answer, For only love can conquer hate"". This is the song that probably desribes the world at the time in the best ways. ""Whats's Happening Brother"" is rather simular, it desribes the return of his brother from a 3 year duty in the Vietnam war and how he's a changed man but just aswell desribing the changes in America during the 3 years he was gone. On ""Flyin' High (In The Friendly Skies) Marvin deals with drug use and what it does to you. He sais ""Well I know I'm hooked my friend/ To the boy who makes slaves out of men"". Curtis Mayfield would also make songs about this on his albumSuperfly. ""Save the Children"" deals with poverty among children and the dreadful situation they sometimes live in. ""When I look at the world it fills me with sorrow/ Little children today are really gonna suffer tomorrow/ Oh what a shame, such a bad way to live"". Sadly there's still alot of children growing up under tough conditions today.""God Is Love"" is such a beautiful song. Here he talks about his love and faith in god. Marvin Gaye grew up in a very religious home and a strong faith followed him through out his life. ""Mercy Mercy Me"" is a song that Al Gore probably could use cause it deals with polution and environemt problems caused by man and how it is destroying our beautiful world. ""Right On"" deals with the rich and poor, good and evil. Apart from tne other songs here it's arrangements sounds more like Latin-Jazz then Gospel infleunced Soul. This song is considerably longer then the other one's an clocks at 7 minutes and then it seques into ""Wholy Holy"". This one is very slow and sophisticated and is about Jesus. The last song is ""Inner City Blues"" and deals with the problems in the inner cities. It's very simular to ""What's Going On"". Main themes, povery, crime, police bruality.Overall, the imapact of this album is undeniable, not only it was an emancipation for Marvin but it also helped others to become socially conscious and make the music in the way they wanted. It isn't strange that ""What's Going On"" started a trend that would get all these kind of albums started. Now, it's been 35 years ago and it does sound a little dated with it's sound and too many songs sound very simular but the lyrical themes are still present today and songs like the title track are still amazing to this day. A classic of classics, ""What's Going On"" is deeply recommended and should have a special place in any music lovers collection."
1,"A debut classic like ""Ready to Die"", ""Illmatic"", and ""Doggy Style.""  And while NAS, BIG, and SNOOP have not recorded material that has  excelled the quality of their first records, I think Big L would have gone on to make a better, more satisfying album.  That's not to say that this record is not all that.  ""Put it On"", ""MVP"" and the title track are all banging and the jazz laced DITC sound provides an interesting contrast to Big L's slashing voice. Big L is a versatile and extremely intelligent rapper with a razor sharp delivery  and  rhyming style that has influenced  the likes of Em and 50.  Big L was one of the most talented rappers (in my opinion, along with BIG and NAS, one of the top three) to come out of the 90's, all hip-hop fans must pick up this record ."
1,"black sunday has to be one of the best albums ever.these guys have been in  the hip hop scene since 91,no wonder their stil around today.its not your  average rap group because dj muggs drops some smokey beats.if your gonna  sample from other artists,do it like dj muggs,his hits from the bong has  the beat from dusty springfield's &quot;son of a preacher man&quot; its  classic.i remember listening to this album everyday,you know back in the  day when rap was still donr for the love of it.anyways,this is cypress  hill's best album.get it!"
1,"This is a classic album, by far one of the best albums released in the late 1980s. Babyface composed beautiful songs for their debut album. My personal favorites are One Night, Ready or Not, and Can't Stop. This album is perfect with the lights down."
1,"Slow down guys! Just because the name of this album is Captain Fantastic doesn't mean it is so great. I would give it 3 and 1/2 stars. On this album there isn't good songs like Philadelphia Freedom or Pinball Wizard which are also from 1975. Title song is boring,Tell Me When The Whistle Blows and Writing are also not very good songs. The best songs are SSMLT,Tower Of Babel,Better Off Dead and We All Fall In Love Sometimes and other songs are ok. I am a big Elton's fan and I was listening this album thousand times and I think that GYBR and Dont Shoot Me are much more better than this. But don't get me wrong,this is more than good album!"
1,"the title track is good and fopp is a heavy rocking classic and smoking, and can't 4get the sweet sticky thing pure funkjazz love this 2disday."
1,"Since first hearing Violator last year, I've purchased several DM albums but always concluded that Violator was their best, along with their earlier pre-Black Celebration material.  I held off buying &quot;Ultra&quot;  thinking I'd be disappointed with the direction they'd taken their music  in.  However, upon seeing it going cheap in a bargain bin, I had to get it  just to see what it was like, fully expecting to hate it.  To my surprise,  I didn't hate it. . .I loved it.  As with Violator, I had to listen a few  times to really appreciate all the songs, but after doing so I'd have to  say this ranks right up there with Violator.  &quot;Home&quot; is the best  cut, followed closely by &quot;The Bottom Line&quot; and  &quot;Insight&quot;.  The singles, &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; and  &quot;It's No Good&quot; are next best. The rest of the songs fill out the  album, but I feel if any of them were removed it would detract from the  listening experience.If you're still stuck in DM's past as I was, give  &quot;Ultra&quot; a listen and instead of looking back, you'll be looking  forward to their next album."
1,This album is a classic masterpiece!!! One of the best albums of all time!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five Stars!!! A+
1,"It is hard to believe that this record is almost 40 years old, but it is.  And it couldn't have aged any better.  It still sounds as fresh, creative, and innovative as it did back in the day.  The seven-album run that the Moody Blues reeled off from 1967 to 1972 is quite stunning, and opinions are often all over the map as to what their best of those seven is, but in my mind, it is an easy question to answer.  With all due respect to the other six albums, all of which are excellent in their own way, as well, the answer for me will always be ""In Search of the Lost Chord."""
1,"This is a typical conversation when this album's playing:""Who's this?""""Loverboy.""""Loverboy?  You mean the guy in the headband, the ones who do 'Working For The Weekend'?""""Yeah, this is the first album.""""Wow.  I didn't know--wait a second, I know this song!  This song rocks!  I didn't know Loverboy did this song!""The song in question is ""Turn Me Loose,"" which in the (dear God, has it been that long?) 27 years since its release has turned into a veritable eighties anthem ... and it's usually the one song that people who hate Loverboy like.  This album is also a reminder that before they became arena rock darlings, Loverboy was marketed as a new wave band.  If you're used to ""Working For The Weekend"" a lot of this record will surprise you.  From the synth-heavy doomed-to-be-dated ""Lady of the 80s"" (which they still do in concert much to my amusement) and ""Prissy Prissy"" to the hard stomp of ""Teenage Overdose"" to the Cars-like ""D.O.A."" and ""The Kid Is Hot Tonite"", ""Loverboy"" is a pretty good view of what power pop was like in 1980.  It's a solid debut and still sounds pretty good on the iPod, so buy with confidence."
1,"Having released the best-selling-album-ever just five years before pushing this one out to the market was, already, a quite difficult milestone. However, ""Bad"" still delivers good music not to disappoint the true fans, even though it did disapointed the critics and the profane masses expecting a ""Thriller v.2"".If compared with ""Thriller"" this one would definitely look unfairly like a poor recording, but when listened as a standalone project (what it really is) you'll find quite a good R&B; dance pop album, delivering quality, creativity and a several pop gems. Remarkable collaborations also helped to made this one an essential.Keeping in mind it was dated on 1987, you'll understand why this chap was used to be considered then the ""king of pop"" as it sounds far ahead from it's era... far so good that it even gave the enough reasons for the jealous to start the harassment that lead to Michael Jackson decline. It marks the beginning of the end of a legend, away from the music scenario.A personal masterpiece on Michael Jackson's career, carefully produced by Quincy Jones, who also deserves a special recognition on being the one who put ""Off the Wall"", ""Thriller"", ""Bad"" and Michael Jackson himself on the place they are, even today, no matter the resentful: at the pop highest.For a full ""Bad experience"" customers and real fans might find interesting to get also a copy of the complementary movie, 'Moonwalker', which showcases a kindo story around the ""Bad"" songs (keeping also in mind that the imdb rating is 4.7/10 as of today...):Micheal Jackson - Moonwalker [Non-US Format, PAL, Region 2, Import]"
1,"After the great ""Long Distance Voyager"", The Moody Blues had to top it, they couldn't, but it still had some very good music nothing less.  ""Blue Water"", was a great leadoff track, the bass part by John Lodge always reminded me of The Move.  Hayward's ""Meet Me Halfway"", is one slick piece of pop-rock.  Their top 30 hit ""Sitting At The Wheel"", was a nice rocker by the Moody's, another song that comes close to ELO.  ""Hole In The World"", love the military drumming by Graeme this song leads into ""Under My Feet"", a nice little ditty by Lodge.  ""Running Water"", got a little airplay back in '83, very nice ballad by Justin.  And the disco mix of ""Sitting At The Wheel"", a nice treat for a few listens.  Not as strong as ""LDV"", from 1981.  They almost got too mellow here."
1,"Listening to this album, it is necessary to distance yourself first from their pounding progressive punk genius and think about when this album came out. New Wave and synth-pop like Simple Minds were the vogue. This album sounds as good as anything at the time, and the first six tunes especially are fabulous, with excellent writing and stupendous production. Uptown is likely the most retro-Stranglers sounding tune, with the chorus more interesting than the rest of the tune. After that the album is not as strong, some rock n roll tunes kind of finish it off, but the first 6 tunes definetly rank among some of the Stranglers' best. Skin Deep reminds me of Simple Minds &quot;Don't You Forget About Me...&quot; but means more because Stranglers wrote the tune themselves (unlike Simple Minds) and because they were true originators of the whole punk New Wave movement, not Jonny-come-lately-s."
1,"I had a lot of fun with my vinyl copy of this album when I'd get into arguements with people as to whether or not backward masking was used on records.  I'd plop this record down on the turntable and run the ""Fire on High"" track backwards and you'd clearly hear ""The music is reversible, but time is not...turn back...turn back...turn back.""  Also, at the beginning of the song Down Home Town they've got ""Face the mighty waterfall"" backward masked into the intro.I won't repeat what everyone else wrote.  I think most of us know where this album fits into the history of ELO and what the songs are like, but what we're wondering is whether or not to pony up the money to but another copy of it.Well, I listened to this version through my computer on nice Sennheiser headphones and I can't tell where the improvement in sound happened.  Perhaps I can hear it on some of the quieter passages.However, I can say that the ""stripped down"" Evil Woman is very cool, especially with the additional verse that isn't on the original.  Also, the Waterfall instrumental is great.  The ""strange magic"" single edit is the same truncated and out-of-context version that I got rather sick of when it was played on the radio all the time.  The alternative version of Fire on High sounds like the intro to an old Twilight Zone episode only it goes on and on and on.  It was interesting but I'll probably skip it next time I listen to this CD.So, should you but this again?  Sure, there's just enough here to warrent spending the money.  Of course, if you don't own it in any form then here's your chance to get a truly great 1970's progressive power-pop period piece that you'll find to be a lot of fun."
1,"When the air turns cold and the daylight hours diminish, I think of when I became familiar with Leonard Cohen's the Future. One December, my mother, whose love of unconventional, eclectic music I inherited, used Christmas money from my grandparents to expand her CD collection, including the purchase of the Future, an album from which the two best songs of her adored Natural Born Killers soundtrack were taken. I gave the album a few trial listens, as I had always expanded my tastes by waltzing through Mom's tape and CD collection.The Future, however, was much different from the Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin I picked-up from her. To a high school student whose favorite bands were mostly FM radio staples, Cohen sounded dark, sober and distant. The Future's simplistic arrangements, slow pace and Cohen's gritty, tuneless voice made the Future a failure on the scale that I rated Led Zeppelin IV and Hot Rocks as classics. Yet, the brooding articulateness of the album was something I slowly found to be spell-binding. Lines such as ""Things are going to slide/Slide in all directions/Won't be nothing/Nothing you can measure anymore/The blizzard, the blizzard of the world/Has crossed the threshold/And it has overturned/The order of the soul,"" had both an immediate impact and an abstraction and complexity about them that made the lyrics mysterious and affecting after several listens, even after memorization. Songs of love and of anger I had heard but the precise lyrics of Cohen, speaking of that disappointed feeling of one who loosens-up in celebration and struggles to find a hand to hold (""Closing Time""), of desperate patience (""Waiting for the Miracle"") and intellectualized hope (""Deocracy"") were fresh, exotic and intriguing to me. Even the slow-paced music began to engage me, with its sleekness, craftiness and exact appropriateness to the song. All in all, to a high school student whose favorite bands were mostly FM radio staples, Cohen was somebody bizarre and astonishing.He was a musical persona more multifaceted and more vibrant than any other I had known, a writer of consciously futile protest mantras; a desperate romantic always embraced by love to the point of entanglement, a witty old man (three times my age) sitting lonesome at the edge of a bar waiting for someone to pour his wisdom and wry observations into. This was the person I saw as a listened to the Future, relentlessly - with headphones on the bus, driving to my part-time job, alone in my room - always surrounded by cold air, falling snow and the sense of wonderment only a poet can provide. The Future was my introduction to a more cerebral, more mature side of popular music. Even today, after absorbing the Velvet Underground and Nico, Astral Weeks and Blood On the Tracks, I have yet to hear an album that stimulates me in the way the Future does. I am thankful that I discovered Leonard Cohen's best album during that lush, white Pennsylvania winter at the age in which every new discovery in music seemed supernatural."
1,"First of all I am appalled at some of your editor reviewers.  What planet do some of them come from? Luther - the man who put the dance band CHANGE on the map, the man who did the amazing vocal arrangements for David Bowie's groundbreaking YOUNG AMERICANS & toured with Bowie for many years, who lulled us all into love in the 80's - has the chops & then some with some truly great albums.  And this one, with I Wonder, Any Love (whew!), For You To Love (Ouch!! Incredible!!), I Wonder & the cover of Love Won't Let Me Wait (This song nearly belongs to HIM now!!!)Pretty much all of his recordings until Power of Love, which in my opinion is the beginning of his potency loss.  Sorry, but as great as Barry White is, Luther could mop the floor with him.  And he is right up there with AL Green.  I don't wish to compare these great men, however.  But the Wilonsky must be doing some bad drugs if he thinks for one minute he knows of what he speaks!!!  Anyone who agrees with me, give me an amen!!!  I saw Luther live on tour with Anita Baker in NYC when this album was out and he nearly blew Ms. Baker off the stage.  And this was when she could do no wrong (early in her boom period).  He had the women in the audience nearly fainting in their seats and the men hooping & hollering & slapping five to his power.  These days it seems his selection & production may need a bit of viagra, but he's still the King of Romance, with maybe MAXWELL at his heels. Make no mistake - LUTHER IS THE GREATEST!!! Amen!!!"
1,"Tupac Shakurs Sixth album, and first post death album  ""The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory"" was released in November 1996, just two months after his passing. Exit 2pac, enter Makaveli. The album is twelve tracks in all, and contains guest appearances from Makavelis group the Outlawz, Val Young, KC & Jojo, and Tyrone Wrice. Album intro...begins with Pac calling out names, other rappers he was beefing with at the time: Biggie Smalls, Nas, Jay-Z, Mobb Deep. Tupac really lets loose on this album, coming out intense,dark and angry on many of the tracks like ""Hail Mary"", ""Blasphemy"" and ""Life of an Outlaw"". ""Toss it Up"" feat Kc & Jojo is a nice rap/r&b collab. ""To Live and Die"" is another more relaxed track a dedication to L.A. and California, although Pac doesnt hesitate to call out his former labelmate Dr. Dre,... ""Just Like Daddy"" feat. Outlawz is a track about the ladies. ""Krazy"" is a deep track, where Pac talks about thug life, time passing and getting high. ""White Man'z World"" and ""Me and My Girlfriend"" follow and raise the albums tempo even more. ""Hold ya Head"" is another deep track about death, jail,money, lost homies, Pacs main message though is a positive one, keep yourself up no matter what. Album ends with ""Against all the Odds"" a powerful closer where Pac takes on all opposition and lets it be known he is ready for war. Tupac was developing more and more as an artist, and this music goes far beyond just anger and calling out names, into deep, powerful, music with an important message. This is definetly an album worth listening to and having in the collection."
1,"Facelift by Alice In Chains started it all. Grunge began here. So did one of the greatest bands of all time, Alice In Chains. Jerry Cantrell's guitar playing is amazing and so are his lyrics. Michael Starr and Sean Kinney's rythm is tight as always, and Layne Staleys voice sounds as amzing as ever!The album starts off with one of Alice In Chains best songs, 'We Die Young' is hard, heavy, and scary! 'Man In The Box' is next and it just maybe Alice In Chains best song. It has one of Jerry Cantrells best guitar solos. Next is the classic 'Sea Of Sorrow' which is also one of Alice In Chains best songs. 'Bleed The Freak' is one of my all time favorite Alice In Chains songs, its just a killer song! 'I Cant Remember' is another great song, a little slower but still heavy as hell! 'Love, Hate, Love' is a great hard rocker, its kinda crazy though! 'It Aint Like That' doesnt really stand out but its still a really good song. 'Sunshine' is a killer hard rock song with awesome guitar! 'Put You Down' is a strange but good song. 'Confusion' is a really strange song but I love it. 'I Know Something about you' has Beatles-esq lyrics but metal music, is killer! 'Real Thing' is the perfect song to end the album.Buy this you will love it and I can garanty that!!!"
1,"This album takes the noise to a further level, it is an album with no pauses, with beats and lyrics that seem more sporadic (Welcome To The Terrordome) than the more straightforward but still original jams on PE's  first two albums.  The subject matter is again about empowerment, plus gets  onto the topic of Hollywood (Chuck is joined by Ice Cube and Big Daddy  Kane), AIDS, interracial dating, B-Sides vs. A-sides, the use of 33.3  records vs 45's, women's empowerment, 911, etc.  Different things are done  with the vocals making songs like Reggie Jax and BSide Wins Again something  special, Terminator gets disgusting on &quot;Leave this off your F**inkg  Charts,&quot; and Flav has two jams in 911 is a Joke and Can't Do Nothin  For Ya Man.  The beginning of the album is quite amazing, the intro  followed by Brother's Gonna Work It Out, my favorite jam on the album.  Overall, another classic PE album, more experimental than even Nation of  Millions was."
1,"The late Rick James first love was the fine art of jazz music.  He eventually found his calling in the field of funk and soul.  In 1981, James released ""Street Songs"", which goes down in Motown history as quite possibly the greatest funk album ever released.  This album stayed on top of the R&B charts for over 5 months, and was fueled by the the #1 mega hits ""Give It To Me"", and ""Superfreak"", which dominated the pop charts all summer long in 1981.  This album had no trouble crossing over to the playlists of middle America Radio airwaves.  This is some of the best dance music ever waxed and although his career did not have the longevity everyone expected due to a multitude of personal problems, Rick James for one year, ruled the pop world.  He took a little from George Clinton's style, and passed on his own influence to such pop stars as Prince.  This cd contains two bonus tracks that are extended dance mixes of his big hits ""Superfreak"" and ""Give It To Me"".  An array of stars play supporting roles like Stevie Wonder,Teena Marie and three members of the Temptations, most notably the bass voice of the late Melvin Franklin.  With a bargain price attached to this classic album, the purchase of this cd is a no brainer if you were one of those souls who fondly remember the dance clubs of 1981."

1,"In 1982 progressive rock couldn't be less popular.Newer rock styles based in punk were in vogue and alot of the prog rockers of the previous decade had gone the way of the dinasaur-literally.That's why members of three of the most popular prog rock bands came together to form Asia and to make their music work,they chose to blend big arena rock sounds with pure pop melodies and hooks.The result is one of the best first sides any VINYL LP ever had with the first four songs-""Heat Of The Moment"",""Only Time Will Tell"" (both huge hits),""Soul Survivor"" and ""One Step Closer"" all add up as a perfect example of what style Asia were trying to achieve,and for better or worse paved the way for very similar 'hair metal'-type bands to come.Although as the next part indicates Asia will never be mistaken for heavy metal-most of the songs there showcase themore bombastic side of progressive rock-lack of melody and oftenoverplaying.But on ""Here Comes The Feeling"" the band are back to pop perfect again as on the first songs.Often written off by critics as being too commercial 'Asia' actually ends up sounding fairly enjoyable in certain sections and,of course Steve Howes wailing guitars,bloated as they can be do convey the point well."
1,"Elton is revved up with his new band on this under-appreciated record. Why is it underappreciated? Let me give you all the huzzahs first.The production was loud and bombastic, just like having his new band and the excitement it brings to the ""band"" sound. All his success money paying for studio time and production excess, but you can feel the thrill. Half of the songs are up there with his classic album tracks and singles, and with a couple more on that level this would have been a terrific album on par with say, Caribou. Elton certainly was in this year the Phil Collins/Midas of the mid-70's. The inclusion of ""Sugar On The Floor"" is welcoming here, despite its feeling a little more like a 'Blue Moves' track.Ok, so why under-rated? Well, the duds are serious duds and gimicky tracks. The opening medley could have been developed into one or two meatier songs, but there is a sense of hurried-ness with packing them into one track. Fun, but more likely to be something you'll skip over after hearing it, and that's not how you open a record. In a way, it's good they got it over with so you can move on to the better songs. 'Feed Me' and 'Billy Bones' would have been a more toned-down opening one-two punch. Bernie's lyrics here really come off as slightly more directionless and one-off than we've become accustomed to before this record. He was getting that way on 'Caribou' but the Captain LP sort of put him back on track. He still has plenty of good wordplay.Alas, a record showing the crash of a great success story in its energetic, nervy rock, makes it easy to miss the better songs. It's a disjointed collection this one, but thanks to the interwebs, you can juggle the song order to make this one more listenable so you can enjoy it for its merits."
1,"Great arrangements and production abound here.  ""Sowing The Seeds of Love"" is a great song (one of the best of the 80's) and is a take-off of the Beatles during their St. Pepper's days (trippy).  The great Oleta Adams is stunning on ""Woman In Chains"" and ""Badman's Song"".The good thing is that this still sounds great today. An impressive album."
1,"Tears for Fears seems to have aged more gracefully than most other 1980s music, in part because the band relied more on real instruments than synthesized noise, in part because they really sang. Fifteen years after its release, Songs from the Big Chair remains the essential album from this duo.Beyond having two huge hits, which sound great even now, the album has a consistency and continuity. 'Head over Heels', for example, just fits best when it is bookended by the live recording of 'Broken'. 'Working Hour' is a fantastic vocal and instrumental romp -- why it never made it to the 'Greatest Hits' set is beyond me. While it might be stretch, I have always thought of 'Big Chair' as one of few 1980s concept albums. Every track is distinctive, but you cannot help but listen to the whole thing through."
1,"I still have my original MCA vinyl of this baby and while the remastering job is quite nice, there is one audible goof.  ISLAND GIRL slows down in the final chorus.  If you listen carefully you can hear the pitch slowly change while the CD plays.  Don't believe me?  Play the last few measures of the song which are exactly like the beginngin ones and you will notice the change in pitch.  There is no key change in this song.  My LP does not exhibit this problem.  Otherwise this Polygram release is wonderful!!"
1,"The Eagles' reunion, welcomed by most, shortcircuited the solo career Don Henley had to that point. With the Eagles, Henley played  southern California's John Lennon to Glenn Frey's poppy Paul McCartney; solo, he  delivered pointed observations on decaying morals and lifestyles while Frey  delivered drive-tape raveups like &quot;The Heat Is On.&quot;  (If the  call-girl expose' &quot;You'll Never Make Love In This Town Again&quot; is  to be believed, Henley knew that decadence first-hand.)With stellar  backup including members of Tom Petty's Heartbreakers, Toto, Bruce Hornsby  (on the gorgeous &quot;End of the Innocence&quot;)Sheryl Crow (her backup  vocals on the preposterous &quot;Garden of Allah&quot;) Take 6 and even  ex-Eagles, Henley guides us through a decade gone wrong. He spotlights ugly  Americans overseas (&quot;All She Wants To Do Is Dance&quot;), street crime  (&quot;New York Minute&quot;), insensitivity personal (&quot;The Last  Worthless Evening,&quot; &quot;Heart of the Matter&quot;) and  media-generated (&quot;Dirty Laundry,&quot;). Throughout, Henley writes  with character detail and empathy missing from Eagles' chestnuts like  &quot;Desperado&quot; and &quot;Life In The Fast Lane.&quot; The two new  songs notwithstanding, &quot;Actual Miles&quot; serves as an audio photo  album through the decade of Gordon Gekko and Ollie North, and establishes  Henley in front of the drum kit as a first-rate singer-songwriter."
1,"Astro creep is absolutely incredible. Zombie likes to mess around with different sounds. I got this when it came out cuz Astro Creep was so good. Its a little bit interesting, mainly for the chick on the cover."
1,"Not ""his best album besides Regulate...G Funk Era"" ...this is his best album period.His debut gets praised by millions of people who've only heard Regulate and This DJ...yeah they're great songs, but ""Take a Look Over Your Shoulder"" is a much better album, maybe a few skippable tracks but that's up to whoever's listening. It's damn near perfect."
1,"Following the surprise multiplatinum success of his classic 1994 debutRegulate...G Funk Era, Warren G sat back and watched the g-funk genre he helped originate explode. Outside of some production work and scattered guest appearances, Warren was relatively quiet for a full three years, finally dropping the follow-up, ""Take a Look Over Your Shoulder (Reality)"" in 1997. People seem to be pretty split in their opinions on this album, and I think that's because people were hoping for anotherRegulate...G Funk Era. That album was an ingenious blend of simple yet catchy, low-fi, and sunny, soulful beats teamed with fun raps. They were so beautifully laidback and made for perfect chilled-out listening. His raps are almost as appealing as his incredible production because he's so real; he seems more like a regular guy than any other Long Beach gangsta rapper. His raps are somewhere between talking and rapping, and his singing is somewhere between rapping and singing. So on this album, rather than just try to duplicate his debut with a sound that had been tiredly imitated for the previous three years, Warren instead took an admirably artistic route and made a very different album. ""Take a Look"" is pretty experimental, drawing from a more diverse range of influences. The beats are more dense than they were on his debut, often using a fuller range of instrumentation rather than the simple arrangement of synths, bass, and light sampling. He's really inventive a lot of the time, and it's cool. A lot of the music borders closer to R&B; than rap, it's definitley hookier, and there are some more obvious singles. One of the coolest things I like about this album is how he reworks famous songs. For instance, his spirited version of Eric Clapton and Bob Marley's ""I Shot the Sheriff"" is surprisingly successful. He's looking beyond hip hop on ""Take a Look,"" and the result is beautiful.The one big similarity between this and his debut is the result of the production. These beats are literally the smoothest around. I don't know how he does it, but every gorgeous beat on ""Take a Look"" is so chilled out and relaxing that it makes for the ultimate summertime or late-night listening. The pure funk and smooth instrumentals just make you feel good. In that way, it is a lot likeRegulate...G Funk Era. Lyrically, Warren is on a different page. Mostly, he just lets the beats do the talking, and much of the actual rapping is handled by his large list of guest rappers. There's a much higher-profile feeling to this project, and this is reflected in the lyrics and guests. Whereas his first album featured a small crew of underground Long Beach artists, ""Take a Look"" has a few more A-list MCs. Unfortunately, Warren would learn the hard way just like his labelmates Jayo Felony, the Dove Shack, Twinz, South Central Cartel, and WC that Def Jam was completely incapable or unwilling to promote its West Coast artists, and the lack of publicity led to disappointing sales for ""Take a Look.""After the intro, the album begins with a Nate Dogg collabo called ""Annie Mae."" Over a quirky and bluesy beat, the duo speak of a woman they both knew, and this song is all-around great. ""Smokin' Me Out"" features a particularly soulful Ronald Isley, providing an awesome appearance to a beautiful production, the hook is awesome. He kicks some nice lyrics on the cool ""Reality,"" and Jayo Felony and Knee-Hi guest on the discretionary ""Young Fun."" A matured Mr. Malik, Bad Azz, and Perfec show up to collaborate on the memorable ""What We Go Through."" ""We Brings Heat"" has an awesome vibe and features Jah-Skilz and Twinz, Warren's proteges. ""Transformers"" is gorgeously relaxing, with a space-age hook, and the classic ""Relax Ya Mind"" follows in a similar fashion. ""To All D.J.'s"" is the weakest song on the album, the beat's a little too sparse and subject matter a bit uninspired. K9 and PC assume the rapping duties on the funky ""Back Up,"" which is followed by another West Coast classic in ""Can You Feel It."" His cover of ""I Shot the Sheriff"" is ingenious, adding a g-funk twist to a classic standard, and Erick Sermon's EPMD remix is also great.""Take a Look"" is musically genius and very experimental and is really a joy to listen to for its phenomenal production. Warren G steps outside the g-funk box to help push his genre even further than it had been pushed before, extending into R&B; and pop music for this album. Even ten years after its release, I find this album perfect to pop into the player just to chill and relax, especially in the summer. It's sad that it's out of print now, but as it's still widely available, I highly recommend it. Warren G is a musical genius, and I really can't get enough of his production, and if not for the sheer brilliance of his debut, I believe this would have been hailed as the quality music it is. No, it's notRegulate...G Funk Era, but nothing really is, and ""Take a Look"" is an underappreciated gem of hip hop."
1,"Big L,Is by far one of the most clever MC's ever grasp the mic. He resurrected Harlem in the early 90's. A time when Harlem had very few hip-hop artists, some of whom were ashamed of there own area. Big L and Kool Moe Dee are probably the greatest MC's ever to rise from the Harlem streets. What kills me about this, is how so many folks jumped on Big L's jock after he was brutally murdered. Let's face it, a large majority of these reviewers only became interested Big L overnite. Why do you think his posthumous album &quot;The Big Picture&quot; is certified gold? Why couldn't everyone see this raw talent when he was living? It's become a redundant trend in music to all of a sudden pay close attention to dope artists after they pass away. If you weren't down with the underground from the jump just stay out, and keep supporting that garbage you call hip hop. Quit trying to pay your respects to the soldiers you know nothing about. Some of these people in these reviews go on and on about how L was so great, but don't probably even own any of the other DITC family albums. God forbid if O.C. dies...I garauntee will see some more bandwagon dikridders up in here, talking about how great  he was, when they didn't know squat about the man when he was alive. Personally when L died that was my worst Valentine's Day ever in life. He was truly an inspiration that taught us that being underground in hip hop can still be simplistic as hell while using witty punchlines, instead of complex as hell... with deep metaphors. If you add Lifestylez to your collection, explore the entire D.I.T.C. catalog as well, peep the classic albums from Lord Finesse, Show &amp; AG, O.C., Diamond D, and Fat Joe. Don't be a freakin tourist....support real underground hip hop. Quit coming around after somebody passes. The reason why hip hop is so screwed up right now is simply because it lacks the balance of underground and mainstream...when you have an equilibrium it provides the audience with more creative outlets and alternatives. But if the balance is gone and its shifted too far to the mainstream or too far towards the underground, you have a world of mimicry, lack of inspiration, and no creativity. Think about that....That's why hip hop was at its peak during the Golden Era -1987-1994.Big L RIP."
1,"Incognito have been one of the most innovative, exciting groups out there, but most Americans haven't even heard of them.  Each of their CDs is worth a purchase, but 100 Degrees and Rising is one of the first purchases to have.  Excellent for a Saturday evening dinner party, chillin' at the crib on a Sunday afternoon, or even for those moments when you just want to mellow out.  Highly, highly recommended."
1,"Dangerous is an amazing album...It entered the Billboard 200 charts at #1 and the lead off single Black Or White debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at #35 and jumping to #1 the very next week and staying there for 7 weeks...Dangerous starts off with an amazing song Jam...It has beats out of this world and with Heavy D with rap is awesome....The follow up single to Black Or White is Remember The Time peaking at #3 on the singles chart(blocked by Vanessa Williams Save The Best For Last)but stay at #3 for 5 weeks..next is In The Closet which peaked at #6 another amazing song..next Jam is released and even though it was the first Michael Jackson solo single to miss the Top 10 peaking at #26 but still a great song...next is Heal The World...which peaked at #27 but due to lack of promotion it didnt make the top 10....next is Who Is It?(an MJ classic)peaking at #14 but going gold....next is Will You Be There??(One Of My Fav's)..peaked at #7 and also going gold....Give Into Me was suppose to be the 8th single but was canceled due to certain FALSE charges agaisnt MJ...Non single stand out tracks are Keep The Faith,Dangerous,Gone Too Soon....This album is amazing...."
1,"An odd compilation that blends all the songs so there are no gaps in between - creating a disco journey, in a way.  What fans should realise is many of these are not the original recordings.  That's obvious I guess, to create the continous journey of the songs.  Nevertheless, it works and presents an ideal CD for a 70's party.  Just put it on, and start dancing.But - what do I have to do to find the original epic recording of &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; on a compilation?"
1,"It's hard to believe ""Memory of Trees"" came out 11 years ago;it has held up well over the passage of time.It's Enya's last great album before the New Age/pop of ""Amarantine"" and ""Day without rain."" Back in 1995,Enya still had her creative spark,her own voice.I agree with the reviewer who said that this is her saddest album;it is melancholy,bittersweet,from the opening title song.""Memory of Trees"" is elegaic&majestic.;""Pax Deorum"" sounds like it is from a Requiem Mass,it is a dark threnody.Unlike the reviewer who said that this has a ""disconcerting"" blend of spirituality&sensuality;,I don't find it disconcerting at all.""Anywhere is"" is a hopeful song,looking to possibilities.""Hope has a place"" is about love,but it is up to the listener to decide if it is romantic,platonic,etc.I've always had a soft spot for this song.""On my way home"" is a triumphant ending about return.This is truly a masterpiece of New Age music,a must for any Enya fan!"
1,"No Doubt is one of the few bands who improves with each album.! Gwens vocals are far less whiny on this album,and the lyrics are more serious then their debut.!Althou their debut was a flop for them I *Love* it you should check that out as well.!This album spawned such major hits as &quot;Don't Speak&quot;, &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, and &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;.!Which brought this ska band to super stardon they sold over 10 million copies of this album.! I bought this album without hearing a single song from it.!And I am proud to say I was NOT disapointed it is actually a good album.!If you are looking for something that is not over produced and more original then Britney Spears then check out No Doubt's &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;!!! The best songs here are &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;, &quot;Don't Speak&quot;, &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, &quot;Excuse me Mr.&quot;, &quot;Sweet 16&quot;, and &quot;Different People&quot;.!But that's just my opinions!!!Just check out this album!!!"
1,"This is a really great album. It sounds really cool like early nineties, summertime, you know that kind of sound. And it has some of my all time favorite Aaliyah songs like, Back and forth, At your best, Down, young nation, age aint nothin but a number, no one knows, and my absolute favorite Aaliyah song street thing."
1,"After emerging from the underground scene of the Bay Area, Too Short comes back with his mainstream sophomore effort Life Is...Too Short.  Unfortunately this contains only the clean songs not the original release.  This version also contains a few songs from the debut album Born To Mack.  The title track leads this album off with positivity and a message.  He incorporates funk guitar licks over deep bass kicks and keys to match production efforts.  ""Rhymes"" and ""Mack Attack"" uptempo tracks showcasing Sir Too Short's flows as he spits constant without any hooks or choruses.  To clear rumours, ""I Ain't Trippin'"" clears the air as Short give a brief history of his quest to stardom.  ""...now that I established one fact / I came here to rap..."" a punchline found on ""Nobody Does It Better"" as he claims his position as a pioneer.  ""Oakland"" is a mainstream, R&B groove that's more like an instrumental interlude.  No he does not rap or flow on this song, but he does calmly takes us on a ride in a Cadillac Barritz on Trues and Vogue with the top down feeling the breeze.  Representing East Oakland like no other, ""City Of Dope (Edited Version)"" is the darker side of the city streets.  Most would ignore Too Short because of his favoriate word, but these tracks shows his versitility and has a statement.  Produced, written, performed and mixed by the artist with little help personalised this LP as you can feel the sense of pride taken for his releases and this one is no let down.  Too Short still ""don't stop that rap""!"
1,This album is a progressive rock landmark!!! A classic recording!!! A+!!! Their finest hour !!! Five stars!!!
1,"The uncompromising self titled debut album of the politically motivated and vitrol charged band Rage Against the Machine remains one of the best recorded albums of all time and the best piece of material to ever come from the group.  The combination of rap, Zeppelin inspired riffs (check out &quot;Wake Up&quot;), and guitarist Tom Morello's sonic fueled solos made this album a real winner, but vocalist Zack de la Rocha's politically charged lyrics (which weren't misaimed much like on this album's follow up &quot;Evil Empire&quot;) are the real highlight.  Every single song, from the rip roaring opener &quot;Bombtrack&quot;, to &quot;Killing in the Name&quot;, to &quot;Take the Power Back&quot;, &quot;Bullet in the Head&quot;, and the closing &quot;Freedom&quot; are all masterpieces that don't get stale.  This is the album that put RATM on the map, nothing they had done since would ever be as profound as their debut album, and even after almost fourteen years after it's release, this remains their masterpiece."
1,"I remember this album when I was 9. I love this album. She delivered a record that showcases her maturity while offering a diversity of music sure to appeal to her ever-growing audience of young and old alike. She covered the spectrum while still maintaining her own soulful identity. She had craft an album that has a distinctly personal feel to it.  This album is a glowing testament to her status as one of the decade's most vibrant,exciting,soul deep,straight from the heart young artists. This album allows us listeners the opportunity to witness Toni in an array of musical moods and settings. This album has been certified 8x Platinum. Remember,this was 1996-1997."
1,"I don't know what everyone's problem is with this CD. Its incorporates a good mix of old and new sounds and the result is a near masterpiece.  Out of thirteen tracks only two or three rate as low as ordinary.  Elements  of jazz, soul, and positive rap make this a screaming BUY!"
1,This was one of the first Hiphop albums I ever purchased and I still listen to it today I think that krs's style was best suited to Primos production. Once he lost Primo (with the exception of a few albums) he couldnt hold it anymore musicly. krs didnt care about the latest trends in music or about bein a thug or topping the pop charts he just showed his incredible talents on the mic and stomped all the wack MCs that deserved it. This was also the album that introduced the world to krs as a solo artist and he proved that he had plenty of ammunition left from his BDP days as well as few musical/lyrical tricks up his sleeve This album along with any other BDP release should be considerd mandatory listening for all you youngsters out there who are just getting into Hiphop this was the era that I belive Hiphop was the best about 93-98 its a shame that kris is doing the crap hes doing now I wish he would find a better producer or just stop doing albums and continue his carrer as a live battle rapper.
1,"Love Stevie, for his music, style and what he stands for and as he has matured so has his music. basically grew up together. LoveYou Man!!!!"
1,"I always thought Art had a difficult time choosing songs for his great voice but on this album he gets it right!  Every song is terrific!!  Here's how I rate the songs:1. I Believe (When I Fall in Love It Will Be Forever) - 9 - He does a great job on this Stevie Wonder tune - great start2. Rag Doll - 10 - One of the many classics on this album - could be his best solo song ever3. Break Away  - 9 - Another great song4. Disney Girls - 10 - or this could be his best solo song ever5. Waters of March (Aguas de Maro) - 8 - Good song - takes a while to get used to the arrangement6. My Little Town - 9 - Great reunion with Paul Simon7. I Only Have Eyes for You  - 10 - Another classic - great arrangement!8. Lookin' for the Right One  - 8 - Good song9. 99 Miles from L.A.  - 9 - Love this one too - what a mood10. The Same Old Tears on a New Background - 8 - Ends with a pretty good songThis is defintely Art's best solo album by far!!  Get this one first and if you like it get Angel Clare or Fate for Breakfast and a Best of collection -- ""Garfunkel"" or ""Simply the Best"" (Import) are the best choices available. His new collection ""The Singer"" has way way way too many poor selections and drags. Get the last 4 Simon & Garfunkel albums too!"
1,"I bought this album when it came out after hearing ""Behavior Control Technician"" and being floored by it. I wasn't sure when I bought it if the rest of the album could be that good and original. It was, and more. A brilliant piece of work that stands strongly amongst other great albums of it's time such as, ""Check Your Head"" by the Beastie Boys, ""Blood Sugar Sex Magik"" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and ""Ritual de lo Habitual"" by Jane's Addiction. A must listen for everyone who wants to hear mind expanding music that will move your soul. A true classic."
1,"For fans of early MJ this is the album for you. Some of the best songs include Don't Stop Till You Get Enough, Rock With You  and of course Off The Wall. Michael you're the best."
1,"There are no words.  Only truth, Justice and the Roc-Nation way.  Don't believe me?  The Streetz Is Watchin'.  Track 5."
1,Arista did a good thing buy releasing this cd full of Toni's best hits as well as a few sounds from the vaults we havent heard. Overall I think they did a good job of suming up all the hits that helped to make toni who she is today. Like what?*Give you my heart*Love shoulda brought you home*Breathe Again*Your makign me high*Let it Flow*Un-break My heart*I dont want to*Just be a man about it*Hit the freeway*Whatchu need*Un-break my heart (remix)I think these songs right here are the best on the cd but everything here is good. The bonus tracks are good but &quot;whatchu need&quot; is the best one to me. For all the toni fans you might not want to bother with this being that you probably have all her albums....for those who like toni and missed out on a few...this is a must have. Those who never knew anything about toni...this is also one for you to check out. Now that she is on Blackground records...we will see what she comes out with next but until then........this is it!Get it!
1,"It's pretty tough writing a review for an album where it appears that everything that can be said about this album has been said.  However, if Brian Wilson had that attitude about songwriting before doing &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, then we wouldn't be listening to it, right?  So here's my two cents:If you have the mono mix of this album, it is worth the extra money to upgrade to this CD.  The stereo mix brings out the Boys' voices to their fullest.  It will fill up you car or your home stereo much better than the mono version.Pop (or rock) music can be sophisticated, but still be accessible, attract new generations of music fans and reward repeated listenings, like &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.  If you were to believe the critics of 2000, you would think that &quot;Kid A&quot; by Radiohead just passed &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; in the music department.  Don't believe it.  In another 35 years, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; will still be revered and loved by new generations, while &quot;Kid A&quot; will probably be looked at with disdain, a pompous monstrosity, much like the the works of Emerson, Lake and Palmer are looked at now in '00.Oh yeah, the music on here is great!  Unlike their earlier hits, which are badly overplayed on the homogenized, baby-boomer oldies stations, the songs here never seem to get tiresome.  It's kind of like a hazy summer day at a tropical beach, with dark thunderclouds on the horizon, at least for me.  Any fan of rock or pop music should have this CD in their collection, without question.  Once you have it, the recent Brother Years compilation (1970-86) will make a fascinating bookend for &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.  It does show that &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; dwarfed nearly everything else the Beach Boys did afterward, even though there were some interesting stops along the decline."
1,"This is a greatest hits collection that was first released in 1974. Amazingly, none of the songs sound outdated in any way. Everything sounds like you'd hear it at a party! There's only one song that I wish was on here that isn't and there are no bad songs on this CD. If you are interested in the music of Elton John in any way, check this out!!!"
1,"In 1982, Steve Howe of Yes, Carl Palmer of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, Geoff Downes of The Buggles, and John Wetton of King Crimson formed one of Rock's first &quot;supergroups&quot;.  The result of this union was this unvbelievable debut album.  Penned by Wetton and Downes, this album produced the classics &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot; and &quot;Only Time Will Tell&quot;.  This album was released at the same time MTV hit the airwaves, so these songs received many hours of play.  This album still ranks as one of my personal favorites even after 20 years.  I can't get enough of Geoff Downes' keyboard work and especially Carl Palmer's unparalleled drumming.  Each track is first-rate and the insturmentals are perfectly blended.  This album is a must for serious rock music fans."
0,I thought this was supposed to be software that had cheese recipes in it.  Instead I get a lot of Bass and some guy talking through his nose.  I finally was able to make some but it did not taste that good so I am going to return this because it no workie workie.
1,"This really isn't a review, just me wanting to briefly share my sentimental feelings about the Moodies and this particular album.Having been born in 1964 into a household that did not allow rock music, I didn't discover The Moody Blues until the Summer of 1981. I can remember so very clearly lying on the floor on a hot day and hearing 'Gemini Dream' on the radio. I was instantly in love with the sounds of the music, lyrics, and what I was to later learn, John Lodge's  unique voice.  I was ecstatic when a few months later I got another delicious taste of the Moodies with 'The Voice'. I have been smitten by them ever since. Before LDV, I had never even heard of the Moodies and had certainly never heard anything sounding remotely like them.  Since that time I have discovered the earlier works of this great band. They never cease to amaze, enthrall and delight me. Every time I listen to a Moodies song, they take up a little bit more space in my heart, where this album holds a very, very special place.Now that I know them, I cannot imagine a world without the beautiful music and words of these talented and wonderful men who call themselves The Moody Blues."
0,"For me, this is just a British singer with a bunch of good songs, but let's not fool ourselves with this one. THIS IS NOT ELTON JOHN!! I mean, which is the best song here?? ""Recover your Soul""?, ""The Big Picture""? And what about the 80% of the album?? Believe me, I am one of the most devoted EJ fans from Venezuela, but I have to tell you that this record is depressing!! Even ""Leather Jackets"" is a masterpiece compared to this one!! Sorry...."
1,"Finally, a gorgeously restored, masterfully produced, lovingly detailed account of the Dusseldorf band's epic slice of dark, yet beautiful synth pop.  It's truly a shame that this record was largely overlooked in the United States. In the US, you'd think that Depeche Mode had singularly invented this particular style of emotional, deep, brooding, dark electronica... not so, friends. Even what later became Depeche Mode's graphic and photographic style is taken for a test drive here. This was the first release on which now famous photographer Anton Corbijn was allowed to design the entire visual presentation. This album should have been HUGE. One is left to wonder what might have been if the record label, ZTT, weren't entirely consumed by their Frankie Goes to Hollywood craze at the time. This is recommended listening to any child of the 80's that was into alternative, new wave... the stuff that MTV's 120 Minutes was made of.  Thankfully, the album retains it's brilliance even 25 years on. It's a calling card from another time.""A Secret Wish"" is one of those maddening ZTT releases that was released in many different versions over the years. Different mixes, different edits, different running orders... finally, after 25 years, all of the incarnations of all of the albums tracks are presented in one complete edition.  Lovingly packaged, with detailed liner notes (to help you make sense of all the tracks), and immaculate audio remastering. I couldn't recommend this album more.  As ZTT used to put in the runout groove of their records and other odd places on many of their releases, ""For Those of You with an Eye for the Finer Detail, We Salute You.""For completists, I also highly recommend picking upOutside WorldandWishful Thinking, both of which include many remixes and tracks from this same era, but not found on this release."
1,"Evidently, there are 2 versions of this single.  I bought one way back in the day which has LOSER on it, accompanied by CORVETTE BUMMER and these two other UNBELIEVABLE songs!  TOTALLY CONFUSED, a mellow song with (get this) a female back up singer, and one of Beck's greatest songs of all time--MTV MAKES ME WANT TO SMOKE CRACK, where Beck tears it up on the piano.  You need to find this version of the single as well, because the songs on this particular version are really cool, but having a Beck collection at your home without MTV MAKES ME WANT TO SMOKE CRACK is like showing up at church naked...it's UNSPEAKABLE!"
1,"Even the most funk-obsessed will find soul-satisfaction in this 2-CD anthology.  Roll back the carpet and get on the good foot because these horns are ready to please, please, please.  The Godfather is never too far from the action but he does step aside long enough for the J.B.'s to show why they're the premier funk band in the business.  Maceo Parker is way up front, providing ample evidence of just how much his yakety sax contributed to James Brown's success.  Fred Wesley, on trombone, occasionally runs out of ideas before he runs out of notes, but this is not the kind of compilation one scrutinizes with a micrometer - you just get it and get into it.With 30 great-gosh-almighty-hit-me-one-more-time-again tracks to select from, you might imagine there are quite a few standouts, too many to mention them all.  Blessed Blackness is especially nice, as are Dirty Harri, Parrty, Doing It To Death, and Pass The Peas.  My personal favorite is I'm Payin' Taxes, What Am I Buyin' - almost 10 minutes of outstanding backbeat, tight horns, great singing - and that magic ingredient - it's okay what you say."
1,ONE DAY HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FAVORITE OF MINE FROM UGK. I HAD TO REPLACE THIS CD IN MY COLLECTION.
1,"GUILTY is generally considered Streisand's best ""pop"" recording.  I tend to agree.  The union of Barbra and Barry Gibb was strategically brilliant.  Gibb, Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson's production put Babs in a whole new arena for the legendary singer.  The trademark Bee Gees sound blends incredibly well with the inimitable vocals and produces some of Babs' best recordings.GUILTY generated three huge singles:  WOMAN IN LOVE and her two duets with Barry--the title track and WHAT KIND OF FOOL.  My favorite track however is the gorgeous THE LOVE INSIDE---it still gives me chills.  The remaining tracks are all good tunes and GUILTY is certainly a pinnacle in Streisand's 40+ years of recording."
1,"Those who say that Elton John's streak of great albums ended with &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; should listen to &quot;Made in England&quot;. Paul Buckmaster's superb orchestral arrangements are heard belatedly once more, after a long, long, time, most notably, in the classic &quot;Believe&quot;; which is just as memorable a song as &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;, &quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot;, &quot;Someone Saved My life Tonight&quot;, &quot;I'm Still Standing&quot;, &quot;Sad Songs (Say So Much)&quot;, &quot;Sacrifice&quot; or &quot;The One&quot;. Percussionist Ray Cooper is back, along with guitarist Davey Johnstone, giving some of their best performances in their careers. For once Bernie Taupin has written an entire album of fine, witty - and at times, funny - lyrics, ranging from his musings on the Northern Irish troubles (&quot;Belfast&quot;) to Tennessee Williams (&quot;Lies&quot;); there's not a single dud in the whole lot, though &quot;Pain&quot; comes perilously close to being filler. Elton has never sung with more sincerity as he has in the title track or in &quot;Believe&quot;; his vocals on the other songs sound equally convincing. Along with &quot;The One&quot; and &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; this has to rate as the best of Elton's work from the 1990's; indeed, I believe it will be remembered as a classic alongside his great albums from the 1970's."
1,Great clazzik s@#t E-40 forty water iz killin em all in the rap world.I love this whole disc a must buy for any serious rap heads.
1,"Make no mistake-Luther Vandross is an excellent modern R&B;cronner but he can SURE pack a punch on the right mid to uptempodance funk tunes and ""Busy Body"" has plenty of 'em.From theopening ""I Wanted Your Love"",""I'll Let You Slide"",the slamming""For The Sweetness Of Your Love"" and the burning,sexual tital song-all specacularly produced by Marcus Miller.Oh and thenthere is ""Superstar"" and all that stuff.But seek out ""Busy Body"" AND Marcus Miller's similar sound self-titaled 1984 LP (if you can) and you'll be so satisfied!"
1,"what can I say about Stevie WOnder that hasn't already been said?? Musical Genius and trensetter along with creating a style and vibe all his own. this DOuble Album is the kind of album which reflects a wide range of topics  from everyday life and Love and everything else in between and a Musical Blend of Stews that sizzle from start to finish.  ""As"" is always the song that moves as does ""isn't she lovely"", Another Star, knocks me off my feet, I wish, sir duke,etc... so many great songs, stylings and Production that still blows the mind some 30 plus years later. incredible Music from an Incredible Musical Genius."
1,"This is by far my favorite Stevie Wonder album released in 1973 right in the middle of his well known classic period many consider this his pinnacle acheivement, which i agree imo, dont even think about hitting the skip button every song is good and needs to be heard here is a rundown 1. ""Too High"" starts the album off jumping in the right way best opener for stevie in his career. 2. ""Visions"" i love this song to death probably my favorite song on the album. 3. ""Living For The City"" everybody knows this song the tale of an inner city youth of where he comes from and living in poverty a classic among listners. 4. ""Golden Lady"" i love the piano beat, it's obvious this song is about a woman really great song. 5. ""Higher Ground"" this was a single from the album no need to explain we all love it. 6. ""Jesus Children Of America"" the aspects of religion, great chorus to go with a timeless song. 7. ""All In Love Is Fair"" great ballad Stevie sings his heart out. 8. ""Don't You Worry Bout A Thing"" this has a latin feel to it which fits the album perfect one of my faves. 9. ""He's Misstra Know It All"" closes the album perfectly and i mean perfect great piano beat overall 10/10 perfect album from start to finish."
1,"Yep, I was one of those 10-11 year old kids who loved disco when it was popular, and then totally rejected it by the time I was 13 (okay, maybe 14). But during when this music was at its peak in 1977-78, there were very few bands that I liked more than this fab foursome from Sweden, who at the time just happened to be one of the most popular in the world.As some reviewers have mentioned, there was a certain naivete` about ABBA that was so appealing back then. Part of it was that their music was upbeat without being too silly. Another part of it was the gorgeous vocal harmonies between lead singers Agnetha and Frida. Now that I've come full-circle to appreciate the 70's disco I grew up on, as well as the 80's metal and 90's grunge and industrial that I've grown into, I can say that nothing quite brings back the way I felt in my early double-digit days more than putting on GOLD, the definitive ABBA greatest-hits CD.The CD begins with their first U.S. #1 hit &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;, the song that broke them into mega-stardom. Relentlessly upbeat, this song helped define the disco era. It all ends with their very first U.S. (and international) hit &quot;Waterloo&quot;, which they recorded back in 1973, and showed that they were upbeat even before there was disco. In between are 70's classics like &quot;Fernando&quot;, &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; (which was so well-utilized in the wonderful film THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT), &quot;Money, Money, Money&quot;, &quot;Take A Chance On Me&quot; (during which is impossible to resist the urge to toe-tap), and &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot; (Ah-ha!).  There are some 70's curios like &quot;Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)&quot;, &quot;Does Your Mother Know&quot;, and &quot;S.O.S.&quot; but even these are entertaining.  There are even some early-'80's gems like &quot;Super Trouper&quot; and &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot; (which is probably the greatest disco-love-ballad ever).Listen, I don't listen to this CD often, and it is in fact the only ABBA CD I own. But, every once in a while, maybe every 3-4 months, I need to hear some of this music. And if that's what you need to do too, then I think you need to get this CD. 'Cause if it's an ABBA fix you need, then there isn't another CD you can get that can satisfy it as well as ABBA GOLD! :)"
1,"call this one &quot;Bodge on Boogie&quot; because its THAT good, folks!Now you know..."
1,"I really hope that this CD has reissued the VERY beginning of &quot;Things Are Getting Better&quot;, where Cannonball tells the engineer (Jack Higgins) what the tune will consist of, who plays when, and then tells the lineup to &quot;speak your little sermon, then get the **** out&quot;. &quot;Blues Oriental&quot; is great, as is this whole CD, &quot;Groovin' High&quot; being my personal favorite, but what makes it one of the best are the collaberators - Wynton Kelly, Percy Heath, Milt Jackson, and Art Blakey, who, by the way, plays perfectly behind this band. Cannonball is at ease and blowing so well here because of these players. I really believe that Riverside (the label that originally recorded this and a host of other great classic '50s and early '60s jazz LPs) got the best out of many of these artists, for whatever reason. Another great Riverside Cannonball recording was &quot;Portrait of Cannonball&quot; with Blue Mitchell and Bill Evans, with Philly Joe Jones, and Sam Jones."
1,"Seriously.  Just crank that puppy, and thrill to the way its glorious swooping bassline makes your subwoofer earn its living, and to the way it glides from DM's trademark minor key into major and back again, and to the way that it all just sounds so effortless.It clearly wasn't, of course.  These guys (now minus Alan Wilder) went through some well-publicized ugly times to get to the point that they were able to pull off _Ultra_ -- but they also managed to move beyond the stifling cynicism of _Songs of Faith and Devotion_ and come up with something catchy, cathartic, and occasionally quite moving.  I'd rank it right up there with _Violator_, _Black Celebration_, and (if I may plug a largely overlooked personal favorite) Mesh's _Who Watches Over Me?_ among the best albums ever released within its genre."
1,While great musically - this BBR remaster not quite as sonically amazing as other reviews have noted - and not that different from the Legacy release. Booklet notes are interesting. Pity BBR stopped using SuperCD cases
1,"This album is truly mind blowing, no other way to describe it.  A fusion of such a variety of sounds... done so well, this is a great example of why Stevie is regarded as a legend in the music industry.  I would def. recommend this to younger people, because EVERYTHING on the radio these days is complete garbage.  This is REAL music."
1,"Released in 1988, Viva Santana amounts to the most diverse Santana CD, in that it is made up of remixes, live performances, and unreleased studio material stretching throughout Carlos Santana's many years in the public eye.  ""Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen"" is the one song that falls into more than one of those categories (both a remix and a live version are included).  None of the unreleased studio material is from before 1979 except ""Ballin',"" recorded in 1967, and it is interesting to note how its sound is characteristic of the early years.  However, the unreleased studio material is overall not that strong. Improvement through remixing is generally not a big concern for me, but it can be detected a bit here.  There are naturally a lot of rockers and Latin tunes, but two of the most desirable tracks are live cuts of the pretty numbers ""Song of the Wind"" and ""Europa,"" as always with great guitar by Carlos.  ""Soul Sacrifice"" is merely another rendition of the Woodstock version, but also included is the group's previously unreleased performance at the giant music & arts fair of ""Persuasion,"" one of my favorite Santana tunes.  There are enough of Santana's finest songs on this double CD to justify its purchase as a greatest hits package of sorts, but in a broader sense it is simply an excellent Santana sampler."
1,"&#34;Bad&#34; is my favorite Michael Jackson album, so I was thrilled to see all of the &#34;Bad 25&#34; items they were releasing.  Cool vinyl picture disc is an instant collector's piece.  I suggest getting two if you plan on playing one and keep the other one unopened."

1,"this is an essential British blues-rock album, with a great meshing of talents. Jack Bruce had better power in his voice than Clapton, so Bruce was the principal singer. Clapton did his guitar-God thing, with the usual choices of unusual (but beautiful) chords. Ginger Baker bangs the hell outa them drums, and voila!Beautiful music..."
1,This album is kinda uneven but it contains their funkiest track ever Far East Mississippi. This song alone is worth buying the album.
1,"Despite the cynical (and hilarous) cover, this is really quite an adequate Greatest Hits albums. It includes almost all of the best songs from Don's solo career. I like Don Henley's music because he's honest, he's not fooling anybody, and he tells you what he really thinks in his songs, instead of just catering to the audience like so many others. This is rare in an artist today; you have to dig through an awful lot of boy bands and sell-outs to get to the Don Henleys, Roger Waters, and Bruce Springsteens. Anyway, this has most of Don's best songs that are both lyrically cynical and honest as well as still managing to be melodic. Dirty Laundry, The Boys of Summer, New York Minute, etc. are all great tracks, and The Heart of the Matter (one of my favorite ballads), The End of the Innocence, and others are flat out masterpieces. Buy this album if you want a good overview of Don's solo career, although it is missing a few songs, which is why I have it 4 stars instead of 5."
1,"I listen to a wide variety of music, and I think that Alison Krauss has the most beautiful voice in all of today's music.  The pop acts of today can't compare.  &quot;I've Got That Old Feeling&quot; has 12 exceptional songs from bluegrass to country including the title song, &quot;It's Over&quot;, and &quot;Wish I Still Had You&quot;.  Not only can Krauss sing, she plays the violin to perfection.  If you haven't listened to Alison Krauss yet, you are in for a treat!"
1,"Before rap took over the airwaves, Charlie and his brothers dropped the bomb. Nothing but hits on this one. Summer of 82 belonged to the Gap Band.This album has been sampled a lot in a quite a few hiphop classics.The Hits:Dropped the Bomb (Act like you  know)Early in the MorningOutstanding (Classic)Seasons No Reason To Change (Love it)"
1,"Live albums are not often held in high regard in an artists discography. Although there are many exceptions to that rule, many listeners simply turn their noses up at live recordings. It's too bad, because this live album lives up to the quality of most of his studio albums. This album was executed perfectly. Joel just came off of a string of 3 multi-platinum selling albums before deciding to record his first live album, ""Songs in the Attic"". Joel, being the smart showman that he is, wisely decided to play cuts from his first 4 albums (besides ""Piano Man""), that were not huge hits. Aside from that, Joel also had a strong backing band to give these older songs a thicker sound, more in line with his bigger hits. Joel seized the opportunity to bring his earlier discography to life, and he succeeded brilliantly.The album starts off with a bang on ""Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)"", which clearly presents that the listener is in for a treat. Some of my favorite cuts are ""Summer, Highland Falls"", ""She's Got a Way"", and ""I've Loved These Days"". Like I said, many of the original versions are outshine by the new live versions, including ""Streetlife Serenader"", ""Captain Jack"", ""The Ballad of Billy the Kid"", and ""Los Angelenos"". His voice is a large part in the vast improvement. It just sounds thicker and full of life. The melodies and feel of the music is warmer than that of the studio recordings.Although I can't put this album above some of Joel's most seminal work, I will say that it's a lot better than his first three albums, and definitely stands as essential listening for those seeking out the beautiful crooning talents of Billy Joel."
1,I enjoyed his single hits and live stuff for years and this one is a great one to get .
1,"Just like every 2Pac, it sold as one of the best cds ever. Well, this is a awesome cd, a must have. This is a classic, and if u don't have it, then i think u should get it soon."
1,"I am not a Dylan expert or even lover of his music (im lukewarm about him)...ive heard/owned about 8 of his albums now, counting this one, and let me say this album is INCREDIBLE...if you love music, if you believe that music is supposed to be important (as I do) then get this. What a flawless piece of artwork."
1,"Being that I was a child from the 80's I was raise up hearing and reading about this album from the books, magazines, T.V. and of course the radio. What more can be said of this album? EVERYONE knows the songs and its incredible history. Simply put, this album is a staple like bread, milk or butter. You can't be without a copy. Now comes this special edition and for all the originals greatness, this one outshines it!Remember the incredible remastering done on HIStory? Well imagine that applied to the entire Thriller album. The sound is unbelievable! Everything is so crisp, full and alive! The songs practically leap out of the speakers. You've never heard Thriller like this before!All Michael Jackson fans should already have this album and those who don't, should consider buying it. I strongly recommend this album to anyone who wishes to experience the true artistic side of MJ, the original Thriller days MJ. Enjoy the King of Pop!"
1,"The title track not withstanding this album seems throwntogether in comparasin to what came before.Once again Steviereinvents &quot;Hello Young Lovers&quot;,&quot;At Last&quot; and even &quot;Light MyFire&quot; in his own charming way but the arrangements are downrightbizzare and make little sence even by Motown standards.Theyeven tacked on &quot;Yester Me,Yester You&quot;,a fairly old single onwhitch Stevie's voice is still cracking a bit on the high notes.An okay album with great songs like &quot;You And Me&quot; but there isdefinately some filler here."
1,Again glad to have this cd as part of my collection - had it as a vinyl album and missed it.  Great music and wonderful memories every time I hear it.
1,"I have been going through my 1000+ CDs for the Popular Culture class I teach and I have come to the conclusion that &quot;Madman Across the Water&quot; was a seminal album in my life.  I seriously started listening to FM radio in the early Seventies because that was the only place to hear &quot;Levon,&quot; which was my favorite song for about half a year (I believe it was replaced by &quot;Knife's Edge&quot; by Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer).  Consequently, the shift in my musical appreciation from Top Forty to more sophisticated musical forms can be traced to this particular song and this special album.Of course, once I had enough loose change I bought the album and promptly proceeded to play the first side about five times as often as I flipped it over and played side two; having the CD means I tend to listen to the whole thing all the way through.  I would argue that &quot;Tiny Dancer,&quot; &quot;Levon,&quot; &quot;Razor Face,&quot; and &quot;Madman Across the Water&quot; equals the best side of any Elton John record.  I also used the title track as part of a poetry unit for English class (ah, those liberal days of yore).  The movie &quot;Almost Famous&quot; has made &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; popular again, but anybody who listens to this CD is going to find out there are some other great songs too.Ironically, &quot;Levon&quot; made its way onto the third volume of Elton John's greatest hits collection.  Just another example of the cherished memories of our youth exploited by the commercial interests of some soulless giant company."
1,"...and we just got MTV in my home, I think it was May. I was immediately transfixed by the new music video channel. Prior to my budding interest in New Wave music, which started a couple years before, I spent the 1970's listening to Kiss. And considering the lyrical content of just about every Kiss song, I can see why it appealed to me as a pre-teen. It's beyond juvenile. But now it was time to grow up and listen to songs about spaceships and aliens, with bands looking the part. Enter A Flock Of Seagulls. From the first time I saw the video for 'I Ran', I was hooked. The song was (and still is) awesome, the band looked odd and cool, and I had to have the LP. So as I often did at that age, I cleaned the house to earn the $6.99 to buy the album from my local record store. Thankfully, they had one misplaced copy, and I got it!It turned out to be a great year for music, and I'm not just talking singles. The bulk of most New Wave LP's released in the early 80's were often very good, and this album was a prime example. I remember the first time I heard the instantly memorable and catchy 'Telecommunication', I had to play it again. The sound that stood out most to me on the album was Paul Reynolds' very distinctive guitar. His classic guitar riffs rule energetic timepieces like 'You Can Run' and 'Modern Love is Automatic'. I couldn't get enough of this band at the time, and even remember the world premiere of their new video, 'Space Age Love Song'. The band were hot at the time, but it was a shame to have them viewed as a joke in the musically miserable 90's. Thankfully, appreciation for the band as true individuals has remained, and even increased over time. I've never been ashamed to admit to being a fan, even when people were drowning themselves in dreck like Nirvana and Pearl Jam back in those grey days.This latest CD edition is remastered entirely from original studio master tapes, and sounds dramatically improved over previous CD releases. You also get essential bonus tracks. 'Windows' may be my personal favorite AFOS song. Its got a strangely catchy melancholy to it. 'Pick Me Up' makes its first CD appearance on this edition, and is just as catchy as some of the better album tracks.A Flock of Seagulls would go on to release two more very strong albums, Listen (1983) and The Story of a Young Heart (1984) before falling apart. When Paul Reynolds was out of the band, it was over. I loved seeing them back together years ago in the VH1 episode of Bands Reunited, and it looked as if everyone truly enjoyed themselves. Unfortunately, by the time the tour made it to my area, advertised as the original band, it was back to being Mike Score and his alternate band. It would have been a Dream Come True (pun intended, regarding their lackluster 1986 album) to have seen my first MTV love in their original incarnation. Say what you want about the hairdo, AFOS released some amazing music during their heyday. Go on, admit it all you metal and grunge fans, you always had a secret soft spot for A Flock of Seagulls."
1,"Hydra is a very different album from their first.It was obvious they could write hits and be successful, so Hydra comes out sounding like a group of musicians trying something different. They were still performing and/or writing hits for or with other people, so Hydra does have a more experimental edge than their debut.This I'm going to get out of the way first. The song '99' I have never truly embraced, only because I think it just goes on and on! In bands I really like, I try and find something good in every track they do, because face it, there's good in everything. '99' I liked when I first heard it, but after repeated listenings, its a song I skip. Thats a rarity. Especially on the first four TOTO albums for me.And another thing. When ever a video compilation is released of TOTO, it seems they are missing videos I remember seeing a LONG time ago, even before I became better acquainted with them in 1986. I remember, for a FACT, seeing in 1979, a video for 'All Us Boys'. Like any other late 70's performance / video clip, but I remember seeing it and what it looked like. Along with the '99' video, but 'All Us Boys' I know for sure was also a video release. Gripe over.It all opens up very moody. Honestly, I love the first 2 songs on this album more than many other TOTO songs. Both sound right together, one of the best track sequences I can think of. Hydra into St.George and the Dragon thematically and musically segue so well together, I can't hear these songs ever separate again.After '99', is another favourite track of mine, 'Lorraine'. I just love this song. And when I heard this album for the first time, I didn't know you could actually be a fantastic musician, but write great songs as well. I didn't honestly know how it was done, or how to get there. Thanks TOTO. Some of these songs are very basic to play, they are easy chord sequences and arrangements, but its the way they are played that standout so much. They make 4/4 time sound incredibly interesting, and if you're a musician, I really urge you to pick up at least one of the first 4 TOTO albums, they will honestly teach you a lot about arrangement and group interaction. The rhythm section is just so 'together', every other instrument can just play off of it, or with it. (Jeff) Porcaro and David Hungate were players that listened to eachother, knew how to play and how not to.I really can't say anything that comes close to how much can be learned from musicians this good.The main songwriter again is David Paich, and it indicates that he probably had alot of this material available to him for TOTO in his session years. The other members of the band start writing more material on the next two albums, but TOTO and HYDRA are what Paich's songwriting talent and creativity had to offer to talented musicians."
1,"No Doubt's members cite a strange variety of musical influences: Kiss, Prince and Madness, to name a few. And it's easy to imagine that their hometown itself, Anaheim, California (home to Disneyland), may have played a part in forming the band's schizophrenic,high-energy sound, which took TRAGIC KINGDOM, the band's second album, on a slow, steady ride up the pop charts. It finally hit No. 1 in December 1996, 14 months after it was released.This is ska-punk-new wave-dance music, with instrumentation ranging from hardcore guitar to mellow, reggae-style horns. Singer Gwen Stefani's voice is by turns peppy, almost adolescent (&quot;Spiderwebs&quot;) and emotionally wailing; she can sound a lot like Concrete Blonde's Johnette Napolitano (&quot;Just A Girl&quot;). When Stefani sings, &quot;I'm just a girl, little ol' me/Don't let me out of your sight,&quot; she does so without a hint of girlishness; her voice is all attitude, with a warbling edge of melodrama. For the most part, these are happy songs, though No Doubt do get philosophical on &quot;Different People&quot;: &quot;Once in a while I sit back/And think about the planet/Most of the time I trip on it/To kick back and think of how massive it all is.&quot;"
1,"It has been almost ten years since Outkast dropped there debut album &quot;Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik&quot; (1994). Since then Andre and Big Boi have delivered another five great albums and are widely respected by many as the most consistent Rap duo of all time. Simply put there ability to diversify, experimentand deliver original music time after time make them great. Organized Noize production is tight on this release. Outkast make there introduction on &quot;Myintrotoletuknow&quot;, and rep there hometown on &quot;Ain't No Thang&quot;. The title track &quot;Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik&quot; is a laid back cut to groove to. The highlight of this album for me is without a doubt &quot;Player's Ball&quot; an amazing single, one of those excellent tracks with a never ending amount of replay value. Another of my favourites is the deep &quot;Claimin True&quot;, a track about the streets, making money and paying dues. Outkast bring some melody with the love track &quot;Funky Ride&quot;. They then collabrate with Goodie Mob and deliver &quot;Git Up, Git Out&quot;, a first class track full of meaningful, introspective and positive lyrics. Pimped out &quot;Crumblin' Erb&quot; and &quot;Hootie Hoo&quot; keep things going nicely and the short &quot;Player's Ball&quot; (Reprise) closes off the album on a high note. Like all there albums &quot;Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik&quot; is one for the collection."
1,"First of all I'd like to send a posthumous apology to Big L, like a lot of people I didn't really check this album out until after he'd been killed, and what a talent that was lost.  If you have even a slight interest in hiphop and you don't own this album, just follow all the advice on this page and pick it up now.  I see a lot of reviews on here claiming Big L to be the G.O.A.T and there is real evidence of that on this album, though sadly this was his only release while he was alive.  L is basically the king of punchlines and there are so many quoteable lines on the album, my personal favourite is,""A tech nine is my utensilFillin' niggas with so much led they can use they d**k for a pencil"",thats taken from Da Graveyard and there are so many others I could mention on the album.The production on this album is typical mid 90's East Coast beats, and for the most part it's not bad, though it's never as strong as L himself.  Some people have been critical of the beats and it's true that a few of the songs sound similar beatwise, however there are some nice beats particularly on Put It On, Street Struck, M.V.P and Fed Up With The Bullsh*t.  If your into that mid 90's sound you'll probably like the production, but as I said what really stands up throughout is Big L.  I always think that the mark of a true great mc is that they can make an ordinary beat sound good with tight rhymes and flow and L has this ability, along with the likes of Nas, Tupac & Biggie.Every track on here is superb, my favourites are Put It On, No Endz No Skinz, Street Struck & I Don't Understand It, where L attacks all wack emcees.  A classic album that's been slept on by most people for way too long, when I picked this up I couldn't believe how good L was like I said if you have any interest in hiphop, buy this now.  If he had only put out more albums he could have been a serious contender for G.O.A.T.R.I.P Big L"
1,"This was a great album. It was the best non-concept album Alice Cooper had done in years. His voice sounds mature and clear in these songs. Ozzy, Slash, Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, and others make guest appearances on the record. Alice should have put together his own band, instead of just using guest stars."
1,"Almost 27 years since its initial release, I find I keep coming back to this album.  I must confess, it was the 1st Costello record I bought (we're talking 1985 here) & it made enough of an impact for me to tear through everything that came before it with relish & abandon.  In short, it made a fan out of me.Among Costello devotees there is obviously a healthy, ongoing debate as to which albums deserve ""classic"" status. By & large, most agree Imperial Bedroom is on that list.  The Costello admirers who hoist their fickle disdain on the likes of ""Man Out Of Time"" are few & far between. The fact that legendary Jazz trumpet great, Chet Baker covered ""Almost Blue"" to his dying day might also make one think twice as to it's merit.A lot of ink has been spilled on the ""Beatlesque"" production, courtesy of Geoff Emerick (The man who twiddled the nobs on a little album called ""Sgt. Pepper's""). But one thing that seems to set Bedroom apart from its predecessors is the fact that this is an album Costello pretty much composed on the piano, rather than the guitar.  More than anything that preceded it, Cocktail Lounge Cabaret & Rogers & Hart musical stylings take precedence over 1-2-3-4- Rock & Roll. All of which, might just account for any cries of ""he's lost his edge"".Yet, regardless of the lavish, chirpy production or the absurd ""Gershwin"" comparisons Bedroom received, the sentiments of the songs are as dark & jaded as ever. Here domestic unrest meets morning-after malaise. The infectious ""insult & flattery"" of ""Beyond Belief"" soon gives way to the eviscerating self-portrait of ""Shabby Doll"".  The best way to sum up might be: all the strings in the world couldn't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.Personally, I don't find a single dud among Bedroom's 15 tracks. And while, ""Man Out of Time"" & ""Almost Blue"" are usually on any given Greatest Hits compilation, lesser known greats like, ""Human Hands"" & ""Pidgin English"" need not be overlooked.For all its seemingly sophisticated studio trickery, Costello's liner notes reveal it actually took 3 Attractions to play the 1 accordion on ""Long Honeymoon""...One to hold it in place, another to work the bellows, while Steve Nieve played the keyboard. So perhaps Punk is not dead after all.Despite this little footnote, Imperial Bedroom is without a doubt one of Costello's most elegant & concise albums.  I suppose a case could also be made for it being one of his most self-obsessed. But for me, he rises above the fray of his own self-conflict in a way we all can relate to.While a bit of a flop in its day, Columbia advertised the album with one word: ""Masterpiece?""(much to Costello's embarrassment).For this discerning fan, the answer is simple: Yes."
1,"Neil Diamond's career has been a metamorphosis of sorts. He was born when he became known for tunes like &quot;Solitary Man&quot; and &quot;Cherry Cherry&quot;.Then he started growing when he moved to MCA Records with &quot;Brooklyn Roads&quot; up to &quot;Morningside&quot;.By the time he recorded for Columbia, he had matured with songs like &quot;Be&quot; and &quot;If You Know What I Mean&quot;.This album shows his first decade with Columbia wasn't too shabby.It also beacme a turning point because after this collection, he only had hits sporadically. But by then, his place in history was secure."
1,"I knew Lennie when I was teaching at McGill & doing jazz gigs at night in Montreal. He used to come with his classical guitar (I also had mine for Latin American stuff)to my gigs & at intermission we'd do some of his songs together. I don't usually put in personal stuff in my reviews, but you'll forgive me if I do it here.If you grew up in the 60s you've got to know the songs on this album which was recorded & digitally remastered in 1990.Songs like ""Suzanne,"" ""Sisters oof Mercy,""So long Marianne,""Famous Blue Raincoat;"" they're all there, & if you can't appreciate the genius of this wonderful man, there's something wrong. The poetry of these songs is studied in every English Literature class at every universioty in North America & every civized country.If you don't already have it, get it. You're in for a treat."
0,"Costello fans will likely brand me a heretic, but 'Bedroom' seems to me to be one of his more overrated recordings. 'Beyond Belief' and 'Man Out of Time' certainly rate consideration in a 'Best of' compilation. 'Long Honeymoon', 'Human Hands' and 'Every Home' are somewhat interesting. However, beyond that I find little that's especially compelling here.There are treats on the bonus disc that I enjoy more than much of the original 'Bedroom' recordings, thanks in part to Steve Nieve's scorching work on the ivories. In fact, the alternative version of 'The Town Where Time Stood Still' and the toe-tap inducing ""From Head to Toe"" merit inclusion on my desert-island list of Elvis favorites."
1,"What can you say that hasn't been already said or written about this splendid album.  When I first heard this album in 1966, I wondered &quot;What the heck is this?&quot;  This wasn't about girls, surf and hot  rods.  After a few listenings I couldn't get it out of my head.  The whole  recording is like a dream.  Brian Wilson's arrangements and use of unique  instruments makes for a lasting and memorable piece of work.  It is a  surprisingly mature work for one of Brian's age at the time. Every song is  a gem!  It's the only popular album whose beauty has brought me close to  tears.  If you haven't got this CD in your collection... ...your collection  is not complete.  I can see where Brian Wilson's sensativity could only  lead  to his world of isolation, withdrawal and dissapointment with a world  not as idealistic as he would wish.  After reaching such perfection,  anything else is anti-climatic."
1,"Sure,most of Mr. Clapton's stuff is reasonably good, but really that's only when it's compared to the immediate competition. Truly, when one is a rather naive 17 year old, some of these tunes may not sound half bad! But with some musical and worldly experience, this album, like just about all ""Rock"", fades away into the realm of adolescent sentimentality,bordering on noisy nonsense. Indeed, listening to say ""Bell Bottom Blues"" for a wizened old timer (now over 50) is simply an embarrassment, and the idea of these performers playing them now is even worse. Same with just about everything here. And the copy cat version of ""Little Wing"", originally written/recorded by Eric's old rival, J. Hendrix, does not come close to the original! Really, the best Clapton can still be heard on the older (1967-68)""Cream"" albums, much of which still sounds fresh and unique, not just thumping re-treads of 3 chord blues with banal lyrics."
1,"...and with it a legendary career in rock,balls and good taste.His 1984 opus,even though a product of that(golden,by the way)era,is a combination of wit,intelligence,social awareness,poetry,all topped by supreme  songwriting skills and one of the best voices in biz."
1,"from the very second you start this it's awesome. hell, it uses clips from shogun assasin, which is the first two lone wolf and cub movies edited into one. if you're interested in getting these you should get the individual movies rather than shogun assasin. oh, this was what they're watching in kill bill by the way. anyway...back on track.When the MC's came, to live our their nameAnd to perform (forrrrm)Some had, to snort cocaine (caiiinnne) to act insane (sannne)with before Pete Rock-ed it on, now gonethat the mental plane (plaaanne) to spark the brain (brainnn)with the building to be bornYo RZA flip the track with the what to guyCheck em check chicka icka etta UHHabsolutely the best hook ever!!! RZA is supurb on this, but obviously the GZA stands out. his lyrics were so fresh when this dropped that they literally blew fresh air into mainstream hip hop. unfortunately it seems like everyone that was around back then seems to have forgotten about this. i remember when tracks off this were played on the radio REGULARLY! it's a shame there isn't anyone of this caliber around any more (that gets air play), maybe we wouldn't have to deal with this mike jones, lil john, crunk, southern, bullsh*t anymore.buy this and raekwon's ""only built 4 cuban lynx"". of course get ""36 chambers"", ""forever"" is pretty damn good too. actually. f*ck it, get everything that wu-tang put out before '98.in terms of best wu-tang. no, this definately isn't the best wu-tang cd.only built 4 cuban lynx36 chambersliquid swordsliquid swords is definately a step down, cuban lynx and 36 chambers are interchangable."
1,Such a classic. Unforgettable every song just melts in your mind pick this up weather you are a new fonkayeer or ate just funking around
1,"My theory is that the great young performers burst onto the scene with their pentup perceptions of the world gathered in their formative years that explode in their earlier works.Then their styles mature, settle down and sometimes grow or not.Often their best work IS their first ones.This phenomena exists in the career of Joan Baez as much as anyone.When I was going to school (UC Berkeley) in the early 60s two women I was close to played the guitar and were inspired by Joan Baez, who I had never heard of before.It must have been common among a certain set of young women who idolized Joan, who wasn't much older than they.There are 5 cds one can consider to sample this period.There is one called Early Joan Baez, a 2 cd set. This has all the songs from her first four albums, two of which are quite obscure.These were followed by two concert cds containing many of the same songs, of which this is the best.Both concert cds have some of the same songs.This one is the expanded version of the original vinyl.""Chrystaline"" is the word often used to best describe her voice, especially at this early age.She was influenced by the folk scene of course, particularly by Pete Seeger, and incorporated Scottish and English ballads as well as American folksongs from Appalachia and elsewhere.I recall 40 years ago a friend and his wife telling me they cry when they hear these songs.After all these years, in which I haven't listened to these songs much, they retain their power.Three Dylan songs appear on this concert album.The next album is Farewell Angelina, which I believe has 5.Dylan's original liner notes appear as a long poem.In Whitmanesque fashion but more obliquely he conveys the effect Joan had on him, he with the gruff voice and representing nearly the opposite of her sensibilities in many ways.He wonders how truth can come out of such purity. He had assumed truth comes out of only roughness and ugliness.Though they were romantically enmeshed, the interplay between their musical personae was complex - a dance of opposites but sharing a deep sympathy for the human condition."
1,"Anyone who knows anything about good music owns this album. It is just that simple. On &quot;Blood On The Tracks,&quot; we hear Dylan at his most vulnerable and emotional. It is a very sad album as it is about his divorce to wife Sara but it is written from such a deep personal level that it becomes poetry that can speak to anyone who has gone through a similar situation. Most people labeled Dylan as a social critic and writer in the 60s but here, Dylan speaks from the bottom of his heart that few artists have managed to do without falling into a hole of obscurity and sappiness. &quot;Blood On The Tracks&quot; is without a doubt one of Dylan's top five albums of all time and one of the greatest albums ever. Like I said starting my review, if you like good music then you own &quot;Blood On The Tracks.&quot;"
1,"HEART OF STONE is a strong effort from Cher. Her voice lends very well to these songs, and it's a fairly consistent effort start to finish. The album opens with the mega hit &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot;, a signature song for Cher. There's a mix of a little of everything on here, from rock, to tender ballads. The feel of the album is very 80's, definately because it's from that era, but it's still a solid sounding album. I enjoy the tender &quot;After All&quot; with Peter Cetera, the theme from CHANCES ARE. Other hits spawned from this album included &quot;Heart of Stone&quot; and &quot;Just Like Jesse James&quot;. My favorite tracks include &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot;, &quot;Starting Over&quot;, &quot;After All&quot;, &quot;Still In Love With You&quot;, &quot;Does Anybody Really Fall In Love Anymore?&quot; and &quot;Love On A Rooftop&quot;. As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a good CD to start your Cher collection with. Not a bad CD to add to your collection."
1,"When ""Imperial Bedroom"" first hit the shelves, critics were falling over themselves with superlatives. Even Columbia's ""Artist...Masterpiece?"" ad campaign was begging the question. Was this the album that would crack the new wave stereotype that had been hung around Elvis Costello's neck since ""My Aim Is True?""The answer was yes...and no.Granted, hiring Geoff Emerick to put his Beatle-esque touches made for a handsome, rich sound, more than any other album in EC's discography. The expansiveness paid off right from the album's opener, ""Beyond Belief."" Toying with his own range and the overlapping vocal parts, Elvis' willingness to experiment rocked the foundations of all the early ""punks"" of the period. (Think of how closely Joe Jackson's ""Night And Day"" and The Police's ""Synchronicity"" followed.) The experiments were also inherent to the arrangements. The high pitched strings that slip out of the album's fade to ""Town Cryer"" were four cellos overdubbed to sound like an entire string section, as I recall.Working from the pretext that they could experiment like the Beatles did, each song was tinkered and toyed with till (as you can hear in the comparisons to the bonus disc's demo versions) they barely resembled their original ideas. It made the original album's side one a song suite of near ""Sgt. Pepper"" proportions, with the standout of ""Man Out Of Time"" marking the perfect bridge between the Elvis of old and the Elvis of new. His anguished howl that breaks the song open and then ushers it into the heartbreak of ""Almost Blue"" reset the boundaries of compositions in 1982.Comparisons to Gershwin and Porter were also being tossed around when ""Imperial Bedroom"" first came out, one suspects they had more to do with overzealous critics trying to make associations with ""serious music"" than to the obvious merits of Elvis' songwriting prowess. The debt to Tin Pan Alley (""The Long Honeymoon"") is truly there. But the lyrical jabs and jibes are still pure Costello, and a line like ""In a private detective overcoat and dirty deadman's shoes"" would be perfect for that kind of stage production cross. I'd be hard pressed to imagine Cole Porter working up the anger behind ""Shabby Doll.""In short, the dark and introspective ""Imperial Bedroom"" was a turning point for Elvis, final proof that he was at the crest of the still expanding wave of British writers that had begun emerging in the early 80's. It was likely the best album of 1982 as well."
1,"This is the real deeper than rap! To me one of the most important rap albums ever. Every song on here goes hard. At the time it came out it was very emotional and heart touching to all of his fans. My whole city was bumpin it every where you went, no bootlegs all real cds out the store, that may never happen again!R.I.P. Tupac one Luv!"
1,"This album was poorly received when released, probably owing to the difference in style from its mega-hit predecessor TOTO IV, and the presence of Fergie Fredrickson, a new vocalist that had replaced Bobby Kimball. In hindsight, though, the drubbing ISOLATION received was undeserved...this is a satisfying colleciton for what it is:  80s power-pop tunes.Whereas TOTO IV and the band's earlier work had a bluesy, R&amp;B edge to go along with the slick LA pop sound, ISOLATION plunged headlong into the 80s wave, powered by Fredrickson's vocals...a major departure from Kimball's, but very impressive in their own right.The best cut on the album is &quot;Stranger In Town&quot;, erroneously described in another review as being about Jack the Ripper (it's actually based on the plot of the old movie &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot;, which has also been adopted into an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical).  That cut alone is worth owning the CD, but &quot;Carmen&quot;, &quot;Endless&quot; and the title track are also solid efforts.Like many 80s albums of the period, ISOLATION is hard-driving, pulsating pop music.  Recognize and enjoy it for what it is, and you won't be sorry."
1,Indeed a very delightful record of the egnimatic eighties.  The beats are quite captivating and the lyrics quite thought provoking.  Just what is a vegemite sandwich anyway?  Its a shame this band disappeared almost as quickly as it emerged on the scene.  This music is clever without being sappy. The saxaphone playing is quite nice as well.  Worth a spin.
1,"Another fantastic Billy Joel album-- with Joel continuing his rocking of the world in 1978.He added a jazzy feel to his classic rock in this one which features such classics as the lively  ""Big Shot"", the  heartfelt ""Honesty"", and the assertive teenage statement of youth ""My Life"".Another fantastic addition to your Joel collection to treasure."
1,"I have to admit, that there are quite a number of songs on this album which did scare me to a small extent - i.e ""Blasphemy"". In spite of this, this album is quite good, yet can get on my nerves after a while. ""Bomb First"" is excellent, as is ""Against All Odds"".J - Vidi's Top Songs:* Bomb First* Against All Odds* Hail Mary"
1,"This album is 31 minutes and 33 seconds long and was released on May, 1984. The album reached #80 on the US Billboard Album Chart. Though none of the songs charted in the US, a couple reached 100 chart in the UK. You can tell that they are still trying to find themselves as musicians. When you listed to Different Light, the have found their pop rock sound. I liked it and would make a great addition to your eighties music collection."
1,"With America in their back pockets, and thus, buying some time; Priest decide to go with a very British/European, dark horse album. Amazing they could even follow up ""Screaming"" but, oh yes, their mutations are now accelerating at an even faster clip; just check the last bars of the second, the pre-chorus and bridge of the third, and that spellbinding apocalyptic fourth cut. Their mental synapses now taking on a life of their own; this is what happens when you take a band with as much raw talent and work ethic as Priest and let them develop over a decade, and aren't we, the audience, so much the better for it? On a conscious level the band is already thinking with that minimalist aesthetic of a danceable metal; ""Love Bites"" is a daring little move, a bit of ZZ Top in there, that they would explore further on the follow up. I love the nod to hardcore punk in ""Freewheel Burning's"" DRI/Suicidal Tendencies style word cadence; shows Priest still had their ear to the street. Lyrically Rob has finally hit the big time so this is what rock stars should sing about I guess. Great songs about sex; ""Jawbreaker,"" (that's a good thing), ""Eat Me Alive"" (she was 23, I was 16, my mom was at work, I was going down, yes to this song), as well as self-affirmation, and aural films.  This is musical knowledge from light years in the future, metal taken as far as you can take it, after this all bands could do would be to play faster and more note dense (sacrificing the musicality), or incorporate a different genre into their sound; just regurgitate, regurgitate. The slight negation in my rating is due to the disjointedness between the songs on side two. Bonus track: Hear that? I told ya."
1,"this is one of the best wu tang solo efforts.  the beats are razor sharp, and the lyrics wonderfully compliments the beats.  the flow IS like a liquid sword if you think about it.  this is best heard with the volume all the way up!!!!"
1,"This is a great album to put on in the car, top down and hair flying. While a lot of people will argue as to the song selections, that they may not be &quot;the best he could do&quot;, this is after all a greatest hits album, and that is what we get, for the most part anyway. All except one was a chart hit. The final song &quot;Without Expression&quot; was newly recorded for this album, although it was written in 1968. The rest are songs that hit the charts during the years 1978 - 1988, so I assume that there will be another greatest hits album on the way, covering his later hits. I hope so anyway. The 12 page booklet contains an interesting Mellencamp bio, written by Timothy White."
1,....and that's exactly what a great magician like Stevie Wonder will do.... I didn't think this album held gas compared to his 70s stuff..... but man..... he kind of put me in this trance..... he's just got something that I can't describe... it's like each of his songs build up and climax near the end... he just starts going nuts with his voice and instruments... it's good stuff!!!!
0,This should have had Livin' in America!!! That song would make it complete!!!!!!
1,"This could arguably be the best Wu-Tang solo album.  Once again, the RZA lays down his amazing beats for his fellow Clan-mate to glide over.  The GZA, who is probably the Clan's most gifted MC, drops jewels throughout this album (peep &quot;Labels&quot;).  This is my second favorite Wu-Tang album behind &quot;Only built 4 Cuban Linx&quot;.  Also, his second Wu album was O.K., but the &quot;Legend of The Liquid Sword&quot; is hot too.  As far as this CD goes, certified classic."
1,"This is not another lousy Celtic New Age album - it is a genuine piece of music, well written and performed with emotion. It never fails to send shivers up and down my spine for some reason... Ever since I heard Orinoco Flow Enya has cast her spell on me. She is just so different and strange and so utterly artistic. On this album every song is as perfect as it can get on a pop record, with melodies that have a tendency to lodge themselves into my brain. I have every Enya album to date, but this one seems to be particularly special. A must for any music lover!"
1,"I am usually a metalhead. I used to think the only rappers that had something intersting to say were the old school rappers like &quot;Public Enemy&quot;, &quot;2 Live Crew&quot;, &quot;Notorious B.I.G&quot;, (eaily) &quot;Nas&quot; ect. It is just that I think the same about 2-pac as alot of people do. He really has created the best of the genre. All the CDs are gangsta rap landmarks, and his is lyrics are very profound. This is the first disk I have bought by 2 pac, but it will not be my last."
1,"Yo! Bum Rush the Show-Formerly a loose congregate of college-radio DJs and party promoters in the Long Island area, `Spectrum City' became Public Enemy when Def Jam exec Rick Rubin allegedly badgered Chuck D into accepting a record deal; Chuck insisted that Flav come along, and hip-hop history was begun.  Along with producers Bill Stephney and Hank Shocklee, Chuck and company considered themselves hip-hop's answer to the Clash:  The first album as almost a punk effort, more about rhythm & noise rather than rhythm & blues.  The LP opens with ""You're Gonna Get Yours"", Chuck and Flav's ode to the Oldsmobile 98:  ""Smoke is coming, when I burn/ rubber when my wheels turn; tinted windows so super-bad; looking like the car the Green Hornet had.""  The riskiest cut may have been ""Sophisticated Bi*ch"":  hardcore metal guitar (courtesy of Vernon Reid) and hip-hop bassline make for a powerful punch. The lyrics rail against a loose woman, though later statements by Chuck assert that this was an allegorical rant against the policies of urban radio stations at the time.  Other standout joints include ""Public Enemy #1"" (covered years later by Puff Daddy), ""Miuzi Weighs a Ton"", ""Timebomb"" (""They go `ooh!' and `ah!' when I jump in my car, people treat me like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar..""), and the anti-crack-cocaine diatribe ""Megablast"". This is the true beginning of the PE dynasty, even before ""Nation of Millions"". Not to be missed."
1,"look here, when you have a band who is responsible for the lot of hip hop history and it is lead by a man who is the most sampled artist in hip hop period, then you have something ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL!!!!!  if you do not have this, then by all means, get this!!!!  the selections speak for themselves now!!!!  a groovefest as usual with that period of james brown and friends."
1,"Judas Priest defends the faith of heavy metal.  Another of Priests greatest albums.  The hits include Jawbreaker, Defenders of the faith, the Sentinal, wah hell all the songs are excellent.  This is Judas Priest style heavy metal at it's best."
1,Makaveli's (2Pac's) 7 Day Theory is one of 2Pac's greatest albumz. Including hits like Hail Mary or To Live And Die In L.A. this is a must have klazzic.
1,"A lot of you think this is there first national record to rise to stardom but in actualality N2DEEP Back to the hotel put E-40 and B-legit to the gold record artist status that they were bound to achieve.this record  didn't achieve that status but more than should've.if your someone who is a  pure click fan the song V-town on back to the hotel is one to get.When this  record was first released independently samples weren't cleared and when  jive picked it up they chose not to clear them and took them of the record.  bad decision.they have sold around 400,000 copies of this yet this a bay  classic. It still will most likely go gold but it would make it there  faster if they would bring back the original album.These 4 artists have  tried to hold down the westcoast while the rest of the west has been and  stayed on vacation.If you don't have this record get it but if possible hit  a store that has the original copy not the edited version."
1,"I first heard of Living Colour when I was in high school and Cult of Personality was getting lots of play on MTV. At the time, most Black musicians were into R&B; or rap. A Black rock group was a novelty. I didn't know what to make of this group of rockers back then, but now I can appreciate the genius of their sound. Living Colour is equal parts rock and funk with a bit of rap added in for good measure-- Chuck D. and Flava Flav guest on ""Funny Vibe."" Their lyrics are full of social commentary and critical thought that is lacking from today's popular music.Living Colour touched on racism, gentrification, economic exploitation and a whole host of other social issues without being preachy. ""Which Way to America?"" still rings true today as there are still many folks who lives are not anywhere close to the American dream. ""Funny Vibe"" is basically about racial profiling -- a bane on the existence of law abiding Black folks. ""Cult of Personality,"" their most widely played single, is about how the masses are willingly played by their leaders who get by on charisma.For all their social consciousness, Corey Glover and the guys still know how to rock. I love the bass lines and the guitar riffs, and I swear this music forces me to workout harder each time I pump it at the gym. I just wished that I had given this group a chance when they first debuted."
1,"...of a boring Monday night.I bought this album on cassette when it came out in 1987.  I'm listening to the CD as I write this review.  It is one of Cher's over-the-top albums, and I say that lovingly.  It's fun, full of catchy tunes, with an overblown production with credits that read like a who's who in studio musicians.  It is perfect listening when you are stuck in a traffic jam, or when you need music to propel you to clean your house.  The high energy songs will help turn washing your windows or dishes into a tightly choreographed routine.  Some reviewers refer to it as a comeback album, but for some of us, Cher never went away.  There might have been a few years absence from the music charts, but does it really matter?"
1,"The remastered version of Michael Jackson's &quot;Thriller&quot; album is amazing.  This album is pure perfection, and they way you hear it was the was it was meant to be listened to.  The sound quality is superb.  I promise you that you will become as obsessed with this album today as you were when it came out almost 20 years ago.  Listen to such hits as &quot;Wanna Be Startin Somethin&quot; &quot;Thriller&quot; &quot;Billie Jean&quot; &quot;Beat It&quot; and &quot;Human Nature&quot; among others.  You will also be treated to a brand new interview with Quincy Jones about making the best selling album EVER!  The biggest highlight is hearing Michael's ORIGINAL demo recoring of &quot;Billie Jean!&quot;  You will not recognize it.  This album is incredible.  ORDER IT NOW!"
1,"THE THING ABOUT THE MOODY BLUES IS THAT THEIR MUSIC WAS JUST SO DAMN MELODIC, IF NOTHING ELSE.  THAT'S WHY THEY WERE ALWAYS ENJOYABLE TO LISTEN TO.  THIS ALBUM WAS THE LAST OF THEIR ORIGINAL SEVEN ALBUMS, RECORDED BETWEEN 1967-72, WHICH CONSTITUTE THE BEST AND MOST ORIGNAL PHASE OF THEIR RECORDINGS. I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT, AND HAVE LISTENED TO IT A LOT OVER THE YEARS.  THEY WERE DIFFERENT FROM MOST OF THE OTHER BRITISH ROCK BANDS THAT WERE AROUND AT THE TIME, NOT BETTER, BUT DIFFERENT."
1,"I've recently been wanting to discover different types of music & artists from legendary female singers and Joni Mitchell was mentioned to me.  I must admit, I knew who she was but never had the pleasure to experience her music until I picked ""Night Ride Home"" as my first Joni Mitchell album.  Listening to this haunting album, I discovered her lyrics are extremely deep and complex, which is something a true artist/poet can only possess.  Overall this is true art from a true poet, absolutely wonderful!.  Up next for me ""Blue"" and ""Hejira."""
1,You could already tell that this dude was gonna be BIG.  No one I don't think could havepredicted that he would become the supersonic megastar that he did become.But from this project you surely could tell that he belonged out front.Very enjoyable look back at the starting point from a solo point of view for a manwho would become a music legend!
1,"There is no doubt about it in my mind! The voice, the guitar, and the emotion behind the lyrics express some of the most hypnotic music ever to be played. Son House was heavier and Charlie Patton was faster but they can't match this. Nor can Muddy Waters or B.B King sold more and reached more ears. Johnson is the best of the blues.I won't dwell on the legend or be like the purists and whine about his overblown image, I just want to describe the music. And when one thinks about the music, I think about the voice. The howls of pain and woe in his voice just smack of the plantation fields of the Delta, and translates a sort of desparation that voices have been trying to match (blues or otherwise) for decades. It's the sort of soul that you look for in the likes of Aretha Franklin and Marvin Gaye, not a traveling bluesman of the '30s. And then guitarists can learn from one of the all time greats. Bear in mind he was a fingerpicker and if you break his music down, he is playing rhythm lines, lead lines, and bass lines all at the same time. It was this sort of technical mastery that would awe many a guitarist for years to come, most notably Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, and Jimmy Page. And I haven't even mentioned the riffs that have underlied so many a blues and rock song over the years, most notably spawning rip offs from Elmore James and Muddy Waters, followed later by Buddy Guy, Jimi Hendrix, and Stevie Ray Vaughan. He even paved the way for jazz and swing, with favorites such as Terraplane Blues and They're Red Hot becoming hits in the Chicago swing scene.So as you can see Robert Johnson's music would touch not just the juke joints and bars of the Delta, but (unlike similar performances by others before and after) would transcend into almost all forums of modern music. Purists can say all they want about how Johnson took lyrics and licks from other artists (which was the tradition of the day, anyway) but it was his performances that hit people the most, so it is he that deserves the most credit. There is no doubt that this is some of the greatest blues ever to be caught on record, and everyone should add it alongside the stores of Rolling Stones, Cream, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Muddy Waters, and Hendrix albums, because he deserves it."
1,"A superficial view of rock history would suggest that Grunge changed the face of the genre, a second coming of Punk that rang the death-knell for both libidinous poodle-rockin' soft metal and the third rate post Nu Wave art school pretension that did the commercial rounds in the early 90's.  A more considered analysis points to Slint's &quot;Spiderland&quot; as The Album That Started All The Trouble, imposing the more spacious and pared-down appeal of ambient techno and the less frenetic agenda of classical minimalism on the mechanics and instrumentation of rock.  This is where rock first learned to chill from a cerebral perspective, and to appreciate the virtues of introspection without the self-obsession and existential baggage that characterised earlier attempts.  Subsequent offerings of a similar ilk have been termed &quot;math rock&quot;, largely due to the increased harmonic and rhythmic complexity to which &quot;Spiderland&quot; gave birth.  It's largely a dark and claustrophobic album, alternating episodes of crunching and oppressive intensity with stark and rarefied breaks that allow the music to breathe.  It's also an undeniable landmark in Rock History, now would someone please release a properly mastered version?"
1,"A must have for all music lovers.  This is one of the best CDs ever made, and one of the best if not the best live concert ever."
1,"This album is not worth five stars. Those who've made it so should have another listen to 'Solar Prestige' and reassess. Even Elton and Bernie have indicated this song was made-up trash.Elsewhere, Elton displays his deep affection for the music of The United States, including some of the less celebrated genres. The LP suffers only because it seems casual and offhand, coming as it did towards the end of Elton's dream run, and some of the greatest albums of the Seventies.The real jewel in the crown here is 'Ticking'. It's compelling from start to finish, and it's as raw as Elton ever got. It's an incredible performance, and leaves the listener with an altogether different vibe than if the album finished with 'Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me', which would've been the predictable choice.It's still an essential album-- but then I'd say ALL of his Seventies albums are, although 'Victim Of Love' ends the decade on a low."
1,"Toto fs works require repeated listens until you finally reach AOR heaven they provide. Isolation released in 1984 is no exception.gStranger In Town h Euro-pop tinged pop rocker was my first encounter with TOTO. It was the first cut from the album and ended up around Top 30. Since then even after I got TOTO IV and Fahrenheit, Isolation was the album to skip because the album didn ft produce huge hits and its first single didn ft so much appealing.It took me 17 years before I finally appreciate their impeccable melodic rock world.The album features the new singer Fergie Fredericksen who has recently been doing great works such as  gEquilibrium h with 80 fs top hit-makers. You can also hear his great voice in Radioactive fs  gCeremony of Innocence h and forthcoming Jim Peterik project MECCA. With Fergie fs strong vocal this TOTO really rocks. Particularly  gLion h  gAngel Don't Cry h ( gI Can't Lie h chorus is impressive) are outstanding.  gCarmen h is another excellent example of great power ballad. These hard-edged nice rock tracks easily overshadow their hit singles from the album  gStranger.. h and  gHolyanna h.   gHow Does It Feel h is classic TOTO styled nice ballad.  They are super musicians and know how to  ghold the line h. They bring melodic rock grace and pure delight.Highly recommended for Journey and Survivor fans who love the style of rock represented by  gWhen Seconds Count h(Survivor),  gRaised On Radio h(Journey) or  g17 h(Chicago). And recent melodic rock appreciators who love Tommy Denandar fs project Radioactive, which has the similar rock style, and Fergie Fredericksen fs  gEquilibrium h. I just can ft wait their brand new album coming really soon."
1,"When I bring up Jayo to a lot of my friends, they asked me ""Damn, what happened to him?"" With the rapper from San Diego, signing a deal with Def Jam, he was able to release his debut album ""Take A Ride"". We all know how Def Jam treats west coast artists, so I'm pretty sure that there wasn't much behind this album. To me, I find Jayo to be a rapper who talks about what he has been through. Most of his songs are about how he has gotten into jail and ran the streets of San Diego, all backed by some great west coast production that was popular around the time the west coast hit it's peak in 1994/'95.Most of these tracks Jayo rarely switches up his subject matter, so expect a lot of gangsta topics on the majority of the tracks. ""The Loc Is On His Own"" & ""I'ma Keep Bangin'"" are all dedicated to his lifestyle that he lives. The production on the latter song will keep you interested. ""Sherm Stick"" is the tune to the old R&B; song ""Come And Go With Me"", as Jayo rhymes about getting smoked out. ""Brothas & Sistas"" (or track #7) was one of the singles for this album and rides a heavy basslines and synths thats cool. ""Can't Keep A Gee Down"" is another banging song to ride to. Further on the album, the short song ""Don't Call Me A *****"" is dope. ""They Got Me On Medication"" is a standout in my opinion. ""Funk 2 Da Head"" is my favorite track, as Jayo flows perfectly with the dope beat. ""Take A Ride"" sounds decent, but not a standout. A couple of filler tracks in the middle of the album, like ""***** I'm Through"", but that doesn't make the album bad.Overall, excellent album from Jayo. His rhyme style is great in my opinion. This album has that southern Cali vibe that many people who are fans of gangsta rap would appriciate. The next albumWhatcha Gonna Do?would follow up three years later (which is a little more commercial, but great), and is worth picking up as well. Peace.Lyrics: B+Production: B+Guest Appearances: N/AMusical Vibes: A+Top 5 Tracks:1. Funk 2 Da Head2. Medication3. Can't Keep A Gee Down4. I'ma Keep Bangin'5. Brothas & Sistas"
1,"South Central Cartel has a dope underground thing goin' on despite signed to Def Jam for this 1994 joint.  Havoc, Prodeje, Havikk, L.V. DJ Gripp and DJ Kaos represent for that So Cali to the fullest.  Beatwise, some of the beats may leave a little more to be desired; some may need to grow on you for a while.  Then again, there are many that slap while in the deck!  Prodeje is nathan to mess wit on the boards and Gripp and Kaos come correct too.  Havoc, Prod, and Havi-double-k tear the mic up with those loc'd azz gangster tales.  One classic is ""Servin' Em Heat"" with a loud, bouncy Zapp sample.  Dope rappers Big Mike and 3-2 from Rap-A-Lot and southern fame come kick in some g'd up game in the G-Funk-da-fied melody ""Gang Stories.""  ""Gangsta Team"" is a long but dope track with what else, a team of the best from the west, 2Pac, Spice 1, Ice-T, and MC Eiht trade in verses with SCC makin' a hella tight Bay 2 LA connection over a fast and hard beat.  SCC represents the set in ""It's A SCC Thang"" over one of the best G-Funk beats I've ever heard, perfect to swerve thru the streets with the melodic beats and relentless flows.  Gangsta Rap may not have been nathan new by '94, but SCC definitely delivers with their especially heated lyrics.  Cali heads should not sleep on this one!  G-Funk classics like this should not be slept on, but are.  If you like this one, check out Spice 1-AmeriKKKa's Nightmare, Havoc and Prodeje-Kickin Game, Pooh Man- Ain't No Love, Big Mike- Somethin' Serious all from 1994, and G-Funk classics in the gangster vein.  Also, peep SCC's 1997 classic All Day Every Day."
1,even though this Album was my least Favorite in the Michael Jackson&amp;Quincy Jones Era Together this Project Here makes it better.&quot;Fly Away&quot; is a Tight Cut.once again i had much of the Material just now being Released but I still dig it combined with the Interviews.for anybody that digs MJ you gonna dig this.
1,"I think Hangar Eighteen summed things up best.  As for the negative review I can understand that one too.  I was somewhat unimpressed on first listen and the anti-drug sentiment and lack of rebelliosness did put me off a bit, but after living with this album for a while I can say nothing generates as much fun and pleasure as this one.  I even love the preachy ""Stay Clean"".  It could be my favorite album of all time if the lyrics were a bit raunchier, but even with that shortcoming it always gets played when I need an adrenaline rush and it has a lot of tough competition as I have 1000's of CD's(just mentioned so the reader knows it ain't easy to get played).  Right now it is in my top 10 list of favorite CD's as well.  A punk classic."
1,"I have had this Set for so long.I think this set Captures the Group at it's Artistic peak,however you can see the shift with Michael Coming fully into His own&that alone is what kinda seperates the vibe going on here.but overall this is a Real Good Set.I would have given this set a 5 if it were a two disc set and if it included more songs from ""Destiny"",""Triumph""&songs like ""Let me Show you the Way to Go""&Michael's ""You Can't Win"" from the Wiz.I think playing it too safe hurts the Set a bit.we all know the Hits are coming but if they made this a Double Set&thrown in more newer Material then this would have been a ELite Live Set.still it's really Good to me nevertheless.and after seeing the Michael 30 Year Tribute Show last Year it's time for a updated Live set with MJ&Family."
0,"So it's late 1975. Elton's previous 6 albums have soared to number one: the last one, ""Captain Fantastic"" actually entering the charts at number one, a feat then previously unheard of. Elton is playing on the Muppet Show, getting his star on Hollywood Blvd., and filling out Dodger Stadium in L.A. for two nights straight. ""Philadelphia Freedom"" goes to #1 and his portrayal of the Pinball Wizard in the Who's ""Tommy"" dominates the movie. Elton is the biggest rock star on the planet and can seemingly do no wrong. Predictably, when ""Rock of the Westies"" is released, it, like its predecessor, enters the chart at number one...But Elton's life is in turmoil. He is depressed and drinking. He dives into a swimming pool after taking an OD of sleeping pills in a failed suicide attempt...with his mother present! The sycophants around him convince him of his infallibility. This album, from its unintelligible jokes in the liner notes, to its goofy feel overall, are the testament of an burnt-out artist in pain.Unlike previous albums, where Elton and Bernie would allow themselves one ""silly"" song...almost all the songs on this album are clownish. With Dee Murray and Nigel Olson gone, Elton's new band injects his music with a harder rock sound, but the inherent silliness in the lyrics spills over badly. The ""Medley"" in the beginning complains of an ugly big woman down in New Orleans. Similarly, the protagonist of the #1 hit ""Island Girl"" is black, island woman standing 6'3"" who could drive her nails into you like a rake...""Dan Dare"", finds Elton returning to the theme of space travel, only this time, rather than the thoughtful ""Rocketman"", we get frenetic piano playing and Elton's barking noises.The drivel just does not stop. An otherwise superb production effort by Gus Dudgeon is ruined by Elton/Bernie's buffoonery as they relate songs about a bar fight in a Mexican cantina, a fight between an overworked married couple and the simply incoherent ""Billy Bones"" which takes us from the decks of a stormweathered ship to the flash and pazazz of some rock star's entrance on stage...""Street Kids"" is the only discernible song with any punch here. ""I Feel Like a Bullet"" is the hit Elton tried to push on fans following ""Island Girl"" though it never took off, and its obvious why. While Davey Johnstone's guitar work is beautiful, and Elton's falsetto impressive, the song is just too sappy.The remastered version has a beautiful song called ""Sugar on the Floor"". Elton is alone at his piano: all of the silliness gone. His singing is sorrowful and pleading. It is the most honest track on the album."
1,"From interviews and press reports, one would believe that Jon Anderson was pretty much fed up with &quot;mainstream pop&quot; in the late 80's when _Big Generator_ came out.  However, recorded and released around that time, _In The City Of Angels_ is a pretty mainstream pop album.  Certain songs such as &quot;Sundancing&quot;, &quot;Top of the World&quot;, and &quot;Hurry Home&quot; are a little experimental and similar to what would come on _Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe_, but songs such as &quot;Is It Me&quot;, &quot;In A Lifetime&quot;, and &quot;If It Wasn't For Love&quot; are in the same mold of MOR late 80's love songs.  However, with Anderson singing, these songs become bearable.  The highlights on this album include a very tender &quot;For You&quot; (with Anderson playing the harp), a very energetic &quot;New Civilization&quot;, and the uplifting &quot;It's On Fire&quot;, &quot;Hurry Home&quot;, and &quot;Top of the World&quot;.  Many of the musicians and songwriters on this album were members of Toto so there is an 80's Rock sheen on most of the songs.  However, if you're a fan of Anderson even at his most &quot;twee&quot;, this is an enjoyable album.  If you're searching for something on the same level as _Olias of Sunhillow_, look elsewhere."
1,You can't really knock this Cd. So what-?-? On this tape the Beasties are  at their most immature-- rappin' about lots of stuff... but mainly girls  and getting loaded..... &quot;You've got to fight for your right to  party...&quot; and all of that....So it's before MCA and the boys found  Milarepa and Tibet and stopped killing stuff.... so its before they found  jazz and the Dust Brothers.... so its before Paul's Boutique-- which might  be the best CD ever put together....this album is tight and a lot of fun  to listen to... and if you're like thirteen or growing up in a swamp in  Indiana and never heard this-- buy it! (My own personal swamp was a hill in  WVa....)
1,"The Players within a span of 3 years transformed themselves from a rock-funk outfit to a smoldering semi-jazz influcenced funk outfit. Either way the music was just as powerful. Where as &quot;Fire&quot; just burned with pure white hot rock-funk, this one smolders with sweaty down deep funk that sticks in your head. Even thier singles were smoother at this point (The funky &quot;Who'd She Coo?&quot;). Hot Ballds like &quot;Precious Love, Little Lady Maria, and Tell the Truth&quot; still sound fresh today and Give it up to the Players for keeping it fresh regardless of record sales."
0,You really have the impression somehow that she can't sing. Also the songs don't seem spectacular. It's weak dancey stuff - like DJ Bobo and all those acts. This is really a no-go for me
1,"Pop chart statistics may mislead you otherwise but,in terms of The Jacksons' early years at Epic this has to be their more consistant and enjoyable album.Wheras some of the production onThe Jacksonsis somewhat by-the-numbers Philly soul and is also recorded rather flat this album is mixed up a lot hotter and,while still deeply ingrained in the Philly sound the grooves,rhythms and sense of funk are much strong emphasized.So this second Epic album is a lot more punchy,aggresive and uptempo than the debut.I didn't realize until recently that ""Music's Takin' Over"" was really huge in New York during this time that is,according to an interview with Chuck D of Public Enemy my friend in Oakland heard.And I can see how it would be a huge funk monster because the guitar and bass riffs are MEAN and Mikes voice has a lot of strengh on the song.The title song is the only tune here that doesn't really represent anything entirely new for the group and kind of sounds just a little behind the times.""Diff'rent Kind Of Lady"" is one of two (again) self written songs and is another incredible groove that has this great sense of tension in the rhythm and a tad of vocorder in the end.""Even Though Your Gone"" and ""Find Me A Girl"" are more glossy Philly ballads than the kind heard on the debut and actually serve as good selling points for this album.There are a couple more great uptempo tunes in the heavily,percussive bounce of ""Jump For Joy""-one of the most genuinely ""positive thinking"" type songs I've heard and the happily funky orientation of the music really delivers on the promise.There are some excellent celebratory synthesizer squiggles at the conclusion of the song that help to bring it even more to life.""Do What You Wanna"",another self written tune has a really crisp Philly jump to it and..is yet another positive attitude kind of song.Michael singing ""Don't be phony just be for real"" may seem slightly awkward now but at least then I could sense he believed it even for himself. The pointed anti war ballad ""Man Of War"" points to the Jacksons' future utopian vision of unity over conflict. This more than any other Jacksons album from the mid/late 70's really pointed the most to an individual musical and conceptual direction for the brothers.And even though this is still a very much ignored part of their recorded legacy that should at least be taken into consideration."

1,"Who was Nick Drake? What motivated him? Why can you never tell, from his singing, what mood he was in? Those tunings: where did he get them from? What did his friends think of him? These questions need answering. This music is as emotionality devastating and powerful as Joy Division.Why? On the surface, we have beautiful melodic structures rendered on acoustic guitar, with unorthodox progressions. On top is the velvety voice, rather middle class, which never even attempts to `project' or `emote'. The key seems to be that Nick Drake realised something important: that surface structure and deep structure are orthogonal. You can express the deepest despair in the prettiest of ways. Joy Division and Nick Drake: totally different surface structures; same deep structure.It's not always true. `Which Will' has a gorgeous detuning which makes the guitar sound like a harp. Small triplets sound in the treble; the bass strings take you down with them. The shape of the music, its progression, has some of the finality of Joy Division's `New Dawn Fades'. But then again, it's cheerful. Like Mozart. Cheerful and sad at the same time. During `Pink Moon', Nick sings `Saw it written and I saw it say'; only you'd swear it was a strangely-accented `Saw it written and suicide'.This music is undateable. You would not be surprised to hear `1965' or `2005' or anything in-between. Like `Bryter Layter', this music is extremely sophisticated, formally advanced, durable, and totally enigmatic. It would sound at home in a wine bar. Why does it make you want to cry? Where is the emotion, exactly, being expressed? This music is an object lesson to the emoters, of which there have been far too many in rock. It is extraordinarily subtle, and makes nonsense of aesthetic theories that try to relate form to content, and which rock stars implicitly recognise. No flangers, no chorus effects, no big drums, no grunge screaming for titles like `Parasite' and `Harvest Breed'.Nick Drake taps and expresses fundamental emotions which rock music doesn't often go near with any real success. Things like, beauty of days; loveliness of weather and girlfriends; how do you survive lost love; what do you do when you hate yourself; what happens when the world does not accept you. He was some kind of genius at rendering these things. I am still trying to work out exactly what sort. RIP Nick."
1,"love this underrated, and slept on, the ballad even though you're gone is still my favorite, find me a girl love it this was michael at his best, man of war love the lyrics, do what you're wanna was the fab 5 at their funkiset.goin places love the lyrical format of these songs."
1,"The first album of this girl duo with the R.Kelly hits &quot;Stroke you up&quot; andothers. It's a solid, typical R.Kelly, production with fine voices. Verybeautiful ballad: &quot;All is not gone"
1,"as we did back in the day.I bought this when it was first released on vinyl and it has taken me all these years to get it on cd, shame on me. I had forgotten how I used to love her laid back style. Every song is so great that even after all these years I find I remember most of the lyrics.I remember it was so good to listen to this album along with James Taylor, Carly Simon and the like after rockin' the night away. This music is timeless and will be enjoyed by every generation."
1,"Its a shame this great band only made 2 great albums. When Heatwave's songwriter/keyboardist Rod Temperton left the group after this album, Heatwave went downhill. Almost every song on this album is jammin'. Star Of A Story is Heatwave's greatest song. I was told by a former Heatwave member that Rod quit the band because lead singer Johnnie Wilder stole one of his songs. Thats the music business for ya."
1,"This is where Elton's legendary string of hits began. ""Honky Chateau"" would become the first of 7 straight #1 albums to hit the charts between 1972-1975: a truly dizzying output of music given its overall popularity and quality. And to think, Elton was prepared to hang up his recording career if this album failed...Davey Johnstone formally joined Dee and Nigel in Elton's band. Jean-Luc Ponty added his string arrangements and Gus Dudgeon acted as producer. They recorded this album in a castle in France named the Chateau d'Herouville. Curiously, the music that emanated from those session had nothing to do with the lofty orchestral arrangements of previous efforts like ""Madman"" or ""Elton John"". This album was a pure rocker, many of the tracks invested with a Southern rock feel, only more streamlined and radio-friendly.Elton's piano work on ""Honky Cat"" is masterful. ""I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself"" is both comical and melodramatic as Elton's shifts between the sorrowful lament of the chorus to ragtime and tap-dancing. ""Salvation"" comes as close to an anthem as anything Elton's ever written. Then there are tremendous rock songs on here, like ""Susie"" and the powerful ""Hercules"". The bonus track of ""Slave"" invests the original laid-back country recording with pure fire on the piano.But what most people will no doubt remember most on this album is the classic hit ""Rocketman"" and the lesser-known and absolutely beautiful ""Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters"". This album was the emergence of Elton as the greatest singer/songwriter of his day."
1,"If The Lady of Rage was promoted right this album might have did a little better than it did. I have a lot of respect for Lady of Rage for staying true to the hiphop culture when the game was populated with rap hookers and clones of rap hookers. Standout tracks: wickedness (original and remix), sho shot, microphone pon cok, rough,rugged and raw, big bad lady, some s--- and the rest of this album. Filler:none. The only flaw of this album is that sometimes her metaphors get repetitive but that doesnt make this album less of a classic. Rage deserves props for not stooping to the mindless raunchiness that made trina and khia famous. This is definetely a hiphop classic worth picking up."
1,"I first became a fan of ELO when I heard the ""Xanadu"" soundtrack after first watching the movie and then listening to the ""Time"" album which is still my all-time favourite album of theirs.  I then discovered ""Discovery"" and these 3 albums represent their best work for me.  I also went back and got their greatest hits album to learn more about their early days and as the years passed I realised that I grew tired of much of that album save for 2 tracks which I never seem to tire of: ""Evil Woman"" and ""Strange Magic"".  For this reason I decided to get ""Face the Music"" and it is now my favourite ""early"" ELO album.  I know Jeff Lynne himself prefers ""Out of the Blue"" and ""A New World Record"" which are perhaps more complete and ""filled out"" but I think that up to ""Discovery"" this is ELO's best album.  With the exception of ""Poker"" and ""Down Home Town"" there are no weak tracks here as we get to hear many of the elements that have become Jeff Lynne trademarks over the years make an appearance here.  Jeff Lynne himself oversaw the remastering of this mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) release but truth be told the improvement in the sound quality is subtle and it is the bonus tracks that are real treats for fans.  His ""stripped down mix"" version of ""Evil Woman"" is very good and I find myself liking it more than the original!This release also includes a foldout containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese as well as a 12-page colour booklet containing an essay on the album as well as a short note from Jeff himself about the album.  This mlps release though is a bit of a mixed bag as the design and assembly is poor when compared with what is out there and with what Sony Music is capable of when compared to their other mlps releases in the past; it seems for some reason Sony decided to go cheap with the ELO mlps releases as this is the same with the ""Time"" and ""Discovery"" mlps releases as well.  Thankfully, the sound quality and the content somewhat makes up for this which explains the 3 stars.Very good content, good sound quality but poor mlps design makes this a mixed bag.  MLPS collectors will be disappointed and for the rest, you may want to check out the cheaper jewel case versions instead."

1,"Her biggest selling album, GUILTY is easily Barbra Streisand's best contemporary pop effort to date.  Barry Gibb's skilled production hand gives GUILTY an added sense of cohesiveness, something that was sorely lacking from many of Streisand's late-seventies pop efforts.  Gibb (along with Albhy Galuten and brothers Robin and Maurice) also had a hand in writing every one of the nine melodic songs and even duets on two of them.Their pairing produced a monster hit with the riveting title track (#3 Pop, #5 Adult Contemporary), however it's actually the other Streisand-Gibb smash duet ""What Kind Of Fool"" (#10 Pop, #1 Adult Contemporary) that proves to be the disc's show-stopper.  Gibb's production and voice are an inarguable key to GUILTY's success, but it is Streisand's magnificent vocals that provide the album with it's soul - that's right SOUL!  The chart-topping smash ""Woman In Love"" (#1 Pop, #1 Adult Contemporary) was the leadoff single and stands a slice of pure pop perfection, with Streisand's performance as thrilling as any ever captured on record.Amazingly enough for a pop record, the remaining six tracks more than hold up to the three big hits.  The restrained ballads ""Run Wild"" and ""The Love Inside"" are absolutely gorgeous, while the seven minute-plus ""Make It Like A Memory"" plays out like mini-pop symphony.  Barbra even ventures into dance territory with ""Life Story"" and the international hit ""Promises"" and really brings these tracks to life with a sexy exuberance.  Even the slightly dated light funk of ""Never Give Up"" is a slinky delight.  GUILTY was a massive hit upon release, hitting #1 on the Hot 200 and achieving Quintuple Platinum status in US sales and selling nearly 20 million copies worldwide.  This success is hardly surprising as GUILTY is simply everything a pop album should be."
1,"More than once I have panned re-issues of albums on CD that added nothing to the original.  My usual reason is that a CD can hold 80 minutes of music and a vinyl album typically had 38 to 48 minutes of music.  My criticism increases with a ""greatest"" or ""best of"" collection because there are almost always more songs that could or should have been added.  My criticism of content should extend to this album as well, but this album embodies Simon and Garfunkel's peak popularity and its value is as much historical and contextual as commercial.  Yes, I purchased this album in spite of the numerous collections of varying sizes, including a comprehensive collection of all of Simon and Garfunkel's works.  I am unable to explain why this album works for me, but I suspect it is because I grew up in the 60s and 70s.This collection is just a bit too brief, but what magnificent songs.""Mrs. Robinson,"" ""The Sound of Silence"" and ""Scarborough Fair/Canticle"" are musical poetry.  All three songs are part of the soundtrack to the 1967 movie ""The Graduate.""  ""The Sound of Silence"" in particularly is one of the greatest songs of the rock era.  The latter two songs are great melancholy songs for a rainy day.There are also live songs on this album.  The gorgeous song ""For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her"" is one of those songs.  Though the clapping at the end is a bit loud, the song itself is one of the best versions available.  Art Garfunkel shows in this song why his pairing with Paul Simon was so incredible.  Another live song is ""The 59th Street Bridge Song,"" which most know as ""Feelin' Groovy.""  This song is a marvelous little ditty that shows the playful side of the duo.  The clapping fits better here and lets you imagine the duo playing on a New York City street in the springtime.""The Boxer"" is a story song that is one of the best story songs of any era.  Part folk, part rock, and all art, this song combines catchy and dramatic music with catchy lyrics and a poignant story that is simultaneously haunting and enjoyable.  Another poignant song that fits well with ""The Boxer"" is ""I Am a Rock.""  Both songs seem to offer introspective views of life and remind us all that we are responsible for ourselves.""Homeward Bound"" is a live song.  This harmonious folk song is a wonderful addition to this CD.  This song would be perfect for a movie soundtrack.  This song rolls into another live song, the phenomenal ""Bridge Over Troubled Water,"" where Art Garfunkel gets to show his vocal range.  I do not know where this song was recorded, but the acoustics of the song itself are wonderful and highlight the power of the song and contrast between the soft opening and powerful ending.""America"" is another song that makes effective use of powerful vocals and music.  This song is a celebration of country and seeking oneself as well as seeking who we are as a nation.  The story in the song is deeper than the words suggest.  This song is one of Simon and Garfunkel's greats.""Kathy's Song"" is a friendly little live song.  This song is pretty, but is less dramatic and artistic than many of the other songs on this CD.  This song contained elements that foreshadowed the future of Paul Simon's music.The following song is yet another incredible song.  ""El Condor Pasa (If I Could)"" contains incredible music and vocals and is yet another of Simon and Garfunkel's greatest songs.  The haunting panpipe used in this song makes it one of the most memorable songs in the duo's portfolio.""Bookends"" is a lovely little song that provides a significant contrast with the percussion driven ending of this CD, ""Cecilia.""  ""Cecilia"" is the most enthusiastic song on this CD.  The close out of this album, from ""El Condor Pasa"" to ""Bookends"" and ending with ""Cecilia"" was a brilliant way to close out the album.  Rather than feeling melancholy, as the previous songs would have done, you leave feeling good and wanting to do it all over again.There are many other collections of the works of Simon and Garfunkel, which often includes some of their solo works.  However, at the time this album was released, this collection was the collection to have.  I still listen to this collection a lot, even with everything else that is available.  I suspect I always will.  Enjoy!"
1,"How many double albums have not one moment of filler? Maybe Blonde on Blonde, maybe Exile On Main Street, if that's your cup of tea. This is one of the most consistantly brilliant albums of all time. Anyone who is really  interested in great soulful rock music cannot be without this in their  collection. A cornerstone."
1,"1995 was The Bay Area's biggest year. Artists such as The Luniz, Mac Mall, and the Hieroglyphics were having big hits that year. Too Short just dropped a near classic album. And The Click was on point, reppin' northern Cali area. 40 Water comes out with his third solo album In A Major Way back in'95. The album has that northern west coast vibe that is guaranteed to get listeners moving. A few standouts include ""Ridin' Sidewayz"" with B-Legit, and Mac Shon. ""Spittin'"" has a dope bass line too that will hype you up. ""Sprinkle Me"" is the album's first single that features 40's younger sister Suga-T (she also sings the hook for ""Fed""). Bay Area artists Spice 1, Mac Mall, and Tupac drop in for the dope ""Dusted 'N' Disgusted"". ""Smoke 'N' Drank"" is my favorite from the album that will keep you bouncing (that pre-hyphy style song). 40's younger son comes in and drops a few bars on ""All Bad"" to help close out the album.E-40 dropped an excellent album for '95. In A Major Way is mostly consistent all though out, as it helped represented the west coast. This album vibes like most albums out there and it is highly recommended if you're a fan of their music. 4 stars- Highly recommended. Peace.Lyrics: B+Production: A-Guest Appearances: B+Musical Vibes: A-Top 5 Tracks:1. Smoke 'N' Drank2. Spittin'3. Ridin' Sidewayz (featuring B-Legit and Mac Shon)4. Sprinkle Me (featuring Suga-T)5.

1,"Sophie B Hawkins doesn't really fit into any specified musical category. She does pop, rock, ballads, keyboards, driving rhythmic drumming and precussion... it's just plain good music - with incredible lyrics and passionate vocals. Her second release, Whaler, is more mellow than her debut, Tongues and Tails, yet just as powerful. My favorite tracks include Right Beside You, As I Lay Me Down, Did We Not Choose Each Other, and Don't Tell Me No."
1,"This CD has been a favorite of mine from the first day I bought it, as it was released.  I was stunned by the profoundly beautiful lyrics and emotional honesty of these songs.  Taupin and John have produced a pop  masterpiece here - full of mature insights into the human condition, with  all its pain and joy.  A remarkable recording.  Shows Elton John at his  artistic best.  And the actual quality of the recording is second to  none.Simply a pleasure to listen to over and over again."
1,"A double album *rock musical* version of H.G. Wells' sci-fi classic, ""The War Of The Worlds""? Many people would laugh at such an idea. But in 1978, musician/songwriter/producer Jeff Wayne actually did it, and created one of rock's most supreme concept albums. Although the album has always been much more popular in Britain and other parts of Europe (even having a multi-year UK album-chart run rivaling Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side Of The Moon""), it nonetheless has a strong cult following here in North America, myself proudly included. I first became aware of the ""War Of The Worlds"" album sometime in the late 80's, when I discovered that Justin Hayward, the lead singer for The Moody Blues (one of my all-time favorite bands) was singing on it. Curious, I picked up a vinyl copy of the album at a used record store, dropped the needle on Side One, and I was instantly hooked. I'd never heard anything like it before. The way the Martian-invasion narrative is brilliantly sustained from beginning to end, and, of course, Jeff Wayne's incredible music score that matches it. And, completing the ""War Of The Worlds"" package, there's the elaborate artwork that accompanies & illustrates the album---simply marvelous to look at. No question about it, ""The War Of The Worlds"" is quite an acheivement. Nearly three decades later after it's initial release, the album still sounds just as fresh & exciting now as it did back then. Besides the legendary, commanding voice of Richard Burton as the album's narrator, Jeff Wayne's stunning music rocks (""Horsell Common & The Heat Ray""), rouses (""Brave New World""), has incredible beauty (""Forever Autumn""), and, at turns, is effectively eerie (""The Red Weed""). The musicianship that Wayne has ensembled for the album is first-rate, from great singers like Justin Hayward, David Essex, Thin Lizzy's Phil Lynott & Julie Covington, to incredible musicians like Jo Partridge, Herbie Flowers, Chris Spedding, and Jeff Wayne himself. The album has amazing moods, atmospherics & sound effects, and the surprise twist at the album's end still gives me goosebumps to this day! There's no doubt in my mind that H.G. Wells himself would've been very happy indeed with this powerful musical treatment of his story. Although Jeff Wayne's ""War Of The Worlds"" has never been staged, I was very fortunately blessed to see a Laserium presentation of the album at the London Planetarium back in July of 1990. They presented the *whole* double album, complete with lasers, slides, & pyrotechnics. There was even an intermission after Side Two! It was a truly spellbinding show, and a great tribute to the album's timeless appeal. The point of mentioning it is that Jeff Wayne's ""War Of The Worlds"" succeeds not only as a rock album, but as a storytelling album that lends itself quite well to visual presentation. I can easily see a touring ""rock concert"" presentation of ""War Of The Worlds"" someday, complete with rock band & orchestra, singers, slides, lasers & pyrotechnics. Maybe Jeff Wayne could try to hook up with someone in the theater world and mount such a production? One can dream....In the meantime, buy the CD, and discover for yourself what all the fuss is about. Jeff Wayne's ""War Of The Worlds"" is truly a rock musical masterwork. (NOTE: This is a slightly-revised version of the review I wrote for ""The War Of The Worlds"" five years ago, as the old CD version is now out-of-print. But I stand by every word of it, 'cause I love this album. Thanks.)"
1,"Solid from start to finish!  This is classic Elton, fun rockers and very nice ballads!  This also features one of Elton's strongest backing bands!"
1,"Stevie Wonder spent almost three years working on this album and the time was well spent.  The music is probably the most personal and outspoken of his career.  He sings about his childhood in songs like &quot;I Wish&quot;  &amp; &quot;Easy Goin' Evening&quot;, his heroes in &quot;Sir Duke&quot;,  the birth of his daughter in &quot;Isn't She Lovely&quot; and while  &quot;Contusion&quot; is an instrumental the title is a reference to the  life-threatening auto accident he was involved in.  Mr. Wonder has always  been a strong voice for the civil rights movement and the struggles for his  race's equality and he expresses his feelings on those matters in  &quot;Village Ghetto Land&quot;, &quot;Pastime Paradise&quot; &amp;  &quot;Joy Inside My Tears&quot;.  He also gives us a history lesson in  &quot;Black Man&quot;.  &quot;Love's In Need Of Love Today&quot; and  &quot;Have A Talk With God&quot; are pleas for togetherness and  understanding.  Mr. Wonder could always write great love songs and they are  here as well in the forms of &quot;Ebony Eyes&quot;, &quot;As&quot;,  &quot;Knocks Me Off My Feet&quot; and others.  As I've just mentioned, the  album broaches many diverse subjects, but it all comes together in the end.  Usually on double albums, there is filler, but not here.  Every song serves  a purpose and help create a cohesive musical statement.  Stevie Wonder has  been called a musical genius and this album is further proof that the title  is an appropriate one."
1,"Unlike their previous six albums, this recording is in a mostly blase funk until the rousing closer I'm Just A Singer In A Rock 'n' Roll Band. Isn't Life Strange sounds like a mediocre Bee Gees song.For prime Moodies, check out Lost Chord, Threshold and Childrens Children."
1,"I remember when the music teacher in a local Bronx High School (Cardinal Spellman) started to rave about his son's band to my friends who attended the institution.  His son had abandoned his Italian roots, grown his hair long, dressed strangly for the times and chose the stage name Tyler.  He picked up vinyl for anyone who wanted and we took this record home to listen.  I remember as a young musician and enthusiast, I was shocked by the power and range of his voice, particularly on his blood curdling rock screams, as well as the guitar work by the guitar duo of Joe Perry and Brad Whitford.  The band reminded me of a combination of the Stones and the Yardbirds.  Seeing them live at Central Park on a hot Summer night in July two years later, it was clear to see that is impression was correct, from both their material and personna on stage.  This disk was recorded poorly, but the remastered release improves on the muddy sound of the original.  Initially, the disk did not do well, and the single (""Dream On"") was later re-released after the second disk (""Get Your Wings"") made more of an impact.  The results were astounding.  ""Dream On"" shot up the charts as a classic rock anthem, and this album was released with a different color back ground, and entered the charts.  For years, folks thought this was actually their second disk because of the timing and the extended airplay the ""newly"" released ""Dream On"" received.  Although the tune is clearly a rock masterpiece, with it's strong dynamics, great guitar and screaming vocals, this is not the only gem here.  ""Make It"" is a strong rocker with a great guitar hook, and Steven Tyler shows his vocal chops where he sings along note for note with the lead at the end.  ""Write Me a Letter"" is another ballsy rocker, with harmonica by Tyler and Stones like vocal harmonies on the chorus.  ""One Way Street"" features a sparse arrangement of one guitar, vocals, and minimal drums to start, and segues into another driving tune.  ""Mama Kin"" has another memorable guitar hook and powerful vocals, making it a cover song choice for numerous bands, including Guns and Roses.  The release concludes with a no nonesence take on the Rufus Thomas classic, ""Walkin' the Dog"" done as the heavy handed rocker the boys heard their English influences play.  In all, this is good debut, that suffers from poor recording and production, but a strong indication of the band's future capabilities.  Their sound and arrangements really grow up as they received label backing and budget, especially on the Jack Douglas produced follow up, ""Get Your Wings"".  Get this."
1,"To this day EW&F; have shown themselves to be complete musical professionals.  This is a fun cd that gets a 5 star rating for the stellar brass section and just overall clever and tight musicianship.  These guys could hang with anyone back in the day and I assume they are just as hot live if you catch them today.  You'll immediately recognize a lot of these songs because they were made for FM radio.  Also, every pop cover band with a horn section has to cover at least 2 or 3 songs from EW&F.;All 'N All represents the band during one of their strongest periods.  I highly recommend getting this first and then picking up others from their collection."
1,"Maria soothes the soul with this, her second solo album. Backed by the Jayhawks and old-friends from her Lone Justice days, she rips through the songs--some originals, some cover versions--with abandon. For proof, listen to ""I'm Gonna Soothe You,"" which basically wraps you in its warmth. ""My touch is gentle, my body is warm ..."" she sings, stepping out from the speakers. She's sexy, saucy, inviting and sweet all at once; and envelops you with her passion. Further proof: Her wondrous remake of the Goffin-King classic ""I Can't Make It Alone""; and her raucous ode to her Lone Justice days, ""My Girlhood Among the Outlaws."" A true classic - and for $7, a no-brainer. Buy it."
1,"Forget the tacky outfits they wore in their music videos. Forget the dated artwork gracing the album cover. Fact is, anytime you hear ""Cult of Personality"" on the radio, in a video game or on your iPod, you are compelled to turn the volume up as loud as humanly possible. The crunchy guitar riffs, the funky bass, hard-hitting drums and the smooth vocal stylings of Corey Glover all combined to make this song, and much of Living Colour's breakthrough album, ""Vivid,"" a smash-hit as well as a glimpse into the future of hard rock and metal.As one of the bands at the forefront of the funk-metal boom, Living Colour stood out from the pack, not only because they were an all African American rock band, but because of their superb musicianship and willingness to explore many, many genres. ""Livid"" runs the gamut from arena rock (""Cult of Personality"") to power-ballads with messages (""Open Letter to a Landlord"") to funk jams (""What's Your Favorite Colour""). Much can be written about ""Cult of Personality"" itself, as it serves as an excellent intro to the album - complete with quotations from John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. - and is the one track that sticks out the most and carries the album. ""Middle Man"" comes close to catching the same energy, as well as the punk-funk-metal fusion of ""Desperate People.""The fact of the matter is there isn't one bad song in the bunch. Musically, this album is a sonic success, with Glover's vocals serving as the focal point. Vernon Reid's guitar riffs are equally as loud and in your face, while the rhythm section is both tight and funky at the same time. The only shortcoming to be found here are in some of the awkward lyrical moments, a prime example being ""Funny Vibe."" Considering how good the album sounds, though, such flaws are forgivable.""Livid"" is a snap-shot of a time when mainstream bands weren't afraid to experiment and to bend genre rules, and anyone who adores the likes of Red Hot Chili Peppers' ""Mother's Milk"" or any early Faith No More (we're talking pre-Mike Patton here) will find an album that is fun, fresh, funky and loud. An album that has soul and power, has maybe dated itself a bit, but ultimately sounds just as good twenty plus years later, ""Vivid"" - like all good music -- stands the test of time."
1,"This is it, the M.B. cd that i feel to be their best overall effort, an' i've heard The Moody Blues. GOTTA have seven stars to rate this one."
1,"This is one of the best ever Jazz albums, recorded by one of the top five tenor players in Jazz history.The other musicians are:Tommy Flanagan - PianoDoug Watkins - BassMax Roach - drumsEven if you're not a Jazz fan you'll know Sonny Rollins 'St Thomas' which opens the album, with its calypso melody its one of the best known Jazz tunes. The performances are uniformly excellent and the sound is incredible since this album was recorded 50 years ago.The track 'Moritat' is in fact 'The theme from the three penny opera', but it sounds remarkably similar to 'Mack the Knife'. Whatever the tune really is, Rollins is never less throughly inventive, as anyone who has seen him live will testify to. This track perhaps contains the highlight of the album, where Sonny Rollins trades 4's with Max Roach.This is one of the classic Jazz albums and should be in everyones collection."
1,"Whereas this recording is not Traffic's best work, it is very unique with the blending of many different flute, sitar, harp, organ, and more.  Not to forget the superb Guitar work by David Mason.  The song arrangements aren't  as developed as on the classic John Barley Corn and Low Spark Recordings  but the elements of folk, jazz, and rock make this a very listenable  record."
1,"All Eyez On Me is a classic west coast album, but should be enjoyed by more than just west coast hip hop fans.  This is the peak of 2Pac's career and just may be the best album he has ever made."
1,"Hey, I'm a rocker, too - I like me some Stones, some AC/DC, some Aerosmith, some Zeppelin, some Sab, some Guns n' Roses, some Who, some Hendrix and some Cream. But you know, you gotta mellow out sometimes, and that's why I listen to Elton. (Hell, even Axl Rose admitted to being a big fan of his).Now my man Reg Dwight's been taking a lot of abuse lately, mainly because he's gay (which has got to be the stupidest reason I can think of to criticize a musician). If you're looking to diss the guy just because of that, take it up with him. But I warn you - he's rich. He's probably got ninja bodyguards.All joking aside, EJ rules. He's capable of writing the perfect pop song, and hey, that piano! He's awesome with piano! Gotta love his voice, too. In other words, very talented man. I'm not a big fan of Bernie Taupin, but hey, Elton's great. This is not the perfect compilation of his work - I'd have liked to see some songs from Madman Across the Water (like the hits Tiny Dancer and Levon), and I don't like Bennie and the Jets. Song just bugs me. Good news is, that's the only bad song here: this has my favorite all-time EJ song (Crocodile Rock, which is the ultimate feel-good tune - come on, how can you NOT like it? It's not possible! I mean, I have heard one person criticize it, but he had the rough intelligence of a cinderblock), as well as several other great ones, mostly ballads like Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Your Song (simply the perfect pop song), Candle in the Wind, Daniel, Rocket Man, and Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me. Then there are the cool stylistic experiments like the gospelly Border Song (Holy Moses) (off his self-titled second, which I recommend - it's the one with Your Song on it), and the New Orleans-sounding Honky Cat. And who says EJ can't rock? Throw on Saturday Night's All Right (for Fighting) and see if you still think that way.A couple of Elton's studio LP's are really good too - I'd go with self-titled, Madman Across the Water and Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player. Those just starting out with him should start her.e"
1,"Billy Joel enjoyed a run of mega hit albums in the late 70's, that capped off with 1980's release Glass Houses (see my review). Songs from these albums; The Stranger, 52nd Street, and the aforementioned Glass Houses became concert staples, yet Billy always included a number of his earlier songs in concert, and as the liner notes state, these songs always enjoyed a great reception.  At this point in his career, Billy was also adament that he was not ready to release a greatest hits album.The solution?, a live disk that would showcase his songs, PRE Stranger album, and he selected songs appropriate for a live reading. As Billy also stated in this albums liner notes he did not inlcude songs that would not ""translate"" well in a live setting. This is why Piano Man is not featured here, yet Captain Jack is.The arena impact of Miami 2017, Say Goodbye To Hollywood, and The Ballad of Billy The Kid, balance the intimate environs set for Summer Highland Falls, She's Got A Way, and Your My Home.An added treat from this album was hearing 2 of the songsfrom the Cold Spring Harbor album (She's Got A Way, and Everybody Loves You Now), since at the point that this disk was released,  those of us lucky to have had a vinyl copy of Cold Spring Harbor had to ""imagine"" what these tracks sounded like for real since the pressings of Cold Spring Harbor were recorded too fast and thus Billy sounded in spots like one of the Chipmuncks.The final track is my favorite, and I Loved These Days, seemed to be foreshadowing on Billy's part, that his musical career would take new directions with is next studio album (which it did)."
1,"Nothing spectacular here, just a thoroughly enjoyable pop/new wave/synth/whatever offering from an outfit that probably deserved more attention.  Definitely worth getting."
1,"This cd is really good. As usual, R. Kelly is really talented writer and producer when it comes to music. No matter that this cd is ten years old, you can still listen to it over and over again. The best songs on here are ""you remind me of something"", ""step into my room"", ""baby, baby, baby, baby"", and ""down low"", which was a huge megahit when it came out and still is widely known for pinning the popular term to call any relationship that is the quiet, hush-hush, secretive sin of illicit sexual rompings (not that this is a good thing because it is really not, but the song sounds so good!) I do have to disagree with his message in ""the sermon"" where he throws the criticisms back in the faces of all those who condemn him for this sexual and explicit nature. All of that ""even the statue of liberty wants to bump and grind"" was uncalled for and unnecessary, and it is exactly this reason why he has gotten into so much trouble with his little scandals and sexual escapes. Though I like his music, people are right in their analysis of him because, really, he is just too sexual and wanton in nature for which he makes no apologies. What he calls ""judgment"" is really the truth. Thus, the conclusion: Despite its lax morals and looseness, its just a really nice and well-produced cd."
1,"What can I say about the Cars first album. The Cars debut album has to be one of the most impressive albums that I have ever heard. Why can't bands make albums this great anymore? Three big hit singles ""Good Times Roll"",""Just What I Needed"", and ""My Bestfriend's Girl"". As well as ""Bye, Bye Love"", ""Moving in Stereo"", and ""YOu're All I've Got Tonight"" that each get a lot of radio play as well. This is one of those rare albums that is great from start to finish, no filler here."
1,"If you have the first album then you can really see the growth of Andre and Big Bio as artist and musicians. Everything is stepped up on this album from the production, lyrics, flow, and originality!! You can tell from this album that they are no one hit wonders, but made to last true stars especially Andre 3000.P.S. Listen to 13th floor/Growing Old and E.T. then you'll get this album right off the back."
1,"the reprise of i got 5 on it is NOT the remix with spice 1, e-40, Richie Rich, Dru Down and Shock G. this album is a klassic bay area cd. i just got it, and i phuckkin luv it. the whole cd is good. i recommend u buy it if u dont have it awready"
1,"This is one of those ominous recordings that manages to somehow steal the spotlight away from some of the more in depth work of the artist due to this album's attempt at ""getting everything right"". Don't ask me to explain what that means, all I know is that there are many albums that achieve legendary status due to their pitch perfect recipe that delivers all of the prescribed ingrediants in the right order. Somehow that formula for sucess yielded many jazz classics, but overshadowed more personal, detailed work. This applies to most artists then, and as a general forwarning into gageing many composer's true strengths when it comes to buying most recommended titles. They are often ideal first purchases when discovering someone, but usually misleading as well.This album itself is perhaps 1/2 dominated by the man of the hour, giving way to yes..some brilliant corners. There are some amazing musical concepts going on brought on  undoubtedly by a total collaboration at times with some pretty free form plotting by all players. As exciting as some of the swingin tunes can be, the problem of overshadowing genius cannot be remedied when tunes like ""I surrender Dear"" are played, the depth of that writing on display towers over the majority of the disc's mood of playfullness.  Nonetheless, this is one of his more popular albums for a reason, each track on this album has stood the test of time and will continue to represent such a special hybrid of piano induced, frenzied yet organized beauty in it's 5 eclectic compositions that go everywhere from avant garde to ballad to bee bop to solo."
1,"There are so many reviews of the albums of The Moody Blues all over the web, so please forgive me if I repeat what anyone had already said or for not being too original in my review. Here is my experience of this remastered edition of ""Octave""...First off, just like the famous early seven CD re-releases by The Moody Blues, whether they be the 1997 remasters or the 2006/2007 expanded editions, we are once again treated to another topnotch remastering job for the CD reissue of ""Octave"" ... What better candidate to have, when it comes to this task, than Moody Blue band member Justin Hayward?! :) Also, notice how the songs sort of segue together, unlike the original CD release from the 80's, where there would be two or three second gaps between the tracks, so once the last droplet of sound fades from a previous song, the next tune picks up right from that point ... This format takes Moody Blues listeners back to the early albums, when there were no silent gaps between the tracks. I'd also like to add that I am very pleased that, after all of the Moody Blues compilations that came out, since this album, this release features the full version of ""Driftwood,"" and not the edited version that was faded out about a half minute sooner, as was the case on ""Voices In The Sky,"" ""Time Traveller,"" ""Anthology,"" and ""Gold."" This is the only place (Just like the original CD release of this album) where you can find the full five-minute version of ""Driftwood,"" which features excellent guitar and saxophone solos.On this occasion, John Lodge opens up a ""Moody Blues"" album with one of his tracks ... I enjoy ""Stepping in a Slide Zone,"" especially the synthesizer and sound effects at the beginning and end of the song. The guitar piece in the intro made for an eerie but awesome buildup to the opening lyrics, too. I also like the parts of the song where John Lodge shouts, ""Slide zoooooooone!"" ... My father (The original ""Moody Blues"" fan in my family) used to sing along on that line! :)""Had To Fall in Love,"" ""Driftwood,"" ""Survival,"" ""One Step Into The Light,"" and ""The Day We Meet Again"" are absolutely beautiful and are among the greatest songs ever written by the band, in my opinion ... They sort of have that ""New Horizons"" (""Seventh Sojourn"") sound to them.""I'll Be Level With You"" is a fantastic group vocal effort, and the fade out is beautifully dramatic with intense electric guitar and synthesizers ... Love the earth-shaking bass effects from one of the synthesizer dubs, too!Ray Thomas' selections sound different from his previous compositions, but I enjoy them just as much as his other songs ... I like the mellow and relaxing feel to both ""Under Moonshine"" and ""I'm Your Man,"" and the strings sound marvelous on both tracks, too.""Top Rank Suite"" is a unique sounding Justin Hayward track compared to his other songs, but it's so catchy and the saxophones add lots of pizazz to the track ... Another fine tune on the album! :)After ""Seventh Sojourn,"" the latter Moody Blues albums feature synthesizers replacing the mellotrons, as any Moody fan can tell you of course, plus Justin Hayward sings in a more mellow manner than the way he sang on the late 60's/early 70's albums. John Lodge rocks a bit more, at a few points, compared to on the earlier albums (Beginning with ""Sitting At The Wheel,"" from ""The Present""). Also, orchestral arrangements grace certain tracks (""Long Distance Voyager""). Not so much spoken-word poetry, either, until ""Strange Times.""For the bonus tracks, I was overjoyed to find that there were previously unreleased live versions of some of the tracks from ""Octave"" ... The live performance of ""Slide Zone"" sounds unusual when compared to the studio version, but it still sounds amazing. The other live tracks sound similar to their original versions, but still have that unique ""live"" feel to them, too. :) A shame that the five-minute version of John Lodge's ""Survival"" (Found on some pressings of the original CD version of ""Octave"") wasn't also featured as a bonus track on this release. Here, we get the shorter version of the track. Hopefully, one day the full version may make an appearance on a possible future Moody Blues compilation or rarities collection ... That would be nice.The CD booklet that accompanies this release is loaded with photos, lyrics, and a history of the band, so you get your money's worth on not just the disc, but with the insert, too! What an improvement from the simple ""greeting card"" format of the CD ""booklets"" that were featured within the original 1980's CD releases!This is what a remastered, reissued CD release should be all about, and this edition of ""Octave"" really satisfies! Congratulations and job well done to Justin Hayward and everyone who worked on this fantastic CD re-release! Now, let's all hope and pray for some remasters of ""The Other Side Of Life,"" ""Sur La Mer,"" ""Keys Of The Kingdom,"" a return of the ""This Is The Moody Blues"" and ""Legend Of A Band"" compilations, and also a return of the version of ""Strange Times"" that featured the bonus tracks, ""Highway"" and ""This Is The Moment"" ... Then, I'm sure we'll all be joyous and grateful ""Moodies"" fans. :) Thanks for reading and God Bless!~KevyGuy :)* * * * * * *"
1,"Last year's ""Special Edition"" of this album featured a second disk of live-in-concert versions of these songs, but for those who want just the original album - one of the cornerstone albums of 1980s R&B/funk - here it is in digitally remastered glory, with 2 bonus tracks (12-inch remixes of ""Give It To Me Baby"" and ""Super Freak""). A classic."
1,"Stevie is a true legend and ""Innervisions"" is further proof of that.  No one did it like him, and no one ever will.  Not much else to say that hasn't already been said, just a classic album."
1,I love the Bangles. My dad had them all on tape so it did not cost me a cent. The only song I knew on here was Going Down to Liverpool but I fell in love with the song James which was not a hit at all but I enjoyed it. Hero Takes a Fall is OK I guess but I never would have thought it would make it so big. Good album but they get even better by their second one.
1,"By 1988, I'd only heard &quot;I Love Rock And Roll&quot; and &quot;Good Music,&quot; the latter on MTV.  Fortunately, I didn't have to wait long with Up Your Alley and it's opening single, &quot;I Hate Myself For Loving You.&quot;  Having felt I missed out on her when she first came out, this song with opening anthemic drums, power guitars, and chorus.  Desmond Child's songwriting can be felt here.  In some ways, I'm reminded of a slowed down &quot;Heaven's On Fire,&quot; a song he did for KISS.  That song and &quot;Ridin' With James Dean&quot; shows Joan's shift to arena rock, with crashing guitar theatrics and riffs.  &quot;Back It Up&quot; even has shades of Def Leppard.  Given that Hysteria was released the previous year, it's hardly surprising that incorporating that sort of sound was seen as a boon.The other single from here shows how Joan can exhibit the vulnerable and hurt apart from the anger from being lied to.  &quot;Little Liar&quot; exudes all three in this rock ballad, with a choral backing and rhythm guitar that makes this more an 80's Heart song.  Like the other single, this highlights Desmond Child's co-writing talents.  But it also makes me ask, &quot;Joan, do you any NICE guys instead of ones who treat you like cr-p?&quot;Joan does two cover songs back-to-back.  The first is Chuck Berry's rollicking &quot;Tulane.&quot;  See, that's the thing about a Jett album.  It's anticipating what she'll cover in a sea of original numbers that makes it fun.  The other is a moody, paced, chugging rendition of Iggy Pop's &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog,&quot; with enough power guitar to make it worthwhile.The mid-paced rocker &quot;You Want In, I Want Out,&quot; also co-written with Desmond Child, has a sound that mirrors KISS, Crazy Nights era, minus the Ron Nevison wall of synth, but with the arena rock backing vocals of Heart.&quot;Just Like In The Movies&quot; has that classic Jett bite, sporting an electric bluesy guitar that belongs on the first album.  And ace songwriter Diane Warren helps Joan and producer Kenny Laguna on the 60's-pop inspired &quot;Desire,&quot; which sounds quite nice with the usual guitars and backing vocals, also 60's-inspired, a sound also found in the more tempered but listenable &quot;Play that Song Again.&quot;This is the first album since drummer Lee Crystal and bassist Gary Ryan's departure following Good Music, replaced here by Thommy Price and Kasim Sulton respectively.  Ricky Byrd's still here, thank goodness.  Up Your Alley shows Joan as strong as ever, with inroads towards KISS/Def Leppard-style arena rock."
1,"As a teen of the '80s, I loved classic rock (still do), including many of the bands that the members of ASIA were alumni of ie ELP, Yes, King Crimson, UK, and others.  I saw them on the ALPHA tour, which was before the personel changes started.  I love this album possessing the great qualites of the era with great guitar playing, fluid vocals, and cathy rhythms.  Prog rock never sounded better or more accessible."
1,"Of all the supreme recordings the Ohio Players made for Mercury Records in the mid-70's, &quot;Skin Tight&quot; reigns all over the others.  Although  there are only 6 songs, the ultra-funky 7 minute jams of &quot;Skin  Tight&quot; and &quot;Jive Turkey&quot; make up for it.  The intertwining  guitars and keyboards are truly like none I've ever rocked before.  &quot;It's Your Night&quot; and &quot;Heaven Must Be Like This&quot; may  ramble on too long for some (both over 7 minutes long as well), but if you  can really FEEL it then the song is never too long.  The production here is  tight, clear and never pristine.  The skills they had at making harmony  arrangements are really starting to come together here.  It's still a  little rough in the songwriting area, but the performance is unequaled in  the Ohio Players catalog.  A must have for fans of 70's heyday funk."
1,"Although Michael Jackson is one of history's greatest entertainers, he, like is sister Janet, benefits by being paired with a brilliant producer. Master musician Quincy Jones worked magic on the singer's landmark albums (&quot;Off the Wall&quot;, the super-platinum and award-winning &quot;Thriller&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot;).In the case of &quot;Dangerous&quot;, Jackson scored big with the songs either co-written or produced by Teddy Riley. The seven selections bearing the &quot;stamp of approval&quot; by Riley make this an essential album to have by &quot;The Gloved One&quot;.Although the disc shows the beginnings of wretched excess by the singer (three of the songs should've been eliminated), it still showcases the entertainer at his best.  Besides the seven (&quot;Jam&quot;, &quot;Why You Wanna Trip on Me&quot;, the enigmatic &quot;In the Closet&quot;, &quot;She Drives Me Wild&quot;, the superior &quot;Remember the Time&quot;, &quot;Can't Let Her Get Away&quot;, and the title cut), other highlights include the monster smash &quot;Black or White&quot; and &quot;Will You Be There&quot;.Now, if we could get Jackson to steer away from over-emoting as he does on the sappy &quot;Gone 'Too Soon&quot;, then he might be able to return to his rightful place as the &quot;King of Pop&quot;.He just doesn't need to dangle any more babies over banisters."
1,"One of the songs on this album says ""Don't Judge a Book by its Cover.""  Perhaps he should apply that to the terrible album cover as well.  The music inside was pretty good, especially the title track, one of the most feel-good singles in pop history.  Laid-back songs like ""Never had a dream Come True"" and ""Don't wonder why"" are average; so is ""Something to Say.""  But there are some real solid songs here that are worth discovering.  It was pretty ballsy to cover ""We can work it out,"" but Stevie funks it up and it's one of the best covers I've heard of any song.  ""Heaven help us all"" is a gospel-choir-backed prayer for, well, all of us.  It builds and builds and has a fake ending and then comes back for more.  It has a catchy melody and you might wish it was more than 3 minutes long.  There are plenty of short songs here, 7 under 3 minutes.  One of the best, ""Anything you want me to do,"" has one of the best grooves you'll find in pre-genius era Stevie.  ""I Gotta Have a Song"" has a rollicking chorus and would have fit much better as the last song on the album.  All in all, a handful of great songs and a couple good ones, hard to complain about that."
1,"One reviewer stated that if it wasn't for Wynona's Big Brown Beaver, this album would be a flop. That is mostly true. The song Southbound Pachyderm is somewhat overrated, it isn't nearly as good as My Name is Mud. The video is really cool, but that doesn't relate. All these songs need to be listened to carefully in order to appreciate them."
1,"Wes Montgomery was truely gifted at the guitar. He couldn't read a single note of music but his style was very distinct, he used his thumb to play the guitar, he also used incredible octaves in his style as well as tremendous solo's. Boss Guitar for me was Innovative for any jazz guitarist. It showed Montgomery's creativity as a musician. Besame Mucho is a beautiful song, Dearly Beloved shows Montgomery's creative side, Fried Pies is my favorite, for me it has everything a jazz solo should have octaves, block chords, and tremendous playing from the heart. I recommend this to any guitarist out there weather you play the blues or rock. Try learning these solo's and i guarantee you will be one hell of a great guitarist. This is Highly Recommended!!!!!!!"
1,"Yeah, great SECOND album! Don't sleep! I don't know why this gets negative reviews. It's a well crafted follow up to Doggystyle. The actual sound quality I think is actually better than Doggystyle and the Chronic. The beats are banging, and there's enough variety to make the album sound diverse, but it still sounds like a cohesive project. I know everyone loves Dr. Dre, but I think they've been unfair. If people heard this music and were under the impression Dre produced it, they'd be singing it's praises. It just got hated on cause Dr. Dre left and people were looking for it to be lower quality. Pooh and them did a great job! And the lyrics and flow of Snoop?? Who are you kidding? This is top notch Snoop Dogg. The Doggfather (nice first song). Vapors (great remake). Freestyle conversation (which I think is dope). Snoop's Upside Ya Head. Up Jump tha Boogie. Ill party joints. Come on people. This album is hot. Snoop delivered a one-two punch with his first two albums. I remember hearing this when it first came out. My older step brother copped it. He was a big Death Row fan. As a KID i liked it. That's a testament to how catchy some of this album is, but not in a give-me-radio-play!, corny kind of way. It's just that GOOD! As a grown rap fan, I really like this album a lot!"
1,"This cd is pretty tight but it got way overplayed.  Gangsta's Paradise, Too Hot, Exercise Yo' Game, Smilin' Bright As The Sun & Sumpin' New are some tight songs but after hearin 'em on the radio all day everyday you start to not like them but I listened to this the other day and after not hearing it for a while I rembered how it was a good cd.CPT"
1,"I must say, there are a number of classic rock hits on here, but none of them excite me very much. I probably wouldn't even own this if it wasn't for &quot;Dust In The Wind&quot;. That song is excellent, and reminds me of some of the better stuff from &quot;Crosby Stills &amp; Nash&quot; and &quot;America&quot;. Otherwise this also has &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot;, &quot;Point Of No Return&quot;, &quot;Hold On&quot;, and &quot;Play The Game Tonight&quot;, all of which are good, just not the caliber of &quot;Dust In The Wind&quot;. I think my problem is that some of the more rocking songs remind me of &quot;Styx&quot;, and I can't stand them. Overall it's a decent bunch of tunes, but I guess I just can't be a big fan of &quot;Kansas&quot;, when I'm from Missouri."
1,"The cd is super, I had this piece of music on an 8 track tape, and I wanted to hear the sound, and I must say that I am well pleased."
1,"Any barebones Marvin Gaye collection should include a good compilation of his 60's hits as well as Let's Get It On and this one.  What's Going On found Gaye breaking free from the Motown hit-making apparatus to produce an artistic statement that has since become a cornerstone of R&B; and one of the all time great records.  It's instructive that only an artist of Gaye's stature was allowed to get away with something like this at the time on Motown.The title track is one of his greatest and has rightfully become an R&B; standard.  Gaye's gritty, streetwise lyrics set the tone for what's to come.  ""What's Happening Brother"" concerns a dazed and confused returning Vietnam War vet while ""Flyin' High (In The Friendly Sky)"" is about the dangers of drugs.  Considering his own habit and circumstances of his sad demise, it's eerie to hear him sing lines like ""I go crazy when I can't get it...the pain, oh the pain.""""Mercy Mercy Me"" is another of Gaye's best songs and for me is the high point of the album as Gaye welds a classic and hypnotic beat to ecology-minded lyrics.  Another classic hit, ""Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)"" closes out the set.  Despite it's fair share of hits, this record was sequenced so that each song flows into each other, with a singular purpose of music and lyrics that makes it best heard from beginning to end in one sitting.What's Going On not only pushed the boundries wide open on R&B; subject matter, but experimented musically as well.  Starting with background ""party"" sounds and adding bongos, congas and other percussion, full horn and string sections and lush backing vocals make this an almost symphonic form of R&B.;A truly remarkable recording, and quite possibly the best R&B; album ever.  A must for any comprehensive collection."
1,"...like the fine young lady below, I, too, saw Stevie live right after he put this out. It was a nonstop show of all his jams ending with an extended, sing along &quot;Master Blaster&quot;. That was a thoroughly  satisfying experience.Of the album, listen for Michael Jackson, Betty  Wright and the Ojays on &quot;All I Do&quot; and the Gap Band on &quot;I  Ain't Gonna Stand for It&quot;. What about that Paul Riser orchestration on  &quot;Rocket Love&quot;? And just who 'done broke Momma's lamp'...?Who  cares if it doesn't strike critics and so called Stevie purists as on par  with the album prior to this--&quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;? My  opinion is that time has given/will give this album quite a different view.  It will be seen as another excellent production in a brilliantly  exceptional career. (I mean, not even including the raising awareness and  the lobbying to Congress for a national holiday for ML King's Birthday..)All of a sudden, I'm feeling a little warmer..."
1,"Laura Nyro originally made her name as the author of a host of tightly-written pop songs that hit big when covered by other artists--but by 1970 she had acquired a reputation as one of the most flatly uncompromising recording artists of her era, a woman who wrote, performed, and recorded without any significant concern for prevailing tastes.  Then, just as she seemed to have reached this point of self-definition, she suddenly shifted gears and went into the studio with soul-singing trio LaBelle for an homage to the pop songs of the 1950s and 1960s that had originally inspired her.The result was GONNA TAKE A MIRACLE, an album that is generally regarded as Nyro's most widely accessible work.  Opening with a near-acapella rendition of &quot;I Met Him On A Sunday&quot; that divides the song neatly between all four singers, Nyro then launches out on a host of other old favorites with her own voice shining like a diamond against the sultry stylings of LaBelle, giving each tune a noticeably different twist from its original incarnation.Both &quot;The Bells&quot; and &quot;Desiree&quot; suddenly seem as if they had been written with Nyro alone in mind, beginning gently but building a series of dynamic shifts; &quot;Spanish Harlem&quot; is a beautifully rendered selection; and the more vibrant numbers like &quot;Dancing In The Streets&quot; and &quot;Nowhere To Run&quot; crackle with energy.  This one of those rare releases of which you can truly say every single cut is first rate all the way.The most powerful thing about the recording is, I think, its spontaneity.  According to the liner notes by Amy Linden, the singers were having such a good time together that they didn't actually bother to record anything until the last day--and then they popped out one number after another with little preparation.  In any other hands the results would probably have been extremely uneven, but with Nyro and LaBelle it has an enchanting immediacy.  They just stepped up the mikes and did it, and their joy in both the music and each other rings through every single cut.GONNA TAKE A MIRACLE is not Nyro's most personal statement, nor does it really offer her at the highwater mark of her artistry--but it is a beautiful little jewel that her fans will adore and which newcomers will likely find much easier to grasp than her more complex work.  A truly vibrant, memorable, and just down right fun album.  The remaster also offers Nyro performing live, doing brief intros of &quot;Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing&quot; and &quot;O-o-h Child&quot; to full length versions of &quot;Natural Woman&quot; and &quot;Up On The Roof&quot;--bonus tracks that truly deserve the title &quot;bonus.&quot;  Recommended.--GFT (Amazon Reviewer)--"
1,"I had the vinyl two record set of Bobby Goldsboro's 10th Anniversary album and was either trying to get that whole record on cd.  Or at least all of the songs on various cds.  Which I was finally able to do.  This has most of those songs.  And also some that weren't on it.  Like Hello Loser, Whenever He Holds You, a song I like Me Japanese Boy, I Love You.  It Breaks My Heart, and If You Wait For Love.The rest of the songs were on that album.  They are the biggest songs of his career.  See The Funny Little Clown, Watching Scotty Grow, and the monster Honey.  Which as big as it was.  It probably would have been song of the year any other year.  But it seemed like it was overshadowed by By The Time I Get To Phoenix.There are other very good songs on here that probably aren't as well known.  The Straight Life which was also done by Glen Campbell and John Gary.  And one of my favorite Bobby Goldsboro songs Broomstick Cowboy.The cd ends with Summer and then after that kind of turns into a promotion for his latest album at the time.  This is a good cd by an artist.  Who at his peak was as hot as anybody.  But for whatever reason was never taken too seriously."
1,"This jamming 80s album is nothing fancy; it's just hard-hitting and therapeutic when one is in the mood for some straight up no frills hard rock/metal. The song titles are unsophisticated as well. I like the song HEFT, which is probably their defining sound. It's too bad that Fastway never really got into the fast lane as far as success goes, but whatever. This album is still a great acquisition."
1,"This is the blast master at his absolute finest lyrically KRS still had it and showed some of the best poetry and story telling skills that I have ever heard he just kept getting better and better as he progressed through the nineties but something happened towards the end of the millenium he kind of fell off musically then he fell off both musically and lyrically. its a --- shame too because he is still the best live but he cant heat it anymore on solo records but this record is an often over looked classic in the world of Hiphop it has some of the greatest beats that I have ever heard and some of the dopest sleeve art I have ever seen on an album Check it out seriously. if you do not own this album and you call yourself Hiphop you need to do some homework on the history of REAL HIPHOP. My favorite track is ""Cant Stop Wont Stop"" the story telling lines in that song are so vivid you almost feel like you are there. You will not be dissapointed by this record if you choose to purchase it."
1,"Well I bought this disc back in 2007. It's so good, so awesome to listen to, that I just could not pull myself away from listening to it in order to write a review. Let's face it, when having the choice between listening to a jewel of a surround disc or writing out a review, the music is going to win every time. I feel fortunate to have bought it when I did before it became so rare and costly to attain. That is a darn shame. It's a shame because if you love this album, you simply must own this. Beg, borrow, whatever... just get it.I'll never in my life have the experience of sitting in a recording studio while a masterpiece is being recorded, nor will you. Here is the good news though, you wont need to. Not if you have this disc. Yes, that is the experience of listening to this. I kid you not! I want to emphasize this again, as a music lover- if you love this album, if you appreciate the few in a lifetime experiences of joy when you listen to a real talent performing in front of you, get this disc for yourself. I know you will come back here with a comment to thank me. Be aware though, the first track is a little rough around the edges. The use of surround is excellent and Carol's voice coming at you from center channel will give you goosebumps. I know this sounds like a bunch of hype, but trust me, I have trashed some awful sounding albums with brutally honest one star reviews.Content 5Audio Quality 5"
1,"This is my favorite Teena Marie album (tied with ""Robbery"") for a multitude of reasons.  This is Teena's first album as sole producer of her work, which makes this album intensely personal and a true reflection of Teena's identity as an artist.  Teena's two prior albums (Produced by Rick James and Richard Rudolph, respectively) served as a sort of mentoring for her.  This album is a combination of those influences, coupled with her own, making an explosive effort.Perhaps most well known for the smash, ""I Need Your Lovin'"", Teena displays her love for funk in this seven minute opus.  Lush with strings and slamming horns and Teena's classic lyrical touch (""I feel it in my third eye/love will never end""), it is another example of why 25 years later, we still love this woman's work.My personal favorites on this album are the ballads, specifically the jazz infused ""Irons In The Fire"" and the very much underrated ""Tune In Tomorrow"".  ""Tune In Tomorrow"" is a follow-up so to speak of ""I'm Gonna Have My Cake"" from ""Wild & Peaceful"".  Here, Teena becomes the jazz chanteuse and gives us a glimpse (as she continues to do) of where her future work may take her.  That scat at the end climaxes the song...and creates one of Teena's Top 5 vocal performances.Teena also shows off her Latin influences with the heavenly ""You Make Love Like Springtime"" and it's glorious reprise at the end of ""Tune In Tomorrow"".I agree with the previous reviewer and note that ""First Class Love"" is perhaps the weakest moment on the album...but it's orchestration is so tight it overshadows whatever lapses there are in the track.Overall, I still have to give this album 5 stars...As a first effort as a producer, Teena created an album that still sounds fresh and inspiring 25 years later..."
1,"As the final installment of the Moody Blues' classic seven LPs, 1972's ""Seventh Sojourn"" reflects a very mature band. Comfortable with where they've been and how they make music, they ease back here on experimentation in favor of simpler melodies.Make no mistake, though. This is a masterpiece, beginning to end. From Mike Pinder's social thought-provoking ""Lost in a Lost World"" to Justin Hayward's uplifting ""New Horizons"" to Ray Thomas' sea shanty ""For My Lady"" to John Lodge's tearful ""Isn't Life Strange?"" to Pinder's wartime conscientious objector tale in ""When You're a Free Man"" to Lodge's rockin' ""I'm Just a Singer.""I get the feeling they all decided to just be themselves this time, to say what was on their minds and in their hearts in one of those ""I've always wanted to..."" moments. It's as if they knew this would be the last of the lineup's greatness in sound.As a result, the beauty of ""Seventh Sojourn"" is its simplicity, and especially cool are the transitional notes linking songs, notably ""New Horizons"" to ""For My Lady"" to ""Isn't Life Strange?"" You'll need to turn up the volume a bit to catch Thomas's flute tying ""When You're a Free Man"" to ""I'm Just a Singer.""In all, this album, like Phil Travers' cover art, reflects the band's unmatched talent for painting pictures through music.For this Moody Blues fan, it doesn't get any better."
1,"Dangerous~ Michael Jackson is not nearly as good as thriller, bad or off the wall. The sound even when it was released sounded a bit dated and it sounds like he uses the same spiel as he did on the Bad album and it does not work as well. There are some good tracks such ""Black or white"", ""Remember the time"" (yeah, that was the song for the video with Eddie Murphy playing the role of the King and I think Naomi Campel, but I am not sure, it has been quite many years since I saw it) and the overly sentimental but effective track ""Heal the World"". However, MJ has set the bar high for himself with previous releases such as Thriller and Bad and this is not on the same level and he could have used a new producer to made give him new ideas. The book-let is atrocious and the cover-art does not make any sense at all and seems to be a hopscotch of things put together at random with no real sense of direction behind it. On the whole this a good album and 4 stars is not a bad mark for an album that just does not have the brilliance of the past."
1,"It really doesn't matter how you categorise 10cc, but having heard the album today for the first time in a little while, I would say that they were the champions of witty lyrics ... &quot;twopays and threepays&quot; for example.Just great music from very talented people. As we know, Eric Stewart could sing and play a bit, Lol Cream and Kevin Godley were inventors of the Gizmo and went into producing extremely clever videos (&quot;Reet Petite&quot; and &quot;Age of Confusion&quot; to name but two. As for Graham Gouldman, he was the ace in the hole as the songwriter, who started out writing for the legendary Yardbirds.Particular favourites of mine are &quot;Under My Thumb&quot; and &quot;Cry&quot;, but not a duff song to be seen. All these are all class tracks by a class act - whether rock or pop! Who cares about a category?"
1,"This is THE pop album of early/mid 80's. This launched an unknown woman by the name of Cyndi Lauper into superstardom back in 1984 *the year that she actually rivaled the popularity of Madonna.* It is 6x platinum to date and is a must-have. Of course you have the 80's pop anthem &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; which was a #2 US hit and is probably Cyndi's signature song. It's still a great listen after all these years. &quot;Time After Time&quot; was a #1 hit and is still played quite a lot on adult contemporary radio. &quot;She Bop&quot; was a also a top 5 hit and was actually contreversial due to its actual meaning...It's still a great song, though. I love the other top 10 hit present on here which is &quot;All Through the Night.&quot; It isn't remembered as much as the other singles on here, but Cyndi sounds great on it and I love the chorus. The 5th single is &quot;Money Changes Everything&quot; and is another fantastic song and was a US top 40 hit. The non-singles are not as outstanding as the hits on &quot;She's So Unusual&quot; but they're definitely worth a listen. You have a Prince cover and even a 1920's cover with &quot;He's So Unusual&quot; which leads right into the catchy pop ditty &quot;Yeah Yeah.&quot;Although Cyndi Lauper would continue to have minor to moderate success through-out the rest of the 80's, she never again matched the success of &quot;She's So Unusual.&quot; It's a classic pop album and Cyndi should be very proud of it."
1,"While the four previous Brand-X releases had a consistency and adventurousness to them, ""Product"" definitely shows obvious signs of Multiple Personality Disorder.Here, most likely under a lot of pressure from their management (hereafter referred to as ""THE MAN""), Brand-X essentially splintered into two bands. The more adventurous half (with Percy Jones in the bass chair and ex Herbie Hancock's Headhunters drummer Mike Clarke), and the ""Trying To Have A Hit At Any Cost"" half (with Phil Collins and John Giblin on bass) seemed at odds with each other here. The ""Phil Collins Half"" is seen churning out cheese-whiz pop (""Soho"") and even VERRRRRY BAD arena-rock (""Don't Make Waves"") and even regurgitated Genesis-lite (""And So To F---"").The 'Adventurous Half"" hangs in there with gems like ""Not Good Enough, See Me--"", ""Algon"", the pleasantly Pat Metheny-esque ""Rhesus Perplexus"" and ""Dance of The Illegal Aliens"". Another odd item is the dual bass feature ""Wal to Wal"" driven along by a robotic drum machine track.Listening to this was somewhat difficult for me, in part because of the music and in part for the rather muddy production quality on most of the album.But anyway, THE MAN may well have led to Brand-X's dissolution in 1980, trying to have it both ways. ""Product"" does have some worthwhile moments on it, but hardly essential by any stretch."
1,"If you are looking to buy your first Elton John album, there are two ways to go about it: Play it safe and get his first Greatest Hits album, which has most of his classic singles from 1970-1974. Or be a little braver, and snag this, his most tuneful and enjoyable session workout, released in 1972. It's pop music ear candy that's good for the soul.""Honky Chteau"" has a lot of fans, and no wonder. It contains two of Elton's most enduring hits, the playful ""Honky Cat"" and the affectively yearning ""Rocket Man,"" along with 8 other tracks that hardly sag by way of comparison. I revere this album because it represents Elton John at his poppy best, the way I came to love him on the radio when I was growing up in the 1970s. Other great songs like ""Mellow,"" ""Hercules,"" and ""Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters"" add to a rich blend of musical styles that make listening to the entire album a pleasant journey that never gets dull.Listen to the way the piano kicks in on ""Honky Cat,"" the opening track. Elton's keyboard passages bounce from one wall to another and back again in unpredictable but clever rhythmic patterns, while a banjo throws out odd notes to add to the mix. The aural dynamics continue with each of the songs that follow, never in a bombastic way, but a very accomplished and relaxed manner that testifies to Elton's zooming artistic growth.Bernie Taupin's lyrics are funny and work either with or against the grain of the melody in each song in a way that adds to their signature diversity. ""I Think I'm Going To Kill Myself"" is a song that grabs attention for the wrong reason. It's actually about a self-dramatizing teen angry his parents won't let him use the car. His idea for suicide is laughable rather than horrific; he wants to hang around after he kills himself to see how everyone takes the bad news. If there's any lingering doubt about its seriousness, it's dispelled by the merry ragtime melody carrying it, complete with tap dancing. The song only works because the kid doesn't realize the gravity of what he's contemplating, because if he did he wouldn't be young and immature enough to think about doing it!Elsewhere on the album are some of Taupin's most famous lines, about ""trying to drink whiskey from a bottle of wine,"" ""turn around and say good morning to the night,"" and most memorably, ""Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids/In fact it's cold as hell."" Man, did you think Taupin was writing that one about the street you were growing up on, too? Even when the lyrics are goofier, they still work, like his words to the nasty dreamwrecker ""Amy"": ""You're far out, you're fab and insane/A woman of the world it's quite plain."" Elton delivers that one with the right gravelly intonation, all sleazy and '70s glam, which along with the dire yet funky piano accompaniment makes ""Amy"" my call for Honky Cht's sleeper track.The music is ultimately what makes the songs so good. Every song feels very unique, and none of it like filler. Filler is not a bad thing in and of itself; I define ""filler"" as being songs that either work or don't in the context of an album but not outside of it. But you can pull any one of these songs out on its own, and it won't wilt in isolation. ""Slave"" and ""Salvation"" may be my least favorite tracks, but both are solid tunes I can hum to myself days after last hearing them.My favorite on this album has to be ""Honky Cat,"" the sorta title track. I can listen to that forever. It really defines who Elton is on this album; carefree, amiable, willing to laugh at himself. I kind of picture him chained to a whorehouse piano playing that one, trying to make eye contact over his cokebottle glasses with all the wicked women because he wasn't out of the closet yet.Other Elton albums may lay greater claim to being art, but this was Elton's best pop record, and his most enjoyable moment on wax. ""Honky Chteau"" is a gem worth having for your record collection."
1,"This album was the last that we would hear from Tupac while he was alive.  Although released after his death, his presence was more than felt on this one.  With his combination of prophecy (Blasphemy, Hail Mary), political and social issues (just like daddy, white man's world) and of course battling and anger which is what was expected on here (bomb first, life of an outlaw, against all odds).  This album is filled with hits and also leads on many people to still think he is alive to increase the shock value.  His brilliant use of the metaphor comes on ""Me and my Girlfriend"" where he lays down a track about his gun (the girlfriend) and how it will help him survive.  He fires diss rhymes like Mussolini from the balcony on Against all odds and Bomb First where he mentions Nas, Biggie, and Mobb Deep. The Outlaws drop in for the tracks Hail Mary and Life of an Outlaw and help 2pac along with getting his point across.  I especially love the intro because it sets the tone for an extremely dark and gritty album.  This shows you how serious tupac was about the situation and how it affected him.  He still finds time to include more of his political stands on White Man's World.  Also finds time to include a track for the clubs in Toss it Up, one of my favorite tracks.  This classic does not miss by anyone's standards.  This is the last great tupac album that we will ever experience.  If you want real tupac, do not pick up anything after this album.  With the exception of one released album, ""Until the End of Time"", they falter badly and are not the real tupac.  This is the real deal."
1,"&quot;Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik&quot; was good, and I do not doubt that it was groundbreaking and put Outkast on the map. But &quot;ATLiens&quot; was by far and best album they put out. The Source gave  it 4 mics and gave &quot;Aquemini&quot; 5, but I really believe that they  were giving &quot;Aquemini&quot; an extra mic to make up for not labeling  &quot;ATLiens&quot; a hip-hop classic. I can understand how fans of the  first album might not have understood or liked the new sound, and it truly  is a departure from the pimp stylings of their debut. &quot;ATLiens&quot;  runs deeper, fusing soul, R&amp;B and smooth-as-molasses hip-hop with Big  Boi's street-wise raps and Dre's spiritual soliloquies. It's a beautiful  album, and one that any real hip-hopper should have in their collection.  Highlights, well, every song is a highlight, but when it comes down to it,  the driving beats of &quot;Ova Da Wudz,&quot; &quot;Jazzy Belle&quot; and  &quot;Elevators&quot; surpass anything Master P or the Hot Boys ever came  out with. And &quot;13th Floor/Growing Old&quot; is one of the most  poignant hip-hop spirituals of all time. Get this album."
1,"they expose a nerve with this one!most rappers shout-out god in they credits, but few touch on somethin spiritual in their actual lyrics...outkast aint nowhere near saints, but you can feel the spiritual searchin in the undertones of what they are sayin...soul searchin is what hip-hop needs more of.  that's what sets this release from other hip-hop classics; these boys are always lookin to grow beyond not just where they at, but from where they might be tomorrow....but yall proly aint feelin me on that, so i'll just say this:&quot;me anyuuu  yomama an yocuz zin toooooooooo......&quot;"
1,"Released in 1983, ""Busy Body"" was Luther's third album for Epic Records. The uptempo dance tracks ""I Wanted Your Love"", ""I'll Let You Slide"" and the slammin', heat-generating workout ""For The Sweetness Of Your Lovin' "" are classic examples of early-'80s Funk while the ballads ""Busy Body"", ""Make Me a Believer"" and his sultry yet passionate duet with Dionne Warwick (""How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye?"") foreshadow the direction Luther's subsequent albums would take. The ultra-lush Quiet Storm gem ""Superstar/ Until You Come Back To Me"" was this CD's masterpiece, however, and is the one that makes it a must-have. Starting with his next CD (1985's ""The Night I Fell In Love"") Luther's albums would have more and more ballads and only a couple of dance tracks. Enjoy!"
1,"Back in 1976 progressive rock was just past its zenith and slowly on its way out.  The old order of Yes and ELP seemed to be on their last legs.  The respective albums, ""Relayer"" and ""Welcome Back My Friends"" were not exactly fresh breaths of air.  Genesis wasn't exactly shaking the earth with innovative music either.  So who was left to fill the void?  Along comes Starcastle with a sound remarkably like Fragile-era Yes, with guitar-bass rhythms that locked perfectly (think Squire's ""Fish""), and with a vocal/harmony style not a little unlike the Anderson approach.  Subsequently, these guys got creamed by critics and fans alike-and that's a shame, because this album rocks!  It did what the above mentioned bands were failing to do at that time-namely make music that sounded fresh.  Starcastle's ego-free debut doesn't sound like anything new, but it reaffirms what's good about progressive rock.  The title track is long, but it moves.  The opening guitar riff is sweet and the rhythm will leave you breathless for a moment-and this is only the first 15 seconds!  Many of the songs are keyboard heavy that recall the Close To The Edge style of Yes, especially ""Elliptical Seasons"", ""Forces"" and the ""Stargate"" intro to the great ""Sunfield"".  ""To The Fire Wind"" sports another great guitar intro that plays nicely with the keyboards.  Lyrically the songs are basic sci-fi fare with some mystical elements thrown in; check out the album cover, and you basically have the songs in a nutshell.  And there you have it.  If Starcastle showed us anything, it was that sometimes you don't need to have your own idea to be inventive.  The Yes band may have crafted a unique sound of their own, but since they proved unwilling to continue with it, who are they or others to disparage when another band proved that it could go farther with the same idea and yield better results?  Still think Yes or ELP had a unique sound at this time period?  Go buy the subsequent ""Tormato"" and ""Works"" albums and we'll talk."
1,"I saw 'Hotter Than July' at a record store being sold at a decent price, and noted that it included songs that I recognized by name: &quot;Rocket Love&quot;, &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;, &quot;Lately&quot;, and &quot;Master Blaster (Jammin)&quot;. On impulse, I bought it.I'm glad I did. You see, &quot;All I Do&quot; has been remade into a dance/techno song by a British group called the Cleptomaniacs this year; so when I heard the original - it just made me feel so enlightened. For the record I prefer Mr. Wonder's version, but both versions of &quot;All I Do&quot; are enjoyable.&quot;Lately&quot; was immortalized by an R&amp;B group named Jodeci in the spring/summer of 1992; and they actually performed the song with Stevie on the Arsenio Hall show - and it was great. &quot;Lately&quot; (for me) is a sad and moving song that is also very beautiful.It scares me to think that as late as 1980 we still didn't celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday as a national holiday; but hey, at least now I know the words to the whole song besides the chorus. &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; serves as a wonderful finale to the album.But my favorite song on here would have to be &quot;Rocket Love&quot;. My favorite Stevie Wonder songs are the slower, or midtempo songs that seem to just float, and take you on majestic, magic carpet rides. &quot;Send One Your Love&quot;, &quot;Superwoman&quot; and &quot;Ribbon In The Sky&quot; do this for me.But something tells me this isn't his absolute best album (assuming they can be ranked)...and from what I've been able to gather, 'Innervisions' and 'Songs In The Key Of Life' seem to be the top two. At any rate, just know that this disc is a good investment. I'm listening to it right now as I type this. It's on &quot;Lately&quot;...Thanks for reading."
1,"This record does not limit itself in anyway.  Whether its smooth ballads like Harbor Lights and We're All Alone, smooth pop(What Do You Want The Girl To Do, Lowdown, Georgia) or flat out rockers(Jump Street, Lido  Shuffle) this album cooks from start to finish without a single weak point.  Th Future Toto Band Members and Little Feat's Fred Tackett make nice  contributions in support of Boz.  Its amazing how Boz never duplicated the  success of this fine recording, although he had a couple of other decent  songs.  None the less, ignore the last reviewer's comments and buy this  winner."
1,"L' came with the most slept on classic of all time! He brings plenty of ill flows about Lenox Ave., wannabe mc's., and why he is better than your favorite rapper. EVERYONE should own a copy, you don't wanna miss out on the grimest MC to ever rip it."
1,"I'm 56 years old, a serious lifelong music fan, but somehow, back in the day, I didn't ""get"" Parliament Funkadelic.  However, for the last 18 months, I've spent probably 50% of my listening time digging into the P-Funk catalog.  To say it's been an astounding trip is an understatement.Much like the Beatles, it's useless to debate which P-Funk album is the best.  That being said, if I had to pick a favorite, this is it.  While most others seem to favor Mothership Connection or Funkentelechy, Clones is the one that has it all.  The horn arrangements on ""Gamin' On Ya"" and ""Children Of Productions"" are nothing short of amazing, a rich, complex, swirling stew of sound, arranged respectively by Bernie Worrell and Fred Wesley.This is an album that prominently features Glen Goins, one of the greatest vocalists in modern music.  The first lines of ""Funkin' For Fun"" (""Got to go, Got to leave"") are an eerie foreshadowing of his tragic death, scarcely 2 years later, at age 24, but ""Funkin'"" is a joyous celebration of life, and represents P-Funk at its absolute best.  His plaintive callout of ""If you see my mother, tell her I'm alright"" gives me chills just thinking about it.In a larger sense: who in modern music is more influential than George Clinton?  What musical catalog is as deep, as varied, as constantly surprising, as joyous, and yes, as truly strange?  Are there any more unjustly neglected talents than Eddie Hazel and Glen Goins?  When has a greater group of musical talent ever been assembled in one place?So if you're looking for a place to start your voyage into The Funk, this is as good as any.  It's solid from beginning to end; there's simply not a weak note.  From here, though, you'll want to explore back to the origins with albums like Free Your Mind and Maggot Brain and America Eats Its Young.  Clinton was/is an uncompromising genius, and there are delights to be found at every turn."
1,"it's a good album, it has some nice songs like def wish 2 and n 2 deep,  but if you want cmw's best then i suggest you pick up it's a compton thang or straight checkn em"
1,"Will Downing can blow. Up or down tempo, the man flows. He's like Luther on steroids. He covers &quot;I try&quot;,one of my favorites, excellently. A powerful CD to play any time of the day or night. If you don't have this,  you are really missing a great voice with some excellent studio work from  artists like Kevin Eubanks, Omar Hakim, Jonathan Butler and Onaje Allan.  Pick it up."
1,"Michael was never top of my list, thought I'd keep a cd as a keep sake, doubt it'll be played much, another poor soul lost by fame and fortune, his family still buying into the industries professional butt kissing mongers."
1,"One of the greatest albums ever made. My Stero never sounded better. Everyone was talking about this record when it came out. Its almost like a greatest hit tape,you want to play the whole Album. &quot;Stand,&quot;  &quot;You can make it if you Try,&quot; and &quot;Everyday  People,&quot;really helped alot of people who lost there way in the 60's.  Prince couldn't come close to Sly when he was in his prime. I bought a  couple of Albums after this one,but this is by far the best Sly and the  Family Stone have recorded."
1,"SHe and the New Bohemians have created a thought-provoking array of wild and hippy fun loving songs that speak to the care free yet concerned spirit--songs of pain and truth collage this album into any artwoRk that's high on a collector's list.""Circle"" speaks of lonliness and redemption,""Little Miss S"" speaks to the soul of the unfulfilled in a way that encompasses an empathy found in songs such as Maria McKee's remake of ""This Propery Is COndemned."" It's good."
1,"For a while, I believed that 1979's barnstormingLadies Nightwas Kool & The Gang's debut. By bringing in producer Eumir Deodato and lead singer James ""J.T."" Taylor, they did indeed launch themselves into the pop chart stratosphere that year but they'd already had a long-running and very successful career as a jazz-funk band. This is best exemplified by their tune ""Summer Madness"" from their 1974 albumLight of Worldswhich was a firm favourite among fans at the time but was introduced to the wider world in 1991 when DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince sampled it for their monster hit ""Summertime"". Another good indicator of what the guys were capable of can be found on their contribution toSaturday Night Fever: The Original Movie Sound Track, called ""Open Sesame"". I was playing ""Ladies Night"" just the other day and was struck by how incredibly clean - even by today's standards - the production was. It only has six songs on it but every one is a winner.This 1980 follow-up, if anything, was even more popular than its predecessor. The two party hits ""Celebration"" and ""Love Festival"" are as alive now (in connoisseur homes and on specialist dancefloors at least) as they were then but the album offers much more. The mid-tempo tune ""Jones Vs. Jones"", ""Just Friends"", the ballad ""Love Affair"" and the instrumental ""Morning Star"" were all firm favourites of mine right from the gate. My love and enthusiasm for these tunes has not diminished in the intervening 28 years; on the contrary, my appreciation for them has actually grown. Kool & The Gang were a real band, made up of people who were incredibly good musicians who also knew how to write good, funky songs. To crown it all, they had the warm, soulful lead vocals of J.T. and from what I recall, the ladies loved him. The guys just wanted to be him.This successful phase of Kool & The Gang's career went on for a few years, with albums likeSomething Special,As OneandEmergency. Good albums all, but this ultimate classic from a golden era should be in every 80s music lover's collection. The CD cost me a bit more than usual but it's worth every penny. What's more, I even managed to sell my old vinyl copy for a decent amount.They don't make them like this anymore. Once again, I'm just glad I can say I was there."
1,"Who other than Rod Temperton could do a funky thing on Central Heating?The fabulous UK Band Heatwave made two albums with the musicians you get on this album. Both are R&B; gems but I prefer this one. Why? No flaws, it's that simple.I got it in 78 when it came out in Holland, two years later bought me a second copy cause the first one's grooves were gone. Then the cd.It is funky and happy R&B; music, with tight playing, almost no horns (except for an occasional toot here and there and a nice trombone solo on Happiness Togetherness). Not that you'd miss them for a second.The Groove Line, Put The Word Out, Central Heating, Party Poops are the up-tempo dance tracks, Send Out For Sunshine and Mind Blowing Decisions (my favorites) great mid-tempos, Happiness Togetherness (another favorite), Star Of A Story and Leavin' For A Dream, wonderful ballads. Great lead vocals (Johnny Wilder Jr. and his brother Keith Wilder) and harmonies, terrific guitar, bass, drums, percussion, keys.The songwriting is top notch. Beautiful ballads, good stompers, most written by Rod. Quincy must have loved this one too because a little later they started working together on Michael's albums, George Benson, Brothers Johnson etc.So, get it (if not available here, try amazon.co.uk) and let it heat up the place."
1,"This album is so much fun to listen to. The grooves are unmistakable, the lyrics are sing-a-longable, and the songs are just incredible. One great song after another after another after another. It doesn't stop until the album is over. Every song is a sure thing. My favorites on this disc are the monumental &quot;Man In The Mirror&quot;, the funk/80's/synth ecstacy of &quot;Speed Demon&quot;, the pure joy of &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; and &quot;Just Good Friends (with Stevie Wonder)&quot;, also the mega torch ballad &quot;I Just Can't Stop Loving You,&quot; &quot;Another Part Of Me&quot; and &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; are just incredible songs. This album is a sure thing and not to mention SO MUCH FUN. It's really like a ride through a fun house on a roller coaster. Plus, the videos that accompany this album are all classics. It makes me happy."
1,"Catching just about everyone by surprise Cheap Trick's ""Live At Budakon"" album, released early in the year, vaulted to the top of the charts and became a smash hit.  All of a sudden the band went from opening act / club status to being able to headline arenas.  ""Dream Police"" was actually already in the can when the live album was released, and was pushed back to the end of the year in order for the live album to run it's course.  I don't think that ""Dream Police"" is quite as good as the previous studio disc ""Heaven Tonight"", but it has some great songs on it.  The title track is an all time classic and still gets played on classic rock radio to this day.  ""The House Is Rockin"" is a great rocker.  ""Gonna Raise Hell"" is a track that is cool, but features a rather dated disco beat to it.  ""Voices"" was the other hit from the album and was a rather nice ballad.  The album closer ""Need Your Love"" was a 7 minute plus tour de force that features some killer guitar work from Rick Neilson.  This track almost sounds like something UFO might have recorded.  The rest of the album is just ok.  Cheap Trick were at the peak of their popularity at this time in their career and ""Dream Police"" is a great portrait of where the band was at during this time period."
1,"The rule of thumb would be that if you remember that Donovan's last name was Leitch then you probably are a big enough fan to appreciate &quot;Gift From a Flower to a Garden,&quot; which was the first two-LP box set to appear in the rock 'n' roll section rather than the classical at your local record store.  Of course now this collection of flower power music appears on a single CD.  Donovan was saddled with the responsibility of being Britain's answer to Bob Dylan, which was an unfair standard, but his music holds up, especially when you realize they are such opposites.  Dylan is American folk music gone poetic in search of dark introspection while Donovan was optimistic psychedelic mysticism (Were the Beach Boys America's answer to the Beatles? Just wond'rin' aloud).  &quot;Gift From a Flower to a Garden&quot; comes across like two different Donovan albums recorded at the same time.  One is psychedelic of the electric guitar outer space variety and the other is a return to folk and blues played on an acoustic guitar.  In terms of songwriter Donovan shows a lot more variety here than you find on his other albums, and the nice thing is that there is minimal overlap between this double-album and Donovan's Greatest Hits collection (&quot;Wear Your Love Like Heaven&quot;).  The second half of the collection, with &quot;Isle of Islay&quot;, &quot;Widow with a Shawl&quot;, and &quot;Lullaby of the Spring&quot;, is better than the first half (or at least more to my taste)."
1,"Umm... What shall I say 'bout this one? It's pretty easy, if you like westcoast rap you gon' love this one! E-40's best all around and probarly one of Bay Area's finest, up there together with Mac Mall's Illegal Business?.E-40 never dissapoints me and after dropping so many albums, he still hasn't got the props he deserves.The whole Bay Area is painfully underated.Mac Mall, Spice 1, E-40 and his Sick-Wid-It records click and Ray Luv, these are my favorites outta Bay Area.Buy anything by them and show love, 'cause it basically don't get pretty much better than this type of Westcoast rap.One word for this record : Classic.I don't even have to mention highlights 'cause they're all great, but my favorite probarly is Dusten 'N' Disgusted featuring 2Pac, Spice 1 and Mac Mall.Get this one, it will make you money worth, no doubt."
1,"This is their worst album, I think Lifeforms is much better."
1,"Okay, this album is not quite like Napoleon XIV's 1966 one hit wonder. The good news: it is SO much better. A stellar group of musicians, and actor legend Richard Burton narrating this remarkable double album makes the Martian invasion of earth so realistic, you really do feel the Martians may be coming for you next!! I initally purchased this double LP  years ago only because Moody Blues frontman Justin Hayward had a large part in this project, and his guitar work is immediately recognizable throughout this double album, along with his soaring vocals on two songs.  But ALL parties involved here make this work a true classic.  This is an incredible recording from 1978 that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat time and time again. My thanks to Jeff Wayne for spearheading this wonderful project!!!!"
1,"I really, really, really want to give this effort 5 stars. But there is just a bit too much filler going on inside of this to put it that high. In truth this about 3.5 stars. It does contain 5 star material though. I can't believe the song &quot;Send It&quot; doesn't get more nods here! One of my fave songs, talk about your hooks! My God Jeff (hehe, literally)! The send off song Heaven Only Knows is great, Calling America likewise, however there are exactly 4 songs here that I consider fluff and for a 10 song cd that doesn't bode well.It was clear to all that ELO was losing steam and Jeff was losing interest, however having said that, if you program your cd player just right and play all the great tunes hear, you'd never notice. I think this cd is marginally better than his &quot;new last&quot; cd Zoom which is in about the same boat, same great taste, but just as much (if not more) filler."
1,"To actually access the music of Nick Drake, you have to get past a lot of baggage: the biographical legend; the twee aesthetic, aptly signified by the blandly psychedelic cover, fey title and spelling; the voice, an adolescent-whisper-falsetto type thing when it's not trying to be Bob Dylan.  Once you do get past all that, the album is a vaguely pleasant, if indistinguishable, wash of folk pop, with unexpected instruments - cello, piano, harpsichord, sax etc. - keeping things interesting (some of the songs sound like an earnest Divine Comedy).  There is one stand-out track, however, 'Poor Boy', part-Jobim samba, part-Legrand French cafe pop, part-Stones gospel.  Its pop melancholy suggests where Drake's true talents lay."
1,"FRESH!  FOR 1988, you SUCKERS!!!How many people can forget that line?  If you don't know it, you don't have the album!  So what are you waiting for?  Buy it!Best Tracks:  &quot;My Philosophy&quot;, &quot;I'm Still  #1&quot;, &quot;Illegal Business&quot;; and the most HARD ROCKING track  is:&quot;YA SLIPPIN&quot;, which hijacks Deep Purple's &quot;Smoke on  the Water&quot; guitar riff and turns it into a hardcore hip-hop battle  rampage.Krs does a nod to spoken word poetry at the end, a first for rap  albums...&quot;See how it sounds, a little un-rational, a lot of MC's  like to use the word 'dramatical'&quot;. CLASSIC MATERIAL, AN YA KNOW  IT!!!!!!!!"
1,"I have owned every Jay-Z cd besides this one and ""Reasonable Doubt"" and I wanted to know what all the hype was about so I went backwards and bought this cd.  I see Jay-Z was as much a character than as his now. But what I really appreciate that he did THEN that he doesn't do NOW is tell a story.  Biggie, Slick Rick, and sometimes Nas are good for telling a story, but I never thought Jay-Z did that.  In this album, he did it repeatedly. His lyrical game was tight, charisma polished, and less braggadocio (&lt;&lt;gotta love that. Braggers bug me after the first thirty-seconds). He seems more interested in writing about significant topics then, the beats are nice (even though some are a lil' old school--nothin' wrong with that), and the ""Thank You's"" were hilarious."
1,"Every year around Christmastime, the Wham song, ""Last Christmas,"" has survived and thrived. Okay, Wham! was a mediocre duo with George Michael who used it as a launching pad for his own musical career. Duos like Wham! were quite common back in the day. I liked the tape at first and was thrilled later to get the compact disc version.Remember, most tapes and albums or records back in the 1980s had about 10 songs or 12 at the most. Unlike today where compact discs can have up to twenty songs, this album is memorable for the soft ballads and love songs. You don't have to be a Wham! or George Michael fan to enjoy it. The compact disc takes me back to another time where the music was softer and the worries were lighter in my life."
1,"Carole King was one of those singer-songwriters who provided the musical backdrop for the exploration of alternative ways of looking at, exploring, and experiencing the world around us. Her many popular anthems described her feelings, existential angst, and sentimental deliberations about life, love and the battles between the sexes in very approachable and appealing ways. Both the melodies and the lyrics are topical, memorable, and quite up beat, although she is certainly capable of delivering some thought-provoking and plaintive songs, such as an existential wail over the problems with maintaining a long- distance relationship in songs like &quot;So Far Away&quot;.Yet Carole always keeps the tunes within the pop realm, and packages them in a seamless production with great vocals and impeccable musical arrangements. Her studio players included everyone from James Taylor to Eric Clapton, and what is included in this classic album is a treasure for the ages. From ""Tapestry"" to ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"", from ""(You Make Me Feel) Like A Natural Woman"" to """"You've Got A Friend"", and from ""Home Again"" to ""It's Too Late"", the entire album resonates with her unique gift for terrific lyrics showcasing unforgettable melodies. It's all here, folks, a wonderful album that was one of the best pop albums emerging from the unbelievable sixties. Enjoy!"
1,"Of course this is one of the very all time greats, and the Universal double CD deluxe edition of some years ago had a very good remastering job. But as usual, Mobile Fidelity has produced an amazing remaster that has a true analog sound with superb warmth and incredible detail at the same time. A rich, vivid tonality and not even a hint of digititis are the hallmarks of the MFSL sound, and of couse, they only remaster direct from the original analog master tape (unlike the dubious sources of other ""huffy"" celebrity wannabee engineers) - and it shows.Worth every penny. Just get it. It can never sound better."
1,"The worst of the Moody Blues catalogue is better than anything most other bands ever get to make. While this isn't their absolute best, it is indeed a fine album. It only suffers by comparison to their best & from anybody else would be considered a masterpiece.  I personally like this album better than either Favour or Sojurn from the ""Core 7"". This is, in my opinion, the best of the post Octave recordings & a worthy addition to your collection. While this is the best sounding CD available, if you can find it & want the best sounding version I would suggest the German or Japan vinyl pressing."
1,"More pop than Elton's early seventies albums and more consistent than just about anything in his catalog apart from the classicGoodbye Yellow Brick Road. Although Elton had veered into some serious confection territory since ""Crocodile Rock"", ""I've Seen The Saucers"" is a solid FM rock type song that would be on my shortlist of Elton favorites. Does it even need saying that ""Caribou"" includes the studio version of Elton's #2 hit, ""Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me""? Pity thatthe box setsubstitutes an inferior live version. This is the one to own.Other tasty album cuts include the warm ""Pinky"" and the rocking ""Grimsby"" which was a highlight of Elton's 1974 tour in support of this album. A couple of the songs haven't worn as well, ""You're So Static"" and the playful ""Solar Prestige A Gammon"", but given the strength of this collection that's a minor quibble. I used to be an ardent fan in the mid-seventies, owning the complete Elton John from 1969 through about 1975 but of those albums, this is one of only three or four that I've replaced with a CD copy. Recommended even if you already own an Elton John ""best of"" compilation."
1,"There are three words I can say after listening to this album all the way through: wow, WoW and WOW!!!  I must admit, I originally thought ABBA was one or two hit wonder because all I've ever heard from them was the ever-popular ""Dancing Queen.""  (However after listening to it I found myself asking ""They sang that?!  I had no idea!"")  I enjoyed ""Dancing Queen"" enough that my sister bought this wonderful album for me as a Christmas present. At first I was a little hesistant to listen to the other tracks but I decided to do so anyway.  And boy, was I impressed!!  This is one of the few, exclusive albums that I can listen to all the way through.  It's just *that* good.Even in the 2000's ABBA's legacy lives on.  Their music can be tolerated even in today's pop music world.  Take the group A*teens for example.  Isn't it great that you hear children singing songs such as ""Take A Chance On Me"" and ""Mama Mia""?  Yeah maybe they aren't the best singers but the fact remains: ABBA still get recognized even today, decades later.  Currently, the Broadway musical ""Mama, Mia!"" is a hit.  With a musical based on ABBA's greatest hits, why wouldn't it be?  ""Mama Mia!"" was written by Benny and Bjork (The two male singers/songwriters of ABBA) as well as the often produced musical, ""Chess.""My favorite songs on the album are as follows:""Take A Chance On Me"", ""Super Trouper"", ""Chiquitita"", ""Voulez Vous"", ""Does Your Mother Know"", ""One Of Us"", ""The Name of the Game"" and ""Thank You For The Music.""Don't worry, there are more songs on the album then this, all of great merit.  I had a hard time myself thinking up which ones were my absolute favorites, and in time they may change as well.  All of the songs on this album are up-beat and make you just feel happy inside.  The rhythm just makes ya wanna get up and dance (Especially ""Dancing Queen"").  Yeah, some maybe a little 70's like (""Lay All Your Love On Me"") but the fact still remains: ABBA is here to stay!! Reccomended to *anyone*...even if only hearing their song ""Dancing Queen."""
1,"With his impossibly high pop tenor voice, Art Garfunkel found his best solo material ever on this collection of gorgeously arranged pop songs.  Stevie Wonder's I BELIEVE... is simply jaw-dropping; THE WATERS OF MARCH has a kicky, memorable poetic lilt; MY LITTLE TOWN still stands the test of time as Simon and Garfunkel's cryptically brilliant &quot;comeback&quot; duet.  There is no clunker on this album, and it is arranged with an orchestral feel that sounds instantly classic.  With melodies like these, and with an angelic voice like Art's to steer the course, it is no wonder this album has remained one of my all-time favorites from the 70s through today."
1,"This is my favorite Ohio Players LP, mainly because it's 7 terrific songs, great writing, terrific playing and some of the lovliest, quirkiest vocals ever put on wax. The title track opens the album and sports one of the prettiest melodies these gents have ever come up with. This doo-wop flavored ballad sets a calming, soothing mood that permeates almost every track with the exception of the heavy-rock/funk track &quot;Fopp&quot; (ever wonder where Guns 'n' Roses copped the riff for &quot;Paradise City&quot;? here's your answer!) and the number 1 hit &quot;Love Rollercoaster&quot;. The centerpiece of the album is the masterpiece &quot;Sweet Sticky Thing&quot; which is not only one of the longest tracks here, but is of special note because the band displays an overt jazz sound from the sax playing that colors the choruses, to the astounding drumming of Jimmy &quot;Diamond&quot; Williams (notice his great footwork and his cymbal rolls and crashes that close the song), this track alone makes the LP worth owning.  The closing ballad &quot;Alone&quot; is another stunner. Featuring just Sugarfoot on guitar, a rising and falling synth in the background and Sugarfoot's plaintive voice singing lyrics of loneliness and desperation ('I don't wanna be alone anymore', someone pick me up off the floor'), &quot;Alone&quot; ends this classic album on a melancholy but hopeful note for us hopeless romantics! Surprisingly, &quot;Honey&quot; never sounds dated and in fact, it's influence can be heard in the music of artists from the last 2 decades in music (both soul and rock, case in point: Red Hot Chili Peppers cover of &quot;Rollercoaster...&quot; in 1996.) A winning album that has stood the rest of time."
1,"In 1994, the R&B; market was cluttered with girl groups in the likes of SWV, Xscape, TLC, En Vogue, Zhane, and Jade. Despite stiff competition, Changing Faces, a duo of New York songstresses, attained commerical success with their self-titled debut. This was due mainly to the superb lead single ""Stroke U Up"" (platinum single sales) and the follow-up ""Foolin' Around"", each produced by R. Kelly. In addition, both singers were capable vocalists, as displayed by interchangeable lead throughout the set.Not only were the singles well-crafted, but the rest of the album held it own as well. Other highlights include: ""Keep It Right There"" (remix featured on White's Man Burden), ""Come Closer"" (smooth production and smoky vocals), ""Baby Your Love"" (midtempo treat/2nd favorite track), ""Good Thing"" (late-night sleeper) and ""All Is Not Gone"" (syrupy ballad/favorite track).In sum, Changing Faces turned out an excellent record in the midst of the cluttered girl group market. Even though their debut was commercially successful, better records would later turn up for Changing Faces, namely their 3rd set, despite not acheiving the accompanying sales. However, this record is still very good. It has aged well, and continues to get spins from me and radio. A good-buy for the avid R&B; follower.Grade: B+"
0,"When ""Here I Go Again"" comes on the radio, i always end up listening for a few moments just because I am baffled about how bad some songwriting can be.  Its hilarious that when you hear a line, you can predict the next one.  I dont think Coverdale means anything he sings...he just picked the words cuz it sounds good...to him anyway.In the Still of the Night is no better.  The music sounds as if they intended it to be some brooding rock anthem.  Its like they were trying to create some type of mystery and suspense building towards  some rock zenith ...but when you hear the lyrics....all they are saying is ""Im horny...gimme some"".  Hey, Im not opposed to songs about sex, but give me a break, dont pretend like you're telling me something brilliant.All in all, Whitesnake is exactly what Spinal Tap was making fun of.  I bet Whitesnake didnt even get the joke."
1,"Although this album was released all the way back in 1995, I just got my first taste of it. I have always known about Wu Tang Clan but I never got a chance to hear much from them because they are not as mainstream and commercial. After listening to GZA's Liquid Sword I was quite amazed. Why does someone who has such story telling and comparison lyrical skills is not on the radio and flowing in the mainstream and appearing on TRL and BET. I have not heard such great skills since back in the Biggie and 2Pac days. GZA has solid skills with great back up guest appearances from other Wu Tang members. (method man, RZA) The production of RZA was solid, and it somewhat tries to tell the story of Liquid Swords before songs. Some of the beats reminds me of the themes from the old martial art movies. Eventhough this album might not sound really appealing the first time, but every time you listen to it, you will hear something you missed the last time and be impressed by the kinda skill he displayed. Such artists like this are rarely found in the mainstream today. GZA is truly a genious with rhymes and brought the best out of the other guest appearances. This CD is definitely worth your money, it has depth although it talks streets and guns. The creativity in this album is far above many rappers even in the game today.Lyrics: A+Production: ADelivery: A+Overall: A+"
1,"It's Sonny Rollins trio. Can somebody play better in late 50's ? And perfect production too. Like band's playing in my living room. I love similar productions, it's the best in jazz. Only two songs are composed by Rollins, but no problem in his music is essantial his solo playing. No highlights, whole album is perfect with beautiful resourceful playing. Must for any true jazz fan."
1,"PErhaps i was wrong! Maybe BAd is the Best album Of all time selling a record 30 million records around the world it is the second most selling album in the world cause well its just BAD! and this is why....BAd - Title Song  Great Video!

My advice for this C.D is BUY IT. you don't know music if you never heard this album!"
1,"Michael Jackson is definitely one of the most powerful (and controversial) figures in popular music. Aside from the alleged sex abuse scandals, plastic surgery and countless other stories about him, he's made some of the most enduring music to be heard. _Thriller_ and _Bad_ are certified classic albums released during the 1980s. Entering the 1990s, he makes an updated, funky, catchy and addictive album with loads of dance grooves - without losing any of the passion he always injects into his music. However, with the updated production, it still sounds like Michael Jackson...with all those hypnotic vocal nooks and crannies found lurking in many of the tracks, period!Songs like ""Jam,"" ""Why You Wanna Trip On Me"" and ""Can't Let Her Get Away"" are so funky and downright exciting and energetic, they should get many lovers of energetic dance grooves jumping. Sex-tinged numbers like ""In The Closet"" and ""She Drives Me Wild"" show off Michael's latent sexual interests. There's also diversity to be found (Michael always possessed a certain diversity.) Slower, poignant numbers like ""Heal The World"" and ""Will You Be There"" are almost certain to tug at your emotions. The former is mainly a ""wordly"" pop anthem with it's earthy, mellow melody. All this changes when the choir comes in near the end of the song and a pattern of two semitones are increased from the standard, backing keys twice during the song. The vocal/choiral crescendos send shivers down my body. The latter track some will recognize from the movie ""Free Willy."" Like the former track, it mostly begins softly featuring Michael's plaintive vocals, exotic percussion and the hushed vocals of a choir. Later, you know it'll progress to an emotional high, as Michael goes through this passionate and almost crying vocal performance, backed by the heavenly choir in full-effect by now. Both these tracks nearly send me to tears.I've always admired Michael Jackson and the music he's made, even with all the scandals, rumors and other stories that have bogged the airwaves. Let's hope he continues to make music for another 30 years or so."
1,"Trinidad born British singer Billy Ocean (Leslie Sebastian Charles) rose to fame in the 80's where he had hit after hit on both sides of the atlantic with either happy pop songs or tearjerking ballads. Billy Ocean more then anyone is a perfect symbol of the 80's with his music that is typical for that era and even if it's a bit dated by now he still recorded some of the most memorable songs of the 80's. However, it all started in 1976 when he recorded his first album, an eponymous album that spawned the hit single ""Love Really Hurts Without You"" that peaked at #2 in the UK and #22 in the US. Few people would know that 8 years later he would be at #1 in both countries with his ""Caribbean Queen"" and also become one of the most successful caribbean singers of all time. Let's take a look at the songs.It should've started with ""Love Really Hurts Without You"" his first hit which is quite typical for the late 70's. A happy uptempo Pop-R&B; song with piano and disco vibes and Ocean's usual deep but happy voice. i don't know why it isn't on this version, cause I have the same at home with it included.Next song is ""When The Going Gets Tough, The Tough Gets Going"" which was the soundtrack to Michael Douglas/Danny De Vito's film ""The Jewel of the Nile"" and on the video we had the two of them dancing to it. It's another happy uptempo and one of my all time favorite songs that always make me smile. It peaked at #1 in the UK and #2 in the US.""Licence To Chill"" is very simular to ""When The Going"" actually with a happy beat and backround singers + a closure with saxophone and it became his last hit in 1989, proving to be a typical 80's artist.""Caribbean Queen"" from 1984, was Ocean's Biggest hit, a song dedicated to all the beautiful women from Jamaica, Cuba, Bahamas, Haiti, Dominican Repubic, Puerto Rico and Trinidad & Tobago. The song is a midtempo that actually uses the saxophone aswell. The song was also called European or African queen based on where it was released, but I prefered the Caribbean.""There'll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry) was another massive hit peaking at #1 in the US. This however, was one of his slowest most romantic songs. 80's classic for sure.""Loverboy"" is a pop/rock song in fast pace from Ocean's succesfulSuddenlyalbum. Simply put, another strong and memorable Ocean trademark.""Suddenly"" is a ballad and another big hit from 1984 but apart from most other of his songs this one ain't too remarkable or typical for him, it's just a decent ballad.""Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car"" sound a little like ""When The Going"" and it was also soundtrack to a popular film, The Roger Rabbitt film that is. It became one of his biggest and last hits in 1988.""Love Zone"" a power-ballad with some good percussion and another memorable hook. It became a top 10 in 1986.""Here's To You"" was never a single and is a quite forgettable ballad. I think it was first released for this complilation. Maybe they needed more songs?.""I Sleep Much Better (In Someone Else's Bed) a trademark midtempo with some backround singers and happy vibe. Released in 1990 it failed to chart.""The Colour Of Love"" another late ballad hit, eventhough it's very sweet song it didn't become as big as the singles he released in the mid 80's.""Tear Down These Walls"", is a decent uptempo but sounds alot like previous songs aswell. It was released very late and never became a hit.""Mystery Lady"" the last single from the ""Suddenly"" album is good aswell, a midtempo that may not be as famous as the others but is a nice addition to this complilation.Overall, although this compilation is old it is the best one with most of his hits included. I'm bewildered though that ""Love Really Hurts Without You"" isn't included since it was his first song and also the ballad ""Love is Forever"" that was a minor hit eventhough it wasn't too hot. Other then that, everything else is found here. I would have liked to see the songs in chronological order aswell, here there is no order at all. However, the compilation is strong and if you're curious to find out more about Billy Ocean here's a perfect way to start rather then to buy his albums. A good purchase!."
1,"If you are new to The Ohio Players, you are in for a treat!!! There is no better way to start your collection of Ohio Players albums/cds. ""Honey"" was/is the ultimate Ohio Players effort. ""Love Rollercoaster"" got the most play time on the radio, but ""Sweet Sticky Thing"" blows it out of the water. My opinion is very bias, I'd have to admit, but if you give it a listen you may feel the same way as well. ""Sweet Sticky Thing"" would play well on smooth jazz radio stations. The title track ""Honey"" is basic Ohio Players. It setes the tone for the rest of the album just as an opening track should. This missed on a lot of today's music. ""Fopp"" is the brake from the norm. Sugarfoot, the frontman for the Players gives you why he should never be excluded from any talk of who is the best guitarist. Jimi Hendriks would have been proud. The Players showed that they can do rock with anybody. These are just three of the tracks on this album. The album as a whole is well worth the money. I'm old school, for real. Take my word for it, ""Get this album!!!"
1,"For the longest time I had the Do Well cassette blasting in my car. This was basically a 20 minute mash up of the wonderful track Jewel from the album under review here. Jewel was one of the best tracks I heard in the '80s, and I couldn't get enough of it - in all its forms. That wonderful chorus and Claudia's enticing vocals. But that song is just one highlight of Secret Wish. There are the great techno beats of The Murder Of Love and p-Machinery, the lovely melody of The Chase, and does anything compare with the 8 plus minutes of ecstatic electropop that is Dream Within A Dream? I have had the cassette version, the original cd version, the remixed version (Wishful Thinking), the Do Well EP, and now this great remastered release, and it still finds frequent time on my player. It's The Human League meets Amon Duul II, with some Alan Parsons thrown in. No, it's like nothing you ever heard before at the time. A classic."
1,"For me THE GEORGE BENSON GUITAR ALBUM.  Powerful supple guitar lines. George shows his chops on this one.  Playing with a very fat tone, George improvises inventively in every piece, Jack De Johnette, Ron Carter, Harold  Mabern, Mobutu and a very very young Earl Klugh rounds out the line up  along with a horn section.  The title track and &quot;Top of the  World&quot; are the best pieces on this album.  On &quot;Top of the  World&quot; George really shows his strong jazz sensibilities. Supple  liquid guitar lines darting in and out and around Pee Ellis' arrangement.  It rolls, floats  This along with &quot;Beyond the Blue Horizon&quot; are  must-haves."
1,"This CD is a great collection of Olivia's greatest hits. Although it is far from complete, and doesn't include some of her live favorites (such as &quot;Don't Cry for Me, Argentina&quot;), it still encapsules some of her finest moments, from the early country/pop to the later straight-forward rock/pop that made her a star."
1,"I read some review where people said it was rushed. Tupac wrote these songs before he died. These songs were never altered, sold, poluted, or reprised by any other producer/artist. Eminem never got a chance to add his voice or 50 cent's to a song or album. I believed it was somewhat of a cry from the grave, or in a sense final words to poets and fans alike, who could benifet from his wisdom. This album is not be appreciated for its abilty to entertain a club or crowd. And not all rap albums arent supposed to. I believe this album to be the true voice of Tupac after his grave. It is familier of his ""Me Against the World"" album. I urger anyone who is looking for a cd to bump in their car, play at a party or while cleaning their house TO NOT BUY THUS ALBUM, But anyone who wants to know what Tupacs real future for his music to do so! Please lets not poision his legacy lets uphold it."
1,"John Denver was born Henry John Deutschendorf, Jr. He is remembered as one of the great American musicians and song-writers, and a leading humanitarian and environmentalist. This album first came out in 1975, and contains some of John's greatest songs - including Windsong, Spirit, I'm Sorry, and Calypso.Overall, I found this to be a great album, so pleasant to listen to on long car trips. During my recent trip to St. Louis, Missouri, this album became the soundtrack of my voyage (especially the trip home). I love this album, and highly recommend it to everyone."
1,"At their peak, TOTO took a left turn.This album is often put up from TOTO fans as a personal favourite; for others, it's the beginning of the end.The reason for all of this polarisation is that it's essentially a turn toward a new 'sound' for the band which carries them into the next 3 albums and away from MOR pop confections like 'Rosanna' and 'Africa' which showered them with Grammies in 1982.'ISOLATION' takes Toto fans both back to the hard rocking roots of ""Hold the Line"" while embracing their newfound status as studio musician Gods. Put simply, the tunes are reasonably straight ahead, hard rocking compositions with bland themes concerning love, girls, relationship angst which are then dressed up with all manner of studio wizardry, experimentation and finger bending arrangements. When it comes to playing, these guys have to hold back from just plain showing off. Each member of TOTO's has the studio fingers of three other players and when they let it fly, they have no peer.The most interesting tunes venture into more obscure themes. 'Stranger in Town' is based on a true story from an English newspaper and it has the nice underplayed verse/exploding chorus structure that worked so well for 'Africa'. Paich's voice is limited but always so strangely welcome - he sounds like an old friend. 'Lion' cuts a great groove and has amazing keyboard playing. 'Mr Friendly' is quite inventive in it's structure and I find it very infectious - a great one to crank your amp up to it's limitations. All of these tracks would've been very at home on TOTO IV as would have been 'Holyanna', a neat and melodic '4 to the bar' closing tune for the album. 'How does it feel?' is a fine contributor to the library of tuneful Lukather power ballads. It's almost as good as 'I won't hold you back' on the previous album but doesn't quite hit classic status.The rest of the album is for those who like to rock hard - 'Endless', 'Isolation', 'Change of Heart', 'Angel don't cry'. They're all top notch eighties clean 'hard rock'. To my ear, they are a bit sterile and this was borne out for me in seeing the recent TOTO world tour. Those of you who think Fergie was the man for this album and can't imagine Bobby Kimball doing the 'Isolation' songs justice should see him belting out 'Endless' and 'Isolation' on the current tour. He SLAYS them and infuses a soul into them that would've been amazing to capture on this album. In fact I would love to hear this album totally re-recorded with Kimball on lead vocals.There's a lot to enjoy on this LP, and once or twice a year I take it for a spin and groove along. If you love TOTO because you like to hear the world's best musicians do what they do best, this could be your favourite in their catalogue."
1,this band could do so many styles quite well i might add.they have no-limits in there music.i couldn't wait to get this.fencewalk is a classic that jam you can bop your head for days to.just a richly balanced  group.like so many other groups of the 70's they could blend many styles  but like them they had there own idenity.
1,"I can see who I would be had I grown up in the '70s rather than the '90s.  An' I would be, um, well, pretty much the same.  But I woulda been bumpin' this album like crazzaay; the ultimate sweaty, hard-drivin', steady-groovin' funk masterpiece.  To me personally, P-Funk is a never-fully-appreciated piece of modern American music an' the Doctor an' his crew shoulda gotten more love an' respect in they day.  When hip-hop music came along an' started samplin' every piece'a music they put to tape, P-FUNK started gettin' reevaluated an' I guess re-appreciated by the ones who grew up on it.  But it needa get the same from today's generation an' they needa see that while they grew up with Dr. Dre an' Snoop Dogg, an entire HALF'a that musical team is based in this music ri'chere.Anyways, enough'a my amateurish an' uneducated evaluation of the unfair course of black music from the '70s through today.  This is jus' some blazin' HOT music.  Everything stays on track from the get-go; the classic 'Gamin' On Ya', the baddest, funkiest joint 'Gettin' to Know You' which has one'a the slickest horn an' piano solos on the album, an' who could forget them chicken-scratch guitar riffin' an' sing-along vocals on 'Everything is on the One'.  But mos' are definitely right when they point out that you could buy this for 'I've Been Watching You (Move Your Sexy Body)' ALONE an' be satisfied.  This is fa'real jus' some drowsy an' sensuous sloooowed-down funk for dat ayyess an' has prob'ly the catchiest melody on the whole album.  Can't nobody dispute what a classic it is.'Funkin' for Fun' closes the album an' NOTHING coulda summed it up better.  George an' dem was TRULY ahead'a their time, an' if you hear this with a negative ear, then you obviously don' understand an', um, well, you're jus' no fun I guess.  E'ybody in black music was influenced by them, an' it jus' goes to show they wasn't jus' clonin' to expand they band.  The Mothership done cloned a whole generation who're now doin' they own clonin'.  Course ya'know that ol' sayin: If you make a copy of a copy, then is' not nearly as sharp as the original.  If I was talkin' 'bout any other artist or CD this review would make no sense, but since I'm talkin' to P-FUNK fans, I know y'all feel me.  Drown yourself an' have fun."
1,"What a treat this disc is.  I knew Chet Atkins as a kid because my father played many of his records.  Some I felt were outstanding, others I could pass on.  Regardless, you have to admit that Chet was an excellent and entertaining guitarist.  Mark Knopfler has been a favorite of mine since the first Dire Straits album on through all of his solo work.  His unique tone and approach to rock, pop, jazz and country blues guitar is distinctive and to me is about as good as it gets.Combining these two distinct yet complimentary guitar voices was very synergistic.  Students of these masters should not have much trouble picking out who is playing what.  The sound quality is excellent with very good imaging and ambience.  If you like either of these guys, I think you'll like this disc."
1,"James BrownLive At The Apollo (1962-Expanded Edition CD)Recording a live show in a theatre like The Apollo in 1962 was no small feat.  The effort put into making this recording paid off in giving the world one of the greatest live albums ever made.  The mastering done for this expanded CD makes the experience even better.The concert begins powerfully with ""I'll go crazy"" and maintains that power all the way through to its ""Night Train"" ending.  Even in 1962, James Brown was known as `the hardest working man in show business', but the release of this album made him the undeniable `King of Soul'.The four Bonus tracks on this CD consist of three singles released in that period plus another short Medley.  These repeat songs already in the original live album and are, nevertheless, nice additions to the CD.This CD is beyond classic, it is an essential recording to own.  This deserves a SIXTH Star."
1,"I can't name one band to compare Primus to, either in terms of sound or talent. Indeed, I think Primus, together, make up one of the most talented groups ever. Les Claypool is my favorite bassist, and just one listen and you will know why. He creates amazingly hard basslines and seems to play them with ease. He often plays his instrument like it were a lead guitar. The only bassist I can compare him to is Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers, but I think Les might even have him beat. Tim, the drummer, is probably one of the better drummers out there, making great beats to accompany Les's crazy bass playing. He uses a double pedal, but not like most; instead of rapid fire pounding on the pedal like most, he'll put it to a more rhythmatic use. Larry aka Ler isn't the best guitarist in the world but he's still super talented, and he is, however, probably one of the most unique guitarists. In most rock bands, the guitars usually play the same thing as the bass and overpower them, but instead, Ler will let Les and Tim groove while he's playing an oddball riff in the background or just playing a constant solo I'd be hard-pressed to remember. Together, they make up Primus. And this is one of the finest efforts.As I said earlier, NO ONE sounds like Primus, so to a listener who doesn't play an instrument, it will probably just be too weird to stand. And indeed it is quite bizarre, but it's also amazing. But I'll say it again: if you don't play an instrument, you should probably stay clear of Primus. You won't enjoy them very much.However, if you do play an insturment, jusg beginning or professional, and you've never heard Primus, you're in for a treat. Primus has some of the best arrangements, solos (on bass and guitar), double bass drumming, and great socially conscience yet humor filled lyrics I've ever heard. ""Here Come the Bastards"" starts with a catchy bass riff and then goes into a slow-paced jam with the whole band. ""Sgt. Baker"" will immediately grab your attention once it kicks in. The catchy chord-filled bass line and strong lyrics of ""American Life"" will surely entertain an inspiring bassist. ""Jerry Was a Race Car Driver"" is probably the most ascessible on the album and it's also one of the best. But the truly amazing track on this album is the funky ""Tommy the Cat"" which tales the tale of a flirtatious alley cat told through the voices of Les Claypool and Tom Waits. The guitar solo is crazy, but the 8 second bass solo is insane. Les combines every technique I know of into that small time to make a jaw-dropping break in the tune. ""Those Damned Blue Collared Tweakers"" is another catchy one with a great riff. These are only the highlights.So if you're looking for a super talented band, definetly consider Primus. Les Claypool is simply unbelievable and Ler and Tim deliver as well. Primus sucks (that means they rock)!"
1,"I've just checked out Rollins' bio on the frequently consulted ""All Music Guide"" (AMG), which in the very first sentence bluntly praises him as the greatest if all modern saxophonists.  Granted, Sonny belongs in that special group of seminal giants--Hawk, Ben, and Prez and then come Stan, Stitt, Rollins, and a fellow by the name of Coltrane.  Moreover, attentive listeners will discover equally impressive, gifted, expressive tenor players if they listen carefully to scandalously neglected musicians like Harold Land and Hank Mobley.But age, apparently, has its privileges, and Sonny has been making records for 62 years, which in itself deserves some kind of special mention (though so has James Moody, and certainly Jimmy Heath isn't far behind).  Moreover, ""Colossus,"" which Amazon currently lists as its best-selling Rollins' date, was recorded in 1956, rather early for a player venerated for his ""seminal"" influence on the music.Sonny's sound, at least to my ears, changed dramatically around 1970.  Apparently a number of listeners prefer his earlier, darker, deeper, more muscular sound--at least based on the durability of his most revered sessions--most of them from the '50s.  ""Newk's Time,"" ""Way Out West,"" ""Freedom Now Suite,"" ""Vol. 2,"" ""Tenor Madness,"" ""The Bridge""--these are the early Rollin' sessions that stand out, more so than the later ones, which featured a tenor sound that was more treblish, penetrating, rough and ragged (Sonny deserves credit for keeping his chops in shape, far more than other tenor greats).""Saxophone Colossus"" may be the ideal place to start, a second stop might be ""Tenor Madness"" (the sound of Coltrane should expain, in part, Rollins' decision to take a 3-year sabbatical from the music), and then it may be time for some of the numerous trio recordings (which require a more devoted student of the tenor, someone not requiring the moderating sound of a piano).""St. Thomas"" remains Rollins' best-known composition, and ""Blue 7"" one of the best examples of his ""motivic"" approach to improvisation.  And it should not go unnoticed that the pianist on ""Colossus""--Tommy Flanagan--was also the pianist on Coltrane's arguably most influential recording: ""Giant Steps.""  Finally, Sonny (or few other musicians) never had a better bass player than Doug Watkins.  Put all this together, and the result is an indispensable album.[Compare the tempo at the conclusion of ""St. Thomas"" to the tempo at the beginning.  Whenever musicians point an accusing finger at me for ""rushing,"" I quickly point out that it's not unprecedented--even by one of the greatest rhythm sections every assembled (the drummer, incidentally, is Max Roach).]"
1,"""Get Your Wings"" was Aerosmith's second album, easily a step up from their debut, and, for my money, superior to the ""Toys"" or ""Rocks"" that came after.  They weren't MTV fodder yet, they were still militantly ""on medication,"" and the contrariness that ground them to a halt in the early eighties (just as it did, ""that band they worked so hard to look like"") hadn't even started to take hold yet.  Prime stuff, folks:  even the obligatory top-40 song here, ""Train Kept A'Rolling,"" was superior to most anything else going down that vile year of 1974.  And OK, I'll be selfish, all MY favorite Aerosmith songs are represented here, ""Seasons Of Wither""...""Same Old Song And Dance""...""SOS &lt;Too Bad>""...especially ""Lord Of The Thighs"" and ""Pandora's Box.""  Again, Aerosmith would achieve their ""breakthru"" the next two albums after this - and, yeah, too, they would even go on, that decade, to do that atrocious ""Sgt Pepper"" movie with the Bee Gees & Billy Preston.  (But, hey, ""gotta eat,"" and all that) For my money, Aerosmith peaked right here, pre-MTV, pre-Nat'l Inq'r fodder, pre-""divorces,"" pre - before they became a walking caricture of themselves, post ""Permanant Vacation."""
1,"This landmark album from the 70's is one that my older sister owned and played endlessly, using seemingly to tap into an innermost emotional well that only teen-aged girls seem to possess. I just remember that I thought every single song was great and how personal ""Tapestry"" sounded to my young ears. Now, almost 40 years later, that weird jumble of teen hormones having long dissipated and my sister well into adulthood, I cam listen to Carole King with an experienced heart and mind, and it holds up as a classic from the era.""Tapestry"" was one of the first albums of the singer/songwriter era that held together as an entity, and now rings pure as a dozen songs that meld into a seamless whole. King had already honed her skills as an ace commercial songwriter with husband Gerry Goffin, and this was her coming out party. As such, the twelve songs on ""Tapestry"" run the gamut of the confessional ""It's Too Late"" to the committal ""You've Got a Friend"" to emancipation (""Natural Woman""). It's a testament to the staying power of ""Tapestry"" that half of this album became hits for Carole and others (especially James Taylor's classic version of ""Friend""), and the others are almost instantly recognizable.It was that identifiable quality that raised ""Tapestry"" and, by association, King as a solo artist. It also opened doors for the likes of Carly Simon, Joan Armatrading and Taylor."
1,"Coolio came out again in 1995 with the hit ""Gangsta's Paradise"" on the Dangerous Minds soundtrack.  He then released his second album taking the same name.  This album has some special meaning for me. It was only the second rap album I bought ever.  The album is a fun pop-mainstream-style album full of great production and beats, and some nice rhymes by Coolio.  Beatwise, the album is full of that Cali G-Funk courtesy of ""Wino,"" Vic C, and many lesser-known producers, way too many to list here.  ""Gangsta's Paradise"" is obviously a hit, but there are many other classics here too.  ""Is This Me"" is hella twangy feat. Rated R from Thug Life discussing the hold the streets take on people who get caught up in that life.  Coolio shows some love and respect for the women on ""For My Sistas.""  ""Sumpin' New"" is just a plain good time at the club over a bouncy P-Funk sampled type beat, as fun as ""Fantastic Voyage"" from 1994.  ""Get Up Get Down"" features longtime homie WC and homegirl Malika.  The beat is smooth and swingin. ""The Revolution"" is hot with a bouncy lowrider beat dealing with social issues. ""Bright As The Sun"" is a track where the imagery brings up a helicopter (ghetto bird) has its bright lights searching for him over a woozy, twangy beat.  I love ""Exercise Yo' Game"" with Coolio trading spits with Kam, E-40, and 40 Thevz, which has an oddball, but phat beat.  I love the hooter and licqor joint ""Kinda High Kinda Drunk"" with another odd but tight beat.  Coolio has some positive messages in many tracks.  He has fun, but he also can bring up some serious, often sad, imagery on tracks like ""Geto Highlites"" which is basically what it is, runs like a news report in parts of the songs.  The album brings back memories of growing up for me.  I see many hating on the album for being too pop, but I disagree, it is a nice album regardless."
1,"This is not only the first release with Violent J, 2 Dope and John Kichass rapping as ""Insane Clown Posse"", but this is the first ever release from arguably the most successful Horrorcore Rap label to date, Psychopathic Records.This, along with their previous ""Inner City Posse"" albums was without a doubt an experimental album, they had no clue what they wanted their style to be. In this album, they took on gangsta rap (Wizard Of The Hood), Horrorcore Rap (Guts On The Ceiling), Storytelling Rap (First Day Out) and even Political Rap (Taste). They attempted and succeeded very well amongst all styles. However, although this is an experimental album, they ended up to this date with a completely different style, so in each I.C.P. album, do not expect another like this one. This one is unique in that way.Aside from the lyricism, the production also stands out, courtesy of former Detroit producer Chuck Miller, the legendary Esham and Mike Clark. Even I.C.P. themselves are noted as producers. The track that stands out the most here productionwise is without doubt ""First Day Out"", mainly because of its originality and how well the flow from the rhymes fits it.Amazon has recently limited the maximum characters to 4000 words (I believe). So, I can't really give a track-by-track breakdown and tell you my thoughts behind each individual track. I can, however, throw out the tracklisting and my personal A to F rating.01. ""Intro"" N/A02. ""Carnival Of Carnage"" (A)03. ""The Juggla"" (A)04. ""First Day Out"" (A+) (my favorite)05. ""Red Neck Hoe"" (C-) (least favorite)06. ""Wizard Of The Hood"" (A+)07. ""Guts On The Ceiling"" (A)08. ""Is That You? (ft. Kid Rock)"" (B+)09. ""Night Of The Axe"" (A)10. ""Psychopathic"" (A+)11. ""Blackin' Your Eyes"" (B-)12. ""Never Had It Made"" (A+)13. ""Your Rebel Flag"" (B+)14. ""Ghetto Freak Show"" (C+)15. ""Taste (ft. Jump Steady, Capitol E., Nate The Mack & Esham)"" (A)All in all, I recommend this to all fans of old skool hip-hop. Don't fall into the whole ""I.C.P. is the worst group ever"" logic. Granted, I was skeptical upon purchasing this, but after popping this into the CD player, I instantly wanted more. Get this.Peace.~Raw Hide"
1,"This is one of the best CDs you could ever want and no library is complete without it. I bought this in 1975, the year it came out. It took over 30 years to find it again! It's only Justin Hayward & John Lodge, writing every song. It's still Moody Blues, but one of my favs! This should have had air play in the US. Well, one of them did, the best one &#34;I Dreamed Last Night.&#34; In MONO! Geez, anyway, the band was finally through with their sold out, nine month tour and wanted rest! Right, they couldn't stand it,So Justin & John did Blue Jays. Mike Pender did &#34;The Promise,&#34; very dark, yet absolutely fabulous. He ended up in MT Shasta seeking God. OCTAVE was the last album he did, but not every song. Ray Thomas did &#34;Mighty Oaks&#34; which is another must have! And Graham did one about boots. (did not like), plus Justin did a solo, &#34;Songwriter,&#34; and John did something about music. I can't recall and I can't find it, but WOW, it is fabulous too. It opened up with a pic of John laying down with his hand under his head, gorgeousss!!!!!!!!! Justin also did &#34;The View From the Hill.&#34; Awesome and so easy to listen too. I can put it on my CD playet along all the other contemporary Christian music and it fits write in. Oh yes, DECEMBER a Christain CD came out about 5 years ago & wow again! I mean you can't miss with any Moody Blues or their solos, just buy them!As for Blue Jays, it starts with This Morning, by Justin, then a duet of the two singing Remember Me (My Friend) ohhhh my.My Brother, Justin wonderful weave of music & lyrics. You, by John, just as strong. Nights, Winters, Years, Justin, great! John then does Saved By the Music, the most rocker and kick! &#34;I DREAMED LAST NIGHT,&#34; by Justin. The most beautiful, haunting song on the album! Followed by him doing Who Are You Now, wonderful. Back to John with Maybe, another dou on When You Wake Up and the final cut is Justin doing Blue Guitar!March 14,1975 bearing cataloge # THS 12 (US: TH 14) Blue Jays was available in record shops  & made it's entry into Britishalbum charts in 15 days In 18 wks it went to # 4. Justin wrote I Dreamed Last Night in an hour. Justin's Blue Guitar,  was released on a 45 (UK: TH 26 September 1975:US:6702) strange huh? It breached the Britiannia best seller on Oct 25 and shot to # 8 for 7 wks. Thus, that's why it ended up on Blue Jays.John Tracey wrote in London in 1987, &#34;Will our Blue Jays ever take to the wings again? Nobody can say, but wheather they do or not, this is a musical memento to please all lovers of melodic rock, and naturally an essential addition to the library of every Moodies devotees. That should account for a few millionoodies devotees.&#34;Well, I couldn't agree more."
1,"Secrets by Toni Braxton is her most beloved and best-selling album of her career. This album is pretty good but it's also a mixed bag as well. After a thousand listens to, Un-Break my Heart is just plain nauseating! You're Making Me High is probably her strongest single ever, love those naughty lyrics and pulsating beat. How Could An Angel Break My Heart is a beautiful ballad which was co-written by Braxton. The rest of the songs are pretty ordinary and jeez most of the time I can't understand what she is singing, she needs to enuicate her words. This album is a great flashback to the mid-90s but that's pretty much it."
1,"From beginning to end, these guys just baked it all the way.A masterclass of funk and soul and Jazz. 'Honky Tonk' was the first time I heard the J.B.'s and boy, it just swung me right into those jams. They are all here, 'Cross the Tracks,' 'Futureshock'(I used to listen to it when I tripped), 'Blessed Blackness,' 'Pass the Peas;' damn! Maceo, Fred, Bootsy, Clyde, It's too fonky in here, I gotta move!"
1,"How can one argue with Grace Jones wild and crazy style? She could handle rock, disco, r&amp;b and raggae. This release finds her working with the legendary Sly and Robbie, who provide raggae and club rhythms that fit Jone's monotone delivery well.The hit &quot;Pull up to the bumper&quot; is just as erotic as it was in 1981. Her remake of &quot;Use Me&quot; is another winner. The raggae flavor it is given adds a new dimension to the classic.The often sampled title track &quot;Nighclubbing&quot; is still fresh with its riding base line. Other standouts include &quot;Art Groupie&quot; and the different &quot;Walking in the rain&quot; add on to this release. Often underappreciated this is one of Jones's best releases and it is sure to please anyone."
1,"Despite this album's reputation of being an 80's period piece, and, as everyone is probably aware of, their song Video Killed the Radio Star was the first video broadcast on MTV, this is an immensely catchy, tuneful, undated, surprisingly complex album.  Despite it being identified as ""80's"", it still sounds excellent and quite contemporary.  I didn't listen to this album when it came out, but when I finally got around to getting it, I found it absolutely charming and wonderful.The first two songs, Living in the Plastic Age and the deservedly classic Video Killed the Radio Star, set the tone.  They are electronic pop gems.  The synthesizers and computers never overpower Trevor Horn's wonderful vocals, and Geoffrey Downes's musicianship.  The lyrics are quite literate and intelligent (especially on Video), and you never think MTV or 80's when you hear this album.  I've actually never watched the entire video for Video Killed the Radio Star for the record.  Maybe I like the song too much and don't want it ruined.  This album has almost a prog rock vibe to it, dare I say.  It isn't surprising that Downes and Horn went on to join Yes shortly after this album on their unjustly trashed, much maligned album Drama (Drama is excellent).  The only other band that comes to mind that tried this intelligent computer pop/prog rock was Jethro Tull and Ian Anderson with Tull's Under Wraps and Anderson's hard to find but excellent CD/album Walk Into Light.  Mike Oldfield's Five Miles Out also falls into this category.Maybe The Age of Plastic is the missing link between prog rock and electronica.  Go ahead, call me pretentious.  Regardless of my possibly pretentious machinations, this is still an excellent CD/album."
1,"I love Neil Diamond's voice and can never tire of hearing it. He is also a brilliant songwriter...every song here he either wrote or co-wrote. &quot;Be&quot; from the 'Jonathan Livingston Seagull Suite' is a wonderful ballad. As with a lot of his songs, they tell a story...&quot;If you know what I mean&quot; for example is a song about the loss of innocent dreams. This is a really good album, and for those of us who lived through the 70's, they stir up a lot of memories. At least, they do for me."
1,"For some reasons in the industry, may radio stations, and media outlets don't give enough credit to the female singer-songwriters in the industry. Nonetheless, in the media today, that is where they've cornered Melissa Etheridge. Since her career started in the mid 80's, Melissa never recieved enough credit for her talents, and sadly in today's music scene, as you have to be thin-looking and anorexic like Britney Spears, and dance all the way like those dopey boy bands, it still shows that same way.Her 1993 breakout album, Yes I Am, reflected Melissa's image, and how difficult it was for her to come into terms with being bisexual. Surprisingly, the industry really welcomed the record. The album is as tough as the rain it came down on. Songs like I Am The Only One, Come To My Window, which its video starred her ex-partner Julie Cypher, and If I Wanted To.Many people still think of Melissa's fall in the industry with artists like the Indigo Girls, and Sarah McLachlan, nevertheless, it is always worth hearing every other time. Hopefully, people will try to see Melissa Etheridge that same way again, radio."
1,"There is a certain authenticity about Neil Diamond's early work that lends it an enduring appeal. All of these songs are winners, a combination of hook-filled melodies, heartfelt delivery and perfect production. The many cover versions of many of these are proof of their timeless appeal. A pop song like I'm A Believer has more depth of feeling in Diamond's own version than the more famous Monkees cover, while on the ballads like Shilo his voice has a certain haunting atmosphere that still gives me gooseflesh after all these years. This is pop music of quality and distinction."
1,"When you come right down to it, there was probably no other band in history that could just flat out ""create' the way Pink Floyd was able to make music in the 70's.  From Meddle, Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall.  Had they just made one of these albums, it would have made them a Hall of Fame Band.  The fact that they made all five is just plain astounding.  These songs were written during the midst of the creative run of Floyd. Although it isn't quite in the league of the quintet of Floyd albums, it's pretty solid stuff from the man who made Pink Floyd musically available to the world.  Gilmour has the most unique guitar chops.  Sounds easy to play, but try to do it with his feel.  Not so easy.  Only real dedicated players can pull off the Gilmour sound.  This is a great album.  Just because it doesn't have an overall concept should not take away from the sheer pleasure of listening to one of the great musicians of our day."
1,"This 1978 album was Bobby Caldwell's first--I believe it was originally a self-titled effort, and that the title was changed to ""What You Won't Do for Love"" when the song of the same name became a hit.  There is some great stuff here, but unfortunately, it seems that Caldwell just didn't have enough material and/ or was in a hurry to meet a deadline, because there is a considerable amount of blatant filler, including overlong fades, & the album runs less than 35 minutes in the first place.  Also, the lyrics are often very slight.  He's clearly in disco territory on a couple songs--the album opening ""Special To Me"" is way too sugary, but the wonderfully melodic ""Love Won't Wait"" is an irresistible, somewhat jazz-flavored tune.  The smooth, wistful soft rock ballad ""My Flame"" is captivating with great hooks, but there are a couple really weak ballads as well with the ridiculously sappy ""Come To Me"", and ""Take Me Back To Then"" which is a song about wanting to be a kid again and has a very annoyingly overblown lead vocal.  Plus, the funk-flavored love ballad ""Can't Say Goodbye"" is really let down by the overwrought vocals, lame lyrics, & the excessive, overlong fade.  The super mellow album closer ""Down For The Third Time"" has cool, jazzy guitar, & it's an infectiously catchy tune, but it has a fade that's really long, really repetitive, and really dull.  He also slips in an instrumental fragment ""Kalimba Song""--it's less than a minute & 1/2 long & fades out so abruptly that it leaves you with an undeniable ""What, that's it?"" feeling.  There's no denying though that the soulful title track is a classic--it's got a great horn riff, cool orchestration, an ultra-catchy melody, & Caldwell's vocals on it are terrific--he sounds quite similar to Stevie Wonder, but without the annoyingly overdone 'show-biz' mannerisms that Wonder has a tendency to indulge in;  this song also has a very long fade, but this time it's to nice effect--it's got a nice contemplative, atmospheric feel to it.  In the end, the album is a heck of a mixed bag--it's a shame, because the best stuff demonstrates that Caldwell was capable of a masterpiece.  As it is, this is still worth getting if you see it for a low price--there is some must-have material on here that makes the album worth having."
1,"If there is a rap classic, Gangsta's Paradise would be on the list. I gave this CD as a Christmas stocking stuffer. A young friend asked me about it and wondered where he could get CD. I found it on Amazon. It was a joy to see his face when he pulled it from his stocking.  A song like Gangsta Paradise is timeless. The struggles are still there."
0,"I was surprised that ""Turbo"" took such a beating with Priest Fans, because ""Defenders Of Faith"" has got to be, by far, the weakest Priest album with RH. The album really fools you by kicking some ass with the first three songs, and then starts to slowly fall apart. The Sentinel and Heads are gonna roll are Mediocre, but passable, but the last four songs on the album are the worst S**t songs that I have heard on a Priest album, and those ballads Judas Priest has no buiness singing. Sure, Ram it Down and Turbo have been bashed, and those albums aren't Great, but slightly above average around the 3 1/2 Stars rating. This One Sucks. Save your money, Get the first three songs (hint-hint) and avoid the rest"
1,"The songs on POINT OF ENTRY sound like 1981 through-and-through. To me, this is a good thing, since the songs on this CD bring back to me the restless-but-hopeful feelings of my adolescent years that I remember so well. Not only that, but these tunes really do pack a punch. This being the Remastered version, the sound is fully three-dimensional, and really kicks.To be sure, POINT OF ENTRY was an attempt to make Priest more commercial-sounding and less forboding than on previous albums. Gone are the speed-metal riffs of ""Rapid Fire"" from BRITISH STEEL (1980). Gone are the long and complex song structures of ""Beyond The Realms Of Death"" from STAINED CLASS (1978). Gone are the faux-Satanic references of ""Sinner"" from SIN AFTER SIN (1977). However, Tom Allom (incidentally the same producer as on BRITISH STEEL and on many other hell-raising Priest albums afterwards) still maintains his tight, slick production values on this record. The main reason why this album did not sell well upon release was that it alienated a lot of new-found Priest fans who had fallen in love with the band's jackhammer style that was displayed so prominently on BRITISH STEEL. However, as a lot of the same fans eventually came to realize after repeated listenings, the songs on POINT are short, sweet, and listenable--and some of them are very good.The first song, ""Heading Out To The Highway"" is classic Priest, with its racing theme as a metaphor for life. It's thought-provoking, and great to listen to while driving! ""Don't Go"" brings to mind pain and heartbreak. Slow for a Priest song, it has a very unusual and slightly off-kilter rhythm pattern. It definitely doesn't sound like JP at first. Rob Halford has a kind of poppy singing style here, but the tandem lead-guitar solo trade-offs between Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing are just absolutely killer. The song ends up being surprisingly catchy, and you'll soon find yourself humming, ""Don't go...don't go in the morning."" ""Hot Rockin'"", the third and final single from this album, is a straight-ahead rocker that reminds me of that great feeling I get when I want to go out to a rock concert.Most of the other songs are good, too. ""Turning Circles"" has a memorably quiet bridge. ""Desert Plains"" is impressive with its great rhythm guitar that makes it sound as if Priest had gotten an extra drummer. Also memorable is the chorus, ""From desert plains, I bring you love!"" ""Solar Angels"" also has a cool rhythm guitar backing up the main riff, along with some really cool sound effects. It sports a killer solo that lifts my spirits way up above the clouds. ""You Say Yes"" starts out with a quirky, jumpy rhythm pattern, but the chorus is rather droning and simpleminded. Like about half the songs on this CD, it has a cool, quiet midsection which on this song feels somewhat oddly out of place. However, the song ends up fading out on that lame chorus. This is the only ""bad"" track on the record, though. ""All The Way"" begins with a bit of a Rob Halford cheer that would seem more appropriate at the beginning of Olivia Newton-John's ""Physical"" (also recorded in 1981, coincidentally enough!). At least the chorus here is better than in the previous track. ""Troubleshooter"" begins with a cool mid-tempo drum beat, then is joined in perfect timing with a mid-tempo guitar riff. Rob Halford does some good growling vocals that are reminiscient of, say, ""Devil's Child"" from the all-around excellent SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE. ""On The Run"" features Rob doing a lot of high-pitched singing/screaming, especially on the chorus, ""Cause I'm O-O-O-N the run!"" It has an uncharacteristically bouncy drum & bass pattern and was a good choice to end this album when originally released 21 years ago.But wait; there's more! We get two extra tracks here on the Remastered edition: ""Thunder Road"", which had been written ""during the early years of our career"" and recorded in 1987 (presumably during the sessions for the following year's RAM IT DOWN). It contains elecronically-altered Halford screaming, but the most surprising thing is the fuzzbox guitar solo which seems to have walked right out of 1970 and into this song. The second most surprising thing is the quiet keyboard coda immediately following the fuzzbox guitar solo. Lastly, we get a live version of ""Desert Plains"", which is just another example of how incredible Halford & Co. sound live. Unlike most of their contemporaries, Judas Priest prove that they don't need studio tricks to make themselves sound they way they do. The way Rob Halford can hold his high-pitched screech in a live setting the way no one else can just sends shivers up & down my spine. POINT OF ENTRY may not send shivers up or down your spine, but it's a pretty damn good record nonetheless. It may not be the high point of Judas Priest's career, but it's far from the lowest. RECOMMENDED"
1,"As a friend referred to it, this album sounds &quot;raw, yet professional.&quot; The mysterious Kentucky quartet Slint is one of those bands that happened at just the right time and produced a stellar album that probably can't be duplicated. No other band has sounded like this before or since, although I find some parallels in the music on this album to some of the things done by Tool. Slint's use of dynamics was so far ahead of its time that bands and musicians are still trying to catch up. From the opening harmonics of &quot;Breadcrumb Trail&quot; to the closing explosive &quot;I miss you(s)&quot; of &quot;Good Morning, Captain,&quot; this album has to be heard. Julian McMahan's sung/spoken delivery of the lyrics seem to fit right into the mix perfectly, while Britt Walford's drumming is almost mathematical in its precision. A masterpiece."
1,"This was either my 3rd or 4th record, that I  ever bought by Aerosmith in 1976, after ""Dream On"" entered the charts AGAIN. There was a much better & shorter version of ""Dream On"" when it first reached #59, on the charts, in the Fall of 1973. I had always liked the shorter version of ""Dream On"", so much better. The other small hit from this album was ""Mama Kin"", which was very familiar when I first bought the record. It's an excellent song, along w/ ""Make It"", which is the perfect way to START the album. ""Movin' Out"", is another one of my favorite songs here. I love the SCRATCHING sound of the guitar on ""Walkin' the Dog"". It sounds as though the dog has an itch on it's skin! ""Write Me a Letter"" & ""One Way Street"" are pretty good songs, although I didn't like ""One Way Street"" too much, when I first got this album. ""One Way Street"", seems to remind of ""Midnight Gambler"", by the Stones, from THEIR 1969 album titled ""Let it Bleed"". Back to Aerosmith now, the song ""Somebody"" is okay, actually kinda funny, lyric wise, but it's not one of my favorites. Even though ""Dream On"" was the BIGGEST hit on this album & it charted in '73 & again in '76, it is NOT my favorite on this album @ all.  Just recently, I bought this album in CD format & it's good to hear these songs all over again. Definitely recommended."

1,"Jay-Z's career almost ended after the poor response to this follow up to his debut.  He seemed to be lost, when he was really just misunderstood.  He seemed to be pandering, when he was really just experimenting.  He seemed to be wrong, when he was really right.  Remember this album released during the Puff Daddy glory days, the ""shiny suit"" era.  Jay-Z got nailed by critics and fans alike for having his own ""shiny suit"" moment, or something close to it, with his Babyface assisted ""Sunshine"".  Follow that with tight but unfairly maligned singles ""City Is Mine"" (with Blackstreet) and ""I Know What Girls Like"" (with Lil Kim and produced by Puff's Hitmen), and Jay-Z's street audience took their money elsewhere or threw his CD down in disgust.Nevertheless, like the true champion Jay-Z is, he showed exceptional streetsmart brilliance in songs like ""Streets Is Watching"" and ""Imaginary Player"".  Then he poured his heart out (as he did with much greater success on ""Song Cry"" years later) on ""You Must Love Me"" and ""Lucky Me"" with raw, searing honesty.  Though many of his fans initially trashed the album, the masterful release of the Streets Is Watching flick and its soundtrack saved Jay's career and made those same fans appreciate this album more.Definitely not to be slept on, In My Lifetime Vol.1 is a must have if you're a Jay-Z fan, and an interesting pick for any hip-hop fan."
0,"I downloaded this music for free thank goodness just because of all the five star reviews. After listening to this album I have my doubts about these five star reviews. Not much to say about the album except I was totally disappointed. The album was monotonous and boring to the extreme. Almost all of the songs sounded the same. The same guitar rifts, slow beat, and jamming on each song. The song Washer was so so, but was ruined by the lyrics of the lead singer. It sounds like a group of guys in their late teens/early twenties(which they probably were) in a garage just jamming with no common goal or purpose with each band member having their own direction or agenda. No band assimilation whatsoever. To make matters worse the lead singer is not actually singing but just occasionally speaking or telling a story. Fortunately he speaks so low that you can't even tell what he's saying with headphones on. Not that it matters what he's saying anyway.The band reminds me just a little of a much less talented and interesting version of the great band Bedhead.  Bottom line this album was terrible and would never even consider listening to their other music."
1,"Carole King's masterpiece &quot;Tapestry&quot; is exactly what its title suggests: a thick, colorful blend of everything that you realize belongs to Carole King and not just to those people who may sing her stuff.  This  album proves that Carole King owns her music: songs like &quot;Will you  Still Love me Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Natural Woman&quot; sound so much  better in King's raw voice.  The emotional backing behind these songs is  superb and realistic.  Songs like &quot;Home Again&quot; give you that  aching feeling of complete understanding (&quot;I really need someone to  talk to, and nobody else knows how to comfort me tonight&quot;), and  &quot;Too Late&quot;'s almost jazzy piano show that Carole pulled her  influence from all sorts of music.  Another gem is &quot;I Feel the Earth  Move,&quot; where Carole's vocal talent emerges especially at the end of  the song, and you get an almost Janis Joplin (Bobby McGee) effect.  Enjoy  this CD because it's a must-have in any music lover's collection."
1,"I have had this album in my (more or less) Complete Works of Stan Getz for more than a decade but it hadn't occupied a postion of prominence. But I went back the other day and relistened and I really like it!There are less of Getz wonderful ballads than one often finds in this period but the music is spirited and happy and Getz does a great job of call-and-response to passages Tjader plays first on vibes, for example ""Ginza Samba"". Sounds bounce back and forth from vibes to sax and back again! What a happy, optimistic period this was in music.Fun and high energy from beginning to end. Melodic, relaxed and swinging! Should be more popular. Quite fifties Latin music - Seems to presage Getz Bossa Nova albums, in a vague sense.Well recorded, for it's period.(NOt that it's anyone's business, but I bought this CD before Amazon existed)"
1,"This is without doubt one of Miles's finest recordings, although he left so many of a superb quality that it is easy to engage in hyperboles every time. But I have no doubt that his solos on each of the title takes (""Bag's Groove"", Milt Jackson's great tune) are among his best and most lastingly satisfying. He plays, on those, with a beautifully clear, open horn, showing wonderful sense of direction at all times, producing truly inventive phrasing, and subtlety of a kind only he knows how to. There is deep emotion in his playing, but always of a controlled kind, and in remarkable taste. He certainly is one of jazz's greatest masters, and his work, when it is at his best, as here, is truly fulfilling. The other musicians on these two tracks are pretty well on a par: Monk very definitely so, playing just as individualistically and profoundly as Davis. It is an interesting note that these were the two tracks where Davis told Monk to stay silent while he was soloing, which Monk did not appreciate. In truth, though, Davis was probably right to think that both he and Monk would flower forth more when presenting their own solos, and at the end of the day I feel it is Monk who plays the second track more differently from the first than does anyone else. Jackson is also in great form: dazzlingly fluent without  superficiality, swinging with great refinement and assurance. The other tracks, i.e. ""Oleo"" etc., are played without Monk and Jackson: thus Horace Silver stars  on piano, in his typically ""funky"", articulate and soulfully driving way, and Sonny Rollins is also heard to great advantage, though his best work was still to come (which means that he is already no less than excellent here). The bassist, throughout, is Percy Heath, and the drummer Kenny Clarke, and they do very fine work on all the tracks. A totally rewarding and satisfying recording, unhesitatingly recommended for decades of great listening (I have enjoyed it many times since its appearance in 1954). - Joost Daalder"
0,"Weakest of all his works including no limit, maybe 2 or 3 good songs. this was when Snoop sold out Pac'. Never respected him since then. Sell out."
1,This is one of my more favorite cds that came out after his death. it`s great and as the rest of them to follow as well.
1,"""Pink Moon"" was the third and last album that Nick Drake managed to get released in his all too short lifetime. The album differs somewhat from the previous two; first and foremost through the fact that the songs are only accompanied by Drake himself on his acoustic guitar, apart from the title track which has a nice little piano line also played by Drake.The songs are generally simple and short, and in some cases they may seem a little unfinished, with only one verse and a slightly raw sound on the guitar. Drake's well known and strong songwriting is present on most tracks, and when a first disappointment may have subsided, you will discover several fine songs on a par with Drake's very best.The title track ""Pink Moon"" is perhaps the easiest to tune to fall for; a very melodic and catchy song, ywhich you may easily find yourself go humming. A nice variation with the nice piano-part.There is as of the first two albums a sad undertone to most songs. This applies not least ""Place to Be"", one of the few songs with longer lyrics. ""Road"" is a nice little song that could well sound like a Donovan song. ""Which Will"" is also a song that wins on closer acquaintance, while  ""Horn"" is a nice little instrumental which showcases  Drake's original guitar style.""Things Behind the Sun"" is another of the album highlights; a song which seems completely finished, unlike the next track ""Know"", which in both sound and form appears rather unfinished - a little bluesy thing.The sad mood get an extra shot with ""Parasite"" also one of the most memorable songs. ""Free Ride"" may also appear a little unfinished but still quite charming Another fine Donovan-like song.b""Harvest Breed"" is a very short little song with just a single verse - it has a fine typical Drake melody.""From the Morning"" is a worthy end to a nice little album which may nevertheless appear somewhat unresolved, and one can easily come to feel that the album could have deserved a little more time in the creation process and maybe a little variation in the arrangements. The cover art, though, is by far the most  interesting among Drake's three albums."
1,"Other than ""Too Many Puppies"" from Frizzle Fry, three songs from Sailing The Seas of Cheese heralded by initiation into Primus during my NMSU years-thank goodness for alternative college radio.  Buying the full album later on, Sailing became and still is to date my favourite by Les Claypool and friends.  The songs pulse and pound a lot more due to Claypool's uptempo bass and Tim Alexander's drumming.  And Claypool's quirky vocals give Primus an added recognizable uniqueness.The churning rowdy grind of bass and drums in the instrumental interlude of ""Jerry Was a Race Car Driver"" is what caught my ears to that song.  An uptempo tune of the title character, who never finished first or last, but later had an unfortunate ending at an early age.Equally rhythmic and upbeat is ""Tommy the Cat,"" with Tom Waits playing the title character.  The song recounts a tale of a hot feline looking for that he-cat of alleycats, namely the title cat.  Waits himself sounds like he could do guest stints in Primus with his raconteur personality.  This song was actually originally released live on their Suck On This album.The third was ""Those D-mned Blue Collar Tweakers,"" with a leisurely but playful rhythm beat, about how the title characters run the town, be it truckers, workers hammering in nails, or even someone hanging drywall who needs his fix to get the job done quick, but the town turns a blind eye.  A funny reference to Papa Bush is ""curious George's drug patrol is out here hunting snipe.""  At least I think it's Bush 41.After the introductory ditty, Primus's killer rhythm section introduces ""Here Come The Bastards"" with a marching tempo.  The concept of the title bastards introducing ideas-""something about a hammerhead shark, nosehairs and flatus"" lends a bizarre Pythonseque turn to the song, but with Primus, well, what do you expect?  The line of ""anonymity is a virtue in this day and age"" is universal enough, but ten years after this album was released, ""flagrant misuse of Security"" seems relevant, especially with HL Security's tramping on our freedoms.  The song is reprised in ""Los Bastardos"" with the ""here they come"" refrain chanted over and over.The brutality of the military mind, the ""game of warfare"" and the need to put recruits into lockstep is shown in the jamming ""Sgt. Baker,"" with bits of wry humor mixed with Baker's character.  The chorus goes in a left-right left-right marching rhythm:  ""I will r-pe your personality/pummel you with my own philosophy/strip you of your self-integrity/to make you all a bit like me.""  Uh, anyone STILL want to join the military after this?Three verses tell sobering tales of people living the ""American Life,"" of a Sicilian family who decides to go to Ellis Island after the father dies, Ong, a Laotian refugee earning minimum wage in LA, and perhaps the saddest, of Bob the unemployed veteran who sleeps in a cardboard box hunts for aluminum cans, yet somehow manages to maintain his dignity.You know how people go, ""That's what they say"" or ""They tell me""? Well, who's ""they""?  The pounding song ""Eleven"" is a paean for those who can't seem to conform to society or accept ""this dim simplicity of law and order.""  Nothing treasonous about not seeing rhyme or reason in those rules.The frantic tweeked out ""Is It Luck"" is a question asked in response to certain lines, be it something silly like ""cyanide works oh so fast"" to something serious like ""there was food in your mouth today.""  A silly and great number.  The fishing chronicles continue with ""Fish On,"" about how a fisherman and his boys land a hundred pound sturgeon.Better than Frizzle Fry, Primus sails the seas of success and skill with this one."
1,"I'm not sure who came out first, USA or Lothar and the Hand People. My preference is for Lothar, but these guys are a nice discovery.I'd heard about them off and on over the years, but finally bought this CD to actually hear what they were about. I definitely got my money's worth with the excellent liner notes and the ten extra songs.The music is sort of rock, sort of electronic, sort of a lot of things. It is an eclectic mix of influences and is done pretty well. The actual electronic music is a bit more sparse than I imagined, but you can't mistake it, especially when Dorothy is singing through a ring modulator.As I compared them to Lothar And The Hand People, I must say Lothar's electronics were a lot more pronounced, where here with the USA, it is more subtle.Not a bad album, though it doesn't really blow me away. I think it would have been interesting to see what would have happened if they'd stayed together a bit longer and had more time to develop as a band, and maybe get a bigger modular system they could play with.The song that sticks in my head the most is the old-timey I Won't Leave My Wooden Wife For You, Sugar, which may be the least electronic song on the whole album.If you are interested in the dawn of the electronic rock age, I highly recommend adding this to your collection."
1,"this one is one step ahead. As with the first two, all compositions are very good. I don't know why but I'm completely taken by Three Friends, the last one. It springs out of Mister Class And Quality (excellent too) and its beginning is not properly marked on the CD, it really begins at 2:27 into the track. Prologue is another good one to start with. School Days is the best track here. Its rhythmical equilibristics are dizzying. The fast part breaks the rhythm into the slow piano and beautiful vocals fading into another piano part, that in turn flows into a xylophone solo. In the end they return to the very line they begin with (the same approach is used in Experience from Glass House). Working All Day and Peel the Paint both have lots of the vocals sung in unison with the instrumental parts which presents the only weak point here, though both are very good."
1,"Michael Jackson faced the most daunting task any recording artist could tackle: following up the greatest-selling album of all time.  ""Bad"" is an all-too-obvious example of what happens when you try too hard to top yourself.  His first album in 5 years, the CD has some really good songs sandwiched in between cheesy material.  There's no denying the soul and power of ""Man in the Mirror,"" a far more convincing inspirational song than the bloated mess that is ""Heal the World.""  The excellent ""Smooth Criminal"" radiates with unfiltered energy and urgency, while ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" is a bouncy, if fluffy, love song with a killer chorus.  Elsewhere, it's a one-way trip to Velveeta-land.  Michael's duet with Siedah Garret, ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" is so syrupy, it looks better on a mile-high stack of waffles.  The song is extremely sappy.  When he warned, ""your butt is mine"" on the tepid title track, I was holding back bursts of laughter.  C'mon, Jacko.  We know you as a lover, not a fighter.  You said it yourself.  And his duet with Stevie, ""Just Good Friends"" is just forgettable.  Had this CD been released by someone else, it wouldn't have debuted at No. 1 and spawned five Number One singles as it did.  While I wasn't looking for a sequel to ""Thriller,"" ""Bad"" is just a few pints short of the greatness I expected."
1,"Jayo Felony's 1995 debut album is a west coast classic, one of the most overlooked masterpieces of g-funk and a personal favorite of my collectoin. Unfortunately, this album also displayed Def Jam's complete ineptitude to promote west coast artists (just ask Richie Rich, Twinz, The Dove Shack, WC, South Central Cartel, or even Warren G). What's so great about this album is that Jayo is much more insightful than the average g-funker. He's a true lyricist, but his subject matter really sets him apart from his west coast contemporaries. He has beef with the legal and prison system, and on many tracks he vents out his frustration with the law and incarceration. His tales of street crime, penitentiary life, and loneliness are really engaging and interesting, as a rapper Jayo constantly demands and maintains your attention. His flow really helps this too, he's got a lazy and conversational delivery that makes his raps feel more personal. He switches this up sometimes, almost singing a few hooks. But the production is also spectacular. It's so focused, especially because there's not a single guest verse or appearance on the whole album. The music has deep bass, but the instrumentals are a little more stripped down than most of the g-funk coming out at this time. It's not so woozy and computerized either, it has a great feel and is often upbeat and very catchy. The dark, gloomy funk enhances Jayo's portrayal of a grim world where penitentiary stays are punctuated by gang violence and drug abuse. This album has absolutely no weak tracks, the consistency is something rare in this genre, and that's what makes ""Take a Ride"" such a classic. Even the skits are relevant and entertaining. While this album is still available (unlike his other two), I consider this a must have, and this is an awesome, underappreciated classic.Following the intro, the first song is ""The Loc Is on His Own,"" a nice cut. This song is slow and funky, and the lyrics are some of the best. Jayo recounts the difficulties with contacting and connecting with his friends and family following incarceration, it's conscious and an interesting take. He also drops some raw philosophy on the jail system. ""I'ma Keep Bangin'"" is faster and bouncier, the production is very nice and Jayo holds your attention with his rough profiles of urban life. ""Homicide"" is pretty laidback, Jayo shows true lyrical talent on this track. The nice ""Love Boat"" skit serves as an intro to this album's classic single, ""Sherm Stick."" Over a sunny, head-nodding beat, Jayo laces a smoking anthem with a great hook and verses. I also really like ""N...s and B...s,"" another excellently produced track, and ""Can't Keep a Gee Down"" continues the roll of funky, upbeat tracks with intense lyricism. My favorite beat here is found on ""B... I'm Through,"" which musically is the finest track. The woozy, bumping beat has awesome instrumentals and a great hook as well. ""Penitentiary Bound"" is awesome. On this song, Jayo tells the story of a parole violation that led to incarceration, and he explores injustices in the system. The short yet inspiring ""Don't Call Me N..."" is a real highlight, and my favorite song comes next, ""They Got Me On Medication."" Jayo's delivery on this song is totally on point, and the production is excellent. He tells stories about hood life and insanity with the law, leading to the awesome hook. ""Funk 2 da Head"" is appealing but not outstanding, and the album finishes with the title track, an incredibly catchy and upbeat west coast anthem.It's embarrassing that an album so great both lyrically and musically could have gone so under the radar, but the combination of lack of promotion and a flood of g-funk albums in '95 made this one of the year's slept-on gems, just like BG Knocc Out & Dresta'sReal Brothasand Twinz'Conversation. Jayo is one of those rappers that seems to have been on the verge of stardom at one point, but for whatever reason it never really happened for him. Regardless, ""Take a Ride"" is the album that was the first to put San Diego on anybody's hip hop radar. Fans of west coast rap will love this, and anybody can appreciate the emotional lyrics and funky beats."
1,"underated a shame michael is better known for thriller, i lov e this the lyrics are meaningful, the harmonies are tight, this was the jacksons at their creative peak without anyone's supervision, everybody is my favorite. for all jackson fans get this."
1,"The guitar-powered ""Fopp"" and the classic ""Love Rollercoaster'are sadly about as funky as these albums get.Most of these songs are soulful ballads tempered only by the sexy ""Sweet Sticky Thing"".But everything is done well and nothing can be faulted.But at least the Players can deliver a complete package.So even if it's two predecessor's were alot funkier this album is a fine coda to an era!"
1,"Incredible, phenomenal, fantastic, wonderful!  I always liked these old Moody Blues albums but the sound was never very good.  Well, listen to them again for the first time!  The remastering on these is way beyond good, it's tremendous....I can't believe how much better this sounds.  There were some ""Remasters"" in the early nineties that were mildly better.  These are exponentially better.....don't hesitate, if you are a fan...buy these remastered Moody Blues CD's.  I bought them all and like ""In Search of the lost Chord,"" ""Threshold"" and ""Every Good Boy"" the best, but they are all good. Extra tracks are great fun too!"
1,"This CD you can listen too now,and fall in love with it.  The words to 'Irons in the Fire', can you feel what she is saying? ""Tune in Tomorrow"" -What do we do now, now that we both know how?  This is was ture R&B music is!  I can see how this album went on the sell millions years after it was released!  I can only say if you do not feel this CD, you do not know music, no matter how old you are,, Pick it up!  Oh yea Alica Keys had to be listing to this cd when she started writing songs."
1,"After the mega-selling MAKE IT BIG (1984), one would think a band like Wham! would feel the need to keep the streak going for as long as possible, even if personal tensions were chipping away at their foundations. However, it was perhaps already obvious that George Michael was the true star of the group, especially since most of the original material was coming from him, and it was likely he could not care a whit about superstardom because that detracted from artistic development. With Andrew Ridgeley more interested in becoming a pop star and George thinking otherwise, a break-up was inevitable, and 1986's MUSIC FROM THE EDGE OF HEAVEN was their way of bidding their fans farewell.While providing the world with a proper goodbye was all well & good, maybe Wham! had no more fine material left in the can for their swan song only has 3 real new songs out of 8, with the remaining being live tracks, single updates, and George's first ""solo"" songs. There is no denying the quality of the music at hand, but the patchwork nature of HEAVEN makes it far from an essential purchase until after one has gotten MAKE IT BIG and perhaps 1983's FANTASTIC, if one cares to see what George was up to at the top of his career.Unable to replicate MAKE IT BIG's feat of 4 top 10 hits, the 3 top 10 singles are great to have on HEAVEN, although they are certainly not the primary reason for buying the album. ""I'm Your Man"" was released late in 1985 after the adulation from MAKE IT BIG had died down, and was a marked improvement over the merely catchy pop of that album. This song had more of an honest-to-goodness dance-club quality to it, one crying for remixes from any & everyone. While in fact only 6 minutes instead of 8, ""I'm Your Man"" still provides an ample amount of time for getting your groove on, and those who bought MAKE IT BIG probably agreed enough to send the song to #3 in early 1986. Clearly, Wham!'s farewell was still going to be a profitable one.George's first official solo song came next with ""A Different Corner"", a misty ballad once again showing the stock in trade that would provide the finest moments on 1987's FAITH. You can practically hear George's heart breaking upon hearing this song, something that would occur again on ""One More Try"", making this one sort of a dry run for that masterpiece. With just an unobtrusive drum machine backing him, George portrays an impressive amount of heartache for someone who was still only 23 years old at the time. With ""A Different Corner"" making it to #7, it was clear George's solo jaunt was off to a fine start.The fact that single was credited just to George Michael had to have alerted fans the end was nigh, but Wham! was not finished just yet. ""The Edge Of Heaven"" was the group's official goodbye, reaching #10, and harking back to the happy-go-lucky style of MAKE IT BIG with a bouncy atmosphere that was so contagious, one could easily forget for a while that this was the end of Wham! as we knew it. One of George's childhood musical idols, Elton John, plays piano on this song, although you will have to listen carefully for his contribution. Having sung with Elton on ""Wrap Her Up"" and ""Nikita"" the previous year, George clearly had someone big in his corner for going solo.What else is there besides those singles to recommend MUSIC FROM THE EDGE OF HEAVEN? Not much, but even those small highlights are what make it essential. ""Blue"" had been recorded during Wham!'s groundbreaking tour of China, and the lilting Latin elements of the tune make it apparent that regardless of his teen idol status, George still thought like an adult both musically & lyrically. Why on Earth this song was never properly recorded is beyond me. Obviously, the audience at the concert loved the song & George gave his all to it.""Where Did Your Heart Go?"" may have been a cover (the surefire sign that a band was running out of musical gas), but the way George sang this smoky Was [Not Was] number, he truly left the original version in the dust. Whereas ""Careless Whisper"" on MAKE IT BIG showed that he was growing into a superb balladeer, ""Where Did Your Heart Go?"" made it even more apparent, with George's occasionally aching falsetto ranges enough to bring a tear to your eye. Both were songs geared to their teenage audience's parents as well as their kids, proving that George could truly appeal beyond the typical teen-pop norm. Truly Wham!'s final single, it only made it to #50, but still remains among George Michael's finest works.""Battlestations"" returns to the dysfunctional relationships of ""Everything She Wants"" and ""Credit Card Baby"" with another song showing that love in the 1980s had little to do with romance & commitment. The way George sings about his situation, you wonder what the two saw in each other to begin with besides each other's bodies. One would be a fool not to dance like a madman to the song, which leans more to the legitimate dance club scene just like ""I'm Your Man"".""Wham! Rap `86"" was a redo of Wham!'s first-ever single from 1983, and truly sticks out like a sore thumb alongside the more adult numbers on HEAVEN, seeing as how the immaturity of the song was an element George had clearly grown away from in the 3 years since. Try as he may, George certainly did not help the cause of rap music being for White artists, too. Not when we had the Beastie Boys coming up with more street credibility in their middle finger than George had in his whole body.The sad goodbye of MUSIC FROM THE EDGE OF HEAVEN truly bids farewell with ""Last Christmas"", which, by seeing its recording date of November 1984, was a song either not thought worthy of a release or was intended for Wham!'s follow-up to MAKE IT BIG whenever that came along. Once more with a heavy heart & a chip on his shoulder the size of an aircraft carrier, George laments having been abandoned by his lover on a joyous holiday like Christmas, and the sleigh bells are a nicely perverse touch. I am not sure if George intended this song to be covered by anyone else, for his performance is that personal, but ""Last Christmas"" certainly has been several times over by a diverse range of artists, from Hilary Duff to Jimmy Eat World!Whether their fans truly knew it or not, by 1986, the ride that Wham! had been on for a short 2 years was coming to an end as all involved knew that it was George Michael who was willing to give the sweat needed to stay in the game. MUSIC FROM THE EDGE OF HEAVEN is unfortunately like most posthumous albums released after a band has called it quits, too disjointed & scattered to truly function as a legitimate artistic statement. Individually, the songs may have had some overall worth to recommend themselves, but the album was obviously a case of the parts being worth more than the sum. Who knew that from this uneven affair would rise one of the 1980s most ubiquitous & timeless musical personalities?"

1,"While this is their only album I can do without, the country-fried debut still contains enough creativity to hint at the trail these outcasts would blaze on future releases. Some fans claim to always love this most traditional southern rap entry most, but besides for a few creatively produced tracks, a numbing standardization belies the originality this dangerous duo would come to represent."
1,"I wish he and taupin were still writing, singing and producing these types of songs and sound.  I think it certainly was Elton at his best. I like many of his newer songs but they don't come close to the sounds and styles of the 70's hits he garnered."
1,"Billy Joel had put out seven albums before releasing this his first live one. Yet some fans will probably feel let down that the many well-known songs from his most recent albums at the time, ""Glass Houses"", ""52nd Street"", and ""The Stranger"" are almost all ignored in favour of lesser-known material from Joel's first four records.But that is almost certainly a conscious choice by Billy Joel (and/or his record company). They seem to have decided to use the live album as an opportunity to draw attention to songs from Joel's first four albums, songs which had gone largely unnoticed compared to ""Movin' Out"", ""Big Shot"", ""Only The Good Die Young"", ""Just The Way You Are"", ""It's Still Rock & Roll To Me"", and then-recent single hits like ""You May Be Right"" and ""Don't Ask Me Why"".This material amply demonstrates how prominent Joel's piano really was on his early albums, and the lovely ballad ""She's Got A Way"" is virtually a solo performance. Yet some of these songs seem fuller, more lively than the original studio renditions...the arrangements are frequently better, and Joel's vocals are warm and confident.His early songs were extremely grand and often a little too pumped-up, like something out of a musical, but the best ones (like ""Miami 2017"", the surreal ""Captain Jack"", and the irresistable ""Say Goodbye To Hollywood"") are just terrific.If you like Joel's grandiose 70s songwriting style, you are sure to like this album as well."
1,This was the first album I ever heard of thiers and when I heard it I imediately fell in love.  I really recommend this alot!!!
1,"Despite starting with folk and country roots, Olivia Newton-John came to the forefront with her relocation to North America and retooled herself to more pop standards, despite winning a Grammy for Best Country Female Vocal for &quot;Let Me Be There.&quot;  No, there was one more Grammy to be won, and that was Record of the Year (1974) for the tearful heartfelt piano and strings &quot;I Honestly Love You,&quot; definitely the best song here.That was from the If You Love Me, Let Me Know album, and the country title track is also included.  The basso male backing vocalist provide a good balance with Olivia's winsome pop vocals.As for the rest, it's the requisite collection of hits, of which there are plenty, as well as four new songs.  The first one was penned and co-produced by Diane Warren, showing she has something in her magic pen for O N-J.  &quot;Deeper Than A River&quot; belongs squarely in the 80's tradition of dreamy pop ballads, complete with synthesizers and strings.&quot;Not Gonna Be The One&quot; could easily belong on one her Totally Hot album, as there are similarities to this and &quot;A Little More Love.&quot;  Produced by her longtime producer John Farrar.Her cover of Brenda Lee's #1 hit, &quot;I Want To Be Wanted,&quot;--who doesn't want to be?--is my favourite of the four new songs here, showing her ability to put forth great ballads haven't diminished with her Grammy winner.  And with Peter Asher (Peter of Peter and Gordon) as producer, how can she go wrong?&quot;I Need Love&quot; is 80's soul/pop and synth fills set to a funky bass backbeat, with some monologue thrown in.  In an ironic reference to an earlier hit, she sings that she holding out for something more than physical.  Clearly it's something more permanent:  &quot;I'm not looking for a bandaid on loneliness.&quot;  Aren't we all?  And this is the most un-Moroder sounding Giorgio Moroder production I've heard.In a twist of fate, many of her best-known songs turned out to be soundtrack hits.  And because of that, N-J gets tarred with the epithet 70's cheese when many are asked to classify her.  Two of them were from Grease, both duets with John Travolta.  The bouncy &quot;You're The One That I Want,&quot; penultimate number in the movie with the catchy bass setting the rhythm of the song, and a big hit in the US, spent nine weeks at the top in England.  &quot;Summer Nights,&quot; a song placed clearly in the musical genre, also went to #1 in the UK.  The other #1, &quot;Xanadu,&quot; is not on there, but &quot;Magic&quot; also from that movie, is.Of the other movie tracks, the fast-paced pop of &quot;Twist Of Fate,&quot; from Two Of A Kind, her second teaming up with Travolta, with its racing electropop bass synth and fuzzy guitar, definitely shows her staying power in 1983, and as far as this collection went, as material from Soul Kiss and The Rumour are excluded.  The other, from Grease, is her soaring strings and steel guitar ballad, &quot;Hopelessly Devoted To You,&quot; showing a mixture of pop and country instruments.In the US, one of her last gasps at greatness was the smart and punchy title track to her &quot;Physical&quot; album, but singles like thatand lines like &quot;let's get physical/let me hear your body talk&quot; showed her embracing the naughty Sandy side of her.  Small wonder the album cover, showing her flushed from an exercise workout, was mistaken for...well, physical things.From Don't Stop Believin' (1976) comes the melting strings ballad &quot;Sam.&quot;  And from the previous year, &quot;Have You Never Been Mellow?&quot; taken from the album of the same name, was a leisure mid-paced number with strings, and showed Olivia adding her two cents to the feminist bandwagon: &quot;someone else be strong&quot; or &quot;comfort from inside,&quot; reflecting the inner spotlight people began turning on in the 70's.  Another song from that album is the country tune &quot;Please Mr. Please,&quot; a pleading request to someone not to play a certain song for fear of being reminded of a past love.Despite the subtitle 1971-1992, the earliest songs here date from 1974's If You Love Me, Let Me Know.  For a first-time listen at Olivia, much recommended, and if you love her stuff, let me know.  If not, let her be."
1,"Vol 1 is a great album, no question. Though, it is a HUGE dissapointment after Reasonable Doubt, I thought he would be Nas or  Ice Cube quality. However, 2pac and Biggie's death changed Jay-Z dramaticly. After good rap music almost died, Jay's commercialization started with this album. I'm okay with the ""best rapper alive"" thing. It is his ego. I liked how he used the Scarface samples in the ""Sunshine"" intro and others too.  Though, no one really noticed Jigga until this album. In '96 everyone was paying attention to Pac and Biggie. So if Jigga put out Reasonable Doubt albums and never became associated with Biggie, I guess he never would have became famous.Onto the album, it starts out with the dope intro, then ""The City is Mine"". It is about him becoming New York's greatest after Biggie died. There are the filler tracks like ""Where I'm From"" and ""Face Off"". There are quality songs like ""Streets is Watching"" (why is it censored?) and ""Imaginary Player"".Overall, ""In My Lifetime Vol. 1"" is better than any 50 Cent album, just a dissapointment to Reasonable Doubt. Reccomended to any Jay-Z fan"
1,"If you're reading this review you are more than likely already familiar with this excellent live offering by Billy Joel in his prime.  Bypassing the big hits Billy decided to release an album of lesser known (at the time) but still excellent classic album tracks from his earlier albums prior to ""The Stranger"".  Each track here has gone on to be the definitive version of the song in question.The SACD represents the best sounding version of this album that I have heard.  The soundscape is larger with more presence than ever, making it sound as if Billy and the band are performing right in front of you.  Every instrument and Billy's voice rings clear and true.  And don't be afraid to turn this up!  At higher volumes this edition really comes to life!  As for the packaging it is also top notch containing all of the original liner notes, lyrics, and photos.  The disc is stored in a soft foam sleeve and gets inserted into the gatefold cover.  Just a beautiful package and really, you couldn't ask for more!So for those of you wondering if this is worth the upgrade from the remaster, my answer would be YES, without question.  Just to be clear I have no particular issues with the remaster but once you listen to this version I doubt you will be revisiting it again.  I do plan on picking up a few more of Billy's titles on SACD and if they all sound as smooth and deep as this one then I will be one very satisfied listener."
1,"SILK DEGREES is Boz Scaggs' best album ever, and it just got even better, with extra songs and a deluxe remastering treatment that's warm and close, not harsh and shrill. There are many great songs here, especially ""Lowdown and the full-tilt R&B-rocker ""Lido Shuffle."" If you have the old version, get rid of it after buying this CD."
1,"Concord Records initiated a new pass through their Original Jazz Classics catalog in March of 2010, and they now add five more titles to the program. Each reissue features a new 24-bit remaster by Joe Tarantino, extensive liner notes, and bonus tracks. This 1963 set finds jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery at the peak of his creative powers, backed by the talented Mel Rhyne on Hammond B-3 and the sharp-as-a-tack swing of Jimmy Cobb on drums. Montgomery's tone is both smooth and penetrating, and he's as mesmerizing playing upbeat romps as he is laying back into ballads. The fluid paths taken by his solo improvisations feel fresh and spontaneous, and his chords are complex yet remain musical. The album is filled with the grooves of Rhyne's organ playing, but the slow numbers, including Henry Mancini's ""Days of Wine and Roses"" and a serene take on Eddie Heywood's ""Canadian Sunset"" are winningly thoughtful. Montgomery thrived in the trio format, and the mix of up-tempo, ballad, original and cover material, along with straight and Latin-inflected rhythms, give this album terrific range and balance. It's been fifteen years since the last domestic reissue of this title, so it's great to have modern digital practices applied to this classic. The bonus tracks are alternate takes of the album tracks ""Besame Mucho,"" ""The Trick Bag"" and ""Fried Pies,"" and the fold-out booklet includes full-panel reproductions of the original covers (front and back), Joe Goldberg's original album notes, and new liners by Neil Tesser that include fresh interview material with Rhyne and Cobb.

1,"Little Queen is a nice CD, but it is not quite as good as Dreamboat Annie. That is my favorite CD of Heart. My favorite song on this CD of Little Queen is Barracuda."
1,"I choose 5 stars because I like Neil Diamond, and this was EXACTLY what I as looking for. So if you like the old 'original' kind of songs he did then yes; by all means this is your kind of purchase....=))"
1,"Tragic Kindom has turned out to be one of the most successful and recognized albums of the early 90's. Tragic Kingdom is unlike most No Doubt albums. The sound and feel of the album is true to their sun-shine California ska and third wave music. But Tragic Kingdom also offers songs like ""Dont Speak"" and ""Spiderwebs"" to a crowd of alternative listeners. This is a true album of talent."
0,"I was never a big Moody Blues fan but this does have one great song...""Steppin in a Slide Zone"". I like it because it rocks much harder than their typical works. ""Driftwood"" and ""I'll be Level with you"" are also good. After that, the quality severely wanes."
1,"This album is started off with the phrase ""Suge shot him"". Now I think that Suge Knight killed 2pac for the money. This is not 2pac's best album but it has amazing production (bomb First and Hail Mary). I'd still add The 7 day Theory to my collection though."
1,"Being E-40's first true ""LP"" to be released, this album's quality amazes me even today. Every one of the 11 songs is worth listening to, and there are very few slow parts on the album. This disc is very underground and street sounding, considering it was released so early in E-40's career when he was still sellin' tapes out of his trunk. But after this CD was released, the north bay area rap scene changed greatly and new respect was given to the area.The disc starts off with an instant classic track, ""Drought Season""... this song talks about exactly what the title says - the lack of 'substances' going around in the area. Don't need to explain more than that. Following this track is ""Rat Heads"", a pretty good cut about snitches in the game. True words spoken on this track. Skipping a couple [good] tracks, we come to two of my favorites on the album - ""Hide N Seek"" and ""Let Him Have It"". Earl injects a whole lot of story-telling into his raps and both are like a street-book-on-tape. Both of the beats are insanely well produced and hit your subs with madness.The second half of the CD is just as good as the first. Near the end of the disc, we have ""Carlos Rossi"" which is possibly the best song on the album, featuring the Click (E-40's group from Vallejo) and a tight beat. ""Nuttin' Ass Nigga"" is a diss towards Mac Dre, and although the beef has been settled these days, back then things weren't as calm. A great song, even if it is towards another one of my favorite rappers.Overall this disc is a street classic and anyone who enjoys Bay Area rap should not be without it. While not quite as classic as his later albums, ""In A Major Way"", and ""Tha Hall Of Game"", Federal paved the way for future hits. Nothing less than an A.OVERALL SCORE: 92 / 100"
1,"Alison Krauss and her Union Station bandmates do a fine job on So Long, So Wrong.  Alison's singing and fiddle playing dominate, especially on the ballads &quot;Looking In The Eyes Of Love&quot;, &quot;I Can Let Go Now&quot;, &quot;Deeper Than Crying&quot;, &quot;It Doesn't Matter&quot;, &quot;Happiness&quot; and &quot;There Is A Reason&quot;.  However, Union Station's guitarist, Dan Tyminski, who sings lead on &quot;No Place To Hide&quot;, &quot;The Road Is A Lover&quot;, and &quot;Blue Trail Of Sorrow&quot;, also is a strong singer.  Furthermore, Adam Steffey(mandolin), Ron Block(banjo and guitar), and Barry Bales(acoustic bass), the remaining Union Station members, really shine on this one.  The instrumental &quot;Little Liza Jane&quot;, on which all the band members get into the act, is a driving bluegrass tune.  There's no percussion anywhere on the record, but thanks to Barry's thumping bass lines, the songs have a rhythmic, flowing feel to them, which more than makes up for the lack of a drumbeat.  There aren't any musical gimmicks here, but there is a great bluegrass and folk sound.  So Long, So Wrong is a fine collection of songs from a truly talented group of singers and musicians."
1,"Luis Mejia (son) - Released in 1997, The Big Picture is the biggest adult contemporary oriented style, it contains a set of refined, touchy songs. It assembles a fabulous popcraft effort with a mannered, enjoyable and emotional moods, although not as meaningful and potential as his past releases. Although I've never heard Made In England, The Big Picture contains a recognizable debility also present in The One; colorless tunes, synthesized, forgetable compositions and in this case, a lack of originality, although The One is a better album. Beautiful compositions are still present in this album, possessing great, mellow mellodies with their great moments, but quite few: Live Like Horses, although a commonly crafted ballad, it contains some emotional mellodies and a stunning vocal performance. Something About The Way You Look Tonight, apart from being the most famous song in the album, it keeps the return of a marvelous instrumentation, it also possess the most colorful mellody. The Big Picture is still a synthesized, rutine composition but its obviously the only song with a rock inclinnation, and for the exception of its chorus, its a piano based, good composition. Recover Your Soul might be the second best track in the album, with a consistent pop basis and the cheerful, recognizable and memorizeable tunes, is another song for the collection catalogue. Finally, I Can't Steer My Heart Clear Of You stays as a bright, mellodic ballad with some of the semi dramatic style seen in Elton's deepest compositions. The rest of the songs assume an average, unoriginal composition, only made to 'fill up' the album. In conclussion this elegant, mid decade release still possess some acceptable, correct mellodies, with its slight moments, although I can recall the 90's as the worst of Elton John's periods, although all music in general was already dead by this time."
1,"I've owned the original CD since it's initial release in the '80s, and I've always felt that it sounded flat and lifeless, so I ordered this remaster with hope of at least modest improvement. After fetching it from the mailbox, I popped it in my player, hit play, and I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This disc has depth, dynamics, warmth, and perfect tonal balance - all way beyond anything I had hoped for. Who remastered it? Doug Sax. He and his company, The Mastering Lab, do a lot of work for audiophile labels, and he is considered by many to be the best in the business. Apparently he was given a lot of freedom on this project, because even the volume level isn't jacked up to todays record company norms. He gave it plenty of headroom and no noticeable compression, and it sounds sweet! This is an audiophile quality disc for the price of standard admission. I wish they'd clone this guy."
1,And ya don't quit! This is an essential listen. Warren G's smooth raps and G Funk rhythums will never be duplicated but often imitated. Warren G is original and that's why this LP get 5 stars!!!
1,"""Pet Sounds"" is one of those albums that occasionally is released that has a Jekyll/Hyde existence. Many people either hated it or didn't understand it, while those who saw the evolution of rock into art realized that this album was helping direct that evolution. As always in everything from movies to books, the difference between art and entertainment became a huge factor in the album's initial commercial lack of success.There was nothing like ""Pet Sounds"" when it came out. Furthermore, the music was very different from what The Beach Boys had done previously. A recipe for commercial disaster. Long time fans of ""Barbara Ann"" and ""Surfing U.S.A."" wondered what these songs were all about. This stuff just wasn't The Beach Boys they knew. Little did most fans know that The Beach Boys they knew never were The Beach Boys they thought they knew.It wasn't until many years later that the complex relationships and creative conflicts between the members of the group were brought to light, and the discovery that Brian Wilson in particular wanted the group to grow in a more mature direction. ""Pet Sounds"" was a very long step in that direction.We look back on ""Pet Sounds"" from our next millenium perspective and want to say, ""What's the big deal?"" It was a very big deal in 1966. ""Pet Sounds"" and ""Sgt. Pepper"" sparked a whole new revolution in rock music the effect of which can never be fully understood or estimated. These albums were the sound of rock music growing up. However, ""Pet Sounds"" was too alien for the typical public taste at the time, and it flopped.But, other musicians loved it; particularly The Beatles. John and Paul recognized the roots of something great, and were strongly influenced by it. Many other rock and pop musicians have pointed to ""Pet Sounds"" as being a big influence on their music. ""Pet Sounds"" was music as art. ""Sgt. Pepper,"" while also striving for art, also managed to be commercially successful. However, there are songs from ""Sgt. Pepper"" which followed well the artistic path of ""Pet Sounds"" that had their own detractors. Unfortunately not everyone understands art.Listening today, ""Pet Sounds"" is somewhat dated. However, listen to it over and over, and you realize that the music is well done. From our perspective we can look back over 25+ years of rock music and realize that ""Pet Sounds"" was ahead of its time. In all the hysteria of The Beatles, ""Pet Sounds"" got lost.""Pet Sounds"" is great rock because of what it was when it was released, and who it influenced.Beyond the influence, there are some really great songs on this CD. ""Sloop John B."" is one of my favorite Beach Boys songs. ""Wouldn't It Be Nice,"" ""That's Not Me,"" ""I Know There's an Answer,"" ""God Only Knows,"" ""Caroline No""...all very good to great songs. Admittedly somewhat mellow, but beautiful.Should you buy this album? Well, depends on what you like. ""Pet Sounds"" refuses to fit into a nice niche. It's not like what The Beach Boys did before it. It is mellow, but it's not a perfect fit into pop music. If you've heard at least 3 or 4 of the songs above, and like them, then you'll like the rest of the CD. If you haven't heard very much of the CD, then either download samples or borrow a copy. I, on the other hand, may need to purchase another copy, because I think the laser diode is knocking too many molecules off my copy, I play it so much.Note that this album has been reissued and remastered and thus this particular version is now the ""old"" version.  You may want to see what features are available and the price of other versions before you buy.  Good luck!"
1,"I must admit this CD was in my shopping cart for quite a while given its genre.  I finally make the plunge when I needed it for free shipping and the first time I played it, I couldn't believe the beautiful purity and fullness of her voice.The music is very interesting also since it is obviuosly country, but these are real talented musicians and the arrangements are incredibly performed and make a country band  really kick-[...] in a cross over jazzy sense in a couple of tunes where you'd never guess this is a band that plays bluegrass.It's worth every one of those stars and one more if they had it.By the way, I found out that the ladies like this CD very much."
1,"It is a well-known fact that Shania and Mutt write and produce the majority of the material she performs.  Come On Over is no exception.I personally love Shania's ballads.  &quot;You're Still the One&quot;, &quot;From This Moment&quot; (with Bryan White), and &quot;You've Got A Way&quot; are all great cuddle songs.I like to pop the CD in my car and roll the windows down for the first four cuts, they are all upbeat, very singable songs, as are &quot;Honey I'm Home&quot;, &quot;That Don't Impress Me Much&quot;, and &quot;Rock This Country&quot;.Come On Over is good, a little over-produced at times, but Shania's powerful voice shines through."
1,Sreisand can sing. This CD captures the easy feel of early 1970s pop. This CD is a great POP collection of songs yet underated and ignored by many fans of that musical era.
1,"'IN SQUARE CIRCLE'The 1985 album by Stevie Wonder is the official follow-up to his classic 1980 album,'Hotter Than July'/There was a 5 year gap between the 2 albums.Inside the 5 year vaccum,Wonder released 2 albums:The half new studio classic 1982 compilation,'STEVIE WONDER'S ORIGINAL MUSIQUARIUM I'a best of decade compilation double album from his 1972-1982 period that included his hits from 'MUSIC OF MY MIND'(1972) to 'ORIGINAL MUSIQUARIUM I'(1982) which included 4 new songs and his original 1984 movie soundtrack album,'The Woman In Red' which included duets with the legendary Dionne Warwick.When finally released in September,1985 'IN SQUARE CIRCLE' was the last Stevie Wonder album that was on the legendary TAMLA(MOTOWN)imprint.The beat of modern technology inspired Wonder's then new disc 'IN SQUARE CIRCLE'/Utilizing a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer,a Linn drum machine,The Kurzwell 250 and the Synclavier.Wonder recorded more than 30 tracks for the album,which delayed it's release in selecting and trimming a what? 3 CD set of 30 tracks to a single CD of 10 tracks.To name a few of the tracks that were rejected and did not appear on the 'IN SQUARE CIRCLE' album are:'Futuristic Bossa Nova'(presumably slowjazz or jazzfunk)Wonder included legendary jazz greats such as Stan Getz & Wynton Marsalis.For 'Brink Road' Wonder wanted to invite Little Richard,Jerry Lee Lewis & Chuck Berry to perform with him on the track.'Free' an inspirational song about GOD with a fusion mix of electronics and a large gospel choir.(The track 'Free' found it's way 2 years later on Wonder's 1987 album,'CHARACTERS')The legendary musician is setting on the planet's dark grayish surface surrounded by it's rocks with a magnificent purple sky in the background.The planet 'IN SQUARE CIRCLE' has ten satellites that surround the musical planet.Inside the album planet's linear notes were written by Theresa Cropper and Stevie Wonder:'Songlife' as Cropper and Wonder described is the cosmic carrier,the one who guided this process.It was her or his psychic assistance that made this message physically possible.As they came together surrounding each other,they prepared themselves to travel in the unending spiral of life 'IN SQUARE CIRCLE' an interesting yet ageless journey into infinite posibilities.These posibilities as Cropper and Wonder described,came into fruition as 'Part-Time Lover'(with additional vocal aid by Luther Vandross)the lead off satellite single from the planet of 'IN SQUARE CIRCLE' is a high tech 1960s Motownish bouncy bounced groove updated in 1980s synthesized soul pop.Having hot love on the side in the game of love in being discreet when 'Part-Time Lovers'/It would be Wonder's last across the board #1 R&B;,Pop hit.'I Love You Too Much' is the funkiest satellite from the planet of 'IN SQUARE CIRCLE'/The song is 'Maybe Your Baby'(From Wonder's classic 1972 album 'Talking Book')updated in mid-eighties technofunk without a rock guitar part.Just only imagine a scorching rock guitar part added to 'I Love You Too Much' it would've reached scalding porportions in the funk rock stratosphere.The track is a lovefunkfest with a classic Wonder phrase to a woman that takes the track over the top:'Baby,baby,you make me feel like you care alot,But I-I-I-I,Honey,I Love you Too Much!'('Maybe three much!')'Whereabouts' the satelite of life where one could be when one is lost,when Wonder bestows the ?uestion:'Where is the missing one?The missing one?'/'Where is the missing one?The missing one? The tender ballad addresses the topics of missing persons,photographic memories,isolation and introspection.Inside the shores of the planet 'IN SQUARE CIRCLE' is the exquisite heartbroken island ballad play,'Stranger On The Shore Of Love'(A satellite of three acts)/The real life reality play is divided into acts I,II,III:Act I:Two people are in love-lucky is she,lucky feels he...Act II:A table for two love vows of 'I Do'A honeymoon out of a dream,who could ask for anything more...Act III:A home on a hill,with love daffodills-And cold winter nights by the fire-What more could be,for she and heThere's more than enough love and yetShe or he starts feeling regret,what do you get?one broken heart...Oh, I don't wanna be-no stranger on the shore of love-with tears and an upset stomach and a broken heart...(Wonder released a funk track on the 1985 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,Berry Gordy's 'The Last Dragon' entitled 'Upset Stomach' which was not included on 'IN SQUARE CIRCLE':It is quite possible that 'Upset Stomach' could be a spinoff from the track,'Stranger On The Shore Of Love' from the line 'I don't wanna have an upset stomach from a broken heart')A romance that ends in heartbreak,that melted underneath the Sun.The Sun's not providing much warmth for one inside the planet of 'IN SQUARE CIRCLE' as described in the next satellite track 'Never In Your Sun'A beauty of a song inside Wonder's mind of kaleidescope love imagery of meeting a beautiful lady at Lover's Park-one rainy April Monday-smiling soft and warm on a clear December Sunday-wearing taffeta and lace-That matched her braided hair-with their coraled beads that sang to me...She said 'Hi' and asked me why was I looking with sorrowWhen there were much brighter days In store for me tomorrowI looked up at her and smiled and said why I don't knowBut would she agree to stay with me? And she said never in your sun...Then she said,I will only come in your pouring rain to relieve the pain...Wonder's ear for intricate melodies for these tender rhythm of back to back tracks of love and heartbreak are stuff of legend.'Spiritual Walkers'(The prayer satellite from the planet of 'IN SQUARE CIRCLE')is a funk spiritual track aimed at those who spread the word of GOD 2 the masses in light,despite those individuals as Stevie mentioned in the track who 'run from their sight,to not hear the Holy word-They sing and they chant,they preach and they speak in tongues you have never heard'Wonder no doubt is aiming the track at those 'Spiritual Walkers' who are living the word of GOD and JESUS,by not forcing religion or religious principles on the masses,but rather to influence or inspire the truth to light for the people.By the same token,there are so called 'Spiritual Walkers' who are 'spiritual frauds' in the pulpit preaching the Bible and comitting unnatural acts of blasphemous sin and corrupt to the core.I wouldn't rank 'Spiritual Walkers' in Wonder's top 10 Ecclesiastic songs,but the track's message for those who spread the word and those who need the word is of relevance.'Land Of LA LA'(Los Angeles,California)another satellite from the planet of 'IN SQUARE CIRCLE'/with it's faint distant rock edges is a tale of young adults leaving their safe small hometown for the danger and excitement of the big city of Los Angeles,CA in search of Hollywood dreams but learn very quickly about survival before being awed by movie stars,great big cars,perrier and fun all day:'He's a big boy now,She's a strong girl-but only the strong survive living in the Land Of LA LA'The funky synthesized bassfunk of 'Go Home' (another funky satellite from the planet of 'IN SQUARE CIRCLE') that narrates life about a pretty girl that had a real good man and a steady job.But the 2 of them just weren't in her heart.She wanted to be close to another man to give him the love she knew he'd need.He then gently turns her down because of the circumstances concerning the both of them and tells her,'Girl you're wrong-go home!'/On the synthesized bassfunk track,Wonder is on the drums,synthesizer,vocoder and is supported by only 2 bandmates:Bob Malach on saxophone and Larry Gittens on trumpet.Gittens's blaring,precise trumpet funk sounds are remeniscent of his trumpet funk grooves back in 1979 on the airy disco Wonderfunk track,'Race Babbling' from Wonder's 1979 double album of plant life,'STEVIE WONDER'S Journey Through The Secret Life of Plants'Wonder adds another slice of sweet romantic heavenly bliss with the 9th satellite of 'IN SQUARE CIRCLE' the beautiful plush ballad,'Overjoyed'/'Overjoyed',originally recorded in 1979,was intended to be on Wonder's ecclectic new age double album,the extravagant 'Journey Through The Secret Life of Plants'/In 1995,Wonder appeared on the BET music program Video Soul to promote his 1995 CD album 'CONVERSATION PEACE'/He sung some of his classics and chatted with host Donnie Simpson about the historical origins behind his classic songs.When discussing the history behind 'Overjoyed',Simpson was at a Wonder concert when Wonder would say:'Here's a song I wanna play for you all,it didn't make my album'(the album was 'STEVIE WONDER'S Journey Through The Secret Life of Plants')The song was 'Overjoyed'/Simpson wondered in ?uestion:'How could this song not make it on an album?'Overjoyed' found it's way on place on 'IN SQUARE CIRCLE' six years later in 1985.Beautified by it's beautiful lyrics and instrumentation from the heavens as Wonder created a beautiful musical soundscape pallet of piano,CS80,environmental percussion:crickets,nightingale and additional bird sounds,ocean,pebbles in pond,stone dropped,crushing leaves on the track.Wonder invites legendary smooth jazz guitarist Earl Klugh to play with him on the track.Longtime Wonder side musician Paul Riser did the string arrangement.Stevie's legendary vocals and lyrics complete the beautiful ballad:'And though you don't believe that they doThey do come true,for did my dreams come trueWhen I looked at you and maybe too,If you would believeYou too might be overjoyed,overloved,over me'(Also for an added visual experience check out the 'Overjoyed' video:Acomplex video of the heavens mixing life,love,romance and sweet heavenly bliss.I love the beautiful lady with Wonder in the video.)The 10th and final satellite from the planet of  'IN SQUARE CIRCLE' Wonder journeys our rocketship in space from the planet IN SQUARE CIRCLE to planet Earth to KEMET (Africa,The Motherland:The Heartbeat of planet Earth) to the biting stinging social commentary of apartheid:'It's Wrong'(Apartheid)/Wonder blasts the white devil regime of oppression in South Africa done 2 the beautiful Bantu People,with blatant powerful lyrics:'The wretchedness of satan's wrath will come to seize you at last'Cause even he frowns upon the deeds you are doingAnd you know deep in your heart,you've no covenant with God'Cause He would never countenance people abusingYou know apartheid's wrong,like slavery was wrong,like the holocaust was wrong(Qha)Wrong/The pain you cause in God's name points only yourself to blameFor the negative karma you will be receiving/'Cause when people are oppressedWith atrocities that test,the future of all mankind won't stand seeing'The rules I need not recite,For you know what's wrong and what's rightSo strike down your barbaric rules and cruel restrictionsThe clock of now says its time for you to make up your mindBefore its too late for you to earn your redemption...Instrumentation on this track is all Stevie including a powerful backbeat with in your face Bantu African protest chants ('Qha!') vocal chants in the background.Stevie also whips out the instrument called the Cora,which is loud and upfront with radiant,powerful silver metallic noises:A musical warning to white racists regimes that oppression done to BLACK PEOPLE,IS STRAIGHT UP WRONG!!!This powerful protest track is also aimed indirectly to negroe devils who support white racists regimes whether in Africa or in the United States or worldwide in general with evil corrupt governmental rule tactics to destroy Black People including people of many ethnic groups WHO WANT JUSTICE,PEACE AND UNITY.Also during this period of 1985,Stevie Wonder along with 47 others was arrested for protesting the South African Embassy for doing apartheid in Washington,D.C./Most of those who were arrested were taken away by police in buses,while Wonder and his longtime aide Ewart Abner,Jr.were taken away in a police squad car.It was also during this period that Stevie Wonder's music was banned in South Africa for a statement he made when he won an oscar for the 1984 original motion picture musical soundtrack album,'The Woman In Red'/In the statement,Wonder declared that he accepted the award 'In the name of Nelson Mandela' who at the time was imprisoned in South Africa,was sentenced in 1964 of planning to overthrow the South African government.1985 was another year of music and political activism for Stevie Wonder which coincided with other political musical events of the year:USA FOR AFRICA & SUN CITY(ARTISTS UNITED AGAINST APARTHEID)in South Africa.In 1986,Stevie embarked on a concert tour.I saw Stevie live in concert when he came to Dallas TX. at the Reunion Arena and he put on a brilliant show.I also have his 1986 concert souvenir booklet which on the front cover of it has an alternative cover with the same cover version as the original album cover,just slightly different.Inside of it,were photographic images of Wonder from his 'IN SQUARE CIRCLE' album photo pictures and pictures of him performing live in concert with quotes from tracks of the album.The concert souvenir program also includes past photos on Wonder during the era of activism in getting Martin Luther King Jr's birthday as a national holiday with Dr King's widow,Correta Scott King.It also includes pictures of him with various celebrities and a 1983 pic of Stevie with the late great Marvin Gaye.'IN SQUARE CIRCLE' is a great album that needs to be re-issued in an expanded CD edition with bonus tracks that need to be included in the expanded CD edition:'Upset Stomach'(the full length CD version from the 1985 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,'BERRY GORDY'S LAST DRAGON')/The beautiful instrumental version of 'Overjoyed' which is on the 45 B-side vocal version of 'Overjoyed'/The 12 inch extended jam funk versions of 'Part-Time Lover'(8:20) with instrumental B-Side(8:20)/'Go Home'(9:22)with instrumental B-Side(8:36)/'Land of LA LA'(8:40)with instrumental B-Side(8:40)/I have all of these versions of extended funkjams of these tracks on 12 inch vinyl,including the beautiful instrumental 45 version of 'Overjoyed'/In retrospect,'IN SQUARE CIRCLE' is Stevie Wonder in synths mode,mixing spirituality,love,politics,protest and the human condition..."
1,"Billy JoelSongs In The AtticTaken from various concerts in 1980, these are live versions of songs from (mainly dismissed) studio albums released between 1971 and 1976.  This Live album presents those early songs in a far superior style than the old studio cuts.  These are excellently performed songs with high energy and fidelity.  This is not a Live `Hits' album but a Live collection that shows just how good the `other' songs can be when performed at their best.This is a thoroughly entertaining album and it rates a well-deserved five stars."
1,"I've always had a lot of respect for A Flock of Seagulls.  These guys have written interesting and catchy music with imagination.  I like the way they combine the keyboard and guitar playing.  Each instrument complements the  other quite nicely.  This debut album from A Flock of Seagulls is very  solid and energetic.  It's in a new wave synth pop direction with an equal  dose of guitar playing.  All ten of the tracks are satisfying.  The album's  musicianship, songwriting, and production are good.  My favorite tunes are  &quot;I Ran,&quot; &quot;Space Age Love Song,&quot; and &quot;D.N.A.&quot;  &quot;Space Age Lovesong&quot; is my favorite song from A Flock of  Seagulls.  That tune has imagination and catchiness all rolled into one.  Mike Score's vocals really soar on it.  It's truly a well-written song.  Mike Score does a nice job with the vocals throughout the album.  His voice  is effective and unique.  &quot;D.N.A.&quot; happens to be a very  impressive instrumental.  Paul Reynolds' guitar work on it is really good.  &quot;I Ran&quot; is also a cool and memorable tune.  &quot;Modern Love is  Automatic&quot; has an interesting intro.  This album has both futuristic  and imaginative qualities.  It's worth a listen."
1,"I just had to buy this album, even though I have an old copy. The fact that it has now been reamstered and with 2 bonus tracks made it a must-buy. I love the music of Simon and Garfunkel, and this is one of my favourite albums. The sound quality is brilliant, the 20 page booklet contains all lyrics, a few photos, the original liner notes, plus a new essay by Bud Scoppa. Even if you own an old copy, I really do recommend that you trade it in for this one, as it has never sounded better than now."
1,"Facelift(1990). Alice In Chains' First Album.In 1990, when Hair Metal such as Nelson and Slaughter still dominated the charts, a drastic change was about to happen. In Seattle, Washington, four bands(Soundgarden, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Alice In Chains) were about to change the face of music forever, giving a slap in the face to the happy-party attitude of previous music, and dishing out depressing songs that appealed to teen rebels(sort of like myself!). Alice In Chains, after the release of their debut album, 'Facelift', became the first band to achieve minor success, scoring the minor rock radio hits ""Man In The Box"" and ""Sea of Sorrow"". Although the album and the hits later became legendary, fans, including myself, typically overlook 'Facelift', instead buying a compilation or 'Dirt'. Is it a mistake that many fans overlook 'Facelift' or not? Read on to find out!Track Ratings-We Die Young- 'Facelift' starts off with ""We Die Young"", a psychotic rocker that resembles early Soundgarden and Black Sabbath, but even heavier and darker. Layne Staley's emotion, as always, leaves me breathless. Great start!Man In The Box- What hasn't been said before? Along with ""Rooster"", ""Man In The Box"" is Alice In Chains biggest hit, and it's no surprise. Cantrell's pounding, sinister power chords, combined with Layne Staley's eerie, yet catchy harmonies raises eyebrows everywhere. Not to be missed.Sea of Sorrow- Basically a classic metal song, ""Sea of Sorrow"" brings back the sound of classic bands like The Scorpions and Aerosmith. Cantrell's riff is reminiscent of retro-Scorpions, while putting in influences from Joe Perry. Layne Staley sings the twisted morals of the song quite well, and it's obvious this is a fan favorite.Bleed The Freak- Starting off like a classic Alice In Chains ballad, ""Bleed The Freak"" is a dark twisted song that has some religious undertones, and seems to be a purging of Layne Staley's faith. Cantrell is brilliant on this song... he reminds me a lot of Zakk Wylde on this song, with a ripping solo and awesome riffs. Brilliant... spooky.I Can't Remember- ""I Can't Remember"" begins with a doomy acoustic passage and builds-up to a doomed rocker about amnesia. Staley is the perfect voice... his doomed tale is perfectly sung. Jerry Cantrell shines with his guitarmanship. An oddly beautiful song.Love, Hate, Love- Oddly, this sounds like a mix of The Scorpions and Metallica, kind of a spooky, slow, battle between Layne Staley and his mind. Cantrell plays classically influenced riffs, and they fit perfect... once again, oddly beautiful... there are no words.It Ain't Like That- After a few slower songs, Alice In Chains takes it up a notch with ""I Ain't Like That"", a headbanging affair of killer power chords and vocals that demand your attention. Maybe your typical Alice In Chains song, but, does it ever get old?Sunshine- Kind of a bluesy song, ""Sunshine"" is not as gloomy as Alice In Chains' usually is, combining Cantrell's bluesy(and punk) influenced melodies with Layne Staley's punkish vocals. Good.Put You Down- Cantrell starts off ""Put You Down"" with his hopelessly addictive blues-metal riff, which, along with Layne Staley's heartbroken vocals, suck you into the song and you can't get away. Just plain cool...Confusion- ""Confusion"" is another gloomy, dark, and downright depressing song courtesy Alice In Chains. Layne Staley is front and center, spilling his secrets in a gloomy whisper. Cantrell, as usual, impresses.I Know Somthin(Bout You)- ""I Know Somethin(Bout You)"" is a funky song, featuring awesome blues and funk riffs from Cantrell(in fact, this sounds a lot like The Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Staley is more upbeat, just singing this song sarcastically. Impossibly cool, and a different song for Alice In Chains.Real Thing- ""Real Thing"" begins a lot like ""Sea of Sorrow"", building up slowly, and finding Layne Staley at a whisper discussing the truth about addiction. This song is actually quite resounding, and Staley's cries are quite memorable. Cool song... Cantrell shines here.Overall, 'Facelift' is a great offering from Alice In Chains, and hooked me from beginning to end. Every song on here is a winner, even though many sound like another Alice In Chains song you've heard before, they don't sound overdone or rehashed. While 'Facelift' isn't as good as 'Dirt', this is a damn good album from Alice In Chains, and any fan that passed this up would surely regret that decision.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF ALICE IN CHAINS, METAL, GRUNGE, AND ROCK MUSIC! DON'T OVERLOOK THIS ALBUM, AND IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!Killer Cuts- 'We Die Young', 'Man In The Box', 'Sea of Sorrow', 'Bleed The Freak', and 'I Know Somethin(Bout You)'.Also Recommended-Dirt- Alice In ChainsTaken By Force- The ScorpionsRide The Lightning- MetallicaThanks For Reading!"
1,"OK I'll admit I'm a bit of a non-fan of this band though you wouldn't know it if you trawled through my CD collection, each darn studio effort these boys put out up to Keep the Faith is present and accounted for. But even though I'm an avowed sceptic when it comes to this mob it must be admitted their brand of pop metal AOR shifted some serious units and the band did pen some great teen rock anthems all within a G rated atmosphere of uplifting good times.So at the juncture post New Jersey it's utterly justified for this mob to produce a best of for their loving minions of perennial 14 year old housewives and really, for the price you can get this for nowadays there are no excuses for even the very very occasional fan not to pick up this grab bag of BJ's finest moments.A quick flick down the track listing will show you that megahits like Livin' On A Prayer, Keep the Faith and You Give Love A Bad Name are all present and accounted for. The album is actually fairly rock orientated in a way that flies in the face of the bands girlie image and some real soul is injected into proceedings by the inclusion of Wanted Dead or Alive and the Jon solo hit Blaze of Glory. The collection reaches all the way back to their debut for their initial calling card of Runaway and the musically different feel of In & Out of Love shows that this band were capable of writing in forms other than the cliche.Sure there are a wad of soft rock ballads, some of which really should have you reaching for the sick bag (Bed of Roses anyone?), but the zest and dead seriousness with which even the ballads are attacked means that it's hard to fault the philosophical headspace from which they come.A look at the track listing should decide it for you but I would recommend picking this up if you've tapped your foot along to any of these songs on the radio."
1,"I think this is by far the best CD I have ever purchased.  The singing is superb, the music above excellent.  If you are new to bluegrass and Alison Krauss this is a good introduction to both!"
1,"I was lucky enough to see this young lady (and young she was!) on tour twice when this album had just come out, at the Kalamazoo State Theater along with Hot Rize!, another good old fashioned bluegrass treat.  These were the days when Krauss was more famous as a fiddle wunderkind than a pop sensation, and when her voice sounded like a young Brenda Lee or Jimmy Martin's kid sister, rather than the limp but no doubt moneymaking dishrag it does today (Krauss's best contribution these days is her production work with new groups like Nickel Creek.)These songs....none of which were written by Krauss herself, by the way...are fine examples of what in the eighties was termed ""newgrass"", a bluer than bluegrass, saucy treatment of American string band tradition.  The best example might be  Union Station's version of (wait for it) the Allman Brothers' ""Midnight Rider"", which as an Allmans fan I like better than the original.  Many of the other songs are written by John Pennell, founder of the band, still a member, and one who can be credited with discovering Krauss' talent as early as five years before this disc was recorded.The personnel of Union Station has morphed throughout the years, and a few of the songs are led vocally by musicians who are no longer in the band.  But most are Krauss' babies, and she shows them off like a proud country mama.  If you have never had a chance to hear Alison Krauss during her early years on the road, do check this, her solo album, or both, out.  Your heart will leap to the whirlwind melodies, and you will thank yourself, believe me."
1,"Back in the early 80's as an unsuspecting teenager who'd heard ""Opportunity"" off of Get Happy on our then excellent AAA station, K-99 (r.i.p.), I ordered Get Happy and Armed Forces when my sister and I convinced our parents to join the Columbia record club (basically a rip-off, but oh the music I discovered).  From that point forward I was an E.C. fan.  Cue forward a few years as a junior in college and this album is released to little press or fanfare but I think, what the heck, I'll check it out.  At first I was disappointed.  Not quite as hooky or instantly ""gettable"" as some of Costello's older material, it's one that over time has grown to be my favorite.  While musically it may be less accessible (at first), lyrically it is Costello with his finest, most caustic, biting wit expressed in screams and shouts that make you feel like your in the recording booth with him.  ""Blue Chair"" is probably one of my favorite Costello songs, ever, and that's amongst many others I could throw in that.  Once this album grabs you, you will feel emotionally wrung out every time you listen to it - use headphones for full effect."
1,"I first heard TFF via the Mad World video with Roland doing his &quot;can't dance to save my life&quot; routine at the end of a pier.  I always thought it was strangely in tune with the muscial style so that didn't worry me.This album contains IMHO the best TFF singles in Mad World, Pale Shelter and Change.  Although the singles from the second were undoubtedly more successful worldwide, the blend of synth and acoustic guitar on this album raises it above SFTBC.The booklet explains that the duo used their love of a pyschotherapist called Janov to shape the lyrical tone of their songs.  Nearly 20 years later, I can see this theme running through the songs, but I was 15 when this came out and was only interested in synth music (I'm not a great lyrical analyser).This album contains a few remixes, most OK, but also throws on non-album single The Way You Are.  Curt seems to think that the intricate rhythms were just trying to be clever and that's why the song didn't have the success of those previous (albeit on second asking).  The drum rhythms are very clear on the re-mastered CD, it's not the rhythms that are at fault here - it's just that the song is incredibly weak compared to everything-else on this CD."
1,"its easy to declare any wu clansman as underrated (with the exception of meth) but i do believe gza along with ghost and rakewon are among the better emcee's in hip hopduel of the iron mics starts the album off with a typical wu feel, that track along with gold, labels, investigative reports are classics.the other tracks are all solid, making this an album you can put on and leave it...but they are just that solid. that is what puts this from 5 to 4 starsa great cd"
0,cOMEON- AN ALBUMthis GREAT-no one is going to read all the accurate 5 star reviews- would you? me either. list the 8 great Debute albums and this will be listed on most. I wonder what universe this would not be considered great- not a universe I would want to be in.  If you REALLY need to be convinced read all the 5 star reviews.
1,"After the commercial failure of her occasionally brilliant but mostly tepid self-titled debut album, apparently Maria McKee decided upon a throw-enough-styles-at-the-wall-and-see-what sticks approach for her follow-up, presumably so she could perhaps give Geffen a successful,  sales-wise album, but still be able to indulge her muse. So we get  Maria-does-Patsy (Only Once), Maria-does-Motown (I'm Gonna Soothe You),  Maria-does-gospel (I Forgive You), Maria-does-alt.country (Precious Time),  and no less than two Van Morrison covers. And while she does them all well,  there is a pervasive feeling of playing it conservative and taking no  chances throughout this otherwise excellent album, which is not necessarily  a bad thing, but one comes to expect a risk or two from Maria McKee; that  she mostly fails to deliver here only subtracts from my enjoyment  slightly.The aforementioned Morrison covers are outstanding-especially  My Lonely Sad Eyes (which I saw her perform on Chevy Chase's short-lived  late night talk show!) which gets an almost Los Lobos style arrangement,  and she does a swooping, frenzied rendition of Young Lovers Do (one of the  few times she really cuts loose vocally here). I absolutely love I'm Gonna  Soothe You, which is  smooth and soulful, and the Jayhawks help make  Precious Time a lovely country ballad. The album's closer and title track  is a rollicking, enjoyable tune, and one imagines that they had a lot of  fun recording that one.Don't get me wrong-this is a great record. It's  just a little more mainstream and safe than I like to hear from MM. And  that alone might make YGSTGS the McKee album of choice for a lot of people.  Of course, it might have been mine too if the commercial demise of YGSTGS  had not prompted Maria to go on and record the brilliant, nervy Life Is  Sweet, which is one of the bravest, most exciting records I've ever heard.  Unfortunately, Life Is Sweet has been deleted, so you can't buy it except  second-hand, but it's worth the effort to track down, believe me. So  really, you should get You Gotta Sin To Be Saved, and you will enjoy it,  but keep an eye out for Life Is Sweet as well."
1,"This cd kicked off Michael's great run of top ten hits.  And, this cd was done before Michael had all of the surgerys and tried to become something he's not."
1,"It's hard to find a Stevie Wonder CD where almost every song is good. I own several of them and am a huge fan.  My favorites on this CD are Rocket Love, All I Do, and Lately.  The only song that I don't like is Happy Birthday. Buy it and you won't be sorry...I personally feel that it is one of his best!!!"
1,"Most of the younger generation (those born in the 1990's) are probely familer with Flavor Flav with all the TV spotlight he gets on VH-1. Yet back in the Day when Flavor was cracked out, he was with the likes of Chuck D and Terminator X in a very important rap group Public Enemy. This is my favorite PE album of the bunch. They say three times is a charm, and since this was thier third effort, not only did they manage to pull off their best album, but one of the top ten best albums in hip-hop EVER! Almost every song here is a Gem, and for all those that listen to garbage hip-hop (50 Cent, Juvinelle, Little Jon, D-12) then maybe you should use those CD's as coasters or frisbees, and pick up Fear of a Black Planet to hear what REAL Hip-Hop soundsl like. Unfortanltly, the band started to go downhill from here, with two less then steller efforts after this one, and then completely vanishing into thin air. With the return of Flavor outta nowhere being on VH-1's ""The Surreal Life"" and 2 other shows on VH-1, it seems like Public Enemy also came back. I have heard some of the newer material, but it just doesn't live up to this. This is a real important piece of hip-hop history, as a matter of fact, MUSIC history. Please Put this one in your collection if you dont have it. ENJOY"
1,"I have the remastered version released in 1995 which features three bonus tracks.  This album was released in 1975, just when Elton John was at the peak of superstardom.  During this time, there was nothing Elton could do wrong.The hit single from this album was ""Someone Saved My Life Tonight"", which was apparently the only Top 40 single from the album.  It reached #4 on the Billboard charts.  But, that doesn't mean that there wasn't anything more that was worthy of another single that could have been released.  The album itself was at the Top of the album charts for seven weeks; it was one of the Top 10 albums for 1975 for what seemed like forever.  The FM station that I enjoyed listening to in Detroit played other tracks from this album.  The radio favorites were ""Tower of Babel"", ""Tell Me When The Whistle Blows"", and ""Writing.""  My personal favorites from this album were ""Better Off Dead"" and ""We All Fall in Love Sometimes/Curtains.""Yes, this album alone was probably the last great Elton John album (with a cool colorful cover), because after this album he released ""Rock of The Westies,"" which really wasn't all that great even though his hit ""Island Girl"" went to #1.  I just didn't care for that album, so Elton John started to become less of an interest to me from that release forward.Now, this 1995 release of ""Captain Fantastic"" has three great bonus tracks, which include the two #1 singles of ""Lucy in The Sky With Diamonds"" and ""Philadelphia Freedom."" How's that for making a great album even better?  Plus, a B-side single ""One Day at a Time"" (which was also done by John Lennon).  Although, I enjoyed many of Elton John's singles over the next 20 plus years, my Elton John album collection ended with ""Captain Fantastic."""
1,"Aw no, not another hippy. Not another counter-culture lifestyle mullah. Ok, it looks that way but first, let's check Nick Drake's hippie-dom credentials;1, Centre Parting ? - Check.2, Floral Shirt/Dungarees ? - Check.3, Being on Island Records ? - Check.4, Standing in the woods with an acoustic guitar looking meaningful ? - Check.So, he meets the criteria, but does he have a pleasing, cynic-bashing, soulful music, designed (in a genuinely conspiratorial sense ) to make your wobbling correspondent eat his facetious words with side-orders of tofu and quorn?Of course he does, 'Bryter Layter' is yet another excellent surprise.This one is screaming 'winner' before you even get to the music. The sleeve reveals he has John Cale and Richard Thompson (who is rapidly becoming one of my all time heroes) in tandem, so you instinctively know he's running from the winning blocks.Drake's from the Cat Stevens school of smoothy folk-pop but he's far from drone and earnestness. He's got torrential strings, ringing guitar, and more impressively, good songs in abundance.A big music (in a small sense) but it compliments his sweet lyrics and melodies without swamping them.Thompson's influence is immeasurable. Not just here but in music generally. He's enriched works from Sandy Denny to David Thomas and his enigmatic-isms are seized on by Drake who uses them as a platform for his own successes, a building-block to his own particularly pleasing house of tricks.On top, he's got the best use of flute and strings since Tull's sumptuous 'Reasons For Waiting', (which a fair block of 'BL' is very like) and a vital, vibrant album results.Sure, Drake looks all Woodstock, wet and wimpy but his voice has a sandpaper smoothness, and his songs very definitely have depth, insight and unity. He ticks the creative boxes much more than the (deliciously) sarcastic ones above, and therefore he emerges with kudos and no shortfall of credit.He's nowhere near the genius Roy Harper is, (See? That Thompson again!) but 'BL' is firmly on the right track and can fight it's corner with vim and plenty of pride.So, puns well and truly on the back-burner, (and isn't it cute the way that my reviews are circular?) one last condition..Does Nick Drake have a deserved 5-star brilliant album ? - Check."
1,"This album still sounds so good.  The songs are simple but driving with great rythm lines and great drumming.  Mr. Danzig has recently in my opinion entered his fat Elvis mode(if you get a chance, you should watch the online video of him getting punched out for being an insufferable jerk), but there is no question as to the brilliance of his vocals on this album.  His voice(to continue the analogy) sounds like a possessed Elvis.  It's amazing.  Angry but in tune.  Static Age is much more in the punk vein of the Ramones, and less like bands the Germs or Black Flag, which Earth A.D. sounds more like.  The songs are all great sing alongs.  Anthems even.  I suppose his lyrics aren't for everyone, but I personally view them as ironic in that sort of dark humor kind of way.  Even if punk isn't your normal cup of tea, you should still give this album a try."
1,This album featuring George Michael is one of the best albums ever made. It sold over a million copies and had a number of hit singles and videos. This album has always been mainstream since its release. Careless Whisper and Everything She Wants are my favorite tracks on a great album that has no weak tracks.
1,"Brian McKnight released in 1992 still stands the test of the time as a classic debut. The CD which featured the huge hit One Last Cry still gets me misty eyed when I hear it. Brian McKnight, with his brand of songwriter-driven, piano-man quiet storm, was unique among 1990s male solo singers, and unexpectedly became one of the genre's biggest (and only) stars, with each album building on the previous one's success. There's two other very strong songs on this disc The Way Love Goes and the sentimental piano ballad Never Felt This Way."
1,"I can't imagine what I could say about LAYLA that you haven't read or heard ad nauseum already.  I'll just point out that it is, along with only a handful of other Rock records, an actual piece of art, not just a band fulfilling a contractual obligation or a series of ineffectual attempts at charting a single in order to make money.This is the real deal, an artist poring heart and soul into his music to tell a story of heartbrake, dispair and depression.  And, while everyone has heard the guitar poetry and the blind rage of &quot;Layla,&quot; it is the drunken bravado of &quot;Key To The Highway&quot; and the almost religious glorification of the other on Hendrix's &quot;Little Wing&quot; that makes LAYLA AND OTHER ASSORTED LOVE SONGS one of the classics for me.This is an absolute masterpiece, one of the greatest Rock albums ever recorded."
1,"By 1980 The Jacksons had released 3 albums, ''The Jacksons'', ''Going Places'' and ''Destiny'', under the CBS label. Their fourth album became the most successful of the four. The album peaked at No. 10 in the US chart and No. 13 in the UK.Michael Jackson's studio album ''Off The Wall'' had already been release to the public, enjoying considerable success. Triumph is a good set and at this point in time the last good record from The Jacksons. The follow-up ''Victory'' did nothing for the group and is, in my opinion, an utter bore.The album opens with the dramatic, over-the-top ''Can You Feel It''. A fanfare holds the listener's attention, soon we are introduced to a disco-like beat and introduced to the message of the song-we should all live in harmony. The subject is often repeated within Michael Jackson's solo works- ''Heal The World'', ''HIStory'' etc. ''Can You Feel It'' is a favourite among listeners of ''Triumph'' with its over-dramatic sound and the catchy chorus. Personally it's a fave of mine as well as the video accompany the song. By 1980's standard the music video was impressive. Lifted as the third single off the album and landed at a disappointed No. 77 in the US chart.Next up is ''Lovely One'', the first single off Triumph. A fusion between the ''Off The Wall'' sound and that of the ''Destiny'' album. The typical story of a guy wanting a girl, yet the girl is playing hard to get. It landed at No. 12 in the US and it was the most successful single off the album.Your Ways'' is among the best songs on ''Triumph''. Michael Jackson's eerie vocal and up-beat chorus bland incredible well together. My favourite unreleased track from a Jacksons album ever. ''Everybody'' is a call-out for everyone to get on the dancefloor and dance your booty off. Not one of the great track on the album. The sweet vocals work quite well with the beat. The sound is quite dated at this point. A nice upbeat track, but not by any means a masterpiece.''This Place Hotel, formerly know as ''Heartbreak Hotel'', was written solely by Michael Jackson. The sound effect and the ''horror'' sound might have inspired Rod Temperton to write ''Thriller'' for the record of the same name. The ''scream'', in the beginning of the song, is credited to his sister LaToya Jackson. Not the most impressive start to begin your singing career with, but hey everyone has to start somewhere right?. ''This Place Hotel'' is a story of revenge-boy meets girl, dumps girl and have to face the consequences some 10 years later. Released as the second single. It managed to climb to the No. 22 on the US chart.''Time Waits For No One'' is a lovely ballad. Michael Jackson opens the track with his vulnerable singing and sets the pace for the rest of the song. A bit sugary, but a nice melody. A favourite among fans, not a personal favourite of mine. Too sappy for my  liking.''Walk Right Now'' is among my favourite Jackons' songs ever. The trampy chorus and the prominent bass guitar carry the tune though-out the song. The subject is familiar to Jackson. A girl refusing to take no for an answer. She hammers, battles and screams, but it does no good, she is told to ''Walk Right Now''. One of best track on ''Triumph''. It was released as the fourth single.The two final songs ''Give It Up'' and ''Wondering Who'' are the weakest songs on the album. They are the main reason why this album don't get that perfect 5 stars. They are mediocre at best.I consider ''Triumph'' to be a better set than those of several Michael Jackson solo records. It is rarely given notice by the public in general. It is simply quite underrated in my opinion. ''Triumph is a good buy if you are a huge admirer of MJ's solo works-''Off The Wall'' and ''Thriller'' and  also if you like a bland of pop perfection with a twist of disco type of songs.Overall Rate: 9,5/10"
1,"This CD has been stuck on the shelves of my collection, unplayed for ten years.  It is only now as I systematically work through the collection ..., that I realise what a gem I've overlooked.I've been trying to work out why, although her sales have been respectable, Julia has never achieved great commercial success.  I guess her main failing is to have launched her career in the era of dance.  In general the public wanted toe-tapping, extrovert singles.  But Julia is more of an inward-looking chanteuse of jazz-tinged songs of her own composition.  Singers have to be very, very distinctive to bring that segment to the masses.For this album, she'd dispensed with the expensive US session musicians used on the first album and brought together a high-calibre band she could also tour with.There are some gorgeous numbers on this album.  I particularly like 'Your Lovely Face'.  Many of the songs are best played when they can have your full attention -- I find that driving in the dark along very familiar roads works for me.  I'm slightly less keen on the Latin rhythm songs, but that's a purely personal view."
1,"Man,this album still sounds fresh today. These grooves still have the power to move your mind,body & soul. I find it so fascinating that after all these years,these Jamz haven't lost their touch & still Blows the Mind. The Gap Band III never misses a beat. Each cut displays the Gappers'Depth,Range & Musical Diversity. I love this CD so much I'm detailing every song because every track struck a chord with me.""When I Look In Your Eyes""-A Slinky,Disco-Funk Vamp that seduces you to head for the dancefloor & strut your stuff to the sound of Charlie Wilson's Vocal Scatting.""Yearning For Your Love""-Breath-Taking. Mind-Blowing. Truly one of the best Funk Ballads put out on Wax. Charlie Wilson brings this song to life with his Soul-Exuding Performance. You can just feel the Emotion & Expression he sings with,deep down in your gut.""Burn Rubber On Me""-Simmering Funk. Funk On Fire. Funk in Full Throttle. 'Nuff Said.""Nothin' Comes To Sleepers""-Such a realistic song about life. It speaks the truth so frankly & honestly it hurts. Charlie's vocals,full of loneliness & desolation resonates with me on a personal level because I've lost someone I really loved. Anyone who's been through a breakup knows how painful it is & can easily relate to this song's lyrics. Music is always the best therapy & Charlie & the rest of the gap gang provide the perfect musical backdrop with this Introspective Classic. Charlie's Vocals are accompanied only by Bass & Piano.""Are You Living""-Aspirational & Energetic Dance-Oriented Funk with a melodic Earth,Wind & Fire Riff.""Sweet Caroline""-Charlie creates another mellow & heartfelt slow jam. His crooning simply melts your heart.""Humpin'""-A Loud & Proud Rambunctious Romp of Burstin'-With-Fun-Funk. A Funkin',Humpin'Good Time. The Gappers cook up a Stanky Groove.""The Way""-Melodic & Hypnotic Uptempo Tune with an Infectious Hook.""Gash Gash Gash""-A Jam with Many Pockets & Electronically-Altered Vocals. Smokin'."
1,"In 1987 Alison was only 15, and some of the songs on this CD are kind of &quot;honky-tonky&quot;.  In &quot;Song For Life&quot; the lyric begins &quot;I don't drink as much as I used to....&quot; and it's a little incongruous putting the words together with the 15 year-old voice.  Her vocal tone was a little twangy and nasal-sounding, almost strident as she belted out some of these tunes, and I wonder if she was influenced maybe a little by some of the Nashville Big-Hair bunch like Reba.Still.... if she had not appeared until today and suddenly this recording appeared, it would be at least as head-turning today as it was 15 years ago.  No other vocalist in the genre approaches this kind of material with this kind of instrumentation with THAT kind of voice.  Alison surrounded herself by superstars like Sam Bush and Jerry Douglas, so the supporting cast was top-notch.In her first recording she was both astonishingly new and talented, but also showed great promise of things to come.  In the recordings that followed she has unfailingly measured up to that promise. Even in her first record she began showing her taste for sorrowful mournful tunes of doomed love, even on uptempto tunes like &quot;Don't Follow Me&quot; and the title &quot;Too Late to Cry&quot;.  She also began demonstrating her talent for beautiful slow ballads like &quot;Gentle River&quot;.Required stuff for those who want the complete Alison Krauss collection, but I knock it down to 4 stars because the maturity of her voice and mastery of material would show up in full on later recordings."
1,"I've been a fan of Redman since his cameo appearances on the EPMD albums.Redman's combination of hard core rhymes and beats with a twist of humor make his style very unique. &quot;Muddy Waters&quot; is definitely his best work and has to go down as one of the best albums of alltime. If not for Red's verses alone then definitely for the 5-star production. Red's beats are so layered and thick that after listening to the verses to the point of memorization I actually found myself trying to tune Red out to catch all the distinct samples in the beats. The production is so fresh and innovative that even if you don't like Red's flow then the beats will still have you jumping around. The song &quot;Creepin&quot; contains a sample from the gang movie &quot;The Warriors&quot; as the hook. It fits perfectly in the song. There will definitely be no song skipping on this album. Red spits hard on every verse and the production is award winning. From skits to songs, beginning to end this Redman album is my favorite of all time and it will be yours too so purchase it today."
1,"This, &quot;China&quot; and the &quot;Bladerunner&quot; soundtrack are probably the three pinnacles of Vangelis's work. And in the manner of the latter two, &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; offers up music which shifts  through a variety of moods, styles, and evocations, all handled with a  stupendous command of both the studio and the music created therein. The  album's title really sums things up here; Vangelis takes the listener from  both blissful and powerful symphonic visions of heaven, to dark and  foreboding views of hell. Even the Jon &amp; Vangelis collaborative track  here, &quot;So Far Away, So Clear&quot;, really fits well, in my opinion.  But where things really shine is in Part II, where Vangelis shows his  command of both some very tranquil and achingly beautiful music based  around wordless Greek folk vocals, as well as a couple of sections where  his music shows that it can stand up against the likes of avant-gardists  such as Kryzystof Penderecki and George Crumb, both of whose musics bear a  resemblance to parts of this latter half of this album. So, herein you will  find much variety. &quot;New Age&quot;? Uh...bits of it. Pigeonholing this  in that really cheapens it. It's so much more, and so much more complex."
1,"Hard to believe this concert was actually part of a fundraiser for 1972 Democratic Presidential-nominee George McGovern (who would go on to lose to Nixon).  You would never know listening to this incredible CD.  Barbra is in GORGEOUS voice, hitting all her signature notes with ease and finesse.  There's something about this performance that definitely transcends her earlier concerts in the 1960's.  The voice now is a bit more mature and knowing, still singing with plenty of power to spare, but now with a sense of ""woman"" in her interpretations.""People"" ""Don't Rain On My Parade"" ""Starting Here, Starting Now"" now all have a lived-in sense of feeling that her earlier 1960's performances somehow lacked.  Her interplay with the audience is PRECIOUS !  Streisand's audience command is definitely underrated with all her talk of stage fright.  You wouldn't know it listening to her interaction with the crowd.  She's very funny !The CD becomes invaluable with her rare performances of ""Where You Lead"" ""Stoney End"" (one of her biggest ""Rock"" hits) and the Burt Bacharach composition ""Sing"" (popularized by the Carpenters), songs she would never sing in public again for some reason.  This performance was taped just at the start of Barbra's transition from singing Broadway songs to her attempt to be more ""Rock"" oriented, so it's a nice combination of songs from both eras in her storied career.  A Definitely ""Must Have"" from one of the greatest entertainers of the last century.  Most would not argue with that assessment."
1,"I agree with many of the previous reviews; this is a grossly overlooked album. JJ is a lyrical satirist with a bulls-eye view. I love it when he sings ""Sometimes love grows like a flower or it grows like a tumor. Love shows that god has a sense of humour."" Joe's poetry crackles with verve, spunk and dash."
1,"a detailed drawing of a huge heart of stone, Cher sitting next to it(with big hair)and from a distance...it all looked like a skull! Some used-CD's stores may have one festering in their bargain bins(I found it on cassette). The music doesn't reflect that original cover(may be why they changed it): it's power pop, heavy on lovelorn ballads. Very entertaining, but not exactly varied, colorful or substantial. Probably the best Cher from this period however, as &quot;Cher&quot;(with &quot;I Found Someone&quot;)and &quot;Love Hurts&quot; were slim on the hits. B+"
1,"Let me say, this is GZA's second solo release. His first release ""Words From The Genius"" quickly went out of print and you cant find it anywhere so this is his ""main"" first album. What is there to say about it? That its insanely good in so many ways. This album is grimey in so many ways its hard to explain! Let me break down my opinions for you.The lyrics, GZA is the best lyricist out of Wu-Tang Clan. And this album can sure prove that. His lyrics are incredible. His rhyming schemes, he switches them up, uses different styles all the time its just hard to explain his rhyming abilities. He has so many good rhymes you cant ""oh that ones good"" cause they all are! If you read the lyrics to this album and arent amazed then you probably like bubblegum rap or your just too ignorant to undertstand real emcees! GZA's lyrics and flow go perfectly with the production also. GZA put his heart into this album lyrically with everything he got. He speaks on the REAL topics that other emcees dont spit about. This by far is GZA's best work and always will be. One of the best solo albums of all time.Production wise, man this is where the album is top notch. Dark, grimey all in one album! There isnt one track on the album that isnt grimey, it all is! RZA put his heart into producing this album. He did every single track and its great. Hard bangers, great loops following the beat. Most people love the album because of the production, and I dont criticize them for liking it, its HOTT! Came out in 1995, and its still MAD hott here 11 years later. Only if RZA still produced now like he did with this style. But trust me this production is off the chain! RZA is the true production genius.Overall, this album is a must have. If ANYONE tells you anything negative about the album, they are ignorant. This album is awesome. Just read the reviews and you will notice that. Perfect lyrics and perfect production make a perfect album.

1,"What more can be said of this album?  EVERYONE knows the songs and it's incrdible history.  Simply put, this album is a staple like bread, milk or butter.  You can't be without a copy.  Now comes this special edition and for all the original's gretness, this one outshines it!Remember the incredible remastering done on HIStory?  Well imagine that applied to the entire Thriller album.  The sound is unbelievable!  Everyhting is so crisp, full and alive!  The songs practically leap out of the speakers.  You've never heard Thriller like this before!The gold colored cd clocks in at 72:32 with a total of 21 tracks (9 remastered hits), 6 new photos in the booklet, interviews, a demo and two rare songs.  Unfortunately these new tracks aren't numbered in the booklet or on the jewel case, so you'll have to memorize their order.I've always liked 'Someone in the Dark' from the E.T. Storybook, but hardly ever listened to my recording as I was afraid of damaging it.  So it's great to finally have a superb recording of it that I can listen to over and over again.  It's a touching (some might say sappy) song about finding someone special then loosing them.The Billie Jean demo is pretty short (only 2:20), has decent sound quality and is really insightful.  The melody and rhythm is exactly like the finished recording, yet the lyrics aren't finalised.  It's almost like the lyrics were an afterthought to the beat.  Incrdible for it's peak in to MJ's creative process.'Carousel' sounds like a completed song but only runs 1:40.  It's very 70's sounding and is overflowing with refrences to sugar and children.  Sample lyric, &quot;She's from a world of popcorn and candy&quot;.  Ultimately I'm glad the song was cut, but I would've like to hear the entire song.The section where Qunicy and Rod talk about how the Vincent Price sectin came to be is really entertaining.  Then we even get to hear the recording session!  Hearing Vincent Price separated from the song highlights his talent and well honed technique.  It's a joy to hear this and the extra verse is exceptionally creepy.You're sure to listen to the extra songs multiple times and the interviews make for a good listen once or twice.  That plus the amazing remastering of the original album makes this a must have replacement for all die hard MJ fans and a necessary addition for anyone still not in posession of it.  It's a thriller!"
1,"It's all covers of songs by doo-wop singers, girl groups, Motown acts, et al., and it's choice. Laura Nyro and the three members of Labelle (Sarah Dash, Nona Hendryx, and Patti LaBelle) tear into these familiar tunes with great gusto. The live tracks at the end of the CD, including &#34;(You Make Feel Like) A Natural Woman&#34; and &#34;Up on the Roof,&#34; are in a word, terrific."
1,"This aptly entitled album is the first in a triplet of albums recorded at the ""Honky Chateau"" (Chteau d'H&eacute;rouville) in the Oise Valley, France, all three of which were Elton's first huge chart-toppers.  Notwithstanding the terrifying success of GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD, the third in the trilogy and the one which is held up by critics as his own Sgt Pepper, the pinnacle of his success and the favorite of fans all over the world, I personally believe HONKY CHATEAU is the better album of the three (the second being DON'T SHOOT ME I'M ONLY THE PIANO PLAYER).  In many ways it establishes the duo of Elton and Bernie as the greatest pair of song writers since Lennon-McCartney, and it establishes Elton's fine quartet as one of the most talented bands to grace the musical landscape of the 70's.  This is the band which would usher Elton John to the height of his career, and which would firmly plant him in the seat of mega-stardom and true successor to The Beatles as one of the greatest performers in history.  The 50's had Elvis, the 60's had The Beatles, and without a doubt, Elton John was the King of rock and roll in the 70's.  He would be the last as well, before the offal of divergent amalgams of pop music turned the recording industry into a free-for-all with every subgenre one can possibly think up both branching off in different directions and diffusing into homogenous pabulum.  Many critics, both arm-chair and professional have said the 70's was rife with genre and subgenre and no cohesive direction for pop but one artist was indeed holding the middle road on a recognizable course that was the trail blazer for the growth of rock.  While many experiments we now hail as ""Prog Rock"" were technologically and artistically expanding the medium of rock, and R&B; was infusing with rock and jazz into another form of entertainment at the local ""Disco"", and ""California Rock"" and ""Southern Rock"" were grabbing up huge chunks of radio real estate, Elton John and Bernie Taupin and bandmates were driving a familiar vehicle for us, a bus on which we all sat comfortably in awe of inspired lyrical wit and unparalleled musicianship.  ELTON JOHN, TUMBLEWEED CONNECTION, and MADMAN ACROSS THE WATER were a triplet of near Dylanesque fok-rock, hidden treasures for the illuminati that were spread around by word of mouth and greedily eaten like fruit from the tree of knowledge.  We who were illulminated, or so we thought, had already decided that Elton John was candidate most likely to succeed, it was almost an ""Ah Duh!"" and not to take away from the proficient lovability of The Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd, ELO, Led Zeppelin, Queen, and a handful of others whose stars were about to burst forth as well, all of them sat on thrones of their own making, but Elton John had a certain ""?"" (we call it the X Factor now) that appealed across every perceptible border.  You could be a diehard progressive rocker, a disco lover, country-rocker, or just a basic old-time rock-n-roller, if you listened to and loved music, Elton John was in your collection.The Chateau is a 300 year old Villa rife with history.  A building where Chopin once lived, in the valley where Van Gogh was buried, where a French film score composer built a recording studio, discovered by The Grateful Dead, and then became the environment for classics: Pink Floyd's Obscured By Clouds, Cat Stevens' Catch Bull At Four, T-Rex's The Slider (all recorded in the same year as this album), and would be utilized in the future by David Bowie, Bad Company, The Bee Gees, Fleetwood Mac and others.  To say the least, it was a very magical place, and the fact that it produced all three of Elton's ""masterpieces"" (additionally, I will argue that CAPTAIN FANTASTIC AND THE BROWN DIRT COWBOY belongs in that category) just verifies that statement.  The product of those recordings was utterly fantastic, and the songs that resulted in HONKY CHATEAU are nothing short of perfection.  The recording sessions were so pristinely perfect that only one recording could be lifted from the sessions as a bonus track to this remastered CD, an obviously erroneous choice of fast electric version of Slave, which was wisely slowed down and slide into the retinue of antebellum folk.Amy, Suzie, Mellow, and Slave, all positively drip of Leon Russell influence and with hindsight, after the hugely beautiful release of THE UNION by Elton and Leon, they demonstrate the true appreciation which Elton had for his idol.  Amy in particular is an esoteric work of wonder, accented with solos by electric violin virtuoso Jean-Luc Ponty, the song is an impressionist painting splashed with living colors and surrealistic melody.  Honky Cat and Hercules are pure entertainment, the latter being my favorite Elton song.  Both are jaunty and uplifting tongue-in-cheek stories, the former a Nawlin's influenced piano and brass funk that quickly hopped into the top 10 billboards, and the latter is the definition of Elton's mastery at making something old new again.  Hercules fuses 50's doo-wop into 60's Beach Boys harmonies, and it all is enveloped in a richly warm wall-of-sound atmosphere that ends up being pure genius.  The other jaunty joke song is the now politically incorrect I Think I'm Going To Kill Myself, dated to be sure, but still humorous (at least to boomers) lament on teenage suicide.  I won't even speak to Rocket Man, it has become a part of our culture and any critique on it would just fall flat and on deaf ears.  Let's just call it the perfectly arranged song for a voyage into billboard top 10 orbit and into the subculture of the generation who adored it.  The other boomer favorite on this masterwork is Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters, lyrically, poetically, and instrumentally another ballad that can only called ""perfect"".  Crowds at concerts sing along word for word with Elton when he performs it, it has become an anthem of sorts to the emergency workers in the post-911 efforts at the World Trade Center, and it defies categorization as an anthem in general for New York City.  In one take, Elton turned Bernie's lyrics into a flawless diamond.  The song also confirms the perfection of unity between Elton and Bernie and the band which were able to generate such a critically fantastic album in such a short session with literally no throwaways.A word to the remastering of this album.  The words ""pristine"" and ""perfect"" come easily to mind.  There is no over the top loudness, every nuance and original acoustic vibration is captured in a butterfly net and gently delivered to your ears without a misstep or a warble.  Headphones are amazing, car stereo (especially Boston Acoustics) simply uncanny, and home stereo is an audiophiles dream.I recommend every studio album from Empty Sky to Captain Fantastic (1969-1975), then after a fallow period The One (1992) is a nice resurrection, but The Union (2010) with Leon Russell is really his next ""masterpiece"" after '75.  However, at gunpoint, forced to walk away with just one album, Honky Chateau would the unequivocal choice."
1,"The United States of America was, along with the Doors and Jimi Hendrix, one of the most played &quot;alternative&quot; rock albums when alternative rock meant something. After the 60's, some of these albums made it into the  classic pantheon, others, just as good, like USA, are obscure.In 1968,  99% of the rock stations refused to play this because it was too good, too  topical, too loud, too literate, too weird and, well, too psychedelic. Only  low power college stations played it and boy, did they ever! Over and over  all night!Dorothy Moskowitz had (has?) a voice with the beauty and power  of the Jefferson Airplane's Grace Slick. Dorothy, it's good to hear from  you. You were great, why did you stop?USA, with their synthesizer and  distortion violin and without lead guitar goes where no album had gone  before and few since. The first rock album to make extensive use of  synthesizer as a lead instrument. This was the first and as far as I know  the ONLY rock album ever released on the prestigeous classical Columbia  Masterworks label.Commander America said, &quot;The US of A was...the  most successful attempt to simulate the mental and bodily sensations of  certain popular intoxicants of the Sixties&quot;.To be appreciated it  MUST BE HEARD THROUGH HEADPHONES.  &quot;Hard Coming Love&quot; hops around  your head like a rattlesnake on a skillet in an attempt to simulate an  orgasm between your ears!Full of musical and literary references, Byrd  often sounds like late Charles Ives repeatedly quoting &quot;Columbia the  Gem of the Ocean&quot;.  &quot;Steppenwolf&quot; (the book by Hesse, not  the band) &quot;the cost of one admission is your mind&quot;. &quot;Winnie  the Pooh&quot;. The visions of Hironymous Bosch's, &quot;Garden of Earthly  Delight&quot; where Bryd descibes what he sees inside his girlfriends  eyes.&quot;Song for Dead Che&quot; a beautiful ballad, &quot;Agnus  Dei&quot; which compares the aftermath of love and memory to a nuclear  blast &quot;shadows on the pavement but no bodies do you find&quot;.  &quot;Coming Down&quot;. Don't be scared by Byrd's lead-off vehement  anti-war diatribe about the military industrial complex, the &quot;American  Metaphysical Circus&quot;.From beginning to end a lost classic of the  sixties.  Alternately lyrical, thought provoking, excessive, paranoid,  beautiful, raucous, US of A is a classic with a short half-life which  repeatedly appears and disappears from the marketplace. This is the real  sixties, not the &quot;Peace and Love - Flower Power&quot; you usually hear  about.get it while you can. five stars, my highest rating. a classic"
1,"Why put on a Stevie Wonder greatest hits when this masterpiece is just stunning ear candy?Too High, Livin For The City etc. I am inclined to say it's my favorite album by him"
1,The CD arrived after being on order for about 10 days and was packaged adequately for its shipment to me.  I had really like the earlier Tears For Fears CD &#34;Songs From The Big Chair&#34; and also the title track for this CD when I heard it on the radio in years since its release in the later summer of 1989.  The CD (along with its bonus tracks) was an truly remarkable musical production by TFF.  Thanks for making this great music available to the public at an excellent price.
1,"This is the first Elton John &quot;album&quot; I ever listened to, and I certainly loved it.  It has the biggest hits from his albums from 1970-1974 (excluding two on &quot;Madman&quot; and one on &quot;Caribou&quot;).  When I listened to his, I loved the four songs from the &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; album, and that inspired me to buy that album itself.  I found out that there were songs like &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; and &quot;Daniel&quot; and &quot;Honky Cat&quot; that I didn't know were songs of Elton John's at all... I love the songs, but I didn't know they were Elton's, so that excited me very much.  I think this is THE place for someone to begin to get a good taste of what Elton John can do.  My favorite pick is &quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot;, can't go wrong with that one.  However, fans will soon discover that there are much better Elton songs from the albums from which these hits are extracted.This album became the best-known one in Great Britain, which I really didn't like to hear.  It was part of a delay before the release of &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot;.  It was followed by the reissue of &quot;Empty Sky&quot;, then &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot;, so fans had to wait a while for some new material.  But, I'd recommend this album for anyone looking to get into Elton."
1,"Another one that sounds like a greatest hits CD.  They had what, like 5 hits from this album?  Great."
1,"Ah, here is a band who's music is as timeless as good rich soil. With slight homosexual undertones and a wave of resilience, ABC barnstormed radio in the 80's and took us on a happy, cotton candy ride of pop and pleasure.'Be Near me' is as good as music can possibly get. with lyrics like ""All my dreams came true last night/All my hopes and fears/All my dreams came true once more/ In tears.....in tears"" What could make more perfect sense than that? Isn't that what we are all aiming for anyway? How does one walk away from this song and not be wiser? The hip beat just makes me want to imitate The Lord of the Dance and leap from room to room with zing.Other songs on this album will also release the chains from your soul and make you fancy-free. Take the title track and 'So Hip it Hurts'. If this wave was any newer, it wouldn't even be reaching the shore yet.And what of 'Vanity Kills' and 'Fear of the World'? Whereas one will have you believing the world can be conquered and all dreams can come true, the other is a small child, hiding in the corner of a darkened room. Alone, scared, crying for a friendly hand to come out of the darkness and into the light. Isn't that really what we all really want? Aren't we all that small child clinging to a security blanket?ABC reaches deep into the subconscious and pulls out raw emotion. It swirls them around in a magical, colorful pattern, then places it back inside your head. You cannot escape the influence of this band. After all they are ABC. They are the beginning, it is up to you to follow the path they have created to reach Z. Zen, the Zenith."
1,"Say what you will about the obvious choices of  ""The Chronic"" and ""Doggystyle"", my choice will always be Music to Driveby.  This album exemplifies what not only great Gangsta rap should sound like but what good hip-hop should sound like as well.First and foremost, Eiht is an emcee, not just a rapper.  This performance is the pinacle of his rhyme ability before he became known to the public as ""the guy who says geeyah"".  He battles (""Dead Men Tell No Lies"", ""Duck Sick II"", ""Def Wish II"", and ""Who's ****ing Who?""), he paints big lyrical hood murals (""Hood Took Me Under"" & ""Jack Mode""), he constantly reps his hood (""Compton 4 Life""), experiments (""N*ggaz Strugglin"" & ""U's a B*tch""), and destroys with rapid fire delivery (""Hit the Floor"").  He may be the only artist to ever hold his own on a track with the great Brad Jordan a.k.a. Scarface (""N 2 Deep"").Production is cutting edge as well and again.  After the slightly uninspired Staight Checkn'em album, this album returns to the original formula that made It's a Compton Thang so great - creative use of samples.  ""Hood Done Took Me Under"" is the classic example.  Eiht rips the Isaac Hayes sample used by Easy Mo B for Notorious BIG a few years later for ""Warning"", and a good decade before Ludacris used it again on his ""Chicken & Beer"" album.  To top it all off, the loop was vastly superior to either of these uses or numerous others.  Or better yet, check the clever use of scratches and snippets on ""Who's ****ing Who?"" where Tim Dog's voice is used to scorch himself.  The complete bastardization of BDP's classic ""South Bronx"" was even a bold manuver with, to my surprise, absolutely no response from Krs-ONE.  And to wrap it all up, you get the smooth instrumental ""Music To Driveby"" to round it all out.Yeah sure, Eiht didn't get the national recognition until We Come Strapped a few years later.  But that album, in my opinon, pales in comparison to the overuse of the same production used on Driveby's ""Hood Rat"" and waaaaaaay to many ""Geeyah's"".  Driveby's way more diverse in both production and lyrics and does not suffer from any overused topics that Eiht would later be forced to employ from the overabundance of other Gangsta rappers and their albums.If you're even a mild fan of gangsta rap or even hip hop in general, do yourself a favor and pick up this classic."
1,not really feeling this one as much as i thought i would considering everyone loves this album.  i think his self titled album has the better couple of premier beats on it then every beat on this album.  overall this one is mediocre for me
1,"In all my years, I never had owned a Michael Jackson album, in his living years. Something compelled me to purchase a few of his albums, posthumously, just to get a better sense of the artist, on my own terms - free of any previous knowledge of his body of work (which is vast and eclectic).What I love about this album is the freedom and depth of sincerity I sense in Michael's performances, here. This was before the nose jobs, the media drama and the false molestation accusations. This was back when MJ was considered a young and dynamic heartthrob. Off The Wall was prior to Thriller and the rocket that would launch his career in the Moonwalk and the 25th Anniversary MoTown Special.Some of the songs that best embody this brilliant album (with high production standards set by the legendary Quincy Jones) are ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,"" ""Off The Wall,"" ""Burn This Disco"" and ""Girlfriend,"" just to name a few. You feel as though you have set foot on the floor of a disco where it's all party, all the time. Whenever I put this record on, I know I am going to feel happy to be alive. It is full of a spirit of spontaneity and high professionalism. The tunes are memorable, as are the lyrics. Just great and unbeatable."
1,"I just can not get too much of this album. The Godz of heavy metal never seem to disappoint. There are no word to describe this album as a whole. If you are a priest fan, just do it man. Just do it. You will not regret it."
1,"After Billy Joel hit the big time with The Stranger, he had the unenviable task of following up that classic. While 52nd St. isn't as good as The Stranger, it is still a tremendous record. The album opens up with the venomous and hard ""Big Shot"" and then does a complete 180 with the quite ""Honesty"". ""My Life"" is the big hit off the album and it bounces along while ""Zanzibar"" is the best song on the album. It has a smoky, jazzy feel and is one of the most interesting songs Mr. Joel has ever done. ""Stiletto"" has some slick piano work and ""Rosalinda's Eyes"" employs a Latin sound. ""Half A Mile Away"" is full of horns and verve and ""Until The Night"" is a slower number in which Mr. Joel stretches his vocal muscle. The title track closes the album out on a jazzy note. 52nd St. proved that Billy Joel was no fluke, as the album became his first chart topper and won the Grammy for Album of the Year."
1,"My only knowledge of Lisa Loeb a few weeks ago was that I had seen a cable interview of her.  Glasses to me are a turn on with the right person, but that's all I knew of her.  So when I see this CD at a garage sale, with this &quot;just been boinked&quot; look on the cover, it was certainly worth giving it a try.  This collection of songs is currently number one as new find of the year for me.What she does is probably my favorite kind of music.  I like the singer-songwriter combination, because you can see exactly what the writer had in mind.  Just give me a table in a small club, and the performer with a guitar, and I'm set for the evening.Of course, the songs have to work for it to work.  The most important component in music is the songwriting, and very few people have the talent.  Ms. Loeb definately has the talent.  Practically every song on the album has a hook that she grabs from several angles, and keeps working.  That's the stuff that grabs your attention.  Songs like &quot;I Do&quot; and &quot;Truthfully&quot; work this very well.But she also shows a great amount of depth with songs like &quot;Falling in Love&quot;.  This story of how easy it is to fall for someone, but lines like &quot;The time between meeting and finally leaving is sometimes called falling in love&quot; shows a wisdom beyond her years.  From what I can tell, her other works seem to be also quite good, and I promise myself to rise above garage sale level to seek out more works by this talented artist.Just hope she doesn't switch to contact lenses."
1,This is my favorite Simon & Garfunkel album.  And Bridge over Troubled Water is my favorite cut.  They are just so good!
1,"I had reviewed this album at one point but I feel the need to go back and re-review it in a much more objective way..""Picture"" is an album that came out at a time when Elton's career was booming and resurging, but at the same time falling into a sort of adult contemporary and slightly over produced feel. ""Picture"" is exactly that, an adult contemporary, over produced album.The tracks themselves are quite well written with excellent melodies and lyrics that get stuck in your head. Not to mention Elton's vocals are clean, clear, and dead-on. But the best way to sum up the album??  it's this... where is Elton's piano?  Each track is full of excellent pop ear candy with all the 90's sheen in full front... But in it's own way this album comes off more like an project called ""Session musicians featuring Elton John on Vocals"". Chris Thomas is an excellent producer but I do feel on this album the over production hurts the intimate melodies and lyrics that Elton and Bernie had written.For me, ""Picture"" marks the end of Elton's pop album-making machine before he started going back to his early roots. It's his last attempt at a radio friendly target audience in all it's 90's glory. ...now, having said that, I'm a HUGE elton fan, and do appreciate this album greatly even though I do think you have to be in a certain mood to really 'listen' to it. Aside from the over produced sheen, the melodies and lyrics are great and Elton's voice is in fine form. ;o)All The Best,  The AndyMan"
1,A Great collection of Abba's greatest hits. One of the greatest pop songs on one cd. Every song on this album is a classic. Benny and Bj&ouml;rn are one of the greatest songwriters and producers of the twentieth century who made one of the greatest pops songs ever and Agneta and Ann Frid managed to make them timeless with their amazing voices. If you are starting with Abba buy this collection it is fantastic. The only flaw is that it seems to be missing some of their hits like I Do I Do I Do but you can buy this one and more gold and then you'll find some of their songs that perhaps didn't become all time classics.
1,Wu-Tang has several dope mc's but they all admitted back on 36 Chambers that the GZA was the head. Not in commercial appeal but lyrics. Liquid Swords is second only to Cuban Linx by the Chef in Wu-Tang solo projects. The beats are dark and grimey and the lyrics are vivid as a painting by Picasso...
1,"It took Motown nearly 20 years to finally get it right, and release the first career spanning collection of Marvin Gaye's music. It begs the question one question, however: what took them so long?  Marvin Gaye was arguably the most influential rhythm and blues artist of his generation and this moderately priced 29 track double C.D. is the best retrospective of Gaye's work. It is the only ""Best of"" CD that will aquaint the casual fan with the scope of Marvin's career. There are some unreleased treats for the collector, but the avid fan will want it because it's the first comprehensive set of Marvin's hits since the refinement of digital technology. Many of Marvin's early hits were actually mixed through car radio speakers, so they would sound good on an AM car radio, which was the primary method of marketing music in the early sixties. The muddy mixes of many of Marvin's early hits are cleaned up, and the upper and lower registers of don't ""bleed"" into mid range sounds.Marvin Gaye acquired and lost three monetary fortunes during his 23 year musical career. Each time Marvin was confronted with failure, he successfully reinvented himself and gained an even wider following.  He became the first black popular music performer to gain complete artistic control over his work, which laid a blueprint for independence to guide other black artists, most notably fellow Motown musician, Stevie Wonder. Marvin Gaye introduced topical and political commentary into his music with his transcendental 1971 album, ""What's Going On.""  Curtis Mayfield may have predated Gaye in the use of social commentary, but no album produced, before or since, has carried the stunning immediacy of ""What's Going On.""  It has become an artistic benchmark by which all other musical accomplishments have been measured.""The Very Best of Marvin Gaye"" doesn't overlook any aspect of Marvin's multifaceted career. The dapper young star of the Motown stable with a string of AM radio hits, his successful pairing with Tami Terrell and Kim Weston for duet albums, his stellar 1970s career as both a protest artist and singer of jazz infused love ballads and his final incarnation as the sleek singer of ""Sexual Healing"" in his trademark smoking jacket. Marvin Gaye lived in an era that produced the most talented rhythm and blues singers in history. In the ten year span from 1963 until 1973 artists like Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, Curtis Mayfield, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, and Al Green were either emerging or established performers.Despite all of his personal demons, Marvin Gaye's career spanned well into the 1980s, when most of  his peers from the golden age of soul had either died prematurely or had developed a formulatic approach by using the same production template for every album. Marvin refused to use a cookie cutter approach. Marvin Gaye wasn't afraid of taking chances, reinventing himself and redefining his artistry."
1,"So I admit that I was a huge Backstreet Boys fan when they came out...but then again so wasn't anyone my age.  To say now that they suck would be unfair to the genra of music that they profess.  They are bubblegum pop, and in that effect they deliver decent bubblegum pop.  THis is not their best album, for it was their debut and their sophmore album was much more polished but the hits turned out by this album were plenty and this album did solidify them quite the fanbase thanks to whiny ""girl come back to me"" type lyrics and Nick Carters just plain whiny voice.  Not sure what the hype is there for him but oh well...The Backstreet Boys had it all...they had the young cute one ala Nick Carter, they had the talented one ala Brian, they had the drug addict ala A.J., they had the funny looking one ala Howie and they had the creepy older guy ala Kevin.  And they could carry a note for the most part.  Thus the Backstreet Boys were born and teenage girls everywhere went crazy.  I admitt that I liked this CD even though my friends thought I was nuts, all but a few, but how can you resist songs like ""Quit playing games with my heart"" or ""As long as you love me?""...""Everybody"" was huge and so was ""All I have to give"" and the balance of the CD wasn't to bad either.  No, it's not in my CD player right now, and no it won't visit anytime soon, but for what it was, for the time it came out and for the fan base they were after, Backstreet Boys came, saw and conquered."
1,"Released between the progressive Honky Chateau and the all-time classic double-LP, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, is the often overlooked and underrated Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player. This landmark release encapsules what would be Elton's very first Top 5 singles, including the #2 Daniel and what would be Reggie Dwight's first chart-topper, namely the unforgettable Crocodile Rock.Besides being a disc that contained what were then Elton's biggest hits, it included some interesting tunes that received their share of airplay on FM radio, including Teacher, I Need You, Elderberry Wine, and High Flying Bird. These songs were intertwined with other tracks that would shed light on an Elton John who was carefree when necessary and yet was somber in the same respect.I would not say that Don't Shoot Me... is Elton's very best, but if any particular work of art ever showcased an Elton John who seemed to let loose and enjoy life after having heavy burdens lifted, then that was it. Arguably, the energy emanated ideally reflects what many fondly remember about 1973. Not only was that when Don't Shoot Me... was released, but it was also a time when, for millions, several days, months, and years of perpetual worry and stress over domestic and international affairs, including wartime combat, were finally coming to a close.Again, Don't Shoot Me.. is probably the release that perfectly highlighted Elton's lighthearted and serious sides, with the first part serving as a continuation of the humor nicely put forth in Honky Chateau and the second part, which would pave the way for pensive songs that would come to summarize the first phase of Elton's career and thus complete the first volume of his greatest hits, including Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me."
1,"My mind was encapsulated by all the pleasant sounds leaking out of the tracks &quot;Take Me There&quot;  &quot;After The Storm&quot; (which one can't play enough times), &quot;Let's Come Together,&quot; &amp; the  intriguing &quot;Acoustic Time.&quot;  The vigorous and melodic strumming  delivered by Brown goes underrated (judging from so few reviews).  But the  three remakes (which are almost consecutive) were two too many for me.  I  mean... I don't want to knock this album off, because it's pretty darn  good, but I just don't want to listen to something that isn't original-  especially of songs I don't like that much (i.e.- Janet's &quot;That's The  Way,&quot; Vandross' &quot;Any Love,&quot; and Isleys' &quot;For The  Love.&quot; I still like them however (when I'm bored).  Considering that  Norman is a tremendous gee-tar strummer, I wouldn't tell you to dub only  the good songs from someone else, but rather, just buy the cassette of  &quot;After The Storm,&quot; if you're not too fond of remakes."

1,"On vinyl, four sides of some of the best rock ever released.  Whether working solo, working with Cream, or working as ""Derek and the Dominos,"" Eric Clapton lives solely to play rock songs like a bluesman--or to play blues songs like a rocker.  Either way, these fourteen songs are the best work Clapton ever did, celebrating the common themes that draw us siren-like to all forms of popular music, be it rock or blues or even rap.  The sentiments have been around for as long as humankind has been around--my heart's broken, she left me for another guy, why does love got to be so sad, etc.--but the vitality in these pieces makes them seem new.  They connect as well as they would have in the Twenties, and they'll connect just as well in the 2020s or the 2120s.  The musicianship is unparalleled, the emotion almost astoundingly sincere--when, in their knockout cover of Hendrix's ""Little Wing,"" Clapton shouts ""Right on,"" he does it not as a rock showman, not even as a darn good rock showman, but as a human being painfully in love with his craft.  These are love songs, alright.  Love songs for the art of rock."
1,"Not only is this a bajoolion times better than anything I've ever heard by Jackson Browne, it's also one of the very best records of the early '70s. King has a powerful voice: slightly deep, slightly husky, and moving; and she's a hell of a songwriter. Which makes sense, given that she started off as a pro songwriter and had a decade to hone her skills. Anyway, her second solo record has more variety to it than one would thing: ""I Feel the Earth Move"" is a relatively hard rock song; and the jazzy ""It's Too Late"" must've had a big influence on Joni Mitchell, though the fact is the spare piano ballads she's known for (""So Far Away""; ""Beautiful""; the tender hit ""You've Got a Friend""; and my favorite, the soulful insecurity of ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow?"") have a lot going for them, too. The only filler is the crisp country-rocker ""Smackwater Jack"", and even that's made up of by the abundance of strong material such as the lyrical title song, and especially the classic ""(You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman"". And really, ""Smackwater Jack"" isn't all that bad. So forgive me while I give this the highest rating possible in spite of one minor filler: it really is that good, and one of the best-written albums I've ever had the pleasure of hearing."
1,"Rock of the Westies is the definition of an underappreciated gem.  For some reason, ""Island Girl"" seems to be the obvious high point of the album for most people, and while I love the song (especially the chorus) there's a LOT more on here to fall in love with.  I think people just want the hits and that's why they say ""Island Girl"" is the best song.""Billy Bones and the White Bird"" is such a catchy little pop song.  It should have been the biggest hit of Elton's career.  It's THAT good.  ""Hard Luck Story"" has a funky vibe that I strongly admire.  ""I Feel Like a Bullet (In the Gun of Robert Ford)"" is a very good song in terms of vocal melody and atmosphere.  Elton John sure knows how to write memorable songs, and this album is probably the most underrated, and most consistently enjoyable of his career.  At least, it's a classic album in every area.Oh yeah, can't forget about the ""Yell Help"" section of track one either.  I love it!"
1,"Bill is actually remembered for very few hits of his own, but his songs are popular among other singers, who record cover versions and sometimes have hits with them. This is one of several compilations that allow you to hear Bill sing his own songs in his own particular style.Of Bill's songs, Lean on me is the one that is most frequently covered. It is a classic, anthemic song that can be interpreted as a love song or as a gospel song, while its basic simplicity allows it to be adapted to many different musical styles. Nevertheless, among Bill's own hits, the first one that comes to mind is actually Lovely day, partly because others have had a hit with Lean on me (so people who know the song don't always associate it with Bill) and partly because Lovely day is such a fantastic song anyway.But Bill's great songs don't end with Lean on me and Lovely day - Ain't no sunshine, Just the two of us, Use me and Grandma's hands are just a few of the other great songs here and on other Bill Withers compilations."
1,"KRS seemed more focused than ever here. During the making of this album, Scott La Rock, DJ and Producer of BDP was shot and killed. During the making of ""My Philosophy"" in fact...which in my opinion is when Kris started showing his true colors. It was positive and negative, educational and entertaining..which had become the mantra of KRS ever since. On this album he tells you that Illegal Business controls America. He tells you how sometimes love is gonna get you. On this album you learn what the ""word"" ""Unrational"" means."
1,"Joan Baez/ In Concert part 2:  Where Part 1 had Joan doing an excellent job on the traditional Folk catalog, in Part 2 she introduces us to some obscure little songwriter going by the name of Bob Dylan.  In this album she does another excellent job on the traditional cuts but nobody sings a Dylan Song better than Joan Baez and here we have her singing ""Don't Think Twice"" and ""With God on our Side"".  This is a great CD.  Highly Recommended."
1,"Justin Hayward and John Lodge's ""Blue Jays"" album is simply a masterpiece of an album.Does not pale in comparison to anything ""The Moody Blues"" ever released.As a matter of fact it just seems like a progressive step forward from the direction that they were headed in with their release of ""The Seventh Sojourn"" in 1972.After all Justin and John were the two main songwriters of the group.The album as a whole is a pristine masterpiece so going into detail over every track is not needed.My favorite tracks would have to be John Lodge's ""You"" and Justin Hayward's ""I Dreamed Last Night"".The Vocals and slide guitar on ""You"" are quite impressive and it is one of my favorite lyrically as well.""I Dreamed Last Night"" is such a beautiful song that it leads me to believe that Justin Hayward was/is no doubt a genuine genious songwriter musician.I mean just everything about the song is PERFECT!The orchestration done by Peter Knight blends with this song in a way that is truly emotionaly stirring.They should be proud of their collaboration.(The other song's with Knight are wonderful too,just picking my favorites).""Blue Guitar"" is a wonderful addition as a bonus track and I would highly reccommend this album to anyone who likes the ""Moody Blues"".Justin Hayward and John Lodge are up their with Pete Townsend,Nick Drake,Elton John,etc. as my favorite British songwriters.This album has been one of the greatest recent addition's to my constantly growing music expedition."
1,"One of the more oddball shotgun marriages in musical history was Asia, a ""supergroup"" comprised of one ELP member (drummer Carl Palmer), one Crimson King (vocalist/bass John Wetton), a YesMan (guitarist Steve Howe) and a Buggle (keyboardist Geoff Downes). With that kind of pedigree, you would expect long, self-indulgent soloing and piles of classically inspired virtuosity. Surprisingly, none of that appeared on their Geffen debut in 1982.Instead, you got straight ahead arena rock with strong melodies and eager to please hooks on about half of the album. Yes, the album was stunningly well produced and played with verve, but these men were most certainly no pop=musicians. Downes might have been, considering the meager output of The Buggles, however it seems the man who wrote ""Video Killed The Radio Star"" really longed to write ""Starship Trooper."" He and Wetton co-wrote the bulk of the songs here, and while there's plenty of soloing going on, it's economical. (Which was the alleged reason Howe left after two albums, he wanted more.)Again, though, these men are not pop writers. Which means that half the songs on ""Asia"" are utterly awful, long forgotten in the ongiong classic rock play for ""Heat Of The Moment,"" ""Only Time Will Tell"" and ""Wildest Dreams."" Palmer gets to wail away on the drums during ""Wildest Dreams,"" while it is Downes' keyboards that make the album sound like the band didn't just drop in from the seventies. That didn't stop ""Asia"" from hitting number one and getting a lot of pretentious ""serious music"" snobs from creaming themselves over what they considered a rabbit punch to new wave. (Or critics from mocking the band for sounding like throwbacks IN the peak of new wave.)Either way, Asia had the last laugh. Some 40 years later, the good stuff on the disc sounds cool, but that means you're probably just as well off withAsia Gold- which at least has a more up-to-date track mastering - than just buying this one."
1,"Jay-Z's first album, REASONABLE DOUBT is a certified classic. HardKnock Life, Life and Times of S.Carter and The Dynasty have all been multi-platinum and have churned out multitudes of club and radio hits. And who can deny the soulful BLUEPRINT's place as one of the best rap albums to drop in the last half-decade? The album that many rap fans overlook however is the under-appreciated jewel in the Jigga catalogue. In My Lifetime, Vol.1 mends the cleverly intertwining lyrical ability of Shawn Carter with the street anthem beats of producers such as Primo. While hardcore rap fans may complain that radio friendly tracks such as the Puffy produced ""I know what girls like"" and the Babyface laced ""Sunshine"" featuring Foxy Brown should have been omitted it's the superb lyrical skill that holds this album down. The intro ""A Million and One Questions"" is a masterpiece in its own right and the track ""Where I'm from"" lets Hova paint a picture of life in the ghetto while opening the question ""Who's the best emcee, Biggie, Jay-Z or Nas"". The deepest moments of the album however come when Jay decides to go the introspective route. ""You must love Me"" is a personal letter from a hustler to a mother he hurt, a brother he shot and a love he put in danger. ""Lucky Me"" allows Jay to let out his frustrations about the music industry's double standard as both a curse and a gift. When discussing his own demise, Jigga questions why his friends pour henny on the ground, he urges ""Jesus is heaven bound, next time throw it up."" The hip-hop world needs to give it up and finally give Jay-Z the credit that he deserves for this album..."
1,"Robbie Robertson's self-titled solo debut is also his best album on his own. Retaining some of the spirit of his work with the Band, he brings in numerous guests, including Peter Gabriel and U2, to help out, and the result is that his trademark style is brought into the modern age. Influences ranging from U2 to the Meters are clearly audible here, along with Van Morrison, the Band, and Bob Dylan. There's a cautionary undertone to many of the songs, which is fitting considering that his former bandmate, Richard Manuel, had committed suicide the year before. This is a CD that you should own if you're a fan of folk-rock in any form."
1,"PE is another hip hop music icon that'll be talked about in 100 years as pioneering the heart and soul of America's truest art form of self-expression, joy, pain, heartache and real world problems and solutions.You don't know hip hop and you definitely know hip hop music at its highest, purest form if you don't own, know of or even heard this album.It's overwhelming Afrocentric (par for the course circa popular hip hop 1989-mid 1990).For all listeners, you'll definitely get a strong sense that PE has something to say about Black Empowerment and challenging the status quo.For white listeners, please don't be scared off by this album's Pro Black sentiments.PE's Pro-Black messages are NOT anti-white ... PE's very much about self-help.I can remember seeing tape of a documentary back in 1993 of a PE concert they performed waaayyy out in the boonies, somewhere in Middle America where minorities are an entity the local yocals probably only saw on TV.Point is, they talked to several members of the overwhelmingly white, big hair, mullet-sporting crowd and to my surprise and delight, the crowd ""got it.""They spoke with respect and admiration of PE and explained themselves how they thought it wasn't offensive and that PE was just promoting Black empowerment and for more people to get education, question society's way and know their history.Powerful stuff (both this album and that documentary)."
1,"The best thing about getting old classics, is that they are inexpensive and still worth the listen. I may be 23 but I'm very old-school and when growing up all I'd listen to is Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, etc. But who I loved most of all was listening to Billy Ocean. Takes me back to my happier years and having fun. There are a few tracks that I don't remember but they are still good, takes me back to the Miami Vice theme wearing white pants era."
1,"This is, by far, Too Short's best album.  The whole thing is full of his unique, laid back flow and Yay Area beats.  IN THE TRUNK and I AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT A DOG are the best songs, epitomizing Short's lifestyle.  IN  THE TRUNK has the funkiest beat, and the bass...you get submerged in it.  The production on the whole album is tight and Short Dog lays it all out  for the world to see:  the Oaktown lifestyle.  He's an Oakland Vet and  wants everybody to know it.  This is a no compromise album and one of the  best in my collection."
1,"This album is deep the beats are ill, His lyrics are crazy. There are a few really good songs and some of them are now classics. 1)shadowboxing 2)dual of the iron mic 3)b.i.b.l.emy favorite track would have to be b.i.b.l.e b/c it's like religious and in order to understand it you have to be familar with the old testament,go buy it..."
1,"A masterpiece that five stars can,t begin to tell the true magic of this cd.From knocks me off my feet to sir duke to ebony eyes i can go on and on.This cd has got to be one of the best albums ever made if you have not heard this cd where have you been? enjoy!"
1,"If you are a southern hard rock fan, this is a terrific band for you to try out...as long as you aren't offended by explicit lyrics or content, that is.  More conservative people will NEVER allow their children to listen to or buy this album!  Jackyl is pure southern orneryness, or, hard rocking music with a southern rock flair, and they are unabashedly horny, lewd, rude, crude and socially unacceptable and, there, not for the faint of heart!  But for those who appreciate them for who  and what they are and get a kick out of what they have to say, hey, go out and buy their music because they won't disappoint.  They are actually very nice southern born and raised guys who love and appreciate all of their fans and the fan support they receive.  Me and my wife actually got to meet them at Rock USA Oshkosh 2013 because at the close of their show they announced they would be in the merch tent and wanted to meet and greet all of their fans who wanted to meet them.  I think they stood in the merch tent for at least three, if not four, hours, shaking hands, getting pictures taken, signing autographs, and when my wife told Jesse James Dupree she was a huge Jackyl fan, he put his hand over his heart and then planted a huge kiss on her cheek, and so did another band member, although she didn't know which one.  That's what I mean about them really loving their fans!  I really think you will love their music."
1,"i wan't fully enjoying clones at first, sure watching you, dr, and do that stuff where instant favorites of mine. i thought it was too abstract and didn't really funk with it. over time i have realized how layered and funky all these tracks are. even getting to know you is so thumped out that with the right speakers or headset you;ll fall in love. Funk on BAby"
1,"One of his greatest. It's 3rd best in my collection of his cds that I have...so far! It has one of my favorite songs on it and one of his only hits in America, Goody Two Shoes!"
1,Classic cd! This is when the ohio players got the credit they long for.Skin tight need i say more and who could forget the timeless classic heaven must be like this!.But the song is anybody gonna be saved is another great song. so for the price you are not just getting a great cd but an all time classic enjoy!
1,"Mothership Connection is the kind of acid scorched space-jam platter that can keep a party movin' (and you'd best believe I mean MOVIN'!) all night long. It's a freewheeling chunk `o funk that'll instantly vaporize any of the lame-o crap that may be polluting your record collection, and make you boogie from now clear until the end of time. The songs are structured like truly inspired jams, with George Clinton and his band of visionaries hurling interplanetary melodies and starburstin' vocals around minimalist, rhythm driven hypno-grooves. The choruses are huge, the lyrics are divine, and the bass lines are deeper than oceans. As a whole, it's a ridiculously good surge o' wicked cool psychofunk genius. Just don't forget your sunglasses!"
1,"Out of all of Barbra Streisand's albums, this is probably one of her oddest (save, say, Barbra Streisand and Other Musical Instruments).  The songs are pure 60s/early 70s rock, sound very hippy-ish, and are more fascinating than engrossing.  It is semi-notorious for being produced by her boyfriend at the time, Jon Peters, who at that point had no experiencing producing movies or music.  And while it is an album that requires multiple listens to completely appreciate, there are some good recordings on here.Her last album, The Way We Were, was purely commercial, as it was released to promote the single of the same name, and hence was hastily put together from leftover tracks from past recording sessions, so it is understandable that Barbra wanted to do something different (again).  Admittedly, many of the songs first listens will go in one ear and out the other, particularly many in the middle, such as ""I Won't Last a Day Without You,"" ""Life on Mars,"" and ""Crying Time.""  But the more often you hear it, the better they sound.  The only two songs that will capture your attention with one listen are ""Love in the Aftermoon"" (beautiful and romantic) and ""Guava Jelly"" (a catchy, if not altogether successful attempt at reggae).In short, while the album is not the best, it is not terrible, especially if you listen to it more than once.  It will eventually sound good, and be a great part of your CD collection.  Not for novices of Barbra Streisand, but good for her fans that want to hear her do something different."
1,"What a suprise it was for us Wham fams who loved the first album &quot;Fantastic&quot; to see the boys go from white rap music to &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go&quot;.  Still, this album, their most successful,  was full of top-notched material which will permanently mark it's place in  time.  Of the songs on the album, George Michael's Blue-eyed soul never  sounded better than it did on &quot;If You Were There&quot;, a remake of an  old Isley Brothers song.  The rest of the album is pop music at it's  sugar-coated best.  Although the themes were a bit more mature  (&quot;Everything She Wants&quot;, &quot;Like A Baby&quot;), this was still  light hearted music which made us happy."
1,"This is a classic album that sounds as honest and sincere now as it did way back in 1971.  Imagine an album staying in the number one spot for fifteen weeks and on the charts for over SIX YEARS.With four Grammy awards under its belt, and songs like &#8220;I Feel The Earth Move&#8221;; &#8220;It's Too Late&#8221;; &#8220;You've Got A Friend&#8221;; &#8220;Will You Love Me Tomorrow?&#8221;; &#8220;Tapestry&#8221; and &#8220;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&#8221;, this album belongs in any serious collection of &#8216;70s music.See also the tribute album &#8220;Tapestry Revisited&#8221; where folk like Rod Stewart, Aretha Franklin, Amy Grant, Richard Marx, Celine Dion, the Bee Gees and Bebe and Cece Winans, among others, pay homage to this singer/songwriter extraordinaire.A must-have album for your collection.Amanda Richards, March 4, 2006"
1,"If you listened to these songs today, they would still me timeless!  Great dance songs.  They sure knew how to mix songs well.  not one song is a disappointment.  Nearly 15 years alter, I still find myself listening to this CD!BUY IT!  You won't regret it!"

1,"So the world is falling apart? No doubt about that. Turn on your TV, and it's the same thing, just different colors of crap. I mean, how did it all get this stupid?Even the music, god... the music. Between Lil' Jon's stranglehold and TI and... is Nelly still around? The rock scene isn't much better, with all this The Killers From The Heat of 1979. I swear I'm so disillusioned.""I drop megaton bombs more faster than ya blink...""RZA and GZA are doing a pretty damn good job of taking it back to where it came from. If the beat doesn't get you quite grooving, just listen to GZA. That's what you're SUPPOSED to do. And then you're like... ""Yeah, this is how it's done, damn you Justice."" And this album is almost 10 years old now?I'm afraid to get caught up in the ""Duel of the Iron Mic"". GZA, MK, and Deck aren't nice. I suppose I should listen to these guys. The beat is nice, but they're getting a tad confrontational. MK says it's not an 85 affair, but they definitely took a few cues.Then it hits ""Living In The World Today"". But only raise your hands if you're sure. What is this? 3 for 3 already? The first 3 tracks on this CD knock the ball out of the city, screw the park. Damn, GZA isn't just coming out cutting heads. He's drawing and quartering. All opposition is probably running like hell. Don't get shattered like a glass jaw.And of course, ""Gold"" comes through with some overdriven guitar and a beat farmed straight in Hell. It's just the beginning though, as it segues into the highlight of the CD, the icy and epic ""Cold World"". Probably the best beat RZA has ever done, hands down. No arguement. This is the beat that had me sold on Wu. GZA throws out an awesome narratto ive of the battle, only to be outdone by the INS. ""No time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs and seize packages and pocket the currency"".What can I say about ""Labels?"" Either you know, or you don't. If you have no idea, that's your problem. I'd almost rather you not know if it's taken you this long.And when I start thinking ""Cold World"" was the best thing this CD had to offer, ""4th Chamber"" starts beating you into submission. Featuring the Wu GOD up first, Ghostface drops some more cryptic science that takes forever to decypher. He's so good that by the time Killah Preist and the RZA are done, I'm hoping Ghost would come in to drop another verse.But then you have to wait until the end of ""Investigative Reports"" to catch Ghost again. Rae and GZA throw out some good stuff (The chef cooks up some MOUTH WATERING words), but... Ghost throws the verse to end any MC's career into the Grand Canyon. Lines like ""I grab the pen for revenge and let loose, see? Like Muslims standing on the block rockin' the Kufi"" to ""Packed with visions, copywritten, throwin' bread to pidgeons, christ has risen"" to the ultimate ""Yo, they used guns while we angrily shot arrows, you better keep your eye on the sparrow"". What can you do? Nothing.Before I end up analyzing every song on this, I'm gonna cut it short. By the time you're finished listening to the Killah Preist manifesto ""B.I.B.L.E."", you realize that this CD is knowledge. Minimal, possibly old school, but 100% on point. It's also an escape.Absolutely jaded by the world around you? Throw in ""Liquid Swords"". There's nothing I can say about the feeling you get when ""Living In The World Today"" starts after listening to the first two songs. The world might be falling apart, but screw it. If you've got ""Liquid Swords"", no one can mess with you."
1,"This album, like its two predecessors defined Ike's work.  He shows his continued ability (having already proven himself an first rate writer) to take great songs in their own right and rearrange them to make them new and  different classics.  &quot;The Look of Love&quot; is a masterpiece, which  must give its creators new found pride.  However, there is no song like  &quot;You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling&quot;:  Sure enough a great work by  the Righteous Brothers.  A whole 'nother smoke when Ike puts his inimatable  stamp on it.A worthy successor to Hot Buttered Soul, and The I.H.  Movement.  Like those (unlike what followed) no filler."
1,"The Beatles' ""Sgt. Pepper"", ""One"", and ""Abby Road"", Led Zeppelin's ""Led Zeppelin IV"", Alanis Morrissette's ""Jagged Little Pill"", Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"", Nirvana's ""Nevermind"", Metallica's ""Metallica"", Pinkd Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"", Fleetwood Mac's ""Rumours"", The Eagles ""Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975"", AC/DC's ""Back in Black"", Michael Jackson's own ""Bad"" and ""Dangerous"", Meat Loaf's ""Bat Out of Hell"", Shania Twain's ""Come On Over"", the soundtracks of ""Dirty Dancing"", ""Saturday Night Fever"", ""Titantic, and ""The Body Guard"", Celion Dion's ""Falling Into You"", Mariah Cary's ""Music Box"", Madonna's ""Immaculate Collection"", The Backstreet Boys' ""Millennium"", Bruce Springsteen's ""Born in the USA"", Dire Straits ""Brothers in Arms"".What do all these albums have in common?  All have sold in access of thirty million copies.  These are the heavy hitters, the major albums that have commercially outperformed all of the others.  What else do they have in common?Not one of them comes close to outselling ""Thriller"", Michael Jackson's sixth studio album from 1982.  ""Thriller"" has sold an estimated 50-110 MILLION copies.  Too put that in perspective, The Beatles total sales is 170 million in the US total, with Elvis's  moving 119 million unites, with Garth Brooks placing third.  That's all records sold however.  (Granted, The Beatles and Elvis' sales figures are a little more staggering globally: The Beatles have moved 1.3 billion copies and Elvis between 900 million and 1 billion.  Those are, however, world wide sales figures of all records sold).Before ""Thriller"", the biggest selling record was Fleetwood Mac's ""Rumours"".  Then, in 1982, ""Thriller"" arrived, and the world was changed forever.  ""Thriller"" completely rewrote the rules for what music could do commercially - at one point, the album was moving a MILLION UNITS a week.  Success of this magnitude was unimaginable, even going beyond what The Beatles did in the 1960s (as far as sales of an individual album goes).When Michael and producer Quincy Jones went into the studio, they had their sights set on the stars.  Michael was angry about ""Off the Wall"" not winning ""Record of the Year"", and was told by Rolling Stone that black people didn't on magazines didn't sell.  Michael wanted to prove just how valuable he would be to the music industry.  And boy did he ever.  ""Thriller"" would go on to win 8 Grammys (the most ever won at the time)- Album of the Year- Record of the Year (""Beat It"")- Best Male Pop Vocals (""Thriller"")- Best Male Rock Vocals (""Beat It"")- Best Male R&B; Vocals (""Billie Jean"")- Best R&B; Song (""Billie Jean"")- Producer of the Year (Qunicy Jones and Michael Jackson)- Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical (Bruce Swedien)Just like a perfect storm, the success of ""Thriller"" can be attributed, at least partially, to several different factors.  First, and the most obvious, is the music is utterly fantastic.  The album has something for everything, whether it's hard rock, funk, ballads, soul, shmaltz, or some fantastic bass lines and disco.  The next is the advent MVT [is MTV was just beginning].  Michael made three videos for ""Thriller"": ""Beat It"" (with West Side Story coreagraphy), ""Bille Jean"", and the epic ""Thriller"", the most successful video of all time.  All three videos entered into heavy rotation on MTV.  The video of ""Thriller"" totally changed what videos could do.  Shot as an actual short fifteen minute film, ""Thriller"" is a horror classic with great dancing, memorable makeup, and a spooky story line.  Zombies never looked so good. Michael Jackson also helped break down racial boundaries, being MTV's first black star and even meeting with President Reagan at the White House.  (See what having the biggest selling album ever gets you?  An invite to the White House!).When you're dealing with an album like ""Thriller"", that's not a lot to say that hasn't been said before.  Whatever nitpicky comments you wish to make about the album, there is no denying that Michael's music has connected with millions of people the world over.While ""Off the Wall"" was a little looser and, appropriately enough, more off the wall, with ""Thriller"" we find Michael moving into darker, more paranoid territory that would culminate into full-blown defense mode by the time we get to the 1995 ""HIStory"".  For all the fun that ""Thriller"" offers, there are some pretty dark undercurrents on the record that Michael would more deeply explore on subsequent records.  This darker edge gives the album a much more durable framework than would otherwise be the case, and makes the music more lasting and impactful.Musically, each track feels calculated to reach as broad an audience as possible.  While it can perhaps be disconcerting that there appears to be such calculation involved, all concerns melt away when you actually here the album itself.  There's a reason it sold so many copies.  We have the claustrophobic funk of""Wanna Be Startin' Something""  (and scariest track Jackson ever recorded), the hard rock of ""Beat It"" (with a fantastic guitar solo courtesy of hard rock guitarist virtuso Eddie Van Halen), the smooth soul of ""Baby Be Starting Something"" and ""P. Y. T. (Pretty Young Thing)"", and the gentle ballads of ""Human Nature"" and ""The Lady In My Life"".  Then there's the over-the-top schmaltz of the Paul McCartney duet ""The Girl is Mine"", which shows Paul at his sappiest and the weakest track on the record.  It was also the first single released from ""Thriller"".  ""Say, Say, Say"", also recorded in 1982 for as a duet for McCartney's ""Pipes of Peace"", is far stronger and just as successful commercially.That leaves us with two songs: ""Thriller"" and ""Bille Jean"".  ""Thriller"" is an over the top song about evil creatures that lurk in the night, and features voice-over work from none other than Vincent Price, famous for playing Dracula.  Musically it's among the strongest here, and although the lyrics may be a little corny, Michael makes the song so memorable that any minor objections you can come up with are swept away by his performance and the strength of the actual music itself.  One of my favorites, and a song that gets played a lot out Halloween.Then we have ""Billy Jean"", the most contentious song in regards to Quincy Jones and Michael.  ""Billy Jean"" has long been one of the staple songs from the early 1980s. However, though massively popular, Quincy Jones, Jackson's producer, vehemently disliked ""Billie Jean"", and did not think it was strong enough to be on the album.  Jackson insisted the track to be on the album, and the rest is history.  Jackson said: ""A musician knows hit material. Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you and it makes you feel good. That's how I felt about 'Billie Jean'. I knew it was going to be big when I was writing it.""  ""Billie Jean"" became one of the biggest hits of 1983.  Bruce Swedien mixed the song ninety one times before Jackson was satisfied.  Jones wanted to cut the long intro, but Michael insisted the intro be kept in, because, according to Michael, the intro made him want to dance.And there you have it.  In 2009 after Michael died, ""Thriller"" reentered the charts and became the 14th best selling album of that year.  In the years that came after, Michael became increasing bizzare, embroiled in the child sex abuse scandals, holding his son Blanket over a hotel window balcony, and his physical appearance becoming more and more disfigured.  That doesn't change the fact that he made some tremendous music that touched millions of people, and this is some of the best music around, by anyone.*As far as the remakes on the 25th Anniverary edition, they're terrible.  Sorry, we don't need will.i.am., Akron, etc.  They're jsut bad remixes and tarnishing to the legacy of the album.  It would have better to have more unreleased material like the great song ""For All Time"".  Jones and Michael apparently worked on over thirty songs for ""Thriller"", and more unreleased material would be vastly more interesting than these ""contemporary"" remix crap.  With music this timeless you don't need younger artists adding their own flourishes to an acknowledged masterpiece such as this.  ""Someone in the Dark"" from the Steven Spielberg movie ""E. T.: The Extra Terrestrial"" and ""Carousel"" are also good.**Hopefully one day we'll see a ""Thriller"" box set similar to the Twenty Fifth Anniversary Edition of ""Bad"", which is SOOOO MUCH BETTER than the Twenty Fifth Anniversary of ""Thriller""..--------------------------------------------------Some Additional Info for those interested:""Rock With Me"" become one of the first Billboard Top 100 number one singles of the 1980s, and was the fourth highest selling single of 1980.  Rod Temperton wrote three songs of Jackson on his 1982 album ""Thriller"": ""Baby Be Mine"", ""Thriller"", and ""The Lady in My Life"".  He also wrote three songs from the 1979 album ""Off the Wall"": the aforementioned ""Rock With Me"", the title cut ""Off the Wall"", and ""Burn The Disco Out"".Quincy Jones, Jackson's producer, approached Rod Temperton, who wrote the title cut ""Off the Wall"" for Jackson's 1979 album, asking him to come up with the title to the next project.Temperton sad the following: ""Originally, when I did my Thriller demo, I called it Starlight. Quincy said to me, 'You managed to come up with a title for the last album, see what you can do for this album.' I said, 'Oh great,' so I went back to the hotel, wrote two or three hundred titles, and came up with the title 'Midnight Man'. The next morning, I woke up, and I just said this word... Something in my head just said, this is the title. You could visualise it on the top of the Billboard charts. You could see the merchandising for this one word, how it jumped off the page as 'Thriller'.""In 1982, Jackson and Jones recorded the song ""Thriller"" over a period of eight weeks.  Bruce Swedien, the person responsible for mixing ""Thriller"", commented on how instrumental Jones was to the whole recording process:""When we started 'Thriller', the first day at Westlake, we were all there and Quincy [Jones, the producer] walked in followed by me and Michael and Rod Temperton and some of the other people. Quincy turned to us and he said, 'OK guys, we're here to save the recording industry.' Now that's a pretty big responsibility - but he meant it. And that's why those albums, and especially 'Thriller', sound so incredible. The basic thing is, everybody who was involved gave 150 per cent ... Quincy's like a director of a movie and I'm like a director of photography, and it's Quincy's job to cast [it]. Quincy can find the people and he gives us the inspiration to do what we do.""Michael Jackson and John Landis made the famous ""Thriller"" music video.  Landis is famous for such films as ""National Lampoon's Animal House"", ""The Blues Brothers"", ""An American Werewolf in London"", ""Trading Places"", ""Coming to America"", and ""The Stupids"".Conceived more as a short film than a music video, the video famously features Jackson and a large ensemble of zombies dancing on a choreographed dance routine and a script that resembles cheesy 1950s horror films.  Jackson's co-star as the female lead was the ""Playboy"" centerfold Ola Ray.  The video has been inducted into the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2009, the only music video to ever be added to that famed registry.Michael Jackson made the following statement regarding the video in 1999: ""My idea was to make this short film with conversation ... in the beginning - I like having a beginning and a middle and an ending, which would follow a story. I'm very much involved in complete making and creating of the piece. It has to be, you know, my soul. Usually, you know, it's an interpretation of the music. [...] It was a delicate thing to work on because I remember my original approach was, 'How do you make zombies and monsters dance without it being comical?' So I said, 'We have to do just the right kind of movement so it doesn't become something that you laugh at.' But it just has to take it to another level. So I got in a room with [choreographer] Michael Peters, and he and I together kind of imagined how these zombies move by making faces in the mirror. I used to come to rehearsal sometimes with monster makeup on, and I loved doing that. So he and I collaborated and we both choreographed the piece and I thought it should start like that kind of thing and go into this jazzy kind of step, you know. Kind of gruesome things like that, not too much ballet or whatever.""Throughout the years since its release, ""Thriller"" and The Eagles compilation album ""Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975) have held the title as the top selling album in music history in the American market, though globally ""Thriller"" easily beats any other record."
1,"I bought the tape of Now That I Found You after seeing Alison Krauss and her Union Station bandmates in concert in Branson, Missouri, a number of years ago.  Alison's hits &quot;Baby, Now That I Found You&quot;, a '60s pop song, and &quot;When You Say Nothing At All&quot;, the classic Keith Whitley song, are on here.  I also liked Alison's remake of the old Beatles song &quot;I Will&quot;, featuring some fine work by Tony Furtado on banjo.  Not only does Alison do a beautiful job of singing and fiddling, but her Union Station bandmates, who accompany her on most of the songs on this record, are talented musicians as well.  Up until '95, when Now That I Found You was released, Alison was recognized mainly when she sang background vocals on other artists' records, and her music, though it is stellar, didn't get noticed very much except by bluegrass and folk music fans.  This album, which went platinum, was Alison's breakthrough because it got a lot more people interested in her music.  If you haven't heard Alison Krauss's music before, I recommend that you check out Now That I Found You.  It's a great introduction."
1,"TONI BRAXTON was a smashing debut CD back in the 90s, and still is. Braxton's unique voice combined with original, impossible to label songs like the sexy standout ""Breathe Again"" show what magic first-rate producers like L.A. Reid and Babyface can do with an extraordinary singer. Braxton caresses her lyrics with jazzy, Anita Baker-ish embellishments, slurred phrasing, breathy come-ons, and leaping octaves. She swings, sways, wails and wallops her way through this outstanding showcase. Beautifully sung and still sounds fresh as when it was first released."
1,"It has become pretty well known that Roland Orzabal, the guiding light behing TFF has had a tendency to be a little too much of a perfectionist. Let me start off by saying that the title cut is probably the most fantastic sonic adventure I have ever experienced (although its sound is very Beatlesque Sgt. Pepper period it is original on its own and a true masterpiece). The rest just kind of leaves me flat and it is not because of lack of effort or melody. It just seems kind of overblown. &quot;Badlands&quot; tries to incorporate jazz influences but just comes off as long and tedious. Other cuts are tuneful and melodic enough but just don't move me. I think a lot might have to do with how brilliant the title cut is and I am being honest. I expected to just be blown away with the rest of it but was dissappointed because everything pales in comparision."
1,"The Moody Blues' career has spanned four decades, their synthesized/symphonic sound has endeared them to millions of fans, myself included.  While Justin Hayward and John Lodge's vocal prowess is limited, they write great melodies and imaginative lyrics.  Their ability to construct layered vocals and music have made them a definitive band in this esoteric arena.This 1983 release offers their bouncy pop style, their majestic ballads and even a country-tinged cry-in-your-beer song.  The opener, BLUE WORLD, is my favorite track, capitalizing on all their best qualities.  The raucuous SITTING AT THE WHEEL is a rocking addition.  RUNNING WATER is an emotionally charged ballad.  IT'S COLD OUTSIDE OF YOUR HEART is the country-tinged effort but a little too noticeable departure for a more cosmopolitan band.THE PRESENT is not an exemplary entry in the band's catalogue, but it's welcome in my collection!"
1,"Get a Life is a good example of Soul II Soul. There first album was good, but this one has a little bit of all kind's of beat's.People has a house groove.Missing You has the original Soul II Soul vibe, like Keep on  Moving.It is a great song for any occasion.I have alot of fun with this  recording."
1,"I was into this early. Not yet 17 and trying out apsycho-delic lifestyle, Carole came to call. Not acidrock like Uriah Heep etc. I found this to be cool too....What a memory for me! I've just purchased this from thegreat Amazon.com. Delivered, I'll pay less than goingdowntown Toronto to my local retailer. This is worth it.....Breadmanwalking......"
1,"Luis Mejia (son) - Elton John came in this album with a stunning concentration on every track of this marvelous, strongly produced #1 album, Honky Chateau. When I heard it first I considerated it as simply ""good"", but after hearing to it twice that's when I realized how strong, catchy, and even funny album Elton John had the pleasure to release.Honky Chateau contains a lot of enjoyable and familiar sounds through the record, including a lot of folkish compositions, mixing it with classic style pianno ballads and some rock and roll. Along its moods I noticed the album to be very catchy, enjoyable, funny, soft and juvenile, also having some dramatic moments, making it his most comprehensible and easy to listen album.among the tracks each one of them is as enjoyable as the other one, but very original and unique:- Honky Cat: a famous hit song with a lot of folkish sounds and a fresh mood, having a very mellodic electric piano performed by Elton and some ocassional trumpets, perfect for hearing it driving through a lost in the map road in some deep, farm area.- Mellow: a light piano song which is mainly a funny, juvenile song, very simple though, having a light folkish sound introduced when applying the electric violin, although it has its moments.- I Think I'm Going To Kill Myself: another funny, fresh and catchy song, one of my personal favorites, which Elton performes in the perfect way, singing in a freaky way and in a mood just like a crazy man (and I say it in the best sense), also having a fantastic mellody and even having a tap sound part! although the song has its dramatic moment at the end of the second part of the chorus.- Susie (dramas): the song title says it, a dramatic song very alike with Texan Love Song and The Ballad Of Danny Bailey, although a little bit exagerated its a suburban, strong song.- Rocket Man: a long time favorite hit which is the most recognizable track in the album, being a piano ballad mainly focused on piano and applying brief guitars with a semi dramatic mood, its a song much more alike with his past works, and my personal favorite in the album.- Salvation: another good ballad but it goes just too fast being a short song; a couple of more lines in the lyrics would've made it perfect; also the instrumental interlude goes too fast.- Slave: the original version of this song is mainly a song defined by a lot of guitar, banjo and congas, but without Elton playing the piano, which makes the track a little boring. The alternative version is a lot faster and I like it more just because Elton plays the piano and it also features some synthesizers, but the same problem happens like with Salvation; it goes too fast being too short, but enjoyable after all.- Amy: another dramatic song very alike with Susie (dramas), although it keeps its difference for being just a little bit more profound. its the second track to feature Jean-Luc Ponty in the electric violin.- Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters: my second personal favorite, it was a minor hit but its lyrics and composition are very delicate and rythmical. The song mainly spins around Davey Johnstone's mandoline.- Hercules: another minor hit and a song that explodes the best instrumentation in the record, applying one of Elton's best piano performances, it also includes synthesizers, light backing vocals, drums, guitars and even rhino whistle (whatever that is it appears on the performance credits). Its also the most rock and roll alike song.The two greatest highlights in the album are Elton and Taupin outrageously simple but amazing compositions, and the variety of instruments applyied, noticing that this is the first Elton John album not to feature strings (excepting two songs).In conclussion the album its an amazing, easy to listen, delicate, juvenile, fresh composition regarded as one of the greatest Elton John's albums of all time, just ""a simple classic""."
1,together with barry gibb this disc is a must have what kind of fool and woman in love are still gems and sound great today.only neil diamond brought out the same quality in barbara as does barry gibb.
1,"Cyndi had been working as a professional singer for a few years, unknown to the public, before hitting the big time with this album, which yielded four international hit singles, all of which made the top five in America. This album of raucous rock music sold several million copies so, though it is not my favorite Cyndi album, this was easily her most successfulThe first two hits (Girls just want to have fun, Time after time) made the top three in Britain although the net two (She bop, All through the night) were only minor UK hits. The title track is a gender-adapted cover of a song originally written in 1929. Thus, even on this album, Cyndi showed an interest in songs of a bygone age, something that became much more obvious with her more recent covers album, At last. Another notable song here is When you were mine (written by Prince).Cyndi was hailed as the next megastar following the phenomenal success of this album. It was not to be - Madonna became the megastar instead - but Cyndi has recorded some great music since then including the follow-up, True colors, as well as an outstanding Christmas album (Have a nice life) and a wonderful collection of standards (At last)."
1,"I love the fact that there are so many 5 star reviews for this album; one guy compares this to Jackson Browne, and he is really onto what they were after when they created this.  This is the first time a metal band expanded their pallette to really include an adult contemporary audience in their net.  This is also probably the only band talented enough to be able to.  So you not only have Browne, but also Springsteen (""Desert Plains""), Billy Joel, and a good helping of the Stones.  A true, passionate, and intelligent work; this is one of the most original albums I've ever heard."
1,"Originally released in 1968, as this was the Los Angeles short-lived psych band's only record, unfortunately. Wound up liking this CD reissue much better than I had expected. With this Sundazed reissue, you get the lp's initial ten songs + ten more bonus cuts tagged on for good measure. Thoroughly enjoyed a couple of their awesome [undiscovered psychedelic gems] ""Cloud Song"" followed by ""The Garden Of Earthy Delights"", the quirky ""I Won't Leave My Wooden Wife For You, Sugar"", the harmony vocals enriched ""Where Is Yesterday"", the adventurous six-minute ahead-of-it's time ""Stranded In Time"" and ""Metaphor For An Older Man"". Turns out the extra tunes you get on this disc isn't bad either. Recommended for fans of Druids Of Stonehenge, Fifty Foot Hose and early Jefferson Airplane."

1,"For the most part, Bags' Groove is nothing more than standard-issue bebop. I stress ""for the most part"" because of the colossal title track, an eleven minute groove that sinks in and never lets go. Guest appearances by Milt ""Bags"" Jackson and Thelonious Monk are not wasted. At all. Nor do they overshadow Miles. The chemistry between them is perfect - great song to get lost in. Now, most of the other songs here are just, um... they happened, they existed, now what? - a flaw I find in several early Davis albums, Birth of the Cool aside. Still, they're tasteful, they're never annoying, nicely performed, and one of 'em's actually pretty good - I'm a fan of ""Airegin"", though it can never hope to match the title song, which actually overshadows a lot of Miles' pre-Coltrane career (""Walkin'"" and about half of Birth of the Cool aside). Oh, ""If Not For Me"" is nice enough, I guess. ""Oleo"" and ""Doxy""? I could take them or leave them. Regardless, Miles' career would later reach much higher heights."
1,"Mica is a UK soulqueen who has to be taken seriously. She is still there, she is still touring and she is also a wonderful classical singer (what she is doing at the moment). Mica shows what a wonderful voice she has on this album. Good classic smooth soul with fantastic songs. &quot;You put a move...&quot; was later re-done by Tamia, but the original is way better..."
1,"What can I add what anybody has said before? This is an album that started a new genre (crossover) just like Korn did with nu metal. Some believe Urban dance squad started it but i still believe Rage was first. It's influential cause of this and their new experiments with riffs and other guitar sounds. No catchy, 3 minute bubblegum pop tunes but long, experimental masterpieces. Morello's 'space-guitar' is incredible and Zacks flow and rhymes are intelligent and witty. Everytime I put on on of these songs I get chills and emotionally moved. Only thing I noticed is that all songs have the same structure. They all end with Zack shouting a repeated line. They influenced almost all crossover bands that shout their nonsense lyrics in their mics today. They also were a great, overwhelming live experience (I still watch woodstock '99 every now and then). Only bad thing about them was they split up. What do we got instead? Audioslave? meh"
1,"If you're looking to begin your quest through the Aerosmith oeuvre, this may not be the best album for you. However, once you check out their mid-70s landmark recordings, you should make your way back to this record. No one can deny the greatness of &quot;Dream On&quot; or &quot;Mama Kin.&quot; There are also plenty of other great songs that show the band in a different light than all others that followed. Steven's voice sounded different plus Joe had yet to become an integral member of the songrwriting team. Because of that, this is a unique album that shows the roots of the band's sound."
1,So what if the recording sounds lousy. This is the rawest most crudest and best rock & roll Aerosmith has ever done. Energy and songs is the priority over quality. I love the sound of Perry's old amp(probably a 50's Fender champ?) sound like the tubes are dying at the beginning of Somebody and they left it in for posterity! Perfect.
1,"I RECENTLY SAW NEIL IN CONCERT.  I GOT SO EXCITED, I THREW MYDEPENDS AT HIM.  I'M AN 80-YEAR-OLD WOMAN.  SO I'M NOT SUREIF I HAD A BM BEFORE.  ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT HE'S THE SEXIESTMAN ALIVE, AND ANYTHING HE SINGS IS FINE WITH ME."
1,"This debut is amazing, one of the best ever. It sold more than five million copies. Steve Howe, Carl Palmer, Geoff Downes and John Wetton wrote music history here. All the tracks are killers, catchy but strong, pop but heavy, simple but complex. Of course, such marvelous chemistry couldn't last long, and their next effort, ALPHA, was a complete turkey. (but sold more than one million copies!!)"
1,This is one of Stevie's Finest! I love the songs and the vocals. I can  safely say that this is a perfect album and I am glad to own it!
1,"I love the Moody Blues.  Rock with an orchestra.  Really unique, intricate, beautiful, creative music.  Interestingly, the music stands the test of time.  &quot;Nights In White Satin&quot;, is as relevant and modern today as it was when I was in college in 1967. A great classical piece, which should be viewed in that context.  The concert contains all their popular songs as well as three from the &quot;Keys Of The Kingdom&quot; disk, and an overture.  The music is 15 stars and I am listening to it over and over.  Justin Hayward and John Lodge are great writers.  The lyrics are poetic and lovely and it's just great music.  Period.  It's just great music.  There is very little crowd noise on the disk, which is also a plus.  The orchestra is womderful, and the interaction between the band and the orchestra is appropriate and tasteful.  The songs where the orchestra is omitted are great and the band stands alone.  There is only one thing wrong with this disc.  The sonics are not good.  The rhythm section really suffers.  Graeme Edge and John Lodge just don't show up here.  The drums sounds like it was miked from a distance and the bass doesn't appear.  It really makes the listening experience uncomfortable.  It makes the disk sound  cheesy and cheap at spots.  Too bad.  However, I would still buy the disk.  The band and the orchestra are just great.  I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.  You know who."
1,"Admittedly, this is one of Simon and Garfunkel's more dated albums. Though  Simon is a brilliant lyricist, some of his couplets here fall a bit flat  and sound Sophomoric today. Still, there is no one writing today who came  close to his brilliance, even at the incipient stages of his career, as  demonstrated here. &quot;Kathy's Song&quot; remains one of his most magical  set of words (&quot;My mind's distracted and diffused&quot;) and &quot;A  Most Peculiar Man&quot; sounds a bit dated, but who cares? It's still a  wonderful and quirky song.If you are new to S &amp; G, I would opt for  &quot;Bookends&quot; or &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; before you  buy this album. It's not in the same league as their other offerings, but  it's still a solid album which shows the emerging genius of Paul Simon."
1,"You cannot fit all of Marvin's hits on a single CD but this collection has most of the essentials from a British perspective. One advantage that this has over the double CD (Very best of, which was compiled in America but released in both the UK and USA) is that it includes three UK top ten hits that are not on the double CD, these being Onion song (supposedly with Tammi Terrell, though Tammi was too ill to record the song and a sound-alike substituted), You are everything (with Diana Ross) and Abraham Martin and John (which was an American hit for Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, not Marvin Gaye).There is no room on this CD to explore Marvin's career in depth or to explore the many American hits that didn't chart in Britain, but it does contain all his important British hits (some minor hits have been omitted) and on that basis, it provides an excellent overview of Marvin's career. Nevertheless, before buying this, you may wish to compare it with the double CD, Very best of (now re-issued as Gold)."
1,"The king of the south with no doubt brings some more heat for his 2nd solo project.  Filled with some hardcore gangsta songs and some of the deepest songs ever but to a beat in rap, Face does what his fans have loved him for since he broke into the game in the mid to late 80's.  Not his best album to date, but like all his albums it's worthy of at least 4 stars and better than most of the rap put out now-a-days.  Only one song has a guest on it (the pre-teen 2Low).  Like with all his albums, not many songs; only has 12 of them, 2 are classics, 2 are ok, the other 8 are good.  Production is mostly done by N.O. Joe (8 songs), Face does 2 himself, and James Smith & John Bido collaborate for 2 as well.

1,"The eponymous solo debut by Pink Floyd's lead guitarist is an exceptional effort. Surprisingly, it doesn't sound very much like a Pink Floyd album. It managed to get to #29 on the charts. There weren't any singles that penetrated Billboard's Top 200 but how often did Pink Floyd do that?The album opens with the instrumental ""Mihalis"" which is one of the best songs on here. ""There's No Way Out of Here"" was written by a friend of his. This song, at least in the area I live in, was the most played song on the radio from this album. This is the best song on the album. It has good lyrics, a catchy melody & a distinctive harmonica. ""Cry from the Street"" is also a very good song. ""So Far Away"" is a piano based slow song that's the weakest song on the album. ""Short and Sweet"" sounds as if it could be a Pink Floyd effort. ""Raise My Rent"" is an instrumental that also could have been a Pink Floyd song; it also has one of Gilmour's trademark leads. ""No Way"" is another very good song  with another trademark lead. ""Deafinitely"" is another instrumental & is only an average song, Gilmour does one of those odd sounding leads on this one. ""I Can't Breathe Anymore"" closes out the disc. Has anyone else ever noticed how often Gilmour songs have a reference to breathing? It starts off slow then builds up to some crushing rhythm & leads by Gilmour.This is Gilmour's most consistent effort. It sounds more like Pink Floyd than his two other solo efforts. The remastering by Columbia/Legacy is excellent. The booklet provides no information but there are some photos, some of them appear to have been taken while he was very young, high school perhaps. Apparently David Gilmour, Rick Wills & Willie Wilson must have played together when they were young; some of the photos show them playing together live when they were younger. Rick Wills (bass & vocals) would later become the bassist for Foreigner beginning with Head Games. Interestingly, Wills was also a co-composer of Frampton's ""Do You Feel Like We Do""."
