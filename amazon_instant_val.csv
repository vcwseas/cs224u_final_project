1,My grandson is a budding math genius. I have had to revise how we learn things mathematical and loves doing math with the team.
1,"This is a very well done action film. Suburb, realistic action scenes and cinematography. Awesome depiction of the Samurai warrior caste. I usually do not get into a film with subtitles but it works here."
1,"This season is simply not as good as the previous ones. While the previous seasons were excentric and wild, in a most unusual way, here the attempts to go for gross-outs actually spolis the humour. The cast is great as the bunch of low-lifes who run Paddy's bar in Philadelphia but while there was acrazy funny side to the humour, now it is simply crazed. Danny De Vito was allways a problem because his character is not likeable at all in this series. The titles of the episodes say all: Mac and Charlie Die, Who Pooped the bed, Sweet Dee has a heart attack.... It does simply not hold up to the standards of the first seasons, which were irreverent funny. The worst bar in Philadelphia episode is the best and goes quite over the top with the gang kidnapping a restaurant reviewer for sacking their pub. The live performance featurette is good. there are still som funny moments but you will be better off starting with seasons 1 and 2."
1,Top notch shows with excellent acting and superb special effects. We enjoy watching and rewatching each one of these specials.
1,"Don't miss this series. This is as good as it gets. Strong characters, great fx, plenty of complicated plot. See it."
1,"I watched the first four Seasons of Damages on Amazon Prime, but could not find the 5th Season anywhere. This was a few months back, and suddenly, I saw Season 5 offered on Prime, so I watched it. I enjoyed it, but the &#34;3 weeks later,&#34; 2 months earlier nonsense made me want to go back and watch Season  1 again (probably will watch all again with little time in between) to see if I remembered what happened correctly. I love the plot and the actors; I do not like the crazy skipping in time sequence, and I don't see the point in trying so hard to confuse the viewer. I'm watching again to try to see if I get it all correctly, but it should not be this hard. I probably would not have bought any seasons after the first, if it had not been offered on Prime, for this very reason. I do think I'll watch the other seasons again; the twists in the plot and the crazy time sequence makes viewing again interesting--just for one to make sure one got it right!  Damages would clearly be a five star show if it were not for the time sequencing. Whoever thought that up needs to think again!"
1,I started watching this series on cable. Caustic social commentary and biting humor. Over the top! Worth a watch! It's that good.
1,"This is the first show since ""24"" that I cannot stop watching, gladly. Interesting conversations, scenes are loaded with suspense and just about everyone appears suspiciouse, except, of course, the main guy, Will. Of course, it's too intelligent to last more than one season! More drivel reality shows, more drivel and more drivel.!"
1,"Though Matt Smith isn't my FAVORITE Doctor, he's still brilliant in all of these Specials. The Christmas Carol one is okay, the Narnia knockoff is kind of cute, the Snowmen is GREAT! It's all Doctor Who, so the worst episode of this show is better than the best episode of pretty much anything else!"
1,"The adventures Dr Who takes you on are exciting, suspenseful and human.  Matt Smith has come through with his own characterization of the Dr."
1,If Victorian chick flicks are your cup of tea then this is a good one. These stupid reviews have a minimum word requirement so this content was added.
1,what a great show. very macho though. my wife says too much violence. i says plenty of action. great writing.
1,"This is a smidge above-average as far as the TV-rendering of true ghost sightings go.  Every so often, you will hear an EVP or see a picture that can actually be deemed credible.  Chill, unease, and creepiness can be experienced in this series, but erroneous conclusions (unrequited love, tragic-death apparitions, spirits looking for the Light) are often unjustifiably forthcoming, which makes many of the stories seem forced.  This series, as most in the genre, seems unwilling to focus on the malevolent and gratuitous hate behind most, if not all, manifestations and opts out for the charming and quaint explanations behind a haunting. Sometimes &#34;Aunt Rita&#34; is just not your Aunt Rita.  All this said, it's still a fun and safe way to spend the better part of an hour exploring what goes bump in the night.  Worth the watch."
1,Had heard great things about this series and sampled 5 shows last night.  Very addictive series with great suspense.Love the diverse characters and smart dialogue.  Lots of plot twists.  Brilliant acting by Glenn Close and Ted Danson.  What a great find!  Looking forward to more nights of viewing.
1,"World's Greatest Dad hooked me the first time I read about it debuting at Sundance. I heard, ""dark comedy,"" and, ""Robin Williams,"" and was instantly interested. Then the trailer and plot summary really reeled me in. The result is a film that not only surpassed expectations, but also went in an unexpected direction. When a film is described as a dark comedy, it has usually still stuck to specific guidelines. Maybe it still followed a similar formula to what other comedies did before it. These other films that are labeled as dark comedies don't really break any new ground. World's Greatest Dad goes beyond that. It breaks any ground rules that were laid before it and doesn't follow any sort of formula. When they say, ""dark,"" they aren't kidding. The subject content is pretty disturbing yet is somehow still humorous.Robin Williams plays the role of a dad who's trying to do his best with the obstacles life has thrown at him incredibly well. With everything that's going on in his life, even in the moments of the film where he doesn't speak, it looks like he's constantly thinking about something. Always dwelling on what's going on around him with the people who are close to him in his life and trying to decide how he's going to handle this situation he's gotten himself into. While his role does show a bit of his comedic side, Robin Williams proves he can handle serious roles rather well with this performance.While I obviously can't say much about what direction the film goes in without completely spoiling the film, I will say that the trailer does a good job of not giving any of that away. Once the film makes that turn though, it really follows through with it and doesn't let up. One of the best parts of the experience of watching this film for the first time is seeing how far the concept of the film is going to go. As Lance buries himself in this, people begin to say the actions that were taken changed their life for the better. If you told a lie that did that to not just one person, but practically an entire high school...how would you tell them the truth?World's Greatest Dad is not going to be for everyone. Some people will love it and others will just downright hate it. The film isn't just dark, it's DARK. That and it's a very different kind of comedy with an unexpected turn of events. Most of the humor is very dry, so if that's not your thing then I wouldn't recommend it. For me personally though, it's one of the most interesting films I've seen in quite some time."
1,"This is a good show, just not really moving. It is a good who dunnit for anyone to watch. Nice show."
0,not a fan. daughter didnt sit still long enought to really get a grib on what this is all about
1,Not too exited about this one.  Usual fair - chases and fights and gun shootings.  Feel .like have been there done that.
1,I love Survivor and Season 15 is definitely in my top 5 or 6. I highly recommend watching. There are a few really fun characters.
1,i just can't believe they cancelled this show.  it was so groundbreaking and funny.  every episode was new and original.  the writers should win awards.
1,"I'm not crazy about my son watching TV, but I make an exception for Blue's Clues. It is very sweet and my son loves it."
1,"This show was absolutely fantastic - sharp, sarcastic, and funny. It mocked the absurdities of the office culture, employers' complete disregard of the well-being of employees, and a vast gap between the management and the 'drones.' I am mystified why it was cancelled after only two seasons, but am also glad that I did not get to see its decline - which reminds me of 'Common Law' - another great but prematurely cancelled comedy show. I'm happy to own it ; I re-watched some episodes many times. Oh, and those Veridian Dynamics 'ads' are a strike of pure genius!"
1,"Sam wasn't a believable SEAL the first two seasons.  I suspect the show received an extensive amount of help with that, because the character is far more like the laid back SEALs I've met."
1,"Since great crime shows like the Shield and the Sopranos have ended, it's nice to see networks putting out shows like Sons of Anarchy to fill in the missing gap.Sons of Anarchy is about the inner workings of a Biker gang and is seen through the eyes of it's VP, Jax (a perfectly cast Charlie Hunnam). Like most protagonists of shows like this Jax is dedicated but reluctant in his gang's activities. His reluctancies about his biker brothers' methods (especially the gang's leader Clay) are even more pronounced with the birth of his premature son and discovery of his deceased father's journal (who seemed to have his own reluctancies). The episodes (especially in the beginning)play out almost exactly how you expect them to usually closing with a journal entry from Jax's father reflecting his beliefs in contrast to the episodes plot. Thankfully the show's entertaining enough that you usually wont care and things actually start to get more complex in the last few episodes (hopefully this bodes for an even stronger season 2!).The acting in Sons of Anarchy is perfect top to bottom. Ron Perlman has never been better as Clay the biker leader who fears losing control over his crew. Katey Sagal is exceptional as Clay's wife (and Jax's mother), someone with a shady past who puts the gang's ideals before anything else (even her family).Sons of Anarchy may not be the most original show out there but it is entertaining. If it seems like it's stealing ideas from other shows at least they're GOOD ideas. If you're a fan of good crime shows like the Shield, you wont want to miss this strong series."
1,"I was happy to see these episodes available.  I watch one of them every once in a while.  I wish more were available, but I'm happy that Amazon got these available."
0,"How can you run from the dark?  After waking up to an empty city Luke (Christensen) and a small group of survivors try to find a way to escape.  When they realize the darkness is what is causing the vanishings can they find enough light to survive?  Based on the previews I had pretty high expectations for this movie, it was very slow moving.  The idea was pretty creepy, and it is tons better then ""The Happening"", although the story line was pretty similar.  This movie seems like a really good ""Twilight Zone"" episode, but it doesn't really work as a full length movie.  It gets repeatitive pretty quick.  It begins as a pretty scary movie, but runs out of steam quick and begins to drag.  This is not a bad movie at all, but after the ""last man on earth"" type movies like ""I Am Legend"" this one doesn't really compare.  Much, much better then ""The Happening"", but not one to rush out and see.  I give it a C.Would I watch again? - Probebly not.*Also try - Skyline & The Happening"
1,I found it trite and the characters immature.  12 more words required about something I basically disliked but was able to tolerate.  In truth I left the room a lot.
0,"If you're going to parody American horror films there are only three requirements: be funny, cover a variety of situations, and keep the pace up.  This mostly fails on every count.  The ""audience"" gorging themselves on poison is too literal.  The main characters are far too bland.  Insomniacs should buy it: watching this tire roll is very sleep-inducing."
1,Each episodes investigative subject matter is unique and a departure from the norm.  I believe typical Syfy fans would find this two season series quite entertaining.
1,"Always on the lookout for quality children's programming for our family, my wife and I fell in love with this show.  I think I like watching it even more than the kids.  We typically stick with educational shows, which I do not believe this would fall into, but consider this to be a quality show.In addition to its innocence, this show is full of great songs and really encourages imagination.  It is very well thought out, with sub plots of each episode neatly relating to one another and all tying together.This is GREAT stuff!"
1,here we go again a certain number of words necessary when fewer words would do just fine to give a thumbs up.
1,"I knew nothing about this series except that Betty White was in it (and who doesn't love Betty); I found that I could watch it free through my Kindle Fire so I went to town. This half-hour comedy is the funniest show I have seen in a long time; a laugh-out loud, pee in your pants type of laugh. You will recognize all the main characters beginning with Betty White, Wendi Mallic,  Jane Leeves (Frazier) Valerie  Berlinelli (One Day at a Time and many Lifetime and other shows).The show starts out where these three lovely ladies decide to go on  a vacation  to France. The plane unexpectedly  has to land in Cleveland (CLEVELAND????) - (THEIR THOUGHTS EXACTLY). In Cleveland compared to the other women (not true Clevelandites) these three look like movie stars and are given a great deal of attention by the attractive -he-men- of the first bar they hit. Long story short they decide to move to Cleveland where their egos are pumped up every day with every man they meet. They rent a house but Betty White-the housekeeper for fifty years can be fired or they can keep her---keep her they did and the show begins with their life in Cleveland with some mention of their life in LA  (so you learn what they did in LA) and how different Cleveland was but they loved it.There are many guest stars including Regis Philborn, David Spade, Tim Conway, and many many more very funnymen and women - Joan Rivers plays Betty's twin sister....ya' gotta' see that one!Betty is absolutely without a doubt the funniest lady we have ever had; she doesn't have to open her mouth for her body language and her facial expression(s) say it all.The story of these four begins and every single show is a gem unto itself. Do not miss this FAB  sitcom.I don't usually like l/2 hour shows but on my Kindle Fire (did I mention the first three seasons are free to Prime members) I could not put it down and, as they say, laughter is the best medicine, 'they' are so right.Don't miss this one-you'll laugh your ass off and wonder how in the hell  Betty can remember all her lines; do all that she does and still remain totally in control, funny as all get out (anybody say that anymore?) and worth the price of the dvds.I couldn't be happier that I saw this show and because the fourth season is $1.99 per show I'm going to get the DVD or wait until it comes out free on my Fire.  I plan to  watch the whole thing over and over --I'll bet you will too!!!! E N J O Y !!!!!"
1,Please get the rest of the series  thanks youDavid Suchet is the ONLY Poirot......  You will enjoy itThank You aMAZON
1,"About 3.5 stars, and here's why. I expected a little low-budget work, given that this was supposed to be a documentary made by young adult film-makers still in school. However, the camera work was pretty decent. I did not like the Blair Whatever Project, or really anything similar- I thought it a terrible example of mockumentary work. This film kept me engaged for most of the time, due to the subject matter and the skillful integration of the CGI. The characters, if you suspend belief (this is not meant to be real, after all) are likeable and, well, believable,  and although not much time is spent fleshing them out, still do a nice job. I grew up listening to and later finding my own collections of fairy tales, so this was not much of a stretch for me, minus the incredibly large troll that dwarfed the landscape. That particular one I couldn't imagine being secret for long, although admittedly the maps of Norway do show sparse population centers in much of the area. All in all it was an interesting modern take on what the film called a wild population of indigenous creatures, and the &#34;conservationists in charge of them. Or more specifically from the dialog: wild animals, and the hunters that kept them in check. There was a scene or two that dragged, but once the trolls came out to play, it got interesting. Decent film, not a waste of time- and watchable by children. Who knows, perhaps films like this could bring back interest in fairy tales of old, unlike the latest silly live-action Disney-style movies that try to make sensational action movies out of the stories. Somehow, those just don't work."
1,"The premise is that a brainless, model, Deb, accidentally dies, presses a button and is accidentally sent back to earth. Unfortunately, she's sent back in the body of an overweight lawyer, Jane, who was a good person (I know a lawyer that was a good person).The main actress, Brooke Elliott does a great job playing a woman who still sees herself as a model living in a world that perceives her as overweight lawyer; seeing her character evolve from a self indulgent model into someone building a conscious is entertaining. She is forced into ethical dilemmas weekly that are funny, sad, or sometimes touching. There are also plenty of ""big name"" special guest stars playing some really funny characters.Truthfully, with the plot I'm surprised this isn't just another fluff show but it isn't. This show leaves you feeling good about the world, hopeful; I don't know how but it does.I guess I should add that the first couple of shows aren't as good as the later shows but they lay the ground work, so you should watch them knowing that the show turns into something special quickly."
0,The son of Williams in this film is so troubled and so rediculous he hates everyone and everything in life including himself. But the anti-homophobic [...] he uses in the first 30 minutes of the film is nearly 30 times. It seemed to me it was a film about hating everyone and a kid so far out of control there was no help... Williams must have needed the paycheck to pay for his heart surgery... this film is a bottomless pit of insult and a whacked out kid who mistreats everyone including his dad... and the dad seems to be caught up in his own selfish rediculous life.... is this the way Americans are?? Sure seems it. What a let down. What an insult for an actor to take a role than try to tell us how genuis it was for a homophobic film to be put out... would we say the same if the word [...] was used instead of the fag word...? As a gay male this is something the Catholics would love to see and bigots are sure to give a great review. For me an open minded free thinker... this is a waste of life and time. I gave it two stars for the acting BUT... (and butts come in all sizes) I doubt Amazon will post it.
1,"A trio of strong performances highlights this three-character thriller from England.  The film wastes no time in establishing its familiar kidnapping scenario.It's what happens once Alice is taken that elevates it beyond the routine crime caper.  There are some unexpected plot twists and an unexpected climax.  Gemma Arterton's Alice is a complex victim, and she does extremely good job in a difficult role.  Martin Compston is Danny, the ""gentler"" kidnapper dominated by his older partner.  He uses his boyish charm to belie his darker nature.  But it is Eddie Marsan as the mastermind who dominates the film.  Marsan's inspired performance gives us both the hardened pro and the softer, almost pathetic side.  A performance of depth and complexity.ALICE CREED is not always easy to watch but it is good movie-making."
1,"Lots of tension with twist, Will will find a way.  Well written, actors are great, musical score what more can one say - a must watch."
1,"""The Eclipse"" is one of those movies that sort of defies description when it comes to pegging its genre. It is not a supernatural movie in the strictest sense though there are supernatural elements throughout the movie. It also has elements of a psychological thriller. I think I'm most comfortable with viewing it as a psychological drama. The movie attracted my attention as I'm a fan of actor Ciaran Hinds who first impressed me inPersuasionas the lead character, and also in his portrayal inThe Mayor of Casterbridge. When I read that Hinds had won the Best Actor award at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival for his role in this movie, I decided to check it out.Hinds portrays a grieving widower Michael in this movie. Michael had lost his beloved wife to an illness about two years ago, and is now a single parent with two children, a girl aged 14 and a boy aged 11. Michael lives in a small coastal Irish town, working as a woodworking teacher, and generally leads a quiet and unassuming life. But recently, Michael finds himself being plagued by disturbing dreams and 'ghostly' visitations that trouble him deeply. Is he merely dreaming/hallucinating or is he really being plagued by otherworldly visitations? Things get a bit more complicated when he meets a London-based author Lena, whose supernatural-themed work titled ""The Eclipse"" captivates him and draws him to the author. Lena is one of the authors who has been invited to read at the local literary festival, and Michael is tasked with taking care of her transportation, etc.To add to all this drama, there's another author, an American, played by Aidan Quinn who is obsessed with Lena. Amidst this, Michael finds his supernatural encounters increasing with alarming frequency and tries desperately to figure out what is going on.The movie moves at a slow yet steady pace, so viewers looking for fast-paced thrills and scares will be sorely disappointed. Those who like atmospheric human dramas and psychological-themed dramas might appreciate this movie, as I did.Warning (Spoilers ahead)Upon reflection, this movie can be interpreted in different ways - a straightforward haunting of a grieving man; or of a man so lost in grief and unable to let go of his late wife and all the shared memories of their life together that he finds death 'clinging' on to him;finally, Michael is also portrayed as an aspiring writer in this movie and is frustrated by his attempts to flesh out a credible story that he feels will be up to par - I saw the supernatural aspects in this movie as Michael's subconscious trying to make sense of these stories that he is attempting to write.This is why the movie appealed to me - not only is it atmospheric with the gloomy yet breathtakingly beautiful Irish coastal landscape, the lead actor as portrayed by Ciaran Hinds embodies a complex character who draws viewers into the story and holds us captive as we try to puzzle out what exactly is going on. The soundtrack with the choir music is effectively haunting, though I must say the jarring crescendo at each 'scare' got a bit tiresome after a while. On the whole, I enjoyed this movie, and found it refreshing and unique in its approach."
1,"THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOB HOPE COLLECTION, MOVIES THAT ARE FUN.I'D RECOMMEND FOR ANY AGE GROUP"
1,"Instead of following the Dexter formula (12 episodes seasons), this new season of Lie To Me expanded to more than twenty episodes. In this case, this implied a lsos of quality, unfortunately.THings are some how weird in this season. The freshness and sheer brilliance of the first season (however flawed or not the whole concept may be) are gone since Episode One. Tim Roth, however, is still great to watch, as is Gillian Foster (forgot the name of the actress).BUt thing are kind of formulaic here. A lot of episodes are completely stand-alone. And they killed Spike!!"
0,"We opened this because the storyline sounded provocative - a mystery at Oxford.  It was not very intriguing starting out, but...willing to wait (sometimes a story has to &#34;warm up.&#34;)  This one became purient-plus (I realize that there is not such word, but how else to emphasize the content of this movie), and must admit we cannot give a full review - we turned it off.  Guess we were naive, for such an open sexual exhibition was not something we would have expected (unless the movie were rated R or xxx - which this one was not.)  We would say that it was right up the alley for a voyeur.  Suggestive is one thing, but this was eversomuch more.Therefore, can say if you enjoy visual sex, this is the movie for you. If not, would advise you to look elsewhere."
1,"I never thought I would enjoy watching a reality TV show about a pawn shop, but Pawn Stars proved me wrong.  The show is entertaining, educational and above all, funny.  Great dynamics."
1,"For those who are either young or young at heart, this is a very entertaining and fun-filled show set in Australia. It focuses on the trials, tribulations, and love interests of three mermaids who don't even know how they came to be mermaids. While the premise of this show may stretch one's credulity, this is no more problematic than accepting the reality of the majority of TV shows, especially sci-fi with its monsters and end of world scenarios. There is an abundance of Australian eye candy, both the human and natural kind; and, at less than 30 minutes each, the episodes move quickly and have an overall pleasant and relaxing feel about them.One mermaid works in Sea World where she interacts with a trained dolphin; one manages a non-alcoholic bar from time to time where she is also involved from time to time with the owner; one is a singer in said bar where she performs with a small band.  Throw in one hunky diver and his scheming sister, a mysterious cave which is associated in some way with the Moon, and you have an interesting storyline. The special effects are great and you actually come to believe that you are watching real life mermaids in action. Their underwater swimming is almost balletic and has elements of &#34;synchronized swimming&#34;. A catchy opening theme song and its end credits counterpart also adds to the warm feeling that this show imparts.A solid G rating allows a broad audience. One negative is the constant obnoxious behavior of the younger teenage sister of the mermaid Cleo.  She is overbearing to an extreme and never called on it or properly chastised for her deliberate nastiness and mischievous activity.  In fact, her reason for even being a character in this show appears to be non-existent and one wonders why this part was ever created in the first place.  The actress playing her is also unappealing, especially when compared to everyone around her. Perhaps her presence is designed to counterbalance what the producers may have thought was too much saccharin from the others (which I absolutely did not find).  On the contrary, the behavior of the mermaids comes off as being quite &#34;normal&#34;.  One problem for them ironically enough is the fact that they have to avoid water when in their purely human form lest they change into a mermaid right in front of people's eyes, since only a few know that the trio are really mermaids. Enjoy!"
1,Great show! Good for the whole family!
1,I loved the series when it was on and have rewatched it many times.  I saw it at the theaters and couldn't wait to own my own copy.  I have already watched it many times and love it.
1,with Spongebob SquarePants. A lot of adults don't like him but I do and I am 65. I enjoy watching with my grandchildren.
1,Always something going on. Dealing with the moonshiners put the U.S. Marshal's office on high alert. The writers have woven a great believable tale.
1,Clever and amusing with just a touch of intrigue. Costuming and historically accurate. Does Agatha Christi proud. SUCHET is grand!
1,"although highly unrealistic (they make it look like most storage units have hidden treasures -- they certainly don't), the &#34;Collector&#34; is intelligent and entertaining.  Some of the others are just over-the-top silly/annoying"
1,Loved it can not wait to watch season 2 I hope their is a next one!!!!!!!!!I If not thanks AMAZON great show
1,"Loved the characters, their interactions, the crimes and how they were solved.  Love to see this show renewed.  Great fun, entertaining, and educational (for those of us who know nothing about catching the criminal)."
1,"It is like Weeds and Dexter gave birth to one bad @$$ little kid. It says something about today's standards of life when a meth head and a chemist can engage a powerful range of personal growth. There's probably a good joke in that line....But the cook gets burned and finds out he has lung cancer. What's a guy to do when he has a family that depends on him, even after he's gone? Not even the Writer's Strike can get in the way of this train. It's bad. Very bad. And that's good.Why is it that we gravitate towards those who, twenty years ago, who have been abhorrent and never even considered to be 'art' in the media sense of the word. And I guess it says something else about our world today when we've realized not every bad guy is indeed a bad guy. Progressive or the way of the High Road?Whatever. That's all philosophy. Skip the musings and watch a few episodes of this award-winning series. First sampler is one me...."
1,I like this cartoon series. I laughed out loud a lot. I also watched the second season and it was good also.
1,"The series is loosing steam this season as the storylines are running shorter and shorter. The series is entertaining, but continually repeating."
1,"Wonderful show, I love these historical shows like Call the Midwife, and Downton Abby, this one is just as good as the others."
0,Once again TV Types get it WRONG Lying is Lying is LYING .... and so the whole premise of a person becoming better TANKS ... watch the rest on the internet for free .... don't support these writers ...
1,I have seen the Complete series a couple of times.  Every couple of years or so.  It's a Great Show.  But the ending is just Crap. It was a Very Controversial ending.
1,"Back in 2007 I was in Toronto and met some guys who screened Demons 2 one night.  Before the film began they showed a collection of film trailers for Argento films, spaghetti westerns and such, and then the original HOBO trailer played.  It was a wonderfully done trailer that rivaled the ones used in the Tarantino/Rodriguez Grindhouse film.  The director was present in the theater but I didn't speak to him then(too bad), but I always remembered the trailer.  I never thought it would actually become a feature film, let alone star Rutger Hauer.So here we are-Hobo With A Shotgun is a reality, and the exploitation world is the better for it.  Basically it's about a hobo that comes into a crime ridden town and decides to go Bronson when he's seen(and experienced) enough.  The town in the movie is super exaggerated in it's criminal activity-it's a friggin' warzone!  Think of the gang ruled neighborhood in Death Wish 3 and that's how this entire town is!  But then again, everything here is exaggerated.  This movie is very cartoony and brings to mind images of Troma(in fact, a character in the film is wearing a Troma shirt in one scene).  Rutger Hauer is the odd one out in that he's basically the ""normal"", non-cartoon character here.  And that really makes it work.  His downplaying against everyone else's over the top playing really helps give the movie that additional edge to bring it above being total silliness(along with the hot young lady who plays the prostitute.  I forgot her name at the moment).  We all love Hauer, you'd have to be some kind of communist not to.  Though he's been in numerous B movies throughout the years, we've never seen him in something quite like this, something more tongue in cheek.  Movies like Bleeders, Crossworlds and Turbulence 3-Heavy Metal were schlock, but schlock taking itself a bit more seriously.  It's a nice change of pace for Hauer.The film has a decent amount of gore.  Some say it surpasses Machete.  I'm not sure if it does.  Perhaps, but unlike Machete, the gore here is not CGI, which elevates it substantially.The second disc(if you're thinking of buying the 2 disc version) has a nice Making Of.. documentary, interviews with Hauer and director Eisener by Fangoria magazine, the alternate ending, and the original fake trailer(though this may be on disc one, I forgot).  I haven't watched the film on ""Shotgun Mode"" yet, so I'm not sure on that one.All in all, a very good ""grindhouse"" style film here.  Usually these modern throwback movies leave alot to be desired and make you wish you had used your time to watch an actual grindhouse movie instead of these weak imitations.Hobo With A Shotgun is one to be proud of the grindhouse throwback status.  It earns it."
1,"Solid, but forgettable. Just another action movie really. Some things happened, some people fought, I forgot most of it. Blah."
1,This is serious...realy is a good show.  My son & I still enjoy it.i will watch it again & again.
1,"With the cast it could have been better. I think the direction and writing made this rather a long drawn out negative show. Not one bit of light at the end of the tunnel and pretty much ambition and greed leading the way...Washington DC all the way. I get enough of this lovely life on the news. Do not consider it entertaining when it is being played out in our lives. But hey that is just me, you may love it."
0,Look up Bubble Guppies in Webster's and it will say &#34;See also: unwatchable...&#34;  The writers are obviously from either Colorado or Washington and too stoned to get a story together.
1,"This is a story about peoples loss, loneliness and unrealized dreams with a touch of supernatural and a pinch of horror. Worth a viewing."
1,This series had a great first season.  They seemed to lose focus the second season but it is still very entertaining and way ahead of many other offerings.
1,"If you like police shows, you may enjoy this one.  If you are averse to violence, skip it.  The show follows the exploits of a &#34;special forces&#34; group of five, four men and one woman, (with the later addition of a woman FBI agent,) who work mostly undercover.  The group saves a lot of court time and prison expenses by, as often as not, fatally shooting the miscreants.  The FBI agent is played by the always gorgeous Tricia Helfer and the leader of the crew  by an always dependable Dylan McDermot.  The female member of the group, with the silicone-enhanced mouth, played by Nicki Aycox."

1,I have really gotten fond of all these Australian TV series !! Can't stop watching this one ! If you like teens ... you will like this series :-)
1,What these guys do is dangerous. I worked with baby gators and it take 80% bravery and 20% nuts to do what they do.I tip my hat to them. Great show
1,"Season 2 is essential viewing if you enjoyed season 1 or even if you came to the series late like I did and wanted to start from the beginning to fill in the character back stories.  However, there are some flaws that make it less impressive than the seasons 1, 3, 4, and 5:1. While season 2 has some great moments (particularly for Ben, John, Lydia, Sammy, and Nate), it is clear that the writers probably planned to spread the story arcs out over more episodes than 6.  Most of the arcs get resolved by the 6th episode, but the resolutions don't feel earned, particularly for Sal and Chickie.2. I don't like how Amazon Instant's digital version has all the curse words bleeped out.  I know this is how the show aired, but seasons 1 and 3 have all the curse words unbleeped, so why not the same treatment for season 2?  The bleeps are distracting. I'd rather have no curse words that all the bleeps.If you can put up with these minor flaws, stick through season 2, because seasons 3, 4, and 5 are excellent and will be enhanced by knowing the starting points for the characters."
1,"I just love the Poirot series  with David Suchet. It is so interesting. Even though I seen some of the series, I usually can't remember who did it until the very end. It is a real pleasure to watch this series and I highly recommend it to all Agatha Christie fans."
1,"Many things have already been said about J. J. Abrams' new ""Star Trek"" film and as far as critics go, most of them are positive ones including some raving reviews. Before watching the much anticipated film, I was skeptical. And I was wrong. The new feature film succeeds in not only rebooting the Paramount's hugely popular series, but becoming a great staring point for the new chapters that will be seen in the future. The ""odd-number"" theory is officially disproved.The film opens with thrilling and very emotional introductory sequences about James T. Kirk's father, who was ""captain of a starship for twelve minutes"" and saved 800 lives. Then we are introduced to young Kirk (Chris Pine) himself leading an aimless life until one day he speaks with a Starfleet captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) in a bar. Ambitious and rebellious, James T. Kirk impulsively joins the Academy. Three years later a Romulan spaceship attacks the Federation ships and he and the other crew of the Enterprise - Spock (Zachary Quinto), McCoy (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho), Chekhov (Anton Yelchin), and Scottie (Simon Pegg)The film can be enjoyed by the uninitiated and the fans (well, most of them, I think) alike, with spectacular visuals and those interesting and likable characters you can relate to. The script (by Abrams and co-screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman) gets sometimes complicated and even confusing (to allow for the inclusion of Leonard Nimoy, his first appearance on screen since 1991), but manages to keep us interested. I admit it is not very intelligent, but still entertaining.Lastly I add this. I belong to the generation watching ""The Next Generation"" and the re-runs of the original TV series. I am a fan of the series, maybe not a very big fan, but I know there are lots of gaps and plot holes regarding the new film's story, internally and in connection with the timeline of the original series. So the storyline and the details might bother you. I happen to like and enjoy the film partly because I kept in mind that this new film is set in another universe."

1,This show is a keeper. It has imagination productivity developement encouraged in each show. And is friendly to older viewers.I usually rate 5 stars _ but i personally do not like witchcraft of any type being introduced into a childs mind at any age. My granddaughter was not allowed to watch that episode
1,I love this season when I will the next season start I can't wait to see more of it keep it coming
0,Stopped 15 minutes into the movie.  This movie wasn't so bad as it was irratating. The quips from the Satellite of Love crew didn't make up for it.  There is a vast differance between a bad movie and a bad movie that is worthy of the MST treatment.
1,"I can't understand why this show was canceled. It had everything: adventure, action, tension on the front and tension at home, great cast. If you missed this on TV watch it here. Best show."
1,"Point one: this is a very good psychological thriller, full of clever plotting and well played intrigue.Point two: This is part of a huge lifetime opus of Sidney Lumet's work that I am only beginning to savor and enjoy. Am I lucky or what?And the main point: Why isn't Beau Bridges in every movie all the time.Yes you love his brother Jeff. We all love Jeff. But the secret is if the two decided to have a charisma-off, Beau would just stand there and smile and he would win, hands down.I could watch three hours of Brau Bridges chuckling and grinning and lounging around with Robert Preston as the affable Dobbs and feel like it was time well spent. I'm transported back to a more civilized era.And the add James Mason casting shadows and angst everywhere and you've got yourself a show.And if you ever want to see that magic in action, this movie should be the first place you go. Tha man does gymnastics for crying out loud, in slacks and a tie and without missing a beat!Please enjoy!"
1,The whole series was great. It showed how military teams work together and have each others back.  It also showed how the wives help and support  each other. I would recommend this series to anyone.
1,"Like everyone else, this show is the best! It's convoluted episodes keep your mind reeling, which is a good thing."
1,I love this show!  The writing and acting are fabulous.  I love being able to see Timothy Hutton every week.  Christian Kane is another great actor although I wish his character would cut his hair.  The other actors were new to me but they all had great chemistry.  Can't wait for Season Two to start!
1,"This quirky little show is a little to close to reality for me to appreciate the humor.  While everyone else in the room is roaring - I'm twitching with unease because I think I dated Sheldon.  Not the star but a real character who, in my reality, was actually named ""Sheldon""!  I thought brainiacs were sexy - NO -  they are just guys who's brains have outgrown their heads.  The funniest part in this show is the overt discomfort that is evident in these guys when they find themselves in everyday situations surrounded by dumb folk like you and me.  My favorite episode was when Sheldon got the flu and became the center of the universe (unto himself) and the great effort his friends went to in order to avoid him during his illness.  I think this was the show when I mixed up the TV Sheldon with my Sheldon, another whiney hypocondriac. Oh lord - I'm so confused.Bottom line - this is a funny funny show and well worth the price...bg"
0,no story line.  not enlightening about life within the &#34;family.&#34;  presenttion of women who probably as street as their husbands.
1,"This is a terrific series.  I would have loved to see more shows that took place during the war years with the same actors and actresses.  I am sure there were a lot of incredible things that occurred during the war that could have made a longer series.  I was captivated by each story and I have just about wore out the DVDs watching them over and over.  I was born in December, 1942 so I was alive during that time even though I didn't know what was going on in the world.  These stories have shown to me what war time was like and has made me a part of that history.  Thanks."
1,"This is fine background television.  The acting is abit amateurish and hokey at points; however some of the plot-lines and the historical and pseudo-historical background behind the stories/creatures/plots make these episodes lightly engaging.  It's entertaining but not something you would recommend as worth an evening of sit-down tv.  The literal plot-lines drive the show.  What would make this more memorable would be some inter-connectedness among the &#34;abnormals&#34; and what is abnormal in all of us.  This would be the perfect leaping point for some philosophical reflections about &#34;abnormality&#34; and an examination of social, cultural, political, and educational systems and an exploration of how they rely on artifical boundaries/barriers.  The show would do well, then, to reveal and demonstrate how these barriers can be exploited and undermined.  The show could be much more profound with some shoring up of plot, dialogue and subplot."
1,I enjoyed the first season a lot. The 4 main characters are very funny with their self centered ways. The second season they added Danny Devito  (Frank Reynolds) as the deranged father figure. Now most of the story lines revolve around him. Not as funny. Maybe it's better to just leave well enough alone.
1,I enjoye watching the antics of the artsie LA scene.  Can anyone really live that life of booze and drugs and survive?
1,"It's hard for me to rate this season. Overall it's great, as good as any of them. I do have one problem, which is the episode 'The Case Of The Missing Will'. They did a fine job on the episode, and it was quite entertaining, and yet if I could rate the episodes individually that one would only get one star. Why? For the simple reason that they threw Agatha Christie's story in the trash and wrote their own. The 'Missing Will' of the series has absolutely nothing to do with the original, nothing at all.Other than that I would gladly give this season five stars."
1,"12 Episodes on 3 Discs, being released September 14, 2010""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" debuted in 2005 and now its fifth season is coming to DVD. The series was created by Glenn Howerton, Rob McElhenney, and Charlie Day (who recently appeared in ""Going the Distance"") and the three hold writing and producing credits for it. They also star in it as Dennis, Mac, and Charlie along with Dee played by Kaitlin Olson and Dennis and Dee's father, Frank played by Danny DeVito. The premise is that the group owns and works at a bar called Paddy's Pub and this is a group of the dumbest, most ignorantly entertaining people you will ever watch. They don't seem to understand most social interaction rules and each of them thinks quite a bit of themselves and they are always fighting and out to get each other, therefore hilarity ensues.Episodes from this season include the gang going to the Grand Canyon, exploiting the mortgage crisis, Dee and Charlie getting fired, giving Frank an intervention, the Waitress getting married, the gang trying to go to the World Series, Mac and Dennis break up, the D.E.N.N.I.S. system for attracting and making women dependent upon him, the gang attempting to write a movie and be in a movie by M. Night Shyamalan, the gang reigniting a rivalry for Flipadelphia (a beer flip cup tournament), and my favorite episode - Kitten Mittens where Charlie invents a new product. Another episode that I really enjoyed was where the gang decided to put on a wrestling event for the troops and Mac, Dennis, and Charlie became a team called the ""Birds of Prey"" dressed up with feathers all over, but Frank steals the show as ""The Trash Man"" whose gimmick is eating garbage. Eww.This show is so wrong that no one should ever watch it, but we all do because it's  guilty pleasure seeing just how far these characters and the actors who play them will go.Bonus Features:There are about eight hilarious minutes of gag reel which just make me marvel that they are EVER able to film the show with the type of dialogue they riff out. There is a four minute original featurette that's a dating profile of D, the Waitress, Mac, and D's renaissance woman actress friend. It's pretty silly as D gets really drunk, the Waitress's gums bleed, etc. The Schwep dream sequence is a five minute video made up of almost 24,000 still images put together to show some behind the scenes action on the set and even reveal Fred Savage and a crew member wearing a ""What Would Kevin Arnold Do?"" T-shirt. It is all put to music with no dialogue.There is also a bunch of deleted and extended scenes from various episodes like the intervention episode and the commentary on select episodes is pretty funny about how scenes were filmed and how much Danny DeVito loves wearing Crocs. The best extra is probably ""Kitten Mittens"" on an endless loop (about five minutes)! It shows all these adorable kittens wearing the mittens going about their daily activities playing, eating, etc.This set is a must for anyone who enjoys this show with great extras and the episodes all have fantastic re-watch value. I'd even say they are funnier the second or third time you see them."
1,I love this show and I don't think that will ever change.  I hate all of the characters and I mean that in the best way.  Hilarious.
1,"A surprise for those of us not growing up in London. To know these episodes are based on real stories makes watching each episode almost unbelievable, but the interest is still there. Nurses had such a struggle working in a crowded hospital. Doctors, who made little to no salary, are a variety of good and indifferent. I hope there are many more seasons."
1,"I'd never heard of this show... now I can't wait to see the next episode.  I'm glad there are more seasons to watch, because I definitely will be watching.The show has lots of layers and is well done."
0,"This series just tries to be witty by playing on tired old stereotypes. Dull, no insight, puerile. There are so many better things to watch these days."
1,"What were they thinking by canceling this show??  We were addicted to it and the characters in it, especially those inside the Unit.  Fantastic acting, my two favorites were Max Martini and Michael Irby. There are so many mindless shows on TV and they go and cancel a solid one like this?  It makes no sense.  If CBS can do this, don't watch new series on their network anymore because who is to say they won't yank the rug out on those too just when you are getting into it.  The actors who made this show as awesome as it was and the audience deserved more.5 stars for this awesome show, below 0 stars for CBS."
1,"This program is interesting in that it purports to show standard police work by a metropolitan police force; in this case working on homicide cases.  It is rather matter of fact and really lacks excitement, but then that is probably much more accurate than when watching one of the many police related shows.  Ordinary police work is quite mundane and involves little of the excitement normally shown.  In summary, interesting, but far from gripping!"
1,Nothing good or bad to say about this series.  It is just an average show.  If you are in to real drama go somewhere else
1,"Season 2 of Gavin and Stacey another step of this great situation comedy.  Not since the best addictive television comedies like Seinfeld and Cheers before it, has there been such a show worthy of a dedicated following--and sadly America doesn't even know about it. I just happened upon Gavin and Stacey and after a couple shows, I watched all 3 seasons of it in 3 days. The best aspect of this show is that there are truly talented actors who wholly inhabit their characters.  The most annoying, off-putting, characteristic of any show for me, particularly a comedy, is when an actor is constantly aware of what he's doing--the audience is watching him act.  His/her, ego is on full display completely thrilled at this opportunity to strut his stuff in a show.  That doesn't happen in Gavin and Stacey.  Some of these characters are over the top, and you believe them, even love them for their idiosyncrasies.  Gavin and Stacey are two very nice people, who you might know.  They are genuine and sweet and innocently funny.  But the characters that surround them--their families and friends--are straight-up crazy, funny, flawed, sweet, loving, honest people--just like your aunts, uncles and friends.  Pam, Gavin's mom, so mom-ish--loving her prince of a son, sexy with her husband, sometimes trying to be who she isn't, giving and selfish, fussy and warm--is simply funny.  Smithy, Gavin's best friend, is somewhat rotund, cutting back on his eating with a 6-pack of chicken, corn on the cob and other sides, at the end of a night of partying; always greets Gavin with a shared hip-hop song and choreography--with Gav's mom and dad joining in when they're around--quite capably, I might add; rolling on the floor in a tussle with his younger sister--another hip-hop master; and, an all-round hysterically funny good guy!  Brin, Stacey's uncle, is embodied by Rob Brydon, from The Trip...OMG, I adore him... Brin lingers just a minute too long when he hugs Gav, and he is harboring some secret experience...that happened on a fishing trip with his nephew, Stacey's brother...it was very cold on that trip... And, last but certainly not least, Nessa, Stacey's best friend.  Nessa is a hearty (like Smithy) Welsh lady, who is completely blunt in her honest, slightly stilted, take on the world.  She can assist her bouncer friends at the local night club, and go head-to-head with Smithy on a KFC mega meal, where a butter-dripping ear of corn becomes an unexpected bit of foreplay.  The only thing that an American audience might take a bit of getting used to are the British and Welsh accents...but please, give it a minute...the Welsh accents become another great joke.  This only negative about this comedy is that there are not 5 more seasons to hang out with these people.  This is a great, funny and very warm ensemble show."
1,I never heard of this  show till i was going throw kids shows on xbox 360 with the amazon app and now me and boys watch it all the time.
1,"Both my seven year old [who is a 'young' seven] and my two year old watch together and laugh together. Only problem with the show is that the song is an ear worm, and you'll end up with it in your head for quite some time. It's got lots of good lessons, and the kids on the show set a good example without being ridiculous...Overall, a nice show to have the kids watch now and then. Makes them smile!"
1,I enjoy experiencing fictional life with a hero who abides by his personal and professional compass and does what is right and is confident that doing right is the only way.
1,"After a  fantastic season one and a still great but less  good season two, Mad  Men really delivers here during Season Three. While everybody writes it it must be repeated, the writing acting and direction is superb. While Season Two was at times m ore dark and sinister, Season Two despite being somewhat less weird has not lost its touch. We get to follow the partners of a very successful Madison Avenue advertising agency during the eraly 60's and we see the impact of the Kennedy assasination on these career-oriented people. While it is constructed in a very slow-moving way, one is surprised when the season agains ends on cliff hanger episode."
1,"I give this a 5 star rating, mainly because of the discussions of the stunt work involved in the film itself, this being only the featurette. I was impressed with the fact that Angelina does most of her own stunt work (they actually imply that she does it all, but I am not sure if that is the case), and with the demonstrations of just how it is done. Interviews with Angie and the stunt directors/coordinators on this are very informative. A little more about the plot aside from the stunt work might have been good, but sometimes there is a fine line there between teasing and completely giving the story away, which the producers cannot afford to cross also. I's say probably watch the movie first, then this featurette, to appreciate some of the movie."
1,Well if my two year old had a say she would give it ten stars. I think the show has gotten better since it's introduction. I don't mind her watching it at all and the fact that she surprised me by counting to 5 in Spanish says a lot.
1,"This season is not as good as other seasons, but it's still alright. One of my favorite episodes is when it's HALLOWEEN and Satan is throwing a big Sweet Sixteen party and acts like a spoiled rich teenager. Also Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny deal with the death of their friend Chef, stop Manbearpig, try to get a Family Guy episode pulled, defeat a nerdy gamer on World of Warcraft, and stop Ike from having sexual relations with his smokin' hot teacher. (Nice!) All this and more happen in SOUTH PARK: THE COMPLETE 10TH SEASON!!!"
1,"It took a bit to become an enjoyable program.  The characters needed to develop a bit more substance, the writes seem to want to dangle their issues and nuance their personalities for too long a time."
1,"An opportunity for mere mortal to check out the goings on in sunny California, in particular the  home to the rich-not so rich, the famous and not so famous and their life styles."
1,Great series. Police work with some twists and a lot of humor. I have really enjoyed this season and am looking forward to more.
1,"24 Episodes on 3 DiscsIn Season 4 of ""How I Met Your Mother,"" Ted played by Josh Radnor continues an inadvisable relationship with Stella played by Sarah Chalke. We all know she isn't the mother because the show is already in its sixth season by now without her! Just like with Robin before her, the audience is playing the waiting game for it to end. Ted faces a difficult year between problems with Stella, unemployment, Marshall and Lily moving into their own place, and as always confusing signals between himself and Robin.Marshall played by Jason Segel and Lily played by Alyson Hannigan begin to move on and become full adults and have issues with their new apartment and contemplate parenthood for the first time. Robin played by Cobie Smulders has difficulties with losing her job, almost getting deported, and exploring a friends with benefits relationship. Barney played by Neil Patrick Harris continues to be AWESOME but after realizing the extent of his feelings for Robin at the end of Season 3, he spends this entire season pining away for her and manipulate her relationships while staying quiet about his intentions. While it is fun to see Barney reveal a soft spot, the audience doesn't enjoy seeing him so vulnerable that it effects his game with the other ladies.Bonus Features:The most disappointing part of the bonus features on this one is that this season has the least amount of episodes with commentary (four) and three of them are with show creators and/or writers and only one episode, ""The Naked Man"" has actor commentary...and it is with Josh Radnor who you all know by now plays my least favorite character. However, it did confirm that Alyson Hannigan and Cobie Smulders were pregnant during the season which I totally suspected since they kept wearing REALLY loose clothing and holding things like popcorn buckets in front of their stomachs.Other features include the ""Barney Stinson: That Guy's Awesome"" music video with all the power words falling from the sky and exploding, but does not include Barney interviewing himself with a British accent. There is also a Season 3 recap, another gag reel of silly moments, and lastly, there is an Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Panel discussion called ""A Night With Your Mother"" featuring the show creators and main cast members that is less than 20 minutes. They discuss how Barney and Robin's relationship came about as an emergency tactic after the writer's strike. There is also a hilarious highlight where Neil Patrick Harris leaves to go to the bathroom with is microphone still on and everyone is laughing to the point of tears."
1,I would have given it an excellent rating if not for the fact that the show was obviously cut short. To bad I did enjoy it.
1,"The show is more interesting than I thought it would be after the first two episodes. It is definitely worth following. There is a lot to be desired regarding plot, storyline, and character development. However, all in all, an okay and entertaining take regarding some old ground. I have not watched the Bitish version."
1,"As a fan of the original Bionic Woman, I am appalled by the liberties taken by the writers in this show. First of all, they have completely altered the story of Jamie Summers, the original Bionic Woman. The story presented in the series is COMPLETELY different. I don't undertand why they didn't just change her name.Second, the acting of Michelle Ryan is not the best. Still, I do think she is doing the best she can with what she has been given. But, she displays no emotion, barely any tears when crying. Her face looked completely emotionless when her fiance died or when she was at his funeral. The show just doesn't deal with her emotions. They have concentrated so much in the action and the lines that they have forgotten an important part of television, facial expressions and body language. The younger sister seems to be the only one displaying an emotional range in the show.The show is not that cohesive. They do not explain certain things. Why was the sister sentenced(?) or prohibited from using computers? The show just doesn't tie in things together.The show has a very nice visual style (hence my rating of 3 stars) and I think it has some potential, but a lot of things have to be fixed. These facilities, very low budget by the way, where she trains have really bad security and look like a basement. They should vamp up these settings and make them more hi-tech. The plotlines and the writing should deal more with how Jamie feels about all of this. She took everything so matter of fact (except for the initial screaming after her operation). Someone needs to wake her up and say ""Woman, you are Bionic! React! I would also like to know how she knows all these fighting techniques. Was some computer implanted into her head? I mean, she did not train for that long!In conclusion, the show has a lot of things that need fixing. And the first thing should be for Michelle Ryan to start showing some emotion and act better."
1,"Many people have compared this offshoot of the Stargate franchise as a Battlestar Galactica wannabe. Since I've never seen the newest BSG series, I can't compare it myself. So, I'll just say that I loved this newest SG installment and wish that it hadn't been cancelled after Season 2. However, even though it was cancelled, it was just so much fun. Now, the stars are off doing other series. However, if I ever win the Lotto, I will personally fund a TV movie or another season of this show. I miss the characters and would like to see them again."
1,"The plot, characters, and overall production are well done.  Having the main characters being outlaws with some moral code is always an interesting prospective but it works for this season.  Definitely worth watching."
1,"I can't say enough about 24, I LOVE each and every Season and Episode.  If you like action, you will be at the edge of your seat with this Season.  We are VERY hooked and stream from one to the next episode."
1,"I was very glad to see they made the second season and I most definitely hope for a third (same as with Shark series). Damien Lewis is so good that I started buying anything with him in it, just on the basis of the first Life season. Intelligent, funny and well plotted, far from sentimental with a hero who has more inner conflict than the current Batman but turns the opposing forces to his advantage - more of an Aikido disciple than Zen. Or both, probably.There are not that many really intelligent and funny series around (and especially surviving the ratings from your general public) so if you like your shows with lots of action but smart, with really twisted thinking and really good acting thrown in for a huge bonus, do not miss that one."
1,"It was like a film noir spy thriller.  Loyalty, betrayal, seduction.  I wish there was a second season.  It was never clear to me what happened in the scene near the end where the lady gets killed."
1,"This is my kind of movie - dry, sardonic, subtle and funny as can be.  The premise is that a live audience watches a horror movie about a tire rolling around killing people, but that barely scratches the surface of this surprising and wonderful film.  Not for everybody, but if you like something different, this film offers pleasures."
1,"I completely enjoyed Season 1.  Mainly, because Miami is my hometown and I was so familiar with all the areas they filmed the show in.  I gave it 4 stars because the stories got somewhat predictable towards the end of the season.  But, I enjoyed the romantic connection between Jim and Callie."
1,"Enjoyed watching these obese people make the necessary changes in their lives. It was amazing to see not only the physical changes, but the way their whole attitude changed toward life. The sparkle in their eyes and their determination gives me no doubt that they will succeed. Wonderful weight loss experience done right! Looking forward for Season 2 to be available on Prime."
1,"seems kinda on par with 30 Rock at the moment, which isn't great...Mark is an incredibly weak character.  Hoping they phase him out...he's a huge thorn in the side of the ensemble cast atm.As for a review - the show revolves around a backwater Indiana town, Pawnee, and its local government.  Amy Poehler is surprisingly decent in this - her and Tina Fey both given me quite a negative impression over the years, and I can honestly say this is Amy's best work to date.  Despite a veneer of average ""safe"" sitcom, I can see the story getting quite interesting.  Special kudos to Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) and Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari) for playing incredible characters.  And as always, Rashida Jones is just gorgeous.  Please make 10 more of her.  I'll positively review all of them :)  She's not too shabby of an actress either.Overall, it's free, it's only a couple episodes, and there are many worse ways to spend a few hours.  Just ignore Mark.  Mark sucks."
1,I'm an original 80s guy and grew up with the old. Now with children my daughter and I watch this together.  It's not the movie. The show is very well written and the characters can grow.  The FX are very well done.  Tastefully not grotesque.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes the supernatural story lines.
1,"My son is 10.  He has gotten the whole family watching this series - it's pretty awesome.  Great world-building, characters, buy-in.  I'm a big fan myself, now.  Recommend for all ages."
1,Great cast.  Surprisingly substantive and high production quality.  Showtime always felt like HBO-Lite to me and this series is a direct competitor to Game of Thrones without the dragons.
1,My kids love to interact with Dora. Both my one year old and 3 year old learn with this show.
1,"The writing, characters, acting and direction on both Seasons 1 and 2 of ""Justified"" are top shelf. Not only does Mr. Olyphant nail his character but the excellent supporting actors comprise a truly impressive ensemble.  While the plots can be convoluted and somewhat melodramatic and predictable, it's so much fun watching and listening to these folks interact and play off each other that you hardly notice.  With the right mix of drama, action, rednecks and highly intelligent and strong women ""Justified"" pretty much punches its own ticket.I was originally quite wary of the accents and setting, wrongly thinking it a cross between My Name is Earl and Miami Vice, but it's carved a truly original niche of its own.  Impressive and eminently watchable. Margo Martindale in Season 2 is pretty frightening and one of the sleaziest female characters in the history of TV.  Controlled magnificence."
1,"I saw this show on amazon prime instant video list, checked it out and immediately got involved in the entire 4 seasons!!  Did some binge watching, to be honest...I really enjoyed this series, it was amusing in spots--esp. Hiro and Ando and their escapades!  Season 4 had potential but apparently the writers knew the ax was eminent and while there were good episodes, just wasn't up to par with the first 3 seasons--but I know you will want to watch it once you see the other shows!  It's good entertainment, for sure!"
1,"Excellent cast, stories well written, can't understand why it wasn't renewed for another season.  They left us with a few cliff hangers!"
1,"""The Office"" is one of the most brilliant comedy series on TV. Steve Carell is inimitable as Michael Scott; Rainn Wilson is hilarious as the self-centered Dwight. The entire ensemble cast is strong. The whole cast WORKS TOGETHER... in more ways than one.In the fifth season, the new boss Charles (Idris Elba, before he hit it big inObsessed).... so Michael Scott goes off on his own to form the Michael Scott Paper Company. There are hilarious shenanigans involving a bus from a Korean church, square-shaped pancakes, going to a senior investment club. There's the growing romance between Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) Dwight is constantly plotting... to the point of suggesting bees. At the company picnic, Michael hooks up with his ex Holly and they do a cheesy skit about the history of their company based onSlumdog Millionaire.""The Office"" is worth the work!"
1,"loved the first season very, very much, especially Sam.  lots of excitement and intrigue.  this was the very best season"
1,"Having watched all five seasons my wife and I were sad that it was discontinued, but glad it was offered to American audiences.The characters are very engaging and the story line is interesting.It was interesting to watch the characters grow as the show progressed.We wish that it had been continued, but everyone has to move on at times..."
1,"Little Britain can be insanely funny though a few of the recurring characters get revisited a tad too often for me.  I tend to watch series online or by DVD so I get them in clumps which is a great way to watch serial shows but can make skit shows less funny over a marathon.  When you first watch you may find the narrator's voice to be familiar, Tom Baker does voice over work here in the US and he was one of the The Doctors.  The leads/writers are brilliant and if you watch the DVD then view the extras, Lucas in particular is an interesting person.  Walliams swam the Channel for charity."
1,Love this show and the enthusiasm the guys show. We have been all over the country antiquing and enjoy this program.
1,Wish they would have more shows like this. Networks have moved away from si-Fi for some reason. Nothing on network TV worth watching.
1,Mike Row is funny and self deprecating.  What he puts himself through for an acting gig is completely disgusting and funny at the same time.
1,"Well written, extremely well acted peek into the past.  So disappointed to discover that there are only two seasons of this marvelous series.  More!"
1,"Good writing, good acting, quirky plots. It is campy enough that the absurdity of the story line is hilarious. What's not to like?"
1,I agree with Jeeves! I hope Amazon gets permission to offer the rest of the series (12 in total) now that 'Endeavor' has become the prequel to Morse. Both are absolutely the best!
1,This is an enjoyable series. I love seeing a young female having such strength. There was a time in the recent past that such ability in a woman was seldom if ever in Media.
1,"LIFE the tv series was only on two seasons, 2007-2009.  I missed it then and am soh so glad I found it now.  Just finished season one and will order season two.  So very well done.  Rand Ravich gets my kudos for a job well done.  LIFE is a cop show, centering on Det. Charlie Crews.  who is just released from a twelve year prison term, as new evidence clears him  His settlement, great wealth and be a cop again.  We follow week to week stories and Charlies quest to find out who set him up.  Very good supporting cast with Sarah Shabi as his partner and Adam Arkin, as friend and financial advisor, oh, a fellow con.  Try this series.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
1,"Don't get me wrong, its an entertaining show, and at 20 bucks, you should definitely grab it.  To compare it to shows like Six Feet Under is absolutely ridiculous though.  The idea of Dexter being a sociopath is not exploited to its full potential, IMO.  Too much of the time he blends in so much you forget all about it, then you have to be reminded by forced voice overs and flashbacks.  This is a good DVD set though, I see lots of folks complaining about the transfer.  What can I say, don't spend 50 zillion bucks on your TV/Home theatre and you won't be so disappointed.  For 20 bones you get 12 doses of Dexter, AND two episodes of Brotherhood, and one of The Tudors if you have the time to screw around with the PC feature.  Not bad considering that people were lining up out the door to fork over 100 bucks for The Sopranos not too long ago."
1,"I'm a fan of discovery ID and love their shows. This show Stolen Voices Buried Secrets is a good show, it's another real life show detailing information from crimes committed  from the victims who are dead. It's being told from the dead victims  point of view. It's a new show that perimered in January 2011 and the episodes that I have seen so far are interesting. Would recommend."
1,Makes you glad that you were not a patient!!!Otherwise probably true to the period ! Watch if you like the period
1,"Great story line, like a book unfolding as it went on. Then the killing completely shocked me, it was one of those tv shows I would watch again it does not happen often."
0,"To be honest the show is not half bad, I only watch because it's free with my prime and it is not like I am not doing something also just to catch up with episodes. I started watching on a very early Sunday morning when the house still quiet and since I am a sucker for cop and medical shows I gave it a shot. The acting is ok, the story lines are ok and the cast is also ok. Nothing to write home about but entertaining for a free, no suspence, easy going cop show and the main charachter is good to look at. :)"
1,"I don't want to give too many spoilers but this was a really interesting little series, two totally distinct personalities in the same body and they discover and then communicate with each other by leaving video messages........One of the personalities is a meek, mild Mr.Nice Guy and the other is a ""rockem sockem"" secret agent who would make James Bond blush.........the fun really starts when the ""secret agent"" personality spends the night with the ""Nice Guy"" personality's wife............it's too bad that they didn't continue the series."
1,"unlike anything else you've ever seen anywhere.ahead of it's time.funny and deep at the same time.season 1 was short because of the WGA strike and the show never found it's audience.  for a show this different, one and a half seasons wasn't enough."
1,"It may be that the first season was a new thing or that it was actually filled with more interesting content.  The second season is enjoyable - it's Morgan Freeman - but the content just isn't as exciting as the first season for whatever reason.  I would still watch and recommend it, though."
1,"Breaking Bad TV series is an outstanding piece of work from the cast and crew. Kudos to the director for making this one of the very best TV series that I have ever watched in my life. I rarely praise any TV drama but honestly this TV series is one of the most addicting series ever. The work is technically perfect! Everything is well done from acting to sound effects to storytelling. There is something for everyone in the household to watch and enjoy.Warning! After watching this series, you will find most other popular TV series dull and boring! I am confident that within less than 10 mins into the season 1 episode 1 show you will get addicted and cannot stop watching the series.Excellent! 5 Stars!"
1,"The legend of the &#34;missing&#34; ninth Roman legion has been explored many times, most recently in &#34;The Eagle,&#34; but this film follows the traditional view the legion was ambushed in a heavily wooded area by the Picts, and the Roman government kept it quiet to encourage the myth the legions were invincible. This film even offers a prototype to the legendary Pict female leader, Bodica, It is beautifully filmed and very well acted. I recommend it."
1,"It's what we civilized folks have always feared: a hobo with a shotgun. A hobo with a shopping cart or a hobo with a ""Will work for..."" whatever sign, we can deal with. But a hobo with a shotgun, you have to take him seriously, maybe even flip him more than just a quarter. HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN is hands down one of the best movie titles ever, right up there with, off the top of my head, SNAKES ON A PLANE, ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES, THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS, OCTOPUSSY (*tee-hee*), and SSSSSSS.Some background stuff: HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN, the motion picture, is based on the winning fake trailer of the same name that was submitted for an international movie trailer contest to promote Robert Rodriquez and Quentin Tarantino's then upcoming double feature GRINDHOUSE release. This is the second in GRINDHOUSE's batch of fake trailers to be turned into a feature film. The first, of course, is MACHETE. Is this the resurgence of the exploitation film? Dunno. But HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN, like MACHETE, is a bald-faced, unrepentant, gory homage to those cheap grindhouse thrillers that graced those dank movie theaters back in the '70s. Watching this, I half expected Pam Grier to put in a cameo.By the way, the original fake trailer for HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN can be seen in the DVD's bonus featurette focusing on David Brunt.The plot is bare bones. Rutger Hauer, now in his mid-60s and seriously weathered-looking, plays a vagabond who rode in on the rail and into Hope City, a lawless town and ironically-named. Hope City is run with sadistic zeal by a local gang lord named the Drake and his two hoodlum sons. If the grizzled hobo had his druthers, he'd purchase that secondhand lawnmower in the pawn shop and be content with clipping people's back yards. But every day he's haunted by the rampant thuggery taking place before his eyes. The hobo, who isn't exactly in his right mind nowadays, visits the pawnshop and eschews the lawnmower for the 12-gauge shotgun hanging over it. So cue that one newspaper headline screaming: ""Hobo stops begging, demands change!""Oh, gorehounds, you'll eat up this vicious indie B-flick. For starters, you may dig the spaghetti western score which opens the film. It fits you in the proper frame of mind. The rampaging hobo, once unleashed, takes no prisoners. There's a gleefulness in how the film trots out its Rated R stuff; it wallows in the gore and the blood and the sheer visceral nature of the violence. Not to mention, HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN unloads a panoply of awful but ridiculously quotable quotes. I've got three favorites: One goon threatens his victim: ""I'm gonna wash away my blood... with your blood!"" He also boasts, ""They are going to make comics out of my hate crimes."" And the big bad himself, the Drake, indulges in a bit of philosophy: ""When life gives you razor blades, you make a baseball bat... with razor blades.""Rutger Hauer is just having fun with this role. I can't picture him as having approached his director to ask for his character's motivation. HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN is a bloody, profane, over-the-top romp. It doesn't pretend to be anything more than what it is. It doesn't try to be clever. It just has the hobo blasting people to crimson, splattery bits and occasionally delivering some batty, melodramatic comment. Surprisingly, it's the gutsy token chick (Molly Dunsworth), and not the hobo, who has the inspirational speech moment. Facing down a mob, she talks about cleaning up the city and she growls, ""Sometimes, on the streets, a broom just ain't gonna f-----' cut it. That's when you gotta get a shotgun!"" Hoo-ah! I will say that late in the film Molly Dunsworth is showcased in several jaw-droppingly gristly moments. Except that GUTSY TOKEN CHICK WITH A SHOTGUN doesn't quite provoke that same reaction. Or am I wrong? Rumor has it that there's a clip floating around that was cut from the film which had the girl later joining the armored Plague demons. I wouldn't mind a spinoff film about that.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Audio Commentary with director Jason Eisener and Rutger Hauer- Audio Commentary with Jason Eisener, writer John Davies, producer Rob Cotterill, and David Brunt- 44 behind-the-scenes featurettes which include table reads and on-site interviews, although my favorite segments have to do with the feature on David Brunt (the first-time actor who played the hobo in the original GRINDHOUSE fake trailer) and those in which the f/x crew experiments with different things - including egg shells filled with red liquid - to simulate splattered viscera and blood (totaling 01:46:20 minutes)"
1,This team are led by the two Kling brothers who are entertaining while still using science based theories for the paranormal.Excellent viewing for anyone interested in ghost investigations. Some thinking outside the box and interesting locations.
1,I like Sam Witwer (Aidan) but Aidan Turner (Mitchell) plays the tortured vampire much better in the U.K. version (original) of Being Human. Sam Huntington (Josh) isn't the whiny werewolf that Russell Tovey (George) is and I much prefer Russell's version as it makes him more interesting. Meaghan Rath (Sally) just isn't the bubbly ghost that Lenora Crichlow (Annie) is and Lenora's version is just adorable.I'm not sure if I'll continue to watch this series past the free episode but I bought both seasons of the U.K. version as the British actors give so much more depth to the characters making the series a must watch.
1,"This is a series that was cancelled before its time.Two great years of episodes.The series had a great cast of actors, stories, special effects, and music.It is different from the other SG series which I enjoyed too; however, SG:U is my favorite one of the SG series.Watch and enjoy!"
1,Damien Lewis is great in this role!  We really looked forward to watching each episode.  Would highly recommend this series.
1,"This is a show I go back to over and over again, because the acting is superb, the storylines funny and engaging and I fell in love with the characters from the first episode.  If you enjoy witty, intelligent writing, along with great acting and you like to laugh, give this a go."
1,Like this show on Tv and like to see the episodes that I have missed. Will watch more later. I like the end where the boss is exposed.
1,"fun exciting to watch lots of fun with the family to watch what they pull out next. there is drama, action, comedy and a little bit of everthing"
1,"I found the show to be pretty fantastic, however it took me a little to get into the flow of it. Alot is going on at a very quick pace and sometimes it's hard to follow. In the end however the overall season is fantastic."
1,Good clean entertainment but a little on the weird side sometimes. But our kids seem to like it so it stays!
1,"look...im not dumb. completely went into this movie about a revenge seeking tire with absolutely no expectations...i was absolutely blown away about how awesome it was!!!the tire....umm....emotes more emotion than jennifer love hewitt could ever possibly try...some of the scenes in this movie are so trippy, smart, and ridiculous that the viewer is just dumbfounded by how awesome it is...quite violent, actually sad, and a glorious story to boot...recommended, absolutely.i want part 2!!!!"
1,"If you've only read James Ellroy's crime novels, you've been missing out on the eccentric persona behind the pages. Perhaps a little Ellroy will go a long way--he's a bit of a love it or hate it proposition. Having been a successful writer for thirty years, he has a fascination with the dark side and his obsession invariably led to ""L. A.: City of Demons""--an original documentary series for the Investigation Discovery network (admit it, you spend hours perusing ID). Ellroy has an inherent fascination with the underbelly of Los Angeles which began with the brutal slaying of his mother and is showcased in some of his most noteworthy books (Black Dahlia, L. A. Confidential). With his larger-than-life personality in full affect and his offbeat verbal stylings in unique form, Ellroy actually kicks off this six episode production with a feature that includes his mother's murder.His potboiler style, nihilism, and noir conventions actually align fairly well with the stories he wishes to share in this series. This probably won't be used as promotional material by the Los Angeles Department of Tourism any time soon.(1) Dead Women Own Me: Ellroy explores cases that have had a real impact on his life and psyche including the aforementioned Black Dahlia and his mother's case.(2) The Scandal Rags: Explores the pulp publications that made notoriety with high profile stories such as the Lana Turner scandal.(3) L. A. Serial Killers: Seems self-explanatory.(4) Dames and Delinquents: Exposes notorious cases that involve organized crime including the murder of a famed mob princess.(5) The Dark Side of Hollywood: A look at celebrity culture.(6) Hot Spot Homicide: A profile on notorious bars, clubs and prohibition era speakeasies.My three star recommendation is an overly cautious warning to viewers that are new to the James Ellroy experience. I could spend hours, personally, with this oddball character. The beauty of Ellroy is that he's his own biggest fan, an unapologetic egotist who fervently believes he is the world's greatest living crime novelist. He may well be--but his unabashed self-idolatry and aggrandizement may be off-putting to those who aren't used to it. In addition to Ellroy, the series really ups the odd quotient with the participation of an animated bull terrier named Barko. Did I just throw you off? Trust me, it is as weird as it sounds. Most of the series and the exchanges with Barko, in particular, seem to exist solely in Ellroy's head. By placing himself front and center (he doesn't share screen time with other real people), Ellroy puts the primary focus on himself. And while I love it, it also pushes the actual show content to a position of less importance. Therefore, I think fans will love it--but I'm not sure if it will be winning new devotees to the cult of Ellroy's greatness. Hence, my neutral rating is largely for the uninitiated. KGHarris, 7/11."
1,Can someone please tell me how long the extended version is? How any hours and minute? I want to make sure it's the full version which I've heard is better.  Thanks!
1,"An exact copy of a British series.  And I quit watching the original British series because it was just boring.  This version is pretty good.  Vampires, werewolves, and ghost (nice touch).  Good stories overall.  Worth watching to at least see if you like it.  The stories though, later on, get a bit boring.....  Try it out."
1,"Okay, like the title says. The Grand Children love the Movie. I have to admit, I loved it to. Get it for the entire family and I bet you'll like it to."
1,"(do not read if you have not watched the first part - last episode)Now we know that the Doctor has something big coming up. A bullet - or a beam - from something, and the things in the shadows to boot. You cannot recall them and yet one was there, and it told Amy Pond she would reveal them. Then there was the odd place that River and Rory went, underneath the secret streets. as The Doctor says, this is not fighting an invasion because it was already here. it is creating a revolution. With Richard Nixon and his sidekick in tow, it seems that things have gone bad and the others are being hunted while the Doctor has a bad time. you know the doctor, however, and how good he is.This episode wraps up a first piece and explains what the enemy well be. I do not want to say so I will omit it, but I did not expect the name. I also did not expect the man and his love and Nixon and the kid, and I did not expect Amy and the revelation she had. I think she has something big coming and people have yet to notice.The acting is great here. Matt Smith has settled into the doctor and has his guy down pat. It makes me laugh, he has such an energetic humor, and I like that. I also liked the dark here and I thought they had plenty of it. The not seeing and not knowing, the marks on the arms; it added in and made a horror.The VOD is great here, too, and added together it well gets its 5/5. Thank you."
1,"I liked season two of this show.It's still a cute,sexy,funny romantic comedy.Yes,it's a bit raw,by American standards,but it's not an American show.The two lovebirds still have their problems  adjusting to marriage and their friends and family are still ridiculous.Stacey needs to grow up from a selfish girl to a grown woman.Maybe season three will see to that."
0,"I truly enjoyed the Cheech and Chong movies but, find most that try to use marijuana as the focus fall extremely short of the target. This series does just that, fell short at the starting line..."
1,"Fast, facile jokes in a similar style to 30 Rock or Arrested Development make this caricature of Monsanto (a nefarious R&D heavy company that makes both GMO food and pesticides) a lot of fun.  In contrast to Arrested Development, however, the characters are not very well developed, and so I'm watching it with far less empathy than those in AD.  The lack of social empathy is more like 30 rock where only a few characters are singled out for elaboration but they are so over-caricatured and ancillary that they are unrelatable as humans: in Ted this is the zany scientists and cold ceo and in 30 rock Jenna, Tracy, the paige and the writing staff."
1,Haven't figured out where it is going. Hope I find more. Ends with the idea that disaster is looming. What?
1,"This series was fairly good sometimes. I dropped it a star because of the volume explosions between scenes. A scene would end, and then the series theme music would blow your ears out. Yes, my TVs are able to equalize the volume. But I never want to use that setting because sound is vital to most films, and most all sound engineers know what they are doing."
1,"Let's be honest here- Matt Smith's Doctor has encountered just about everything he could find.  He's seen trees that can fly through the space time vortex, carnivorous snowmen, sharks that swim in the air, and much more.  The DW Christmas specials have become a tradition in our household since I first entered the fandom.  Every single one is special in their own way...I guess that's why they're called Christmas specials, not Christmas episodes.  I would encourage you all the watch each one- a lot of times, things that happen in Christmas specials become relevant in episodes to come, even though they're not part of any particular season.  Besides, they're good fun!"
0,I enjoy watching shows with real evidence proof like forensic files. This show is created poorly with subject matter had to believe. Was deceived by the title.
1,Really like this show. It as the same kind of draw you in feel as other shows like the original CSI. You kinda get to know the characters and grow with them.
1,"Curious George is a family-friendly show with great tools for any budding scientist, analyst, or news journalist. What do I mean?Each episode, for example, focuses on George going through a scientific-method-like process to figure out solutions to everyday problems. George's inquisitive nature helps him form hypotheses and experiment to test each hypothesis.George lives with a man with a yellow hat (that's his brand). His character's ok, but GEORGE steals the show. Kids will love the bright colors and uptempo pace of the show. The show has a narrator (who sounds a lot like the man in the yellow hat) who helps guide the viewer through George's actions and thoughts.You can't go wrong with this show."
0,"soap opera... like anyone needs that?  I didnt care for soaps when my sister was glued to them and I had to watch. I dont care what you put the people in, a leather jacket and motorcycles even cant make that cool. Katy is always awesome though so she save me from giving it a one star!"
1,"Not horrible just another take on the Cloverfield style of movie-making which, in turn, borrowed from Blair Witch. Nothing new but nice if you like the genre."
1,A must see for fans of the weird.  The supernatural is explained in alternate ways.  Is the best show I have seen in months.
1,"I think the first season was better. The crimes/mysteries were more common place in that you see people lie all the time for the crimes depicted in season 1.  In season 2, the storyline gets more grittier, more dangerous for Dr. Lightman and his team as they confront liars who will do anything to cover up their lies. There's a hint of unrealism in season 2, only because civilians like LIghtman and his team hardly ever get called to go confront people in dangerous places such as Afghanistan or the site of a collapsed mine shaft where anything could blow up at any second. Psychologists like him and his team still realistically work under controlled conditions, either in their office or through videos and one-on-one interviews. Otherwise, though, season 2 is still exciting."
1,"My husband is a huge fan of this show, and was glad the 'Raw and Uncensored' version was available for a good price. Thanks!"
1,"this show was cancelled by NBC, and should  have been sold to SciFI channel.  Original networks not any good anymore, and often cancel a show to quickly"
0,"I started off liking the show, but it soon lost my interest.  I found much of it to be rather maudlin.  The series is just not very well written."
1,I thought it was the movie. Grandkids were not particularly interested in how the movie was made. They are - twins 5 boy and girl. Plus 3 year old girl.
1,"didn't care for it as much as the first 4...seem to be a lot more draggy, like they ran out of ideas..overall it was ok"
1,Awsome movie and the soundtrack is the best to test any new speaker or subwoofer for its good base effects definitely recomend.
1,"This is a remarkable show about a family and their families, they touch on everything in life, love pain everything."
1,"This unassuming little show about a small Texas town and it's football team was a great ride, all the way through to the final season.  The show features well-rounded characters with realistic problems and believable flaws.  And, that's refreshing, compared to some of today's reality shows (where the filthy rich drum up pseudo-problems to complain about).Maybe the fictional town of Dillon, Texas reminded me nostalgically of my own hometown, where the whole town populace came out on Friday nights to cheer on the football team of the only high school in town.  Or maybe the fictional characters just remind me of my own classmates, teachers, and coaches.  But, whatever the reason, this is one great show, well-acted and under-recognized."
1,Mr. James Elroy's voice is rather monotonous.Very repetitive in speaking about the murder cases in most scenarios.Good locations
1,I just found this series and am enjoying it very much.  You have to like the British mysteries to enjoy this.
1,I love Doctor Who and I think the quality overall is wonderful but every so often an episode is so much more. I feel that way about Blink and this Christmas Carol episode as well.  It's like Groundhog day meets It's a wonderful life.There is a cookie cutter formula applied to Christmas episodes for many tv shows and especially when it comes to using the Dickens story as a template or reference point. Well this episode of Doctor Who does not follow the usual path. It is unique and that is a triumph on it's own. I think Charles Dickens would have liked this one very much. It's definitely in my top 5.2010 staring Harry Potter's Michael Gambon. HD on Amazon. Looks great.The story itself is witty and it's worth the effort just for that alone but there is also a special effect science fiction element of these fish and sharks that can swim in the atmosphere.
1,"Would love to have seen it if they hadn't put so much emphasis on the women's sex appeal and the romance for prime time audiences. Didn't even know about it when it aired, and if more of us had, it might have made it to Season 2, judging by ratings here. That's a failing on the network's and marketers' parts, not the writers, actors or producers. A loss for all, though."
1,"This series is a classic. It can't be duplicated. No matter what Kristen Bell does, she will never surpassthis series."
1,"Some movies need to be seen even if they aren't necessarily great movies. ""Sky Captain and the Land of Tomorrow"" would be one of those titles. Is it a great movie? No. But it's a great achievement. Never was there a movie before that looked or felt like it. The visuals are stunning and it somehow manages to achieve a look that is both futuristic and retro 40s at the same time. ""Metropia"" is also such a movie.This is an animated movie....kind of. I've not read up on the technique, but it looks as though there is live action melded in with animation. The look itself is intriguing. Add to that the fact that the characters have oversized heads and it crosses over into creepy. It takes place in a dystopian future and the production design depicting the various indoor and outdoor scenery also has a very disquieting look.Similar to ""Brazil"" and ""Metropolis"" the viewer is faced with a repressive society where the population is being controlled and monitored. Now even the shampoo is working its way into our minds to help the process. The main character, Roger, hears voices that he's beginning to suspect are not the result of mental instability. When he hooks up with ""The Shampoo Girl"" he becomes involved in a plot to take the whole rotten mess down.The plot is OK. Aside from a couple of twists, there is nothing particularly clever in the way things unwind. It is good enough though to hold the viewer's interest. What really works are the visuals. This is simply mesmerising. I've never seen anything even nearly like it. It also profits by the use of good voices. Vince Gallo, Juliette Lewis, Udu Kier et al help move things forward. The sound design is also good. It helps add to the oppressiveness of it all.If you're into the weird and wonderful in films. If you're wanting to see the possibilities in film making, then this is a must see. If you're waiting for the next ""American Pie"" installment, don't bother."
1,I am old enough that I grew up on cartoons. I read comic books. I am not a fan of the computer image in most series. The art that is Daria reminds me of my first memories of what is now called an &#34;animated&#34; series.  What makes me watch it is the writing and characters. I started watching tv in the 50's. I have watched animation for many years. I know what I like and I like Daria.
1,"I really enjoy the characters...both the good guys and the bad guys...this series has really held my interest , fun to watch !"
1,After watching Dora for the last +10 years! I have Kids ages 3-16!Good for kids. Lots of stuff to learn.
1,"Like most shows of it's kind, SUITS follows the usual formulas for sitcom/dramas. But its clever writing, the back and forth verbal sparring of its characters and the charm of each character in the regular line-up makes this program far superior to its similarly styled contemporaries. My wife and I have been watching this show with the same kind of passion we invested in Battlestar Gallactica marathons. Okay, I admit: different kinds of shows. But SUITS is that good! We've only finished season 1 and have begun season2. I hope the quality and unpredictability of the storylines continues. And I hope Amazon will add season 3 to its Prime offerings (hint)."
1,"I'm not really sure what this program is trying to get across, but my grandson loves the colors and sounds.  Since it isn't teaching evil I let him watch it. It really is kinda lame using adult logic."
1,"I find this a compulsively watchable show. On the other hand, my wife won't watch it at all because it makes her nervous. I tried explaining the plot to someone last night and left the person hopelessly confused, but I wasn't. It was then that I realized what a good job the show does with interweaving numerous different subplots , some of which are clearly related, others not so much, at least on the surface. The flashbacks seem absolutely necessary and clarify many things. Some things, however, seem inexplicable - why are the bad guys (whoever and whichever ones they are) so interested in capturing the Jason Ritter character? The acting runs the gamut. Blair Underwood, as the President, is fine as always, though his role doesn't give him much. The man who is in charge of the secret government operation,(I cannot spell, pronounce or remember his name), is really great, as he was as the gay guilt-ridden lawyer in Damages. Jason Ritter, ostensibly the main character, is new to me. He is very appealing, with a kind of puppy-dog sincerity which, unfortunately, does not match up to his steeliness when he is in action. Most of the time, his girlfriend seems more dominant. Lesser characters range from extremely good to passable. Last week's episode seemed to me one of the best, partly because people began acting more realistically sensible, partly because of its deft combination of sentiment with pyrotechnic action. The show has nothing like the subtlety and thoughtfulness of, say, Rubicon, which my wife did watch. However, I think it may be on its way to being first-rate entertainment, not yet there, but maybe starting to reach for it."
1,"I only watched a few episodes because I think it's horrible but my teenage daughter loves the show, it is a teen soap opera"
1,"I love this show---the characters are so three dimensional and believable.  kudos to the writers---it's an exceptional show!I tried to write and tell them that Sheldon would never say, ""smarter than me"" which he does in the Dennis Kim episode when he's talking to Howard.  It's ""smarter than I"" and Sheldon knows that.  If anyone knows how to reach the writers, pass it along."
1,"An excellent ensemble cast.  Damien Lewis is magnificent.  When this became available through Amazon Prime, I rabidly devoured an episode...and then another...and then all of a sudden, Season 1 was over and I wondered at how deeply engrossed I became in Charlie's story and how much I had grown to care about him and his partner, Danni.  So now I was craving to know even more of Charlie Crews, et al. An excellent ensemble cast.  Damien Lewis is magnificent.  Now it on to season two."
1,I love the puzzles these Agatha Christie movies present partly because the director and the actors are so good.
1,"Love it, being from Louisiana, but living in Wisconsin, helps me connect to the south and their way of living."
1,"Now, some shows go south - quality wise - but that's the fastest rolling downhill so far.Good clear thinking, scientific approach (O'K, as scientific as you can get without losing 99,5% of the audience), logic, dry and sometimes black humor, in short everything that made those series special in the seasons 1 and 2 - gone. I still hope may be not forever - perhaps the writing crew should be changed?Bones is getting quickly disengaged from her brain. Booth - an FBI Special Agent and a former Army sniper - is being turned into a giggling idiot. Bones father, who used to be one of the most insteresting characters, is downsized so much he takes less time than any of those moron interns. A horde of neurotic interns has already ruined Doctor House, so why repeat somebody's else mistake?The fascinating and brillian Stephen Fry has been replaced with that clown... what's the name of that baby shrink again?Who would have said that I would feel profoundly gratefull for the presence of Dr Saroyan? I actually like the first director that much that I was annoyed when they replaced him. But now she is the anchor to the first two seasons when it was a brilliant show as she seems to be the only person who still keeps her brains, humor and common sense.What happened to common logic? Bones's staple phrase used to be : ""There is flesh here, I don't work with flesh!"". Now they make her doing autopsies? Whats' next - working with lab rats? She started making idiotic and illogical statements which she never used to do before. Angela is turning into a cheap stupid easy access somebody - again the initial character was not like that. Booth is behaving like a clown half of the time. The combined IQ rate dropped to around 200 may be.... all of them put together.This is turning into a trashy switch-off-your-brain Grand Guignol show which has nothing to do with the initial concept. Two brillian seasons and now that?!"
1,I'm a nanny an when the kids want to watch tv I'm glad I have prime so the can watch this.
1,"The actors are sublime; the characters extremely diverse and interesting in this series. Season Two moved all characters forward in their personal growth and development, although I would have liked to seen more detail about the Bailey Chase character.The plot effectively weaves a vivid web of real life events into profound change for Grace. The final scene between two tortured souls; one straining against unfathomable psychological and physical pain and leather execution bonds in full-fledged  terror, the other, paralyzed into submission by the greatest love and the fear of something soft and all accepting.The eyes of Grace embrace and beckon Leon, soul to soul into the last seconds of his life. Quietly, with large Angelic eyes and a yielding voice,  and the infinite truth she beckons &#34;Look at me.&#34;  She repeats. &#34;Look at me&#34;.Grace is saved when the choice is made to comfort Leon as he passes before her eyes. His passing reveals her deepest self."
1,All the characters are well defined and strongly characterized. Gina Torres is really great in her role as the boss
1,"Spoilers included:This episode is unique, in my opinion. I'll state this now, in case I'm mixing up episodes. I have seen this but I'm reviewing after not having seen it in a while. So, don't be to hard.The whole idea of Teyla having an alteration to be a Wraith for the time being is really interesting. Especially how Todd manipulates events to his wants. I do enjoy Teyla's use of her authoritative position at the end where she warns Todd about her coming back in the event that he does something that she would not want him to. She can be very intimidating when she wants to be.I won't say much more, but I'll give good points on the creativity of the episode and the acting. Teyla, the actor playing her more specifically, did an excellent job. I can't imagine dealing with having to put all that make-up on.However, I'm going to stop there, as I'm not really one to delve into the actors themselves, other than to rate them as something along the lines of good or bad.Anyway, the episode was very good. It put Todd in a position of power whilst taking down the Queen. However, even though the Wraith to Human potion, as I'll call it, didn't get to go into place, I think it flows with the episodes. With it, it would cut the series short, and that would put a downer on our want for more.So, the Wraith war continues. Good episode. I hope people continue to enjoy the series.Just to note in ending, I'll apologize now if any of this information is out of place. As I pointed out in the beginning, I haven't watched this episode in a while. I wanted to write a review and give stars to this episode so that people would know it was good, instead of just seeing one star.Ok, hope you like the series."
1,"Once you watch one, it will be tough to stop watching them. Great mix of having a per episode mystery of sorts and having a season long build-up."
1,"Season one of Boston Legal was dazzling. The writing was clever, witty, and intelligent. And Alan Shore as the maverick lawyer was as memorable a character as I have ever seen on a TV show.  Then, something happened.  The insightful social and political commentaries became heavy handed, and by season five they were nearly incomprehensible.  (In ""Roe"" Shirley Schmidt accuses China of a ""Holocaust"" against women. Last time I checked, women, even Chinese women, were in no danger of extinction.) But the worst decision the producers made was to give ""Hands"" Espenson center stage. He was a character who should have been discreetly dropped after third season, but instead they allowed his bizarre behavior, not to mention Denny Crane's, to dominate the show. By the end of the fifth season, they were all clowns--even the brilliant Alan Shore.  Dancing with a cheerleader's outfit? Shooting an entire  delegation of Chinese businessmen?  To quote Monty Python's skit-stopping colonel: ""Too silly! Too silly!""Here's my recommendation to those who prefer to avoid disappointment: Watch the last season of The Practice, the show that preceded Boston Legal (and was superior in many respects). Then watch the first two, or perhaps three, seasons of Boston Legal. Then quit while you're ahead."
1,"I love Poirot!!  I love the characters.  The series has great writers, and the set design has so much detail.  It's like being transported back to the time when the story was taking place.  The clothes, the vehicles, foods, everything is so authentic.  Poirot is so brilliant, and observant, that I can never guess who the culprit is.  It's a great series and I can see why it is so popular."
1,"The Poirot series, for me, is some of the most enjoyable programing on television.  The beautiful settings and David Suchet make for a perfect and relaxing evening."
1,"My 2-year old has yet to show any interest in it, but for me, it's not a bad show. The drawings are great and so are the lessons."
1,"Very interesting.  Even though I have watch other programs on President Kennedy, I found this one very interesting because it focused a lot on his father. This brought information I was not aware of.  Enjoyed the show recommend it."
1,"My household discovered this series about a month ago.  We'd never seen it when it was broadcast.  We found the cast, actors, and story lines interesting and, considering the relative age of the series, not dated.  Season 3 retained most of the original cast but added a few new ones.  Veronica is now in college but attends few classes.  She spends most of her time solving big and little problems for her friends.  If you like this type of TV you'll like Veronica Mars.  A side note:  Season 4 was planned, trailers produced, but never happened.  Season 4 trailers can be found online."
1,"Just when I think they can't get any better, they go and get better still. I love these videos and will be very sad when I don't have any new ones to watch.  Keep them coming!!!"
1,"In 2010, the Syfy channel had an interesting idea, to take one of Stephen King's lesser known works, a rare dramatic mystery, The Colorado Kid, and turn it into a Science Fiction story. A lot of Syfy's original shows are way out there, but Haven is more grounded and has quickly amassed a cult following. While there are similarities to the book and other King works are referenced, the show is surprisingly original.Audrey Parker (Emily Rose) is an FBI agent, who gets a tip that one of her fugitives has been spotted in the small town of Haven Maine. Parker is a terrific agent, because she knows nothing of who she is or where she came from. This beautiful, but introverted girl has put everything into her work and it has become her whole life. Once she gets to Haven, she realizes that something about this town isn't quite right, but she has no idea what she's in store for.During her investigation, Parker meets two brothers who have run the towns newspaper for 40 years. These brother show Parker some old stories from a unsolved case 25 years earlier, the murder of the Colorado Kid. Why would Audry care about it you ask, well there is a photo in the paper, showing a woman at the crime scene who could pass for her twin.With the chance to discover who she is and where she came from Parker takes a leave of absence from the FBI and joins the Haven P.D. only to discover that the town and it's people are afflicted with something known as the troubles. These troubled people, for some unknown reason, have ailments that allow them to do the seemingly impossible, such as shape-shifting, destruction with a thought, murder by shadow, the ability to star fires, even an artist who control things simply by drawing them.Parker is paired with the towns only Detective, Nathan Wuornos (Lucas Bryant) who himself is a troubled person. His affliction is that he can't feel anything, an adaptation of a real disease in which people can't feel pain, Wuornos can't feel a thing. Together Parker and Wuornos investigate these troubles, trying to find out what's causing them, while at the same time, Audry tries to solve the Colorado Kid case in the hopes that she might one day find out who she is and where she comes from.This show is fantastic and it's not just about the Science Fiction mystery that I love so much. The troubles are a big part of it, but there is also a great mystery to the whole thing, that is really left to the audience to figure out along with Audrey. The show is further boosted by the small town element, as Haven is one of these quaint towns, where everyone knows everyone else. It makes for some fabulous recurring guests, side stories, and the occasional hilarious moment.Emily Rose is out of this world! She has always had bit parts in TV series here and there, but she's never been a star before, but when it comes to Haven she is truly the perfect one to play Audrey Parker. She brings such a different personality to a sci-fi/cop show and the way the mystery and troubles follow her really draws the audience in.Lucas Bryant is just as interesting as we try to figure out what draws this man into this work. Sure he's trouble, but his lack of feeling has left him emotionless. At times it seems like he's doing a job he doesn't want to do, but for some reason has to.The only other regular cast member is Eric Balfour who at the ripe age of 37 is a Science Fiction veteran. Balfour has done a ton of Sci-Fi, but finds himself in a different role in Haven. Balfour plays Duke Crocker, a petty criminal and smuggler, with a terrific sense of humor, who always seems to get caught up in these troubles cases.Haven is amazing, it's just one of these addictive shows that draws you in right from the very first episode. The writing makes you feel like you're riding along in your hometown, trying to figure out the mystery along side the two detectives. Every episode is better than the one before it and it's just one of those shows you never want to stop watching. It is one of the best shows I have seen in ages and I really can't recommend it enough!"
1,These guys are funny and smart. This show is funny and educational too.  A great show that both my son and I can enjoy together
1,"Mitchum is always spell binding & he is again.  As a kid ""Thunder Road"" became part of my psyche (saw at a drive-in).  The song - I will remember to my grave.  Keely Smith as his girl friend couldn't have been more seductive or more in love w/her moonshine runner.  Mitchum always managed to be in trouble no matter which side of the law he was on.  His classic detective films are hard to find - ""The Big Sleep"" & ""Farewell My Lovely"".  AGAIN why do most reviewers blab it all?  Paragraphs & paragraphs & paragraphs telling one about a film...ever so boring.  Me thinks these folks have too much time on their hands.  I digress...this film is certainly worth watching.  Impossible to notice other actors - Mitchum w/his sleepy eyes & conspicuous laid back attitude could charm the fur off a pussy cat..."
1,"There is no sex or gratuitous violence, there is no swearing or people plotting to ruin each other.  It is a story about dedicated people doing the best they can in horrific circumstances.  It is superbly filmed,  the characters are complex like all humans are but never explored in most mass media,  the actors are the best I've seen and the story is riveting.  So.....where is the continuing story?  I suppose we will not have any more of it,  it is just that good and does not fit into the modern story of greed, vengeance, murder, demons and  vampires.....This one makes you want to be a better person after you watch."
1,"This was actually a very believable and fun film, and it finally gave Lee Pace a chance to show his acting range before being possibly typecast with the upcoming Twilight and Hobbit roles.The story follows a twenty-something played neurotically well by Angarano (who showed great maturity inGentlemen Broncos [Blu-ray]) who cannot get over falling for a forty-something played by Uma Thurman. He finds a way to try and crash her remote upstate New York wedding and pre-party while using his friend as a cushion and unbeknownst helper. The story has some comedic, yet realistic moments highlighted by the best performance (and comic relief role) in the film with Jake Johnson playing the perpetually drunk brother of the bride.The Blu quality is standard, with there being some nice views of the island they filmed at and around. The clarity is not superb or benchmark, nor is the DTS - and the yellow lens bled out the brightness, like Winkler was trying to make it look retro (which when you let the menu play customers thought it looked like a 70s film). The weakness of this product though are the Blu supplements, which in this volume of bad quality makes it hard for me to rate the product any higher than four:* Deleted scenes, 2 minutes. Glad they were cut as they would have made for some tedious additions.* Outtakes, 2:35 minutes. Unfunny and could have been left off the disc.* Extended scene, 2:36 minutes. The only supplement I liked - it was from the dinner table scene and involved more Jake Johnson comedy (I remember him most as the roommate inNo Strings Attached (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)), mistake to cut it.* Making of, 21:47 minutes. A very dry interview and clip laden piece with the mains and director dissecting their roles and love for each other, skipper.* Max Winkler Makes Ceremony, 8:18 minutes. A strange mix of tabletop interviews and behind the scenes showcasing his thinking out loud process. I suppose any huge fans of his will want to see this.* Behind the scenes footage, 7:17 minutes. Big mistake to include this as it was either meant to show how bored people were in between takes, or was providing a yearbook clip of the moments wanting to be forgotten during production, skipper.* A Year in a Tent, 3:50 minutes. The full length clip/short film of Lee Pace's character in Africa. LoDef and slightly tedious, but worth the watch if you liked the clips left in the film.* HDNet promo, 4:25 minutes. Did not even look HD and grabbed quips from the other supplements here.English language with subs in same and Spanish. I did not see any real benchmark Blu clarity on sound or picture (though still worthy to see) and the supplements were hopefully a lesson in how-to and what not to include for this first-time feature director. I liked the outcome (not your typical ending) and it is quirky enough to give it a comedy tag. Four for the film and zero for the rest."
1,Good season. I have grown tired of the repetitive plots and increasing darkness but season 2 was still gripping and full of optimism.
1,I like this tv show because there is a great story line in each episode. They find and catch the perp and prosecute them. I have all the seasons.
1,"Overall the series seems a bit too serious for it's own good. The story is very comic book oriented, so if you like comic books, this is a pretty average watch. Hero grows from ashes, works against evil villain of city, wants to regain his name, protects the weak and innocent, is conflicted with morals, etc. Things that don't quite match up are his lack of romantic chemistry with his co-host/villain's daughter/ daddy's issues/ cute sidekick, Orwell. the rest is pretty standard comic book believable. Think Punisher, but family doesn't die and evil mostly firmly punished but carefully not to bruise a prisoner. I suppose this would be good as a 8-14 year old range comic book series that doesn't promote too much controversy. Some action but not quite enough to be PG if you know what I mean."
0,"I have never watched this, but I know it eats dirt.  How?  Cause I read every  5 and 4 and 3 star review.  Isn't it sad how we are manipulated?  Ok.  Say it is given 5 stars and you get all excited and and watch 2 hours and realize its a dog.  Who gains?? Does Amazon pay something each time anyone watches anyepisode?  mmmmm?  I really don't know but I suspect and so should you."
1,Was very good if more shows out there please get them.  Amazon you need tto do that.I liked the idea girls school.
1,So much fun just watching all over again where it all started.  How much Camille has changed from the first season till now.
1,We see a lot of character development here as the series stretches and the story lines are still good.  Quite  worth your hard earned cash.
1,Great season and glad i bought this. Its so nice having the option to purchase a season like this and watch at my leasure.
1,This was a great series with good acting and true to the time period. London Hospital was ahead of it's time as far as treating the sick and injured. It was fascinating to see how people were treated and that the hospital opened at 8am with patients lined up at the gate. London Hospital pioneered new treatments and procedures while treating the poor. I loved that they smoked in the operating rooms while working on patients as the patients drank a cup of tea!  If you like history and medicine you should watch this series.
1,"By far my favorite season so far.. Tennant is my favorite Doctor, and i love the relationship he has with Rose."
0,"SPOILERS WARNING....J.J. Abrams has a huge slap coming from me. The reason is simple: I swore to my wife years ago that if I should ever discover an actual name behind the 'pioneering' camera shake, I'd slap him (or her). No one needs to see a film that looks like a frightened tourist's film of an erupting volcano while fleeing it.That is perhaps my biggest beef with this film. Abrams is shown in the mini-documentary actually shaking and/or slapping the camera as he is shooting key scenes. This, along with ""the glare"" (from stage lighting) is Abrams' big innovation. This camera quivering and vertigo-inducing swooping is why I have wanted to slap him for so long.As to this film, let us speak as we find: this is not even a remake, much less a homage. It is a highjacking. Though the actors are flawless and talented beyond description for their performances here, it is en evil waste. By starting the film with a history-shifting time traveler, Abrams has cheated everyone who sees this, everyone who retains the love of the original series.Having said that, it is a bloody brilliant move. The so-called Star Trek ""franchise"" was at an apparent end. The TV series ""Enterprise"" had failed miserably; no one seemed to be in control of the intellectual property of Star Trek itself; fans felt a sort of dying era taking place right here, right now. This film saves us from that fate...or does it?In the distant future, an elderly Spock gets embroiled with angry Romulans since he apparently is responsible for their home planet (Romulus) being destroyed. A surviving faction of Romulans--especially nasty leader Nero--go flying backward in time, and Spock is forced along behind them. They appear 25 years before James T. Kirk is born, and they wait.Kirk's father is captain of a starship. The nasty Nero destroys the ship...and James T. Kirk's father. Here is the bloody marvel and the disgrace: this event has offered us a parallel universe-reality, and from thence the film takes off, going boldly where I wished it hadn't. The elderly Spock is now on a mission to see that Nero is destroyed, which task can only fall to Kirk, of course. Meanwhile, the alternate reality trick goes stale rapidly. Vulcan, along with Spock's mother Amanda, is destroyed (and so is the screen time for Wynona Rider); Young Spock is entangled and enamored with Lt. Uhura; Chekov is a little faerie who is damned good at beaming people anywhere; Kirk himself is a rather gay-looking idiot and part-time drunkard; the rest of the clan is essentially ignored.Abrams and all involved are truly innovative and brilliant. But this film cannot pass without further comment. The ghosts of De Kelley and Jimmy Doohan will never rest now. Too many people still remember them with happiness and the pain at the loss of them. Yet here they are, along with the others, being mimicked or parodied or whatever one wishes to call it. I cannot fathom how Nimoy could agree to star in this, but he did. Who else could play ""Spock Prime"" as he is credited?My advice is that if you are a purist, don't see this. If you are a curious, adventurous and sacred-cow-kicking fan, see it. Don't miss it if you are a fan of lunk-head director J.J. If you like cinema for its own sake, see it by all means. I for one felt a bit robbed by it all. I cannot begin to imagine what Rodenberry might have thought of this desecration."
1,"the characters are great, like the story lines, the southern &#34;charm&#34; can be a little much but that's what it is.............."
1,This show is perfectly suited toward youngsters who don't need the over stimulation of ridiculous shows like SpongeBob and the ilk.
1,"This season is more fun, and its great to see the families get together and accept each other.  Vanessa is a little hard to take (very, very selfish) but she is what she is, and she's right out there with it.  That's great."
1,"I knew a few minutes into the 1st episode that I had actually watched this show when it aired on ABC and I remembered that I liked it but not well enough to remember the outcome of any of the episodes. I can understand why this show didn't get renewed but glad that it did tie up the storylines before the show went off the air. Good characters, good guest stars and not a waste of time if you should decide to watch it, but still understandable as to it being canceled."
1,"This series only ran for 11 episodes some years ago, before Jerremy Renner bacame a big star.  I like him and I like looking at Amber Tamblyn, who's dating David Cross, old enough to be her father, when she she be dating me, old enough to be her grandfather.But enough about my imaginary love life.  The Unusuals is a refreshing and fun take on cop shows, and I enjoyed it, which is high praise since I find most cop shows dull and predictable, except for the wonderful British ones, like Foyle's War and Midsommer Murders and Death in Paradise.  Get a ROKU 3 box and you can get all of those and much more."
1,I watched this show when it originally came on tv. I loved it! Then they canceled it after one season. We were left hanging. I wish they would have made a movie that at least gave us some closure.
1,awesome i liked all of the actors in this series. I wish they had continued this show for many for years than it aired.  Maybe they can bring it back.
0,"Zombie Strippers(released April/08)stars one of my fave actors,Robert Englund(forever Freddie Krueger in my heart),as the only real star amongst this  company of amateurs and up and comers.It has been my misfortune of late,if you have seen any of my recent reviews,to be watching movies lately with less than stellar value,shall we say.Add yet another one to that list.*sigh* What I thought would be a low budget indie film,with some real kick to it,turns out to just....a low budget indie film.The jokes and situations are totally lame,old and stereotypical.To give you an idea and a good example of the latter,a Mexican janitor is loading up his gun and with each bullet he carefully puts in the chamber he utters""Pancho Villa....Montezuma...Caesar Chavez...Cinco de Mayo...guacamole..."".Yeah,funny,funny stuff,right? Mr.Englund does a fine job as the owner of the strip club,who is deathly afraid of catching ""something"" off of one of his girls and just loves his money.The strippers themselves I thought also did a pretty good job but the ""comic relief"",such as it is,comes in the form of the opening act,the hippest but dumbest and street wise bunch of Marines you have ever seen.None of them had the acting chops to pull off a send up like theirs,even if they had tried...oh yeah,they were trying.Sorry guys.The plot finds a laboratory become infested with zombies.The marines are called in to eradicate them.They do their job,but in the process one gets bitten and flees the building through a basement window(great security).That Marine in turn heads into a nearby strip club and infects one of the dancers.That dancer/stripper infects another dancer/stripper,and so on and so on.Before you know it the ones uninfected WANT to become infected,as the infected ones are getting all the attention from the male patrons.And oh yes,the strippers,after their dances,each take a patron into the back and proceed to eat them.The remains,either heads,bodies without heads,bodies with heads,etc.,usually re-animate and they lock them in jail-like cells in the basement.Doesn't every strip club you know have jail cells?Owner Englund at first is beside himself with what is happening,but before you can say ""bite me"",he sees dollar signs.The strippers are soon competing with one another and Englund is raking in the dough.Somewhere along the line,the Marine major/leader finds out about the zombies at the club(he overhears a convo while reading a newspaper outside!).Meanwhile one of the stripper zombies has gone down into the basement and voluntarily let the incarcerated ones bite and infect her.She also lets all of them out and they go a-wandering around the club.The Marines come to the rescue and exterminate the zombie menace.Poor Englund gets bitten and is to be taken back to the labs for testing.The Marines also find one of the lab personel in the club trying to pick a lock(?).He fesses that it was he who deliberately spread the zombie virus throughout the lab.He said there's alot of money to be had in ""working for the man"".The Marines leave going to do...whatever they usually do,and the lab man has two of his unbitten cohorts come in to clean up the strip club mess.For a low budget film,the special effects(heads being blown off,ripped apart,etc.)are on the whole not too shabby,as opposed to those in Alien Armegeddon,another indie cheapie.The demographic for a film like this would be male,18-25 yrs.,because there is ALOT of T&A; throughout the film,graphic at that(I think they called it nudity,once upon a time).It is this group that would probably love this film,for that alone.Males of ages before,shouldn't be viewing this at all and those after,will,for the most part,see the film for what it is....bad.The only other person to stand out to any extent was Carmit Levit&eacute; as the Russian Blavatski,who was directly in charge of the dancers.At first I thought her portrayal was a bit over the top,but as the movie progressed she seem to settle down and I actually didn't mind her performance at all.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and looks clear and crisp.Extras include two featurettes,deleted scenes & commentary.All in all,despite having star Robert Englund on board for this project,it is an amateurish and lame excuse for a film and it's satire,send ups and laughs fall flat.Mr.Englund does a good job,as do the strippers(for the most part)and their handler Levite',but it is not nearly enough to save this dud.Give it a wide pass."
1,"Fine series. Writing, directing, acting excellent. Deserves the 5 stars.It is brooding, it is dark yet each character is whole and well done."
1,"Leonard is sensitive and charismatic young man.  He is sort of an artist, a self-thought photographer who produces black and white pictures of American urban landscape (portraits are not his forte by his own admission).  He reads a lot and is loved and indulged by his parents.  But Leonard is utterly unhappy.  His long term relationship and engagement has ended abruptly and his emotional vulnerability is making it impossible for him to function in a society without medication and constant and vigilant care from his parents.As Leonard is struggling to figure out whether to live or die, he works is his father's dry cleaning business and in a short period of time meets two beautiful but very different women.  One is dark haired, professional and independent, affectionate and caring.  The other is blond, compulsive, party girl, kept by a married man on a side for his personal entertainment.  Inevitably, Leonard is attracted to a troubled and emotionally unavailable girl convinced that he can help her and take care of her.  The social pressures of his parents and prospective business deal, propels him in the arms of the other.As story progresses, we are simply curious to see which girl will be Leonard's final choice.  Is he going to follow his heart, or follow his head?  What is it that each of the women can offer him and what is it that he can offer them?  What is the true love?  Is there a compromise in life that one has to make in order to become functional and even happy?I really liked the movie because the director touches up on all of these points delicately and thoughfully.  As it turns out the improbable sometimes turns out to be probable.  Of course, there is a price to it.  To learn what the price is, you must see this movie.  Many consider Gwyneth Paltrow to be the ""it"" girl.  I am sorry, but in this movie, it is Vinessa Shaw that steals the screen.  Her high cheekbones and raven hair give her exotic beauty image that very few actresses can offer to the audiences."
1,I love how this show is realistic with today's family issues. Every time I watch an episode I feel inspired and happy. Love this series.
1,Vincent D'Onofrio is the best. I miss this show so much. I can watch over and over and never get tired of this show!
1,Like the series and the actors. Please see our other reviews of Bones. Range of personalities and dynamics are good.
0,I watched it to the end. Who ever wrote this had no insite into human behavior. The blond was good looking had a presence. And beat Hilary in acting but that was not saying much. the story line was extremely weak. The blond should have knowin his big mouth friend was talking. there was no other way they would know about him. I mean there are a hell of a lot of blond men with pony tails. lol And he had a big mouth. I also noticed that he had no gun shot wound in the pool scean > Bad writing Bad directing. And the minute a bad guy came on the scean you knew he was bad. The only knowen people where the bad guys as usual in a bad movie.
1,"Some of this series is hard to watch because it's so sad, but the truth is that living back then was difficult and sad. Each episode adds to the breadth and depth of the characters, and I'm enjoying it thoroughly."
1,My 4 yr old loves Dora and always enjoys going on adventures. She also like to speak other languages and thinks it is so cool.
1,"If you're a fan of the series SONS OF ANARCHY then you're probably aware of most of what happened in this season and want to pick it up on DVD to watch it again and again. If you're not a fan then you probably haven't seen it yet. I fell into that category and now find myself recording the third season which just began. This is a solid series that may take the low road, but remains interesting if nothing else.The Sons of Anarchy are a motorcycle club (what most would consider bikers), officially known as SAMCRO (Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original). This group is the original band, the beginning of the club, though most have passed away. Originally started with 9 members, the club has expanded and as we've learned in season two is even international. Comparisons to the Hells Angels would be expected, but knowing their reputation for dealing in drugs and more the link isn't really there.The Sons deal mostly in illegal weapons and small time extortion, tending to protect the small town of Charming, CA that they live in rather than do it harm. They keep out drug dealers and meth heads, keeping the streets safe even if they do use a bit of violence to do so. The story never turns lose of the fact that these are dangerous men who do dangerous and illegal things and yet you find yourself rooting for them. Perhaps it's the biker mystique that has long been associated with freedom and a life without care. But those two things aren't found with the Sons as they have as many problems as anyone.As I said, I never saw season one, but from what I gathered, club president Clay Morrow (Ron Perlman) made the decision to take out a member named Opie and by mistake that member's wife was killed. At the same time, vice president Jackson ""Jax"" Teller (Charlie Hunnam) was trying to decide what to do about the club having read his deceased father's ""manifesto"" wherein he discussed the fall of the club should things continue down the path they were at the time of his death. Jax knows of Clay's orders but doesn't let the club know. He'd rather attempt to save the club than see it destroyed from within. Add to that the fact that Jax' mother Gemma (Katey Sagal) is now married to Clay and the plot thickens.But that's just how the new season opens. Not only does Jax have to contend with attempting to reshape the club in a new mold, he has to continue helping with the old. While attempts by the ATF to shut down the Son have failed, setting up a new source isn't easy. Ties to the IRA are slow moving and personal grudges between members of both groups won't make for nice bedfellows.Worse yet is the arrival of someone new to town, a businessman with ties to a white supremacists group known as the League Of American Nationalists (LOAN). Ethan Zobelle (Adam Arkin) is sly and cunning, something the Sons haven't faced before. Hiding any connection to this group from the locals, Zobelle has plans in motion that will change the face of Charming forever. With his hooks already dug into the town's mayor, Zobelle will use this force to shut down the Sons and take over the town, allowing all the things the Sons prevent from running rampant and taking his cut as well.Along with this storyline we find the Sons becoming involved with a legitimate business due to the wife of one of their imprisoned members coming to them for help. That business is the porn industry and while it may be unsavory for most, it's a legit moneymaker that the Sons need while trying to restart their arms business. It's a business that Jax brings the Sons in to and that Clay wants nothing to do with.The crux of the show pits Clay and Jax against one another for various reasons. At the core is the knowledge that Jax has of Clay's actions as well as the resentment he has for the man his mother married. But both men deep inside want nothing more than for the Sons to continue on. They just have different ways of seeing how that will happen.Toss in the IRA double dealing, an ATF agent with a personal grudge, a chief of police who helps the Sons as often as possible and a deputy chief trying to keep things straight and you have a decent drama going on here. Best of all it doesn't rely on weekly fist fights of motorcycle chases to hold a viewers attention. It actually offers a story and some great acting to go with it. Perhaps the biggest surprise to some will be Katey Sagal's portrayal of Gemma, a woman who sees herself as the mother figure for the club, trying to keep it together as well as keep the two men who mean the most to her from killing one another. Forget Peggy Bundy, this role offers Sagal something that she can display her acting chops with. And when a twist in the story involving her comes out (sorry, for once no spoiler on that one), you'll feel so involved in her tale that you can't help but feel for her.As I said, the series revolves around a group of men who choose what most of us would avoid for both a lifestyle and for a profession. But as for offering great drama it delivers in spades. The show will hold your interest from beginning to end. I for one found myself watching it and thinking, perhaps I'll put in the next disc and see what happens. The next thing I knew it was 5AM and I'd spent the entire night watching the second season and setting the DVR for season three. It is that good.A word of warning for parents: the show is seen on FX and like many of their other series is definitely not for kids. Slight nudity and extreme violence are the norm for this group and visible throughout the series. Just a warning for those uninformed."
1,Excellent!
1,"Veronica MARS looks like VENUS, but is a down to EARTH girl who is from cliche filled NEPTUNE where no one drives a MERCURY. Veronica narrates the last dozen years of her life so we can catch up, but continues her ""Sex in the City"" style of narration well into the film. She is set to work for a law firm in NYC and has a great boyfriend. When someone from her ""nearly everyone is rich and famous"" class is killed, and the main suspect is her ex-boyfriend. Veronica returns to resume her role as an investigator in the case.This was a made for TV formulaic script, and wasn't done well. If you have evidence to clear your client, you present it to the DA and not the local sheriff who doesn't like you.  I also don't understand why she never returned the calls or answered the phone from her new employer. She could explain what she was doing, if they were willing to wait, fine, if not, also fine. But to simply ignore the calls without giving them the respect and decency to provide them with information to make a decision is immature and irresponsible.What channel has the ""Columbo"" reruns?Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex. no nudity."
0,"i have contacted amazon at least three times now. the sound in this movie sucks. every fifteen seconds or so, there is a 'break' in the soundtrack, making it impossible to watch."
1,I really want to see the whole movie for free on prime before this year's subscription runs out.  Amazon!?!?!? Well?
1,"Season 1 of Heroes was very good, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys stories about superheroes.  Season 2, well..  I first saw it years back - renting it from a big-box rental place.  Recently,  I picked it up cheap.  The season suffered from the writers' strike, which hurt a lot of shows at the time, even killed some, and gave us a pile of reality shows.  In the case of Heroes, season 2 got clipped to only 11 episodes, so whatever the writers originally planned to do with this season got derailed.  In spite of all this, they did manage to tell some mostly coherent stories.  The season also adds a lot of new characters, which may or may not be a good thing.  Plus, on top of the Hiro story (told in Japanese), we now get the Maya and Alejandro story (told in Spanish), so the show is hard to watch while playingThe Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, Game of the Year EditionNot a complete waste of money if you can get it for less than 10 bucks (including shipping and handling.)"
1,"I found it to be an enjoyable series though the recognizable science was a bit thin. Towards the end it seemed to me the writers had explored pretty much what could be done in the premise of the show. It was a good idea to stop when they did. If you like science fiction, I think you will like this one."
1,"Excellent series, which I watched on TV.  I was sorry to see it end after 13 shows.  Great cast."
1,"I watch this series on SCI Fi channel when I can, but have missed many shows over the seasons.  Therefore, I find it great to be able to fill in the blank spots by watching the show in order.  I plan to buy more seasons and watch them all.  The idea that a vampire, werewolf, and a ghost can live together is unique and makes for interesting storylines"
1,My grandkids love the cartoon and best of all I don't mind them watching it.  It doesn't get to me like some of the other children's programming.  (If I ever win the lottery I will buy the rights to Barney and burn every episode.)
1,why isn't this on regular television or directv? the lightman company and its cast keep you watching and you want more.
1,"Well, what's not to like? It was Doctor Who? and new monsters and a new companion introduction, and it was a lot of flirting and some kissing and well that almost NEVER happens. It was a very satisfying Christmas special, a little more grown-up than usual, and I am beginning to warm to Matt Smith's Doctor. He was even talking to the lady=TARDIS, or I think that's what was happening -- fun fun fun!"
1,"The acting  is excellent.  Scene settings, time period and the conditions of life in that era are horrendous.  The stories were real-life and told in all its horryifying and heroic detail.  I loved both seasons and would strongly recommend watching."
1,I hate that this show was cancelled. It is very smart and sassy. Tim Roth is a great actor. I loved the premise for the show..
1,"This is a pretty good movie, lots of gore. Kept me wondering what was coming and didn't disappoint. Wished there was a few more minutes at the end for more closure. Worth watching."
1,This is a nice Canadian show. Very good ensemble cast carry the NCIS/CSI like show.  Fans of BSG & other Syfi channel shows will see some familiar guest stars through out the seasons.I think the show gets better as the seasons go because you like the Team.
1,"""Dietary Restrictions"" is one of the best episodes of Top Chef Masters. Hubert Keller, Rick Bayless, Michael Chiarello, Art Smith, and Anita Lo face their biggest challenge yet-- catering a gluten-free,soy-free,vegan event for musician Zooey Deschanel (ofTin Man (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)and the musical groupVolume One) It forces the chefs to be creative. They can't rely on their old standbys of meat,dairy,and wheat-based pasta.Rick Bayless makes a vegan tamale--a smart idea. There is plenty of vegetable-based cooking in Mexico. Michael Chiarello finds quinoa pasta, which reminds Deschanel of home. Wheat-free pastas are probably better than the whole wheat pastas that cook strangely and don't taste all that good (Rachael Ray swears by whole wheat pasta inRachael Ray's 30-Minute Get Real Meals: Eat Healthy Without Going to Extremes) Hubert Keller,who is Gandalf-like in the kitchen, makes some vegan magic.""Dietary Restrictions"" is one of those episodes showing why Top Chef Masters is must-see TV!"
1,"I have to admit that I stand corrected. After Michael and Pam left Dunder-Mifflin last week, I was seriously concerned for the future of the show. I just couldn't see a world where Michael wasn't doing some kind of crazy, unproductive thing around the office while Pam and Jim play pranks on Dwight. However, in ""Dream Team,"" we were treated to something surprisingly entertaining and funny.The Michael Scott Paper company officially begins in Michael's condo. Michael puts together a ""dream team"" of people to kick things off. We finally get to see what happened to Ryan after he got out of prison for fraud and, it seems, returns to the cast for good. Michael and his team set out to find investors for their fledgling company, but run into trouble when it becomes clear that Michael has no clear idea what his company is or where its going. One of the dream team members jumps ship while Pam convinces Michael to continue with the company. Together, Michael, Pam and Ryan move into open office space in the same building as Dunder-Mifflin.Meanwhile, Jim makes a bad impression on his new boss, Charles, while Andy continues his usual brown-nosing antics. In order to change the Charles's view of him, Jim lies about his soccer-playing abilities. This leads to an office-wide soccer game where Dwight spends the entire time trying to expose Jim's lie.While there isn't too much screen time back at good old D-M, Michael and co. get much-needed time to play off one another. The ending does get a little serious, even for The Office, but the rest of the episode is so funny that it works. I found myself laughing out loud several times -in fact, more often than I have in recent Office episodes."
1,"In Short: Homicide detective relocates from Chicago to Florida after a quarrel with his old boss and bullet in his rear end. A settlement left him with enough money to buy a house, and that's about it. He finds a new place, on a new squad, in a new city. Friends and foes make an engaging and entertaining time.So, the reason I gave this 4 stars:1. There is just too much sex. It is implied everywhere and at every turn. I love seeing a little, but it was too heavy for my liking.2. The show didn't grab me. I watch it here and there, but nothing stood out. It failed to pull me in.3. The characters are great. Lots of wit and good rapport. The coroner is fantastic.I think it is one of the better of the crime dramas available, but it isn't my favorite. The best character on here, IMHO, is the coroner. He his hilarious.I think the television series ""Life"" is similar and I prefer it to this one."
1,"I could not believe how well done and interesting this series was I loved it ! So accurate to the timeline ! Great case histories ! I could not believe how reasonable the whole series was ! Highly , highly recommend it !"
1,"The plot has Nelson Mandela's blacks fighting against the poor Zulu blacks. The Zulus are too poor to join Mandela's boycott of work so they fight on the side of the white power structure against the group that is attempting to empower them. Meanwhile four white photographers are out taking photos of the clashes and killings so we can have something to look at when we eat our Rice Krispies.The film is designed to ask the question, ""Are photographers vultures or leeches?""  and ""When do you put down the camera and help?"" I didn't like the fact you didn't have to think about the theme of the film...it was too overt. I like to dig for it. I didn't get attached to the privileged characters shooting pain and suffering. I had a hard time getting involved in the conflict of poor oppressed people fighting poor oppressed people. I really need a David vs. Goliath type story. The movie had some good scenes and a lot of scenes that simply replayed the theme. Okay, we get it.F-bomb, brief sex and nudity"
1,"Wow! I finally watched my very first episode of ""Dexter"" last weekend, and I ended up finishing Season 1 in its entirety within a few days. This is an amazing show about Dexter (Michael C. Hall), a Miami-based forensics experts who also happens to be a serial killer. However, Dexter is a NICE serial killer in that he has a strict moral code that he always adheres to: He only kills people who are violent criminals themselves and deserve to be punished. The first season of ""Dexter"" revolves around another serial killer that's been terrorizing the state of Florida. The Ice Truck Killer has a nasty habit of murdering prostitutes, cutting them up into pieces, and arranging their bodies artfully in very public places. Dexter works with members of the police department, including his adopted sister, Deb (Jennifer Carter), to find the killer. However, Dexter can't help being fascinated by the Ice Truck Killer's meticulous technique. He soon begins communicating with the killer, who seems to have an uncanny connection to Dexter and starts using his murders to trigger painful, repressed memories from Dexter's past.I became hooked on this show very quickly. Hall is amazing as Dexter, who is probably one of the most complex characters in television history. The supporting cast is excellent, especially Carter, Erik King as Sergeant Doakes (the only person who suspects Dexter of any wrongdoing), and James Remar, who portrays Dexter's father in flashbacks. I'm not particularly fond of Rita's character (portrayed by Julie Benz). She's incredibly wishy-washy, but I can definitely see why Dexter was drawn to someone with her personality. I also think the whole Ice Truck Killer identity revelation, intriguing as it was, could have been a bit less obvious. (I figured out his real identity and true connection to Dexter right away, so either the story was a bit too predictable or I am just incredibly brilliant.)Overall, though, ""Dexter"" is a very unique and compelling show. I have no idea how the program will manage to surpass its first season, but I can't wait to find out."
1,Plot /storyline predictable. Loner pushed toooo far and then bang! I had nothing to do and picked this movie. I enjoyed Mr. Hauler's other works but here he is just going through the paces....The excess blood just made the movie ludicrous. I would not rerun it nor recommend to anyone!Video quality was perfect!
1,"As my friends told me, the show would get better as it went along, and so far I have to agree.  The show is very well done, and there are several episodes that I thought were particularly entertaining (some good laughs).  The corpses sometimes are still very graphic, gross and disgusting, and sometimes things get a little too technical, but it is still an excellent show.This DVD set has several extras and it does have subtitles for the hearing impaired.  I hope the quality of the show continued in the other seasons, which I am looking forward to watching.  (I do not have cable or satellite, and only buy DVD's.)"
1,"I enjoy this informative series on science and other subjects, If you haven't seen it , I highly recommend you do.Always informative and interesting shows"
1,Not quite as good as the original but then again they didn't have RDA as their lead. But on the whole it was a good sequel
0,"Ugh, I can't take it - making the presidents right hand man involved in terrorism ?! The first lady clinically insane.  Then making you think it's the vice pres, then it turns out to be the president himself.  Uhhh, yeah, right. I thought at first at least they didn't do another mole in CTU (which they had done every single stinkin season).......then, turns out they did have someone in there following the 'right hand mans' orders! But he 'thought' he was doing the right thing.  Either way, STOP RECYCLING THE EXACT SAME PLOT LINES.  And they still have everyone respond to anything with ""I understand"".  Choose a different line once in awhile !  I give this 1 star, no idea why this has an average of 4 1/2 stars.  This is by far the worst of the first 5 seasons I've watched. It's more boring daytime soap opera than action/drama like the seasons before this one.  Feel free to skip this season, I wish I had."
1,"CEREMONY is one of the brighter starts to rise out of Hollywood this year. Though it was made in 2010 and released on Demand TV  before its ultimate release on theaters, it is hopefully going to gather the audience it so richly deserves.  It is a young work: the writer/director is Max Winkler, son of Henry Winkler, a bright young talent who essentially makes his debut with little sparkler. Not only has he come up with a fresh idea for a story but he has also matched that story with a script that is at all times warmly entertaining and at many points a sensitive, philosophical examination of relationships today. And he has cast the film with some of the finest young actors on screen at present.Sam Davis (Michael Angarano, a brilliant young actor in his early 20s, so memorable in the deeply touching 'One Last Thing') writes children's books and lives in the child like fantasies of kids.  He has a friend Marshall Schmidt (Reece Thompson, another early 20s bright young talent) who happens to show up as the only member of an audience to hear Sam read his latest new children's book.  The two boys rekindle their friendship, stagnant for the past year while Marshall recovered from an altercation and hid in his parents home while Sam had a momentary encounter with a beautiful 30s something woman Zoe (Uma Thurman).  The two lads decide to take a little trip to ostensibly to get Marshall out of his parent's home to see the world, but in actuality Sam has heard that Zoe is marrying some wealthy guy, Whit Coutell (Lee Pace, another brilliant actor remembered for his shattering performance in 'Soldier's Girl'), at Whit's lavish seaside home.Sam and Marshall mend long absent feelings of closeness and taking some daring steps they drive to the seaside estate, obtain an invitation to Zoe's party (her wedding to Whit Actually) from Zoe's drunken brother Teddy (Jake  M. Johnson).  Sam confronts Zoe, stating his love and his desire to marry her, but Zoe needs more than a young kid to satisfy her and sees the opportunities of marrying the moneyed Whit.  In a series of incidents both hilarious at times and deeply tender at others all characters discover new concepts of relationships.  How the film ends is left for the viewer to discover.Michael Angarano is pitch perfect as Sam, a young man whose ideals are tested and who must learn the adult role.  His skills are so polished at this young stage in his career that he is bound to become a major star.  Reece Thompson is not far behind, and Uma Thurman gives one of her most well rounded performances.  Lee Pace makes the most of his role, sparkling as the reigning optimist of the story.  But in the end most of the credit for the success of this little gem is due to the talent of Max Winkler who writes as well as he directs: he is a formidable force.  Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, April 11"
1,BY FAR - The funniest episode in &#34;It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.&#34;  It's not just the main story but the subplot of Dee trying to create her own Sex and the City 'girls club' is hilarious.
1,"I was a little skeptical after the fist season ended since Christopher Eccleston was no longer going to be The Doctor.  I really loved him.  But, since I had become a fan of the series, I decided to give the 2nd season a try, starting with the Christmas episode...David Tennant's first episode.I am so glad I gave it a try!  David Tennant's interpretation of the 10th Doctor is superb.  He is great fun to watch.  If you are not sure about this season, give this episode a try ... you won't be sorry!"
1,"An impressive idea about a professional team that can spot the smallest of lies based on body language, expressions and ""microexpressions"".  The main character is compelling, the supporting cast is hit or miss.  Most of the episodes are interesting and I appreciate how they show real clips of politicians and celebrities lying to us with their body language/facial expressions.  Some of it is definitely pop psychology style but other parts are true and the main character is based on a real person.  Most of the characters can't have satisfying love relationships because they catch their partners lying.  Interesting theme about lies and love.  How much do you expose and what do you let get by for the sake of the affair?  DIALOGUE/CHARACTERS: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; FRESHNESS FOR A TV TOPIC: A minus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: October to December 2010 (streamed)."
1,Best cop show since &#34;Police Story&#34; complex characters acted by a great ensemble cast. A real shame TNT cancelled it. Ann Biderman the shows creator is terrific. Fortunately her new show &#34;Ray Donovan &#34; on ShowtimeContinues to show she has great stories to tell
1,I can so relate to the show.  As a parent I so enjoy watching this show.  Its just another enjoyable show from BBC.
1,"I did not think I would like this show, because not really into the whole biker thing, but after the first few episodes I was hooked, now I can't wait to watch.  I am on Season 2 and will continue to watch, it just keeps getting better."
1,I had never watched this show before and was quite surprised and please to see how good it was.  I really like the interaction between the actors and intensiveness of each show.  I plan to watch all the seasons.  Thanks for having this part Prime Video.
1,"I like this show, kinda like a gritty modern 21 jumpstreet (the original show back in the day). The character building is not as good in the second season and loses pace a little but still entertaining. Descent special task team cop show."
1,"Since the last episode of Stargate SGU aired, I haven't watched the SyFy Network at all. I've missed the Stargate series (all of them) and it's clear that the network has no interest in producing customer-quality and popular series that, yes, might be expensive, but that's part of successful programming. In short, the network's decisionmakers are idiots. They had some templates that worked and they blew it. The stuff they have now is junk.Stargate Atlantis was great. SGU was cheap...but it grew on you. I didn't really watch it until I bought the DVDs. And it's strange that Season 1 was released in Blu-Ray and the second and best was not. It's just like SGA. The network just one day decided to pull the plug despite the viewership, quality and the fact that it was making money."
1,"Considering this particular period was so filled with change, twists of fate, rises, falls, and nearly every other device found in great dramas, I expected better than a seeming focus on the sexual antics of the characters. Otherwise, very well done and for those who don't have good background in the period when Henry VIII was King of England, it should hold your attention."
1,"This is an enjoyable and educational show for toddlers.  It has an easy to follow format that will help your child learn, as well as be entertained."
1,The seasons have continued to get better and better. You never can guess what's coming and the action doesn't stop. My only complaint is that Season 4 was the last season and the last episode left me in Unit withdrawal for a couple days!  Wish they would come back for a reunion episode to close out some things.
1,"This is the stuff I like to play while I'm writing a paper or doing homework, and writing novels. It's not a show that makes me go, &#34;Oh wow,&#34; but it is a show that makes me think and provides &#34;good,&#34; background noise."
1,"With whatever the population is of West Virginia, I hear tell there are only sixteen last names. The Whites, it appears, is one of the more notable.Here's the scoop. This documentary film crew follows the White family of Boone County around for one year, filming them, warts and all, and brings their story to anyone willing to take the time to watch.At first I was angry. Here is the very definition of white trash on my TV. They are a rough bunch. Drugs, drug selling, guns, killing, fighting, adultery and pretty much everything else I want to distance myself from. Many of them have died, or were killed, at an early age. They are in and out of jail so frequently it seems to be part of their lives. When and if they are released they will resume whatever behavior it is that put them there in the first place and might very well end up there again. But the world is changing and they are having a hard time running. One of the White sisters is in the hospital room. She is snorting some drug or another, immediately after giving birth. Something is wrong with the child and the hospital will keep the child for ""a couple of days"" for observation. Next thing you know the child becomes a ward of the state and mom needs to go into rehab if she wants her child back.You meet the various family members, local law officials, lawyers and the like. One blindsided me and made me re-think my attitude of things. The history of West Virginia is steeped in coal, one of the ugliest, meanest, most uncaring industries ever. Every family in West Virginia has experienced death from the mines and a sense of hopelessness and futility as a result. So the workers, and their families, over generations, have adopted a particular attitude as a result. They are true rebels with a ""f$%# you"" attitude of defiance. These people are a sad result of a bad deal and they will pull their kids after them just like they were pulled behind their folks. The never ending chain.This is well worth the time to watch for anyone interested. It's just really sad to see."
1,Very good family show. Fun characters and interesting story plots. Seems to be fairly period correct for anyone looking for that  sort of thing. Love it!!!
1,This is an informational video on several different islands.  Gives you a brief look at each.  I would have liked a little more info. but it did let me taste of the different areas.
1,David Suchet is the best actor I've seen portray Agatha Christie's Belgian detective Hercule Poirot.  I love the art deco sets and costumes.  The video quality is very good.  I enjoy seeing Christie's stories come to life.
1,"There isn't anything bad to say about this series. I want it to go on and on. In fact, I dreaded watching the last episode of season 2 because I knew that was it. I know there is a third season, but it is not available - so far.  True entertainment. I fell in love with all of the characters - even felt sorry for Henry Dean - whom I despised all through the series. But, then in a twist of a writer's pen, I felt sorry for him. The writing in so well done that you want to know more about each of the characters. And, it is especially troubling to know that these stories are based on real life events. Come on Amazon - bring us Season 3!!"
0,"I haven't really watched it very much, just enough to make sure it was appropriate for my 7 year old granddaughter.  She likes it very much and has watched other episodes on her mom's account."
1,Inspector Morse never disappoints.  His story leads to the inevitable conclusion without tremendously distractin complications or superhuman feats of strength.  Lewis always plays his part as his sidekick and together they make an umbeatable team.
1,I just recently bought and viewed this series and it is great.  Each episode is a treat itself with a strange mystery occuring and there is an underlying mystery in the town and for the lead female agent. I could not stop watching once I started.
0,"I could not have been more of the thought that &#34;Well, there's an hour or so that I'll never get back...&#34;"
1,I was expecting this to be along the lines of Curse of the Golden Flower; it was better.  This is a look at warring factions during the end of the Han dynasty.  Everything was good about it.  The only thing that some people may not like is it is in Chinese with English subtitles.
1,"The fall TV schedule of 2007 was a mess due to the Writer's Strike that saw all of the script-writers withhold their services.  The effects of such a shake-up can be seen in two crucial ways during the course of this season: 1. The pacing of the early episodes; & 2. The abrupt ending when there should have been more episodes to round out the plotlines.Coming off an incredibly strong first season, this second installment of ""Friday Night Lights"" is, at least at first, markedly different from the original slate of episodes.  There is less of a focus on football and much more on just character drama in general.  For a few examples...the effect on the Taylor family of Eric's TMU job, the strange blossoming of the Landry/Tyra relationship, the struggles of Matt Ceracen, and the tumultuous Jason/Lyla/Tim triangle of friendship/love/stupidity.In fact, for the first six or so episodes of the season, very little football is seen whatsoever.  Unfortunately, this was caused by the ""wait and see"" approach because of the writers strike and thus the subplots became paramount while the show creators were biding their time.  While the show is still okay in this format, it lacks that ""football punch"" that gave it such heart in the first season.As the second season winds down, though, the episodes really start to pick up in all areas.  The somewhat cheesy and overly dramatic plotlines of the early season (Jason to Mexico, a murderer body, etc.) fade into the background and that nice football/life mix takes center stage once again.  In fact, just when you'll think things are truly back on track...the season abruptly ends in mid-stride (again, the strike).  The first episode of Season Three will go on to fill in the gaps, but that is most certainly not the prescribed way to run a dramatic series such as this one.Overall, then, while I cannot give this season a full five starts due to behind-the-scenes issues and a straying from the powerful football scenes, it is still a solid effort that succeeds in pushing storylines forward and creating some great ensemble drama.  For the first time this year, you just have to wade through a bit of unbelievability to get it."
1,"""Rome"" is almost like two different productions smashed together. One of them is a classic well-acted account of the politics and history of Rome in the days of Ceaser. The other production involves ""history of the common people"" and enough graphic sex 'n violence to get a mass audience to watch it. The first production would get five stars from me but the other would get one star. So in the end, it gets three.At the top of the production, there is an excellent cast playing out the classical story of Julius Ceaser from the point where he decided to return from Gaul to his assasination in the senate. The portrayal of Ceaser is incredible. Its really able to get across the concern about what Ceaser's intentions really are and how he is using everyone around him. The other characters in the civil war are equally well done. Pompey is rightfully portrayed as Ceaser's equal rather than a fool or a loser. The personalities of Mark Anthony and a very young Octavian perfectly set up the inevitability of what is to come. The only character whose portrayal fails is Brutus. Rather than an idealistic leading man of Rome, Brutus is written as an immature fool. The writers were obsessed with making Brutus the scorned illegitimate child of Ceaser and explaining everything about the historical character from that point of view. It doesn't work at least for me.Attached to the production is a modernistic ""everyman"" history in the form of two soldiers. They are supposed to weave into the plot to show the lives of everyday romans. But for me, it doesn't really work. They are inserted into key events in every episode in really clumsey ways. Having one of them trigger the civil war and then later be the actual father of Ceasar's child by Cleopatra is just silly. There is also an adultery plot that runs the entire season that just isn't very interesting. It would have been better to ditch the two everyman and bring in character actors for single episodes to play the roles that common people might play in the plot. Both actors are excellent though. They are actually playing far above the material they are being given.Nobody can deny that violence was a part of Roman life. Where the production gets it wrong however is when it does ""look at me"" sorts of sex and violence that don't in any real way advance the plot and are just there to draw in a certain kind of audience.The accurancy of its portrayal of ordinary Roman life is up for question anyway. The reason most productions on rome focus on the top layer of society is that we have books from the period written about those people. We don't have much as far as accounts of common rome go and all too often, archelogy combined with imagination gets substituted for solid history. And all too often, the view of sexuality in roman society is based on a couple writers who wrote tabloid style scandal material either for the political opponents of the elite or for the people in every age who consume such things.Properly edited down, ""Rome"" would be a first-class production. As it is, like most of the material funded by HBO its flawed by an attempt to draw in a bigger audience through salting in lots of sex 'n violence."
1,I was actually shocked at how funny this show is.  It's basically guys getting together with guys and talking smack like guys do.
1,"this whole show is just about too funnylove that the lines, given any other way might not be as funnybut this is sly and well done"
1,"I thought this was a great TV movie with very good acting, very realistic and not the usual US stupidity of exploding cars or Police shooting wildly hundreds of time without reloading or hurting anyone.  Very enjoyable and the good guys win every time without trying to make you feel sorry for a murderer or rapist."
1,"Undercover police dramas are not easy to watch because they require really great writing. The ultimate show would be one where the audience doesn't know who the undercover cop is. The key would be to stack the show with stars so that it would never be obvious who the cop might be, and to write the shows so that anyone could be the undercover. Dark Blue is so far away from that, thats its easy to see why it didn't last. More of a vehicle for its star, the show drops the ball from the opening scene. It's OK to watch if there's nothing else, but i wouldn't waste my time, unless you're a writer searching for the wrong way to write."
1,"This is based on a true fact of Chinese history, and John Woo, a master at film-making, has taken full advantage of computer-generated skill to present us with vast armies, flotillas of warships and - of course - one of his favorite stars, Jet Li.The film is awesome and spectacular, and no one has mastered the concept of a moving camera as well. Gone is the stationary tripod, and Woo keeps his camera hovering over and around his characters almost constantly. This is an epic winner."
1,"This is a well written, well directed, and well acted series. It is fun, witty, intelligent and does not assume its audience is ignorant. It does not rely of site gags but rather intelligence and has the audience be part of the show and not just mindless observers. I would recommend this series to anyone who truly enjoys intelligent heartwarming comedy."
1,"I bet this is the kind of show actors thumb-wrestle their agents to get into: a chance to play a different role in every episode.  Subtle writing, lurking secrets, and explosive action make even jaded viewers like me hang on.  I only wish the performances were on par with the background.  Then this merely good show could be great.Deep beneath Los Angeles, a shadowy organization uses advanced tech to reprogram human beings into whatever they need to be.  Working at once to evade the law and to get immensely rich, the Dollhouse promises the moon to anybody who can afford to pay.  What they can't promise is that they can control the implications.Series principal Eliza Dushku is an odd choice on which to hang an action drama.  The role was created for her, and it plays to her strengths, letting her be essentially vacant as the camera longingly admires her body and her fighting chops.  The show operates at its peak when the camera turns its gaze on the other actors.And what a supporting cast.  Harry Lennix, Olivia Williams, and Tamoh Penikett lead an ensemble through the kind of paces that must make Equity lawyers see dollar signs, from action to romance to comedy and back.  They are capable of so much, but the camera so loves Dushku that they get far too little face time.The story benefits from Joss Whedon's distinctive humor and eye for an off-kilter story.  But not every actor is up to Whedon's particular demands.  Fran Krantz in particular wants to overplay the humor, and winds up mugging for the camera, while Miracle Laurie, so good in the dramatic and romantic scenes, sucks laughter away like a comedy Hoover.Moreover, the show's political implication, that technology's force panders to human weakness, is good but overplayed.  At various points, different characters state the series thesis explicitly, apparently because the creators think we're too thick to put the pieces together.  Considering how subtle the story is, the moral should be equally restrained.This show will likely be remembered as one of TV's great ""Almost-Was"" moments.  Like Whedon's other lost classic, Firefly, people will talk about it in wishful tones, mourning all the missed potential.  I enjoy the show's smart intensity, but it should be so much better than it ultimately proves to be."
1,"My husband and I absolutely love In Plain Sight! We started watching it on Netflix a while ago and were super disappointed when Netflix didn't add seasons 4 and 5. Luckily, we were able to buy it on Amazon Instant Video and watch it that way! It is a good, clean show about 2 US Marshall's working in the witness protection program. It's action packed, suspenseful, and just enough drama. We have nothing but good things to say about it!"
1,THE STORY LINES ARE INTERESTING AND WELL DONE. THE ACTING IS BELEAVABLE.THE UNDERLINING STORY OF A COP IS VERY INTERESTING
1,"It took a while to get into this series, but once we were introduced to the team, it took on a life of its own. The production values are very good and the characters engaging. It is too bad that it was cancelled after the second season."
1,I have watched Dr. Who since the beginning.  When I became housebound and found it on my tablet I watched it again from the beginning.  It just gets better and better.
1,excellent. What is not to like about our Navy SEALs.  Well done by all the actors and the writers. WOW
1,This was a gift for our adult son who has been a South Park fan ever since it began.  It was on his list so he knew what it would be and was very happy to receive it.
1,I just love leverage.  it's one of my favorite shows. each season was better than the next season. to bad it was cancelled after just five seasons.
1,Packed with action adventure through time and space Dr Who rocks and will not be dissapointing through all seasons.  I'm hooked for life!!!
1,Modern day gunfighter surrounded by very articulate hillbillys with great wit and barbs between vey beleivable people.  Great fun!!! Highly entertaining
1,"History, Medical History...its great!! I learn so much from this show that I did not know, I love history and this is a fine series, I could not say enough about it."
1,I am so glad I came across this movie! There was pretty much  non-stop action from beginning to end. This movie is definitely my favorite list.
1,It was fine - not my favorite but a comic on her way up. Some of the same cliche material I hear from others but a spark if the individual world view comes to the fore.
1,I have really gotten into this series. It's very intense at times and shows the corruption that Chicago is famous for. It really gives you some insights into Obama and his minions.
1,I love this show and am so sorry that they cancelled it as soon as they did and would hope that they came out with more episodes after the fifth season ended.
1,"I don't get the almost perfect reviews of this show - have these people watched anything else ?  I'm halfway through the first season - the acting is only OK, the characters don't really gel well together and the plots are usually so ridiculous they go beyond unbelievable.  I just finished watching Mile High where at the end, with cheesy graphics they land a 747 SAFELY on the Key West 7 mile bridge. James Bond called to say this show is ridiculous.  I keep waiting for the bad guys to burst out laughing when they are 'duped', instead of falling for what's being done on them.  And most of the shows don't move around location - one was entirely filmed in a house, another was entirely filmed in a plane, etc. This isn't a bad show - it's ok, just be very weary of all the 5 star reviews which I find very odd after watching half the first season.  I love the show Burn Notice which crushes this if you are looking for something better."
1,Unrelenting rain and gloom gets hard to take but the ACTING is great and  the PLOTS are tight.  A lot of characters to keep track of over time.  A very good episodic mystery.
1,"This is a new twist on the overused Vampire, Werewolf trope by adding in a element of normalicy as the &#34;monsters&#34; attempt to adapt to life inside human society. I watched 2 seasons of the british version before trying this one. The pace is a bit faster here although the show in general is a kind of subtile slower action. Thats one of the things I actually found refreshing. The acting is fairly solid with the standout being the werewolf with social anxiety. Definately worth a look."
1,"Love this show! Not intended for kids, but if you want to. Laugh your ass off then watch this show,"
1,My kids love this show! We have a smart TV and are able to stream it. The stream was seamless... you wouldn't even know it!
1,The interaction between Bones and Booth got even better this season.  The change in other characters helped develop the series.
1,"it was a good show, the characters did their job very well. it was very entertaining.  my husband watced t, too and also found it very entertaining."
1,"A friend of mine recommended that I watch this show. I love the characters plus it has a little bit of everything, action, romance, 'smarts'..."
0,"I'm 26 but I still enjoy a lot of the teen drama shows. Vampire diaries, PLL, al or of shows on The CW. But this show is awful. It has an interesting plot but the acting is beyond bad. The only decent character is Stiles."
1,"This was a good episode. However, there are some things that just aren't fitting with everything.The first is how Mohinder is now. He couldn't hurt anyone and he suddenly changes to the attitude he has now. Unless the syrum did something to his brain this just doesn't seem like Mohinder.Second (Spoiler), seeing Hero kill Ando the way he did really didn't seem like something Hiro would do. I mean, he is told that the only way to join with the other people is to kill Ando and he doesn't back off or use any excuse. He just kills Ando. Yeah, he gets teary eyed, but still, this just doesn't seem right. Honestly, I think people needed to think harder on how to play that scene out. Unless Hero goes back in time to save Ando, doing it the way they did it is stupid. Maybe some of you guys think the same thing.Anyways, this episode was good. I give it four stars. Hopefully, we won't see a whole lot of mistakes, like we've been seeing, in future episodes.Edit: I take back what I said about Hiro, you'll see why."
1,"A great program for toddlers. Easily followed story lines, pleasant music, relatable characters, nothing that would give nightmares. The animation quality is good."
1,"Argentinean writer Guillermo Martinez has a PhD in Mathematical Logic in Buenos Aires and studied at the Mathematical Institute at Oxford University and these facts may explain the sophisticated subject matter of his novel  ' novel THE OXFORD MURDERS ('Cr&iacute;menes imperceptibles'), now adapted for the screen by Jorge Guerricaechevarr&iacute;a and &Aacute;lex de la Iglesia, who also directed the film. It is a cerebral exercise in logic and mathematical theory in addition to being a clever murder mystery heavily bent toward the thinking viewer.Martin (Elijah Wood) arrives at Oxford form his trailer house home in Arizona to study with the brilliant mathematics professor Arthur Seldom (John Hurt).  He brings little with him as he settles in with roommate Yuri Podorov (Burn Gorman) who clearly has a loathing for Seldom and for all of the great minds that have apparently stolen his solution for a theory. His elderly and physically impaired landlady Mrs. Eagleton (Anna Massey), who worked on the infamous Enigma Code that saved England in WW II, warmly accepts Martin into her home, introduces him to her daughter Beth (Julie Cox) who makes it clear that the old lady is preventing Beth from having the life of a free person, a cellist who wants more from life than confinement as a caregiver.  Martin discovers that Seldom is not available to take on new postgrad students, and Martin challenges Seldom in a large classroom as Seldom is declaring Ludwig Wittgenstein's theory that there is no real truth.  That challenge begins a bond between the two and when they individually meet at Mrs. Eagleton's home and find her murdered, Seldom shares a strange note left in his mailbox indicating the murder is the first of a series linked by a mysterious pattern. This new clue introduces the possibility of a code-guided threat of a serial killer and indeed more murders occur, each victim on the surface appearing to die of natural causes, but each paired with a message bearing a new arcane symbol. Seldom and Martin work together to break the code and to discover whether the deaths are innocent or the subtle, ""imperceptible"" homicides of a psychotic killer seeking to match wits with the great logician.  They work with the policeman Inspector Petersen (Jim Carter) and the hunt is on.  There are plenty of sidebars to lead them astray - both from the truth of the code and from personal needs: Martin becomes physically involved with Lorna (Leonor Watling) who has been Seldom's girlfriend in the past, and with Beth to no great end, and Seldom finds a suspicious father of a child in need of lung transplants.  The ending of the story is completely surprising - another code we have failed to break in the course of this intellectual thriller.Elijah Wood and John Hurt have superb screen chemistry and maintain our interest and concern throughout the film.  At times the references to theories of G&ouml;del, Heisenberg, and  Wittgenstein are discussed so rapidly that the information, so pertinent to the story, is difficult to follow.  This is a thinking person's movie, but very much well worth the effort as the performances and developments of the story are exceptional.  Grady Harp, August 10"
1,This show reminds me of little house on the prairie.It's a very high quality period comedy with some great writing.
1,I enjoyed the series. It had a good blend of story lines and kept up my interest. To bad it did not continue.
1,"great series, the casting and acting is terrific.  the &#34;yes, prime minister&#34; series is also excellent.  anyone who enjoys political satire will like these shows."
1,This is all ghost stories backed up by some wild no holds barred evidence by regular people like you and me.you will love it if not you can tell me all about it but I am not worried because it's great.
1,"I like everything about this show, but could be better with cast development.  It is just good science fiction.  Get it."
1,"In this modern day world of computers, Facebook, Tweeters ,Etc. , Imagination is slowly becoming passe.  Fantasy films are still being made with the CGI effect as a safety net but many of them have expunged the 'Once Upon A Time' otherworldly feeling one should experience becoming one with the tale. Writer/director Neil Jordan has resurrected the 'Once Upon A Time' once again by unleashing a modern day fairytale on a jaded film going audience.  He did it once before with his excellent film 'THE COMPANY OF WOLVES' and now does it with 'ONDINE' the most beautiful, mesmerizing piece of cinema released this past year. The Irish countryside is far more breathtaking than a computerized backdrop.  By combining myths with modern day alienation from human roots, Jordan spins a tale of a fisherman who is barely getting by in his small Irish town.  Separated from his wife and father to a dying little girl, his paralysed existence is shattered when one day he catches a beautiful woman in his fishing net.  While trying to separate the myth-(his little girl thinks the woman is a Selkie- a seal creature of Scottish legend) from reality, he hopelessly falls in love and cannot cope with the good fortune that comes his way.  Naturally, a big bad wolf arrives to throw a wrench in the proceedings. Colin Farrell continues to show us what a wonderful thespian he truly is and Alicia Bacheleda is intoxicating as the strange woman.  The scene stealer is Alison Barry as the little girl, Annie, who's presence is felt throughout the proceedings even when not on screen. There is nothing more shattering than a child supporting a parent based on the sheer courage and unwavering faith in the enormity of this love and gift that came from the sea.  With breathtaking photography by Christopher Doyle and an ethereal music score combining traditional Irish ballads, 'ONDINE' is a jewel among the countless remakes and sequels being unleashed on the cinema going public.  As one critic from the Minneapolis Star Tribune stated "" ONDINE is so good that it hurts"".  I couldn't have said it better myself."
1,If you like being strung along with multiple mysteries on many episodes this is for you.  I do like the cast and the ability to watch an episode every other day so the story line is fresh in my mind.
1,"Bloodletting, ruthless killing and unbridled violence are all a part of this film about power struggles between two Yakuza families, who have been played against by the chairman ( Kitamura Soichiro). He plays this game in such a way that each family will eventually destroy them selves and then he will be able to take control over them.There begins a ritual of grisly killing and disappearance of the actors on the screen who die in quick succession where there are no survivors. If grisly killings carried out by men in sharp suits is your cup of tea. Three stars 2/22/2012"
1,"LAST NIGHT is a tightly woven tale that explores the psyches of four people in one fascinating evening. This is the initial directing outing for Iranian-American writer Massy Tadjedin ('The Jacket', 'Leo') who also created the story and the script: the film is so fine that we doubtless will be hearing more about her.Joanna Reed (Keira Knightley) is a beautiful young writer married to commercial real estate developer Michael Reed (Sam Worthington) in what appears to be a happy marriage despite the struggle between two careers. Michael takes Joanna to a company party and there she observes the soft spoken Michael paying attention to one of his co-workers, the sensuous Laura (Eva Mendes), an act that Joanna feels indicates unfaithfulness or at least suspicious behavior on Michael's part. The seed of doubt is planted, Michael is leaving for a business trip to Philadelphia the next morning with his coworkers Andy (Anson Mount) and Laura, and there is friction between Joanna and Michael that Michael's reassurance cannot overcome. The next day as Joanna sops for coffee she encounters an old flame from her time spent writing in Paris - Alex Mann (Guillaume Canet) - and they agree to meet that evening. Chemistry resurges and that evening as Alex and Joanna dine with Alex's publisher Truman (Griffin Dunne), both are questioned by Truman about their past affair, Joanna admits she is now married, and Alex is in a relationship in Paris. The couple leaves and circumstances lead them to return to Joanna's apartment where they face their feelings. At the same time as this evening is developing Michael and Laura enter a seduction dance: Michael is faithful to Joanna but the emotionally bruised Laura persists in her attempt to pull Michael into her web. The manner in which each of these temptations resolves and the aftermath is the brilliance of Massy's writing and direction: this is a story written very much form a women's vantage and that fact allows each of the characters to become very well defined and credible.The quartet of actors is well matched: Knightley continues to mature as a fine actress, Sam Worthington breaks out of his stodgy shell to allow us to see a man driven by fidelity and tempted by lust, Eva Mendes takes Laura to a higher dimension of being, and Guillaume Canet is undeniably an Alex who few women could resist: he has true star power. The method of pairing the development of the one night by flashing back and forth between the progress of the two couples in the dance of seduction vs fidelity is extremely successful. This is a thinking person's movie and an introduction of a writer/director who already has shaped the beginnings of a successful career. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, June 11"
1,Season 2 is better and more exciting than Season 1.  Annie has matured in her role as well as the script.  Auggie shows more versatility as well as the other characters.  Cast is well done.
1,Another netflix show that got me to buying the seasons! I didn't think I would like it but I love it! I can't wait til the 4th season and Netflix gets that!
0,"I got the pilot episode of The Cape for free on Amazon Video on Demand. I watched it. I'll try almost anything once.Once is too much.The story is about a good cop who gets framed by the evil owner of a gigantic corporation/crime syndicate. Since he is assumed to be dead, he cannot go back to his wife or son - though, in a maudlin moment, he visits the boy while the boy is sleeping. There should have been a puppy and some kittens.At the burial service for him, the cop watches from behind a tree, about as difficult to spot as the Washington Monument in DC. Somehow, though, all the police, whom one assumes to be alert and vigilant, miss his presence.Anyway, somehow, and I really do not understand how or why, he gets involved with a circus that seems to have about six members. They seem to perform before a similar number of people. Sets are not a strong point. He performs by battling a small person (ok - dwarf) of extraordinary fighting ability and numerous tattoos.The circus is run by a large black guy whose overacting is great enough to be the converse of Keanu Reeves, if Reeves were actually trying to act. The black guy is a master magician, and he trains the ex-cop to use a cape formerly used by a now departed magician - the magic is fake, but it is allowed to seem almost real to the audience in the course of the episode. Since he used to read a comic called ""The Cape"" to his son to put him to sleep, the ex-cop assumes the identity of ""The Cape."" This might put you to sleep.The bad guy has a British accent and occasional not human eyes, and he has been committing crimes in costume, even though he is the head of a huge conglomerate. For sheer fun, one presumes. These are the crimes pinned on the ex-cop. They are designed to force ""the city"" to privatize its police force by turning it over to his corporation, which the city promptly does. Global domination to follow.The circus members are either committed to destroying the bad guy or become immediately so dedicated, and the Cape and they rob banks belonging to the corporation.The evil overlord's head henchman turns out to be the Cape's former best friend and police partner, who framed him because Mr. Evil threatened to harm his family. He is, however, not a happy henchman. In these sorts of bad movies/shows, having a family is a definite no-no.I don't know who any of the actors were, but none of them were very good, except for the little person who has some comic flair.The show is half serious and half camp/cartoon and occasionally funny. It is not a good mix, and the bad acting, silly plot and low-budget production values seal its fate. It becomes boring."
1,"This show, which I recommend watching from episode 1, season 1, has the best writing, the best characters, the best casting, and the best story I have ever seen on television. Unbelievably good. Each character fully fleshed out; you KNOW them, they are REAL."
1,"Our kids were brought up with Sesame Street and it was the best children's educational TV program around at the time.  Our kids are grown now but still remember all the characters with fondness.  Sounds like a sacrilege, but  now there are better kids educational shows that are more focused on the educational stuff and yet hold their attention better, too."
1,Interesting show that broke the mold on musical comedy on Television.  Enjoyed the singing and glad that singers with some talent were chosen.
0,"I really don't understand why this show was brought back. There are too many characters every one of them irritating, and none of them are sympathetic. There's constantly too much uproar and turmoil among them and around them as the plots are confusing and uninspiring. The leader, a doctor, is a pompous and inept person with an agenda to promote specially gifted people he calls ""alphas"" but who are generally antisocial and even dangerous unless he alone can get them to behave civily for a few moments per episode.  The special gifts are already boring--example: the close up of the ""strong man's"" arteries as he pumps up. I can't stand ""Gary"" the human fiber optic reader. He's neither engaging nor cute, never funny, just a thorn in the side of all because he's special but wait, they are all special! He don't care. He's more specialer.  Just that character alone is so annoying I don't plan to spend any more time ""with him"" watching this. This show should have vanished along with ""3 inches"", a show about a guy with telekinetic powers but could only do it as far as 3 inches. At least that had some humorous potential. This show is as interesting as some car ads. By the time it's over you've forgotten what was being advertised. I don't own this but I was requested to review the show."
1,I lot this show but then I love a great many of the British series both the comedies as well as the mysteries.  Keep them coming.
1,Enjoyed the first season and I hope there is a second.  I like the premises and hope a second season will explore more of that question. I also liked the actors as they portray the investigators who have to figure out &#34;what's going on&#34;.  This having been made more complex with the loss of one of the characters. Hmmm.....
1,"I was incredibly disappointed in season Six of 24. The reason I give this a three-star review as opposed to a two is that I think that perhaps the standards for this season to live up to were very dificult coming off of season Five, which is easily the best season of the show thus far. The plot seemed to go in far too many different directions, far too many relationships unresolved and there were far too many questions that remained unanswered. I applaud the show for being ambitious and trying different things, but there were too few moments of Jack doing what he does best and too many moments where the show felt like a long and very boring civics lesson in terms of presidential power and the transfer of it.Also the problem that seems to be facing this show right now is that Jack has little to no emotional investment anymore in CTU or in his own life. His best friends are all dead (and he's had to kill one of them himself), and his lover is practically catatonic. All he really seems to have left is the job (and his daughter), but that just doesn't seem like enough. The brains behind this great show had better find someone or something fast to get Jack to reinvest himself in emotionally or else this season could be the harbinger of doom for the Hour of Bauer's Power!!"
1,I just finished viewing the first season and i have to admit its a great costume period drama.  It does drag in some places and the acting can be a bit over the top. That being said its a solid B+ mini series.
1,"I was able to catch a sneak peak of this on HDNET before it was released in theaters. I think the reason this film wasn't received well it that they marketed it as a horror movie.....which it is not! The film it about loss and coping with that loss and in the area of showing different types of grieving I do think this film succeeds. The acting is very good and I for one like the marriage here of drama and a little horror. I can say this much, this film has some good scares and they come because the film isn't focused on ""the ghost"". It's not a perfect film, but I think this one hasn't gotten the credit it deserves."
1,My grandson ask to watches this all the time.  He is a big fan of this show.  The streaming is excellent so the picture quality and sound is clear.
1,"With the Winchesters' dad gone, they are truly on their own except for a friend or two.  All they have is each other, though I wish I could count the Impala.Some spoilers may follow.......There is an even darker tone this season, if you can imagine that, with Dean having made a literal deal with the devil to save Sam by going to hell--which he absolutely does not deserve.  There is constantly a sense of time running out, with Lilith doing awful things to our boys and to others, Dean doing some crazy things because he knows what's coming, and Sam looking at him with a blend of pity, fear, and heartbreak over his brother's horrific fate.  I won't soon forget the last few minutes of this season's final episode, and I don't want to reveal them here.Since there is a season four, I can only hope that Sam finds a way to rescue Dean.On a lighter note, the gag reel is very funny, as they always are."
1,This show is just freakin' hilarious! The interaction and relationship between all the characters will make you laugh out loud!
1,"This is one of the best seasons in my opinion because it contains the road trip episode.  There is a scene in which Mac takes Charlie to buy his first pear and Charlie eats the entire thing, sticker and all.  One of my favorite scenes of the entire show."
0,Don't waste your time with season two.  She could be fun if she wasn't so hateful inside.  Not good.  Yuck.
1,I would recommend this series to anyone wanting a new series to watch to fill in free time and also introduces new characters from Canada.
1,"I have no idea, but they did it! David Tennant is BRILLIANT! He may not be the best-looking actor in the world (so say many of my teen and twenties friends), but his talent and the character of the Doctor make him the sexiest! I think he's gorgeous! His interaction with Billie Piper is breathtaking and even though I despise chick-flicks and romance type stories, I think the love story between the Doctor and Rose is the most emotion-grabbing I have ever experienced. I hate to admit it, but I cried... more than once! and so did my hubby, and all our college aged friends!"
1,"Screen writing is excellent.  Recommend entertaining and good family viewing.  Logical results most episodes.  The better of BBC mysteries, Suchet portrays Poirot well."
1,"While this series could have been pretty interesting, the creator and directors just had to make it &#34;cutesie-pie&#34;  from the casting of Piper Perabo to the unbelievability of plot choices....right down to her little smile to the camera in the opening titles.  It all begins with the script. And that turned this possibility of greatness into a mediocre spy vs. spy episodic. It coulda been a contender!"
1,good show.
1,"In some ways, the rich are no different from the rest of us: they get sick, get hurt, and need doctors to figure out what makes them ache. ""Royal Pains: Season One"" follows the misadventures of a doctor who finds himself at their beck and call, and it has the right mix of everything -- luxurious living in the Hamptons, weird medical crises, and a fair amount of humor.Hank Lawson (Mark Feuerstein) is a successful young E.R. doctor in New York... until the day when a wealthy trustee dies because he focused on saving a dying teenager. Trying to distract him from his woes, his brother Evan (Paulo Costanzo) whisks him to an exclusive party in the Hamptons, at the palatial mansion of the reclusive, absurdly-wealthy Boris Rabanisch (Campbell Scott).Then a woman nearly dies at the party, and Hank manages to save both her and Boris' treasured privacy. As a result, he soon finds himself drafted as the new concierge doctor for the wealthy Hamptons residents, along with Evan and a physician's assistant named Divya (Reshma Shetty). And his work often brings him to see Jill Casey (Jill Flint), the administrator of a local hospital.Among the cases: breast implant disasters, an epidemic at a ""bark mitzvah,"" a mystery shark bite, a hemophiliac teenager and his ""cyberchondriac"" girlfriend, and mystery ailments afflicting a senator's son, a ballerina, a horseback rider, a restauranteur, and a bestselling illustrator. Since Hank cares more about curing people than making money, he also provides care for people who can't afford the best -- but the person who needs his help the most may also be the wealthiest.I normally can't watch medical shows -- every time I try, I develop a massive case of ""medical students' disease"" and end up having to go watch ""Psych"" instead. Fortunately, ""Royal Pains"" is relatively light on the medical gore (despite the ""flail chest"" episode) -- the biggest problem is that Hank's McGuyveresque medskills sometimes stretch credibility (he makes a microscope out of jeweler's loupes?).Despite all the deadly medical stuff, the writers also include a lot of light humor (the hot tub disaster) and fun dialogue (""She is my right hand AND my left hand, and occasionally my brain!""). But there are some heavier currents woven into the story, such as Jill's struggles to open a free clinic for the poorer people of the Hamptons. And there's a running mystery about what Boris is doing, and what his motivations might be.Feuerstein is quite likable and endearing as a kind doctor with a conscience, who cares more about curing people than for money or politics -- and the on-off romance he has with Flint is rather cute, if complicated by Jill's ex-hubby. Costanzo's bumbling Evan can be a bit annoying at times (especially in the season finale), but he does seem to be improving. And Shetty's Divya is awesome: a sharp-tongued, sharp-minded young woman who is trapped into an arranged engagement by her arrogant parents.And there are some great supporting actors as well -- Scott's elegant and mysterious Boris, Christine Ebersole's kindly but eccentric socialite, and Ezra Miller's neglected teenager Tucker (who becomes a sort of little-brother/nephew figure to Hank).""Royal Pains"" has some areas that need polishing, but the mixture of medical drama and guilty pleasure is pretty addictive stuff. Just don't make Dr. Hank detox you."
1,The story lines are not too bad and the characters are fairly interesting.  It is what would be called soft porn so that's a bit of an alert for those not quite into that kind of thing.  I find a lot of the people sad and living unfulfilled lives.  Maybe that's why they want to full them with lots of sex.  I do find that it keeps me watching to find out what is going to happen next with certain characters.
1,"Not preachy, but, family oriented.  Gives examples of family love with some morality and fun.  Recommended to families, and those looking for good story lines without worry about language issues."
1,see our season one listing ; same here ; Dave and Cody worked WELL together.  great tutorial
1,"Great season, very entertaining and well worth 10 bucks! I can't wait to get more of the past seasons I missed!"
1,"Very interesting series, but would likely only make sense if you have seen the first and second seasons. Most episodes have an independent story, but there is a larger story, a thread if you will, in the backdrop which you need to be aware of to make sense of it all.I really enjoyed watching this series and can't wait for the release of the next season on dvd."
1,"Understand, I am no fan of cop shows.  There are only three which ever held my attention, and even then, not for long:  Dragnet, due to the droll acting and script;  Car 54 Where Are You, due to the acting and humor;  Law and Order, due to the plots (though acting was good).  Else, I'd much rather spend my time on something else.Because Jeremy Renner was in this, I picked the series to watch in Amazon Prime.  I could never forget his portrayal of Jeffrey Dahmer, and wanted to see Renner play something normal, just to see how he'd act.  So, although I dislike cop shows, I watched this.This series has in it, all the above elements which made the first three listed shows, classics.  The script is lively, quirky, great ensemble characters, believable, full of good twists in the plotline, superb acting, direction and film editing great.  The music is awful, though it fits the theme of the show (way too loud, one must turn the volume down every time the screechy music plays about every 5 minutes, what a pain).Hence only four stars, instead of five.  Honestly, the music is so bad, it's hard to watch each episode.  Maybe that's why the ratings aren't what the producers wanted.  After watching three episodes, having to turn down the volume every five minutes, one doesn't want to watch; even if, the series is good.  I'm gritting out the music now, and only in the middle of watching Episode 4, while I shop in Amazon.  I'm starting to ask myself 'why keep watching', since the music is so annoyingly frequent and unduly loud, even though there are no commercials here!There is a continuing storyline, established here in the pilot.  It's a good storyline, about a hidden policing of the police.Makes you see how hard it is to be a policeman.  Makes you appreciate both sides of the job.  Pace is good, not too fast or too cop-show like, but instead focuses more on what it means to BE a policeman.  Not an action show, though there is action.  In short, for people who want real drama rather than shoot-em-ups, this series is great.The producers should resurrect it, or at least start doing cop show series of this caliber.  'The Unusuals' title is lackluster, but meaningful.  I can't think of a better title which has the same semantic range, but more panache.  Title needs more panache.  Maybe change to Spanish:  'Raros' would be an interesting title."
1,My 5 month old loves this tv show. So do I. It's extremely educational. It's one of her favorite shows to watch.
1,Gullah has familiar songs kids sing in school.  The mother father figure are very personable. The mother and father interact with the kids in song and dance
1,This is a nice Canadian show. Very good ensemble cast carry the NCIS/CSI like show.  Fans of BSG & other Syfi channel shows will see some familiar guest stars through out the seasons.
1,My little girls absolutely Love Ni Hao Ki. They both learn so much. I love the lessons she teaches especially when it comes to ren tu.
1,I just started watching Flashpoint three weeks ago when I was on 10 days bed rest. Shame on me! This is one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. I don't know how it got by me for all those years. Right from the very first minute of the very first season it rocked. I'm almost at the end of the third season and it still rocks! The Characters all click; each actor is so perfectly suited to their role. I honestly can't say one negative things about Flashpoint except that the show is no longer being made! This could have easily been a 10 year run. Anyway - well worth your time if you're into this type of genre.  Yummy stuff!
1,"The last season, wrapped everything up nicely.  Stayed true to the start and had a good end.  It was great that they did not try to just go on and on and on.  Make a good show, have a beginning and an end."
1,"At first I was not as happy with this Stargate as the others, but it still kept me interested enough to keep watching it.  It is a much darker version of Stargate, but I also think a much truer.  I loved the characters and it made me very sad that they did not continue the show."
1,"This movie is a must see and one of the best. The film had a lot of twists toward the end but kept me interested. The film uses an unfolding mystery and atmosphere to create fear. The feel of this movie is dark and foreboding throughout the film. Simple things made this movie: the desolate seaside location...the cliffs...a burlap mask... The house itself is creepy with dark corners. Dripping water, creaking floorboards added to the ominous feel of the movie. Only one scene involved gore - and the entire theater gasped when it happened. Rueda is wonderful as the tormented mother Laura. She carries this film to the end with palpable desperation. She appeared thin, and was not made up with hair and makeup which created more belief in her character. Hollywood actresses could take notes on her believability and strong performance.TOP NOTCH scrip/chills & acting  MUST SEE!!! This movie has the feel the ""The Others"" and has an ""M. Night"" twist towards the end."
1,This imaginative program offers beautiful animation mixed with fun adventures. My kids love anything that involves imagination and there is plenty of it in this program.
1,Good shows I liked this one good UFO special I would recommend it I love the History channel lots of good stuff here
1,"As many people said this show kept getting better each year.The crimes are interesting and the cast is believable and solid.The introduction of the new Character Keppler was a great move although his sudden demise due to a corrupt cop is this seasons one strained aspect. After all if the corrupt cop was going to kill his partner he would be unlikely to do it in Vegas when he's from Trenton. However that's not implausible and he was after all blackmailing Keppler. So  people do things all the time that don't make any sense even bad cops. So even a strained episode of ""CSI"" is still top rate entertainment.Overall the series was at it's peak during this season and the next.The ninth season is excellent too but long time viewers are without three of their favorite characters.  As many posters pointed out this is one of the entire series best seasons and that's true enough because it remains a fascinating show and thankfully there's no techno soundtrack like on later episodes of ""CSI New York"". (which is a great show otherwise).  And that's just another reason to enjoy this wonderful show."
1,Simply one of the best most well written TV series. I am not going to go into the allegories it is comedy and suspense with a past and a (you would think) a future. Sadly it was dropped by the networks even though I understand it had very good numbers. In all probability it was dropped by some 30 year old noodle-head the top brass thought had brains. Life: good acting great plot watch the whole two year life of the show.
1,"I fell in love with this series.  I had plans to watch an episode to see how it was, and I was hooked on the first one.  I watched the whole season in less than a week.  The characters are interesting, and the alters are pretty interesting too! Watch it...it's great!"
1,"great show with alot of laughs. the bantering between the crew is a trip. I do think alot of the stuff is made up, but isstill entertaining"
1,"There are many episodes in this series, so I pretty-much just skip through them to try to find a description of something I think I would like.  It's kind of a crap shoot as to whether you'll be entertained or not, but hey, if you're just sitting around trying to kill 20-30 minutes while you're waiting for something else to do, it's worth a shot."
1,I loved this show!  I watched the first season in sequence and then followed it w/ season 2.  This is another fine tv show that falls victim to corporate poor choices in not finding an audience to keep it on the air for more than 2 season.  Highly recommend.
1,"Good drama but it can get a little tough to watch as they deal with the bloody surgeries, etc so other than that it is a great show for me."
1,This version is more like the history of Batman.  It shows how he is developed into the hero he is and how the supporting characters factor into who he is as a person.
1,"This program is one of the best on DVDs on Amazon Prime.  Many critical reviews are available on the internet, and almost all of them gave this program either a Four Star, or Five Star rating. What else can be said?"
1,"As the third season of Prison Break begins, Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) finds himself back in prison, only this time it's a down and dirty prison in Panama ruled by the tyrannical Lechero (The Wire's Robert Wisdom).  Also sharing space with Michael are T-Bag (Robert Knepper), Bellick (Wade Williams), and Mahone (William Fichtner); while Linc (Dominic Purcell) works on the outside to get his brother free at any cost, with the assistance of a mysterious associate (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) who has her own agenda.  The third season of Prison Break manages to provide pretty much the same kinds of action, suspense, drama, and twists that fans of the series would come to expect by now; which adds up to this season being a success.  However, falling victim to the writer's strike, the third season of Prison Break ends up feeling rushed and somewhat incomplete.  At only 13 episodes, this is something to be expected, but it still comes off as noticeable nonetheless.  Flaws aside, this is still great TV to be seen, and everyone in it is in fine form as well.  All in all, the third season of Prison Break while flawed, is still enjoyable, and sets the stage for even bigger developments to follow."
1,"The early trailers for Monsters are what originally drew my attention to it, even though I knew going into it that it wasn't necessarily what said trailers implied it to be in the vein of Cloverfield.  Still, as impressive as the film winds up being given its miniscule budget, Monsters is still somewhat slightly disappointing in terms of its overall effect.  The story revolves around a pair of travelers (Whitney Able and Scoot McNairy) encountering some dangerous hazards while making a trek back to America coming from Northern Mexico.  These hazards however are of the alien mutant brand, as the film's title implies.  The immigration metaphor is a bit too-heavy handed, but it still packs a punch regardless.  The two actors perform admirably enough, even if their characters are cookie-cutter to put it mildly.  They pale in comparison to the film's main attraction though, as the monsters themselves are rarely seen, but when they are, they're definitely memorable.  Despite that though, you just can't help but think that Monsters wasn't all that it could have been.  I appreciate what it does and what it attempts to do, but the end result just feels like there's a good amount of wasted potential here too.  All in all, don't go into Monsters expecting an action-filled monster flick, but keep an open mind though and give it a chance."
1,This is a good show. I really enjoy it. It keeps you in suspense. I would recommend it to watch.
1,"great performance by Jet Li and the entire cast. the story is basically you love triangle set during chinese feudal wars. and as always, the woman is given all the blame for screwing up the &#34;brotherhood&#34;"
1,I Like this show because the story line has a lot of twists. It keeps you guessing and when they finally solve the case it's surprisingly tragic.
1,"It's hard to watch how childish people are.  How we humans get through a disaster, baffles me.  99% of the sheeple just complain and steal and complain, no one rising to the occasion, everyone yelling my brother my father my sister my children, parochial.So I don't wonder this series only lasted two seasons.  The mirror, hurts.Most poignant in the first episode is the narrow-minded mother who accuses the mayor of not knowing what it's like to have your kid 'out there', when in fact Jake is 'out there', and his dad the mayor, doesn't know if he's still alive.  But he has no luxury to think about that, to cry, to worry.But oh, that mother thinks she's supposed to yell at the mayor, to be a good mother.  Instead, she's not only a bad mother, but a bad human being, heedless of anyone but her own ego.  She obviously doesn't even care about her kids;  because if she did, she'd be trying to help, not yelling.Hope someone will redo the series, for we need to see how hypocritical, parochial and ill-prepared we are, to assemble and think through a crisis, always expecting someone else to handle it;  always uninterested in the big picture, uninterested in doing something ourselves, always ready to blame someone else, never paying attention.It was always 'cool' to pay little attention in school.  Only the bad guys run things.  To be disinterested in anything but one's narrow circle, is supposed to be a virtue.  Yeah, and this is what we get for such bad attitudes.So this series really focuses on WHY war occurs.  Dark lesson never learned.  Which you know, because the music is totally at odds with the theme of the series.  Hence only four stars."
1,I have not had a chance to view this DVD yet but it appears to be in good condition.  Thank You
1,This show is quite unique and very different. This is the type of show that is interesting on many levels.  You get to like the charaters right away-and want to know more and more about them. The stories are thought-provoking and the BEST PART are the Easy to look at stars! There is one man that is so easy to dislike...he plays his part well.  5 star rating.  Check it out ladies!  You will want to stay up to watch the next episode...trust me.
1,This season was better than season 3 which was boring as hell. Brought back  a lot of players from the first 2 seasons and got rid of a boring person from the third season. This show had good twists and a shocking ending. Wrapped everything up nicely.Overall a good series.
1,iCarly is a good show the entire family can watch; this show is enjoyed by all of the kids in my neighborhood up to about 8th grade.  The jokes are pretty funny and what I really like the most as a parent is the show doesn't cross the line like a lot of children-focused shows seem to do with being a tad risqu&eacute;.We have watched all of the episodes of this season for free via our Prime membership vs. the regular price of $24.99 for the whole season: not a bad deal!
1,Very funny. Some of the comedians were funnier than the others. We were laughing so hard the dog thought something was wrong with us
1,"I love this show and hope it comes back for a second season. The premise will be familiar to readers of paranormal romances--a woman dies unexpectedly and comes back in another form that gives her a new perspective on life, society, romance, and, ultimately, her own self.In this case, the diva that drops dead is a shallow, self-absorbed, not all that bright, but not mean, hot blond with a hot lawyer fiance. Refusing to accept death, she defiantly presses a ""return"" button while being processed in the afterlife, and whammo, she's back on earth, resuscitated in the body of a very smart, but very chubby brunette lawyer ( looks reminiscent of Delta Burke, but less kittenish).And off we go. Deb, the dead diva, has to adapt to a new reality as Lane-Bryant-clad plus-size plain Jane. She has her own personality with Jane's brain--so she has a boatload of legal know-how. And, oh oh, her fiance is now a lawyer at Jane's firm. Another female lawyer--one with a slim physique and icy demeanor and high-level ambition that contrasts with Janes's plumpness and subdued prettiness and bit of Deb-ditziness. They sometimes clash, sometimes cooperate, and they are each refining the other, which is cool to watch. Everyone is fated to learn and grow.The humor and drama are well-balanced, and it's fun to see Margaret Cho as the deadpanning snarky but capable assistant to Jane. The actor who plays Deb's fiance is very appealing and quite handsome (reminds me of the late Edward Albert when he was young with a dash of that guy who was Quentin in DARK SHADOWS, for those who remember). He effectively conveys his loss of Deb as heartrending, and his moments with Jane (where they build a friendship) are so touching and lovely, that I long for the next one where they sit together intimately.There are shades of LEGALLY BLONDE (with Deb/Jane as a sort of Elle, but with the blonde super-fashionista on the inside). Others refer to Ally McBeal, but this show seems to have a kinder heart and less cynicism than that one.The guest stars in this first season have been a hoot, including Rosie O'Donnell as a judge, Liza Minelli with Delta Burke as feuding sisters, and Paula Abdul.It may not be a ground-breaking or uberbrilliant show, but I always look forward to it and my hubby likes to watch with me, too. It's fun, it's got romance, and the actress who plays Jane/Deb is very appealing and likable, with an expressive voice and a wonderful ability to switch deftly from ditzy Deb to on-the-job Jane---and you root for her to win her cases and, we hope, get her man...back!Thumbs up."
1,best military series on TV too bad they discontinued it!!! Great acting and great story line!
1,"Great show cleaver, cute,and the girls are beautiful and engaging.Acting is good and this show has some great humorand cleaver plots"
1,My kids love learning about the animals; anyone who says this is a great show to teach kids anything other than the habits of wild animals in jungles and forests is trying to sell you something.
1,"OMG SO AMAZING. paper weights being made!!!!. and salt. and nut crackers then car doors. aaaahhhh. watching raw materials being du ped into hoppers is so fun to watch, even when not high. all the industrial music makes the viewing so much better. this is the best episode ever everrrrr."
1,"Not your standard crime fare...multiple threads in the plot require plenty of attention to the show.  It also had some unexpected, and sometimes uncomfortable, themes and twists in the stories.  Overall, the camera work and scenery was great, the characters well developed and the stories interesting."
1,"Benedict Cumberbatch seems to be everywhere these days.  The Last Enemy is engaging but, in my opinion, more because of the performances of some in the more minor roles.  Mr. Cumberbatch delivers what is in my opinion, his least impressive performance to date.  He seems to have only one facial expression and even his body movements are ridiculously exaggerated.The story line is a tad implausible but that's OK given that this is intended as dystopian fantasy.  Overwriting and overly emotive performances are the weaknesses here.  Both Cumberbatch and his leading lady spend the entire show either sulking or yelling with pretty much the same pained looks on their faces.This is not PBS' finest moment"
1,"I am so sorry this did not continue. The show had intelligence, wit, great story line and writers plus the actors really seemed to enjoy their parts.  I wish I had known it when it was on so I  could have told the producers what a great show they had on their hands. Thank you."
1,"The series came and I had a marathon Saturday watching, great stuff.  Sorry to see that it ended when it did."
1,At first I was hesitant to start watching the series because I really liked SG-1 and didn't want to be disappointed. After watching the first season I was hooked.
1,"Most of the episodes in each season of Leverage have been great ""sting"" operations that reeled you in BUT this episode The Gold Job was filled with things that only as idiot would fall for and since it challenged my common sense this (and ONLY this) episode gets 3 Stars for the producers getting lazy."
0,"Up until this episode I had not seen any of season 13 of South Park. To be honest I had kind of changed my perspective of South Park and apart from the odd chuckle, I was beginning to find the show less and less funny. I watched this episode with the hope that it would re-ignite my liking of the show and convince me to check out the full 12th season and what exists currently of season 13. Unfortunately, the episode titled ""Pinewood Derby"" simply didn't allow for that re-ignition of my liking and I'm sad to say I will not be jumping to the chance to watch the other season 13 episodes.The story focuses around what many South Park fans are constantly asking for; an episode that has Randy Marsh as the main protagonist. This episode focuses around Randy's passion for Stan to win the Pinewood Derby which they have yet to do in all the years it's run. In order to win, Randy steals a magnetic piece of the CERN super collider and conceals it in the car. They win the race and inadvertently discover warp speed which is picked up on by an alien criminal who holds earth hostage while Randy struggles to keep his secret while building a new car.I suppose a lot of what let this episode down was the absence of the other 3 boys. I have never really been a fan of the Randy Marsh character. He's good for a part in an episode, but it's been proven in the past that an episode focusing almost entirely on him simply doesn't work. The episode seems to fall flat in a number of ways. The humour didn't really get me and I only really laughed at the news report showing Randy stealing the part of the super collider, dressed as Princess Leia."
1,rick and crew transform junk into jewels they dont sugar coat the process and get results that are show pieces.
1,"In  season twoThings are still PG rated. Cleo's parents are separated and the mother is out of the show.  You finally get a little background on Rikki (where she lives and who with).  Phoebe and Claire's acting has improved (though Claire's still needs a good deal of work).The girls now seem to have increased their powers and can cause winds, lightening and snow and such. And Emma gets a new boyfriend.But this season pretty much revolves around a new girl in town named Charlotte (played by Brittney Byrnes) and she sets her love sights on Lewis.  She seems nice enough at first but soon becomes a threat to all 3 girls, which gets even worse when Charlotte herself becomes a mermaid with all 3 powers in her own possession, escalating to quite the mermaid showdown.Of seasons 1-3, this is my favorite."
1,"My wife and I enjoy almost every paranormal show on TV.  This one takes the premise seriously and, outside of some of the choices the &#34;hunters&#34; make, we found it fairly believable.  I won't list shows here we don't appreciate but this one we do..."
0,"I was really disappointed in the 3 shows i watched in this series. It was totally all speculation, made up scenarios that did not even make sense. I gave it 1star only because you can learn a little about some cultures and their history somewhat. Though I did not like it, it is free with your prime account. Perhaps take a look for yourself and decide...."
1,"A colleague asked that I view this season because there is an overlap in our specific medical interests. With heroine addiction as in other types of substance abuse, there is decreased ability in the body's immune system and infectious disease becomes more difficult to treat. I very much doubt that I would be able to accomplish what she does with interventions. There seems to be so much darkness before there can be light again . . . if  death doesn't intervene! Yes, I do understand addiction and the absolute need for intervention and treatment. Diagnosing an infectious disease process for substance abusers requires treating both conditions . . . it's the same body/mind. It was past difficult to observe that one intervention and this is certainly an accurate portrayal of the 'real' one.Recommended? That's a good question that I don't have a glib answer for . . . those considering an intervention? Substance abusers? Those interested in human behavior? Perhaps one episode if you are interested in finding a few answers to your own questions.I've viewed 'Chasing The White Dragon,' 'The Global Addiction,' 'Afghanistan: The Opium Trail,' and 'One Man's Seduction.'  If you have an interest in grower to user, 'The Global Addiction' is a 30 min overview by ABC Australia, that is well narrated and reasonably accurate.[Season 10 review]"
1,Love having the Instant View feature on Amazon.com. I have used this feature many times and will do again. Would highly recommend to friends and family.
1,"This is the first season that James the gravedigger is in. He is great to root for because he's not a great talker and he's the biggest powerhouse to play the game. He ends up with 2 idols and makes a bad move. Amanda is one of the stronger girls to play the game but she gets pretty annoying because of how smug she is. Todd is the biggest schemer and deserves to win the game more than anyone else. This season has a big twist that screws the 2 strongest players in the game, Aaron and James. Courtney is probably the weakest player ever to play to game. She starts the game at 93 lbs and ends up at 86 lbs. Jean Robert is the token jerk. Peih Gee is supper annoying and freaks out all the time and she thinks she's somehow the leader of a tribe. James' tribe is great to root for and Peih Gee's tribe is the tribe you hope loses. Jaimee and Erik are both total losers who are great for each other."
1,"My introduction to the greatest TV drama of all time, and the beginning of Walt's downfall. &#34;Crazy Handful of Nothin&#34; is the episode that hooked me, with one of the coolest  Heisenberg moments ever!"
1,"[SPOILER ALERT] I really liked this film. Well, until the last 10 minutes. The end was flimsy and sort of a let down, which is why I'm giving it only 3 stars. It seemed...rushed, perhaps, or, that it was the only ending that could be crammed in the last few minutes. During the movie, the curmudgeon, Arlen, is likable. Not only that, but he dispenses fantastic wisdom throughout the movie (an indication, of course, that these are the things that the screenplay writer has been working out in his own head for years). But at the end, when Arlen tells everyone that he's never really talked to God, followed by a terse explanation that lacked any sort of sentiment at all, it made everyone feel foolish for believing in him, both the readers of his book, and the viewers of the movie. The thing about believing in God is that it's never what we think it is. God doesn't 'talk', but the things that we do, the magic that we create, the art, the beauty, that's God. We don't need a God to come down and give us an explanation of life in such a definitive way. Had Arlen said that he wrote the questions and then subsequently wrote the answers to those questions with the understanding that the arrival of the answers were indeed from a higher power, the magic of the movie (and the character) would have remained alive. As it is written, it's just a schmuck who doesn't believe in anything, not himself, not God, nothing except for a woman who lies to her son because she is too weak to face reality.It's hard to remain beholden to someone who's already sort of a jerk to begin with, then to realize that he's also a liar without a lot of faith in anything, well, that just makes us dislike him altogether. It would have been better if he told the truth and said that he thought that he had written those answers without the hand of God to guide him. But when he found love, then he realized that there was actually some Divine Power out there looking after him after all. In the spirit world, nothing is as we think it should be. That's what faith is. Faith is letting go of everything and trusting that your Higher Power will guide you, whether it's God, The Universe, your Ancestors, Buddha, Jesus, whatever. It never looks like we think it will, and the writer could have capitalized off of that. The writer should have given Arlen a profound revelation, or something that would have made the movie worthwhile. In the end, a very strong movie collapsed under the weight of an insouciant narcissist who wrote a book that he didn't even care about.I think that the writer should have kept the magic alive. He obviously wanted it to be a feel-good movie or else there would never have been the love story. He obviously put a lot of effort into analyzing his own path. To discredit it by having his main character basically say that he's a liar and he has no excuse for it was sort of a cop-out and rendered the movie uninteresting at the end. I was totally inspired all the way through the movie, cried a few times even, but at the end, I stopped believing in the wisdom of the movie just the way that the main character did. Too bad. I would have given it 5 stars up until the last 10 minutes. Perhaps there could be a rewrite!"
1,"I continue to find a visit with keeping up appearances a delight.  Every one of these people are true professionals.  None of us would want a neightbor with hyacinth, but we love to watch others deal with her."
1,"The strength of the story alone will carry along most viewers. But to fully appreciate the tale that 'Assassins' is crafting, you have to understand the Samurai - their machinations for power, political infrastructure and shared heritage.In this period, prior to the West's forced entry into Japan via Commodore Perry, the samurai culture had just past its zenith. Peace had ruled the land for so long that the warrior class were mostly that in name alone - few had tasted real combat. Fewer still wanted it. Luxury and prestige were often chosen above stark training and an ascetic life. And the ultimate glory, to die in battle, was considered poetic by many who carried the 'daisho' (two swords), not a literal truth as in the past.Additionally, absolute loyalty without question was honored above all else. The entire structure of governance was based on this concept, and without it, chaos would ensue.So when an unspeakably horrific monster, born into the family of the Shogunate (the warrior ruling class), was about to be promoted as the Shogun's primary advisor - it was inconceivable that the retainers would do anything to rid themselves of this human cancer; not without bringing terrible shame and dishonor to themselves and their families. And, by default, destabilizing the very structure of their existence and potentially plunging the country back into civil war.The question is, and the crux of this film, what do you do?Borrowing heavily from the true story of 'The Forty-Seven Ronin' - very special men, old school samurai if you will, would take on the task of killing this living demon in human form.Viewers have to understand that assassination of a superior was considered the penultimate evil in samurai culture. It would be akin to combining the modern crimes of betraying your country, raping your sister, and cannibalizing a small child - all wrapped up into one wholly unforgivable sin. So to choose the path of assassination... well, you can only imagine the unbelievable burden being placed on their shoulders.If you can assimilate the contradiction of finding honor in committing the dishonorable - then this film will be infinitely more powerful and enjoyable.That said, I found the film a bit formulaic. While likely 'new' to many in the west, these dramas have been a cultural mainstay for the Japanese since the first katana raised in front of movie cameras. Annual Taiga productions are clearly the standard by which to measure the story, with Kurosawa as the foundation onto which all like stories are visually expressed.Overall - enjoyable, but not superior. I would encourage viewers to invest time and funds in other productions. See Wikipedia under 'Taiga Drama"".[Edited 6.12.11] Learned something new about this production that I feel truly adds to the wonderful characterizations in this film. During the battle, the comical character whom the Twelve meet in the mountains is mortally wounded, a wakizashi thrown by the ""demon"" stabbing him in the throat. Yet, after the battle, he later appears unhurt; commenting how sad he was that the fun was over and happily trotting off back to the mountain.I had ascribed the scene as some kind of medically-explanable freak event. However, an Amazon Discussion reveals a much deeper insight into the film and Japanese culture itself.In fact, what we're witnessing is the physical embodiment of a 'Tengu' - a type of spirit or demon. It appears there are two types, falling into the basic categories of good and evil. Obviously the imp is a good version of this creature. And even more specifically, he appears to have taken the form of a 'Yamabushi' - an ascetic mountain warrior.Wikipedia cites a tale which must have been the inspiration for this character: ""According to a legend in the 18th-century Kaidan Toshiotoko, a tengu took the form of a yamabushi and faithfully served the abbot of a Zen monastery until the man guessed his attendant's true form."""
1,"It started out really good, with the military killing zombies, and one being bitten and accidentally goes to the strip club. There are some smokin' hot naked girls stripping and most of them get bitten and turn into 'Zombie Strippers' They like it because it inhances their performance. Soon, they must stop the flesh-eating strippers or everyone will die! I didn't like the idea of the zombie strippers talking, I like the quiet zombies. If you love zombies and naked women, you'll love ZOMBIE STRIPPERS!!!"
0,NO ONE smiles in this series...at least not the first couple of episodes.We could only watch two episodes...just too excruciatingly boring and grinding.
0,"Not having any prior knowledge of Watchmen I thought this would be fun to watch.  The ""motion comic"" concept is cool and i liked it all the way up to the part where the women speak.  Apparently they only have one narrator.  Multiple narrators would make this much better."
1,"I loved the doctor, the widow, and the wardrobe episode and the mini episodes(prequels). I watched the mini episodes on the bbc website since one of them isn't available on amazon :("
1,"I took a while to git in the swing of the story.  When me got into it we liked it good enough to order the rest of the seasons. The acting is very good, the writing is good also but it jumps around a lot."
1,"Warehouse 13 is like a cheesy detective novel. Once in awhile you want to curl up and get lost in Travis McGee sort of world and escape to an impossible place, but a place that draws you into its possibilities and a make believe world.This is Warehouse 13, a cheesy sci-fi that requires a suspension of reality so you can float away into a pleasant escape."
1,I really enjoyed this movie.  Dame Judi Dench is one of my favorite movie stars.  She is fantastic in all of her movies and she always picks the movie she wishes to be in as an actor.
1,"both my 2 and 6 yr old cannot have enough of it, they are big fans and enjoyed this season."
1,Put together well. I use it to sleep =) Very informative but how are you supposed to know what's true and what's made up?
1,"We got to see the darkness that lurks in Charlie come very close to the surface in this season. When his friend asks him in the early part of the show, ""What do you want, Charlie?"" and says, just standing there with his arms at his sides, "" A peaceful soul."" I knew that this show would not disappoint me.I miss this show. I look at what is on these days and the best I can say, while pretty good (Burn Notice, Lie to Me, Doctor Who), they all lack the dark whimsy that was a vital part of Crewes' journey."
1,"We started watching this series recently, we will watch one right at the end of the evening, funny way to end the day.  Well written and makes you laugh out loud.  We really do enjoy a good laugh from this show."
1,I enjoyed the first season until the last episode.  What is it with following the 'GOD' signal through the Universe?  I thought this series was about seeing the 'GODS' as false and that the ancients were the ones really go all this 'GOD' work.  I can see why this series was canceled.  Maybe sense they set the stage for this to be revisited in 2014.  I can see where they talk able the each part of the journey being needed before the next step is taken.  This is a very Buddhist approach to a journey.  I hope the movie where they re-visit this in 2014 improves the story line.
1,"An entertaining series ahead of the vampire craze, too bad the writers strike put an end to it.  Loved Jason Dohring as Josef  and Alex O'Loughlin's Mick was fascinating to watch.  I think the American accent came much easier to him than his co-star Sophia Myles.  I saw her recently in a Doctor Who episode and she was much more relaxed with that accent."
1,I have enjoyed this series for many years.
1,"As I was watching the &#34;Suits&#34;, I realized that  a whole lot of magical thinking was going on.  The characters are likeable - it didn't matter.  A soft landing at the end of the day."
1,"I gave Rome a 4 star rating because the drama,historic value and a somewhat perspective of the rise and fall of the roman empire. the morals or lack there of was depicted in the series"
1,"I discovered this series after watching Robson Green play a clinical psychologist who explores the twisted psyches of serial killers on another police drama titledWire in the Blood - Complete First Season. Green certainly has a knack for portraying rather eccentric characters. In ""Touching Evil"", Green plays DI Dave Creegan who is assigned to the OSC (Organized and Serial Crime unit). After surviving a gunshot wound to the head, Creegan discovers a unique ability to get into the criminal mind. Creegan is assisted by DI Susan Taylor (Nicola Walker) and several others.Season 2 has three episodes:A Pupil of Murder - a reporter named Laney seems to have first dibs on the crimes of a serial killer who takes the hair of his victims as trophies. When the police catch up with the killer, Creegan's impulsive act results in a tragedy. However, even with the suspect in custody, the crime spree continues, and DI Taylor may be next on the list.The Caregiver - An ex-soldier is haunted by his experiences during the Bosnia War. He resorts to killing those who served with him, in a desperate attempt to erase those horrific memories.What Price a Child - Creegan gets intimately involved with a suspect in a child abduction case. Children go missing, and the police step up their efforts, focusing on several powerful men who are part of an international pedophilia ring. Meanwhile, Hawkins, father of a murdered victim from episode one has vengeance on his mind, and his target is not the killer, but DI Creegan whom he blames for the death of his beloved daughter. Trouble is, Creegan's own children may be targets too.Touching Evil is a gritty crime drama, and well worth watching for fans of the genre."
1,"I've often wondered what happened to Sharon Gless after ""Cagney and Lacy"".  Now I know, she's still appearing in top notch serials.Now if Hulu would start running old ""Cagney and Lacy"" episodes."
1,an interesting plot line.  How everyone reacts is interesting and makes you think what you would do in a massive disaster.Hope nothing like this happens but it makes you think.
1,"Three middle-aged women from L.A. begin a new life in the Midwest after their plane makes an unexpected stop. To their delight, Melanie (Valerie Bertinelli), Joy (Jane Leeves) and Victoria (Wendie Malick) discover they're considered beautiful and in demand by the locals, and as they're all at crossroads in their lives, they decide to stay.They rent a spacious home that comes with a bonus - a  live-in caretaker (played by Betty White). The elderly Elka, a smart-talking Ohio native, clashes with the trio every step of the way. A undeniable bond is formed, however, and clearly visible whenever things get tough.Notable guest stars include Carl Reiner as Elka's boyfriend Max and Wayne Knight (Newman on Seinfeld) as a nerdy neighbor with a crush on Melanie.Although Season 1 only has 10 episodes, this DVD set includes several extras, such as bloopers, cast interviews and a full version of Victoria's infamous ""Lady Pants""  commercial. Viewers are surely in for lots of laughs."
1,My Daughter loves Caillou. It's one of the few programs I let her watch. When the weather turns nice we'll spend as much time as possible outside but till then this is a winner for young children.

1,the credits with the song are just great have to pull up jimmy durante singing it oftem on the web. Lionel is such a stodgy pickle you just want to swat him some
1,"This is an excellent movie.  It is not the ""chucky"" horror flick, it is heavy duty drama which in its own way is a ""horror flick"".  The actors were excellent and the story good.  It's story that fringes on true horror. The evil intentions of one in authority manipulating the innocent towards the destruction of their own soul; by committing atrocious vile acts against others.  I gave this movie five stars for the extremely talented Actors, Director and Writer of this film. I had almost forgotten what a really good movie was..."
1,"I must say I am pleasantly suprised that this film was not the all out gore driven blood bath that we might have expected from Takashi Miike. Instead we are treated to a sumptuously crafted movie made in the tradition of the classic Japanese samurai films. Homage and honor has been meticulously given by Miike in a very respectful way. The first half of this film is beautifully shot, acted and executed. It's textures and wonderful, and the production values are top notch. Yes once the hour long battle begins it never goes in the direction of something like Kill Bill or Shogun Assassin with spraying blood, gore and body parts. Instead there is a lot of very harsh violence that feels authentic, while actual blood is sparse. There are a couple of rolling heads here and there, but it's not the brutal, bloody gruesome violence that we have seen in films like Ichi the Killer. In fact for Takashi Miike this is pretty tame for certain. And to his credit Miike left out the gore and fountains of blood Lady Snowblood would have left in her path for something much more believable. I loved this film, and it's a very good example of how good Takashi Miike can be a solid classic movie making. A must see!"
1,Blue's Clues is a wonderfully engaging show for pre-schoolers. There's an educational theme to each half hour show and the host involves the viewers in the fun and games.
1,An English detective series very well written and a fine cast of actors. Most of the shows will keep your interest as you don't know the culprit till the end.
0,"The reboot of Battlestar Galactica was ultimately a failure.  It is most unfortunate because the elements of greatness were there.  The overarching story was a good one and I was interesting in individual plot lines throughout.  The chief problem was characterization.More and more often as the series progressed, characters were written to do things both against their previous nature and against all common sense.  Both of the Adamas became simply laughable with over-acting the norm and erratic -- unbalanced? -- behavior expected.  I wouldn't trust Bill Adama to rearrange my silverware drawer, much less command a ship.  His always-to-excess drinking alone would have disqualified him from command, a trait shared by way too many of his crew.Mary McDonnell was the series best actor and I wanted to like Laura Roslin.  While a better leader than Bill Adama, she was also ultimately unworthy of my trust.  So, too, was I pulling for Kara Thrace and I really came to enjoy her portrayal by Katee Sackhoff.  Ultimately, I have no freaking idea who and what she was and could muster litter care.  And that was the problem in a nutshell with the series.I just ultimately didn't care whether or not they found earth or survived or lost to the Cylons.  The characters on balance were not very likable and were certainly unworthy of my admiration.  I said in another review of the series -- season 3? -- that the humans were so lacking in worthy quality that it might be better for humanity to be wiped away.  Ultimately, I think that the only character I really would have trusted was Athena and overall, I liked the Cylons more than the humans.  I realize that Ron Moore was trying to create a story where the lines were blurred as to which side should have been seen as the heroes and that is admirable.  It sadly just wasn't executed well.  When you simply stop caring about the characters and a need to finish what you started rather than a burning desire to know what happens in the story drives you forward episode-to-episode, you know a story has gone off the rails.I bet -- I even hope -- that the concept of Battlestar Galactic will be picked up again in a couple of decades.  There is a good story to be told.  It just wasn't this one."
1,I really enjoy this show. The ideas the writers come up with related to the artifacts seem endless. The actors work very well with each other and have great chemistry. I'm glad I can sit down and watch the whole season and not have to wait with the cliff hanger ending to find out what happens at the end. I guess Amazon is o thank for that. Love my Amazon prime.
1,"Great episodes.  Can't wait to see volume 2 when it comes out end of May.  Hopefully, they do not eliminate this show."
1,"Who was Damian Lewis anyhow?  W O W what a dynamic character as Detective Charlie Crews in the TV series &#34;Live.&#34;  NBC really dropped the ball by letting this series go with only two seasons.  NBC blames the 2007-2008 Writers Guild strike by cutting the first season to only 11 episodes.  NBC started the second season on Monday then flipped it to Friday, back to Monday, then back to Friday and eventually to Wednesdays I think.  I loved it but I couldn't find it most of the time.  There are 21 episodes for the second and sadly last season of &#34;LIFE.&#34;  Regardless, we have an albeit short first season but it is a block buster.  LIFE is a show that should have been a multi-season series.  NBC was harassed by idiot reviewers who couldn't see through their thick glassed windows having been scratched by watching too much TV for their prior reviews.  LIFE is and will always be a classic.  Damian Lewis and Sarah Shahi has a 'pop your eyes out' magnetic on screen performances.  The best recurring actor was Garret Dillahunt as Roman Nevikov.  Roman is the greatest hope for a TV nemesis ever.  Introduced in the first season, you will find him back in full force in season two.  They did wrap up the series successfully in season two.  When the final episode &#34;One&#34; aired April 8, 2009, the music was remarkable.  Thankfully, I had the episode recorded so I could identify the songs. Soon, I learned that the DVDs and all future airings of the last episode would never have the original songs.  Today, when you watch the last episode &#34;One&#34; you will find the ending flat due to the ridiculous faux pas of NBCs license for the songs. None-the-less, LIFE is a spectacular &#34;32-episode&#34; series that will always be in the hearts of viewers who worked hard to find it."
1,"Season 1 of ""30 Rock"" was a landmark of television, if you ask me. Finally a sitcom that was original, refreshing, and, most of all, hilarious. When Season 2 began, my expectations were high. To say that my expectations were surpassed would be an understatement of grand proportions.Whereas the plotlines and randomly vanishing characters (any one of Rachel Dratch's appearances???) in Season 1 were out of left-field in that funny-but-almost-too-random kind of way, Season 2 was a different kind of animal.""30 Rock"" season 2 came from left-field, but this time, it pulled you over there with it. In the beginning, it held onto some of the pitfalls of Season 1 (i.e., Where was Jenna half the time???), but as episodes aired, the ensemble and the writing both grew into something much greater and more entertaining than Season 1 ever reached.Even as many shows suffocated and failed the hiatus the writer's strike brought, ""30 Rock"" seemed immune. In fact, I would be so bold as to suggest the break fueled the creativity. Either those last handful of episodes were pure, unadulterated brilliance, or I was just desperate for more ""30 Rock"" after their lengthy sabbatical.Some brilliant moments in Season 2: Carrie Fisher as a crazy ex-writer, EVERYTHING involving the Devon (Will Arnett) vs. Jack rivalry (including the Don Geiss coma), Jack's job at Homeland Security (can you say, ""gay bomb""?), & Kenneth's House Party AND a special appearance by Al Gore satiring himself (""A whale is in trouble!"") in one episode? Oh HECK yeah.All in all, ""30 Rock""'s sophomore season was a brilliant display that proved that comedy can be even better the second time around."
1,"I really like the music, concepts and the colors. The imaginative creators and producers always have a positive message to convey. I find this show to be good for 2 to 4 year olds. DJ Lance and his crew Rock....."
1,both my sons loved it. Very good story lines with music and fun stuff appropriate for the kids. I wish they had more than 4 seasons.
1,"- A convenience store clerk, just rescued: ""You're a superhero! What do they call you?""- Vince Faraday: ""The Cape.""- Clerk: ""The Cape?"" (pauses) ""Well, you'll work on it.""After the ultimately disappointing HEROES bit NBC in the tuchus, the peacock network gets back in the saddle with THE CAPE, yet another superhero franchise. It's an old trope that fuels this series: a righteous man drawing a line in the sand, making a stand in a corrupt town. As Palm City festers, we run into Vince Faraday (David Lyons), dedicated police sergeant who loves his family, especially his young boy. When Faraday is framed and presumed dead, he's instead taken in by the Carnival of Crime and learns some very interesting skills. Out for a reckoning, Faraday assumes the identity of his son's favorite comic book character, the Cape. And off he goes, rarin' to clean up the town. But, nah, he's not ready. Meanwhile, power-mad billionaire Peter Fleming - a.k.a. the crime lord Chess - launches the world's inaugural private metropolitan police force, thus strengthening Chess's stranglehold on Palm City.In watching the pilot, we're instantly aware of the tone, which is dark and oppressive and very serious. Thankfully, Keith David's presence - as the bombastic showman Max Malini who becomes Vince's instructor - lightens the mood some, and Vince himself is a bit of a wiseacre. The circus community inhabiting Max Malini's Show of Fantastic Oddities and Amazements - and, interestingly, these carnies are also professional bank robbers - goes a long way into keeping me invested in the series because, frankly, Vince's story arc projects down a tired, beaten path. His relationship with his son is so earnestly executed it's hard to muffle all bouts of yawns and eye-rollings.Costumes and gangster freaks people the screen, lending the show a heightened and stylized look. In the first two episodes, we meet Chess who isn't shy about sporting a mask and has those glowing reptilian peepers. A smuggler henchman called Scales appropriately features scaly skin. We soon glom onto a secret society of assassins calling itself Tarot, a French member of which has soon poisoned the Cape. At this stage Vince's rogues gallery looks pretty promising.The superhero elements stay within the frame of reality. No aliens from blown up planets and no magic words. Instead, we get sleight-of-hand and hi-tech gadgets and circus props and loads and loads of training. THE CAPE owes more to Batman or Mantis than to Superman or Shazam. I like the hook, that thing which distinguishes the Cape from other crimefighters. It's as if Houdini had become a superhero. It's neat that Vince Faraday gets mentored by circus freaks in the ways of martial arts, mentalism, and illusion casting. Max Malini promises Vince: ""There are 37 vanishing illusions that use a cape. You will master them all."" And so he does. The Cape gains an ally in Orwell, once the sole blogger in the wilderness exposing Palm City's shady elements, but now providing the Cape with research and tech support. Sexy sci-fi icon Summer Glau plays the mysterious Orwell, but I can't help but note that Glau seems to specialize in abruptly-axed television shows. So I'm hoping this is where the trend breaks.There are passages which are heavy-handed and drag a bit. The characters could've also used more development. But then we get to sequences which are gratifyingly action-packed - Vince can do crazy things with his cape - and I like that Vince isn't perfect on his first time out in costume. Obviously, the Cape's showmanship is key to how successful this show is gonna be. But, for me, the best moments revolve around the circus. That's when the show is at its funniest and most interesting. Anyway, as his wife and child mourn the dearly departed Vince Faraday, will the world come to view the Cape favorably? More importantly, will the Nielsen ratings? I'm on board for now. But I said the same thing when HEROES was starting out. 3.5 out of 5 stars for THE CAPE so far, one of the stars thrown in based purely on potential."
1,This is an interesting twist on the alien invasion story.  Was looking to see what the next season was going to have.It does wrap it up but leaves it open to so much more.
1,"An exceptional series ""Lie To Me"" appeared (at least to me) mysteriously on Fox's schedule and quickly moved from an unknown quantity to one of the best shows on TV. The Blu-ray looks exceptionally good be aware that there is a signficiant amount of grain which is an intentional look for the show. The images are crisp, sharp and colorful audio sounds terrific as well. Lightman is the Sherlock Holmes of our generation.Separating lies from the truth is Dr. Cal Lightman's (Tim Roth)business. He's studied people from a variety of cultures and discovered that we have universal expressions that we use when we're telling the truth, lying or under stress. He uses these skills with his collegues at the Lightman Group to help uncover a terrorist operating on U.S. soil, who caused an explosion at a construction site which resulted in the crew being buried alive and to find out who a imprisoned serial rapist is using on the outside to continue his crime spree on the outside. In the process Lightman often alienates his own staff including Dr. Gillian Foster (Kelli Williams), his protege Ria Torres (Monica Raymund) and his own family. Knowing the truth and the tells about who is lying and why can change your life, damage your relationship with your wife, daughter and others but also save people. Once you've turned the ability on it's impossible to turn if off again making life difficult for Lightman and those around him.We get all the uncut first season episodes plus a behind-the-scenes featurette on the creation of the show featuring the show creator/producers/writers featurin plenty of clips from the first season to illustrate their point.Interestingly, the producers and cast are asked who the biggest liar is on the show....you'll be interested in the result. We also get deleted scenes from the show. The show looks quite nice in its home digital debut.Truly the only thing missing from this set are commentary tracks. These would have been nice to hear as we could have heard about the genesis of various scripts, changes that occurred between writing/shooting and the thought process of the directors/actors in the episode. Aside from that minor flaw, ""Lie to Me"" is an exceptional TV show."
1,My 3 yr old loves this show! It is both entertaining and educational. The variety of animals that they teach about is great.
1,My kids love it.  Watch it almost everyday.  Good and funny.  Keeps them entertained.  Hope they get more season's on Prime.
1,"I love the haunted collector, John and his team are always compassionate and helpful when they do their investigations. I love the items that he always seems to pull out of places.....sheer history! I hope he and his team will be on for a long time to come!!!"
1,"The drama is a well acted look at London hospital before World War 1. It served people who couldn't afford private care and shows the difficult, degrading circumstances most of these people lived under. Nurses' and doctors'  lives are portrayed showing both the private & professional sides of their lives while detailing the history of the times."
1,"Character development at its best. At first  I was reluctant, not wanting even to watch episode one, season one, of this series. In spite of my reluctance, the name of the series kept on popping up in random conversations with my friends, and Netflix continued to suggest it based on my interests. I finally gave it a shot and was extremely satisfied with not only the quality of the acting, of the film (filmed in 35 mm film), but also on the strength of the story itself.Walter White, the protagonist of the series, is a high school, genius chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with Stage IIIA lung cancer. After being told that the cancer was inoperable, and sneaking a peek into his bank account, he realizes his financial situation isn't healthy at all, worse off when he is offered medical treatment costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. S*** truly hit the fan for Mr. White. With less than a year to solve his financial crisis and having to pay a bucket load of cash for his treatment, Walter White recurs to a less reputable business to ensure his family's financial situation before he lays down on his deathbed. His brother-in-law, a DEA agent, spoils hims by saying a meth-cook may make up to seven hundred grand in less than a couple of batches of methamphetamine. Being a chemistry genius, he has no problem in conjuring the most perfect, purest recipe for cooking meth. He wouldn't imagine hell would break loose while dealing with the maniacs in this dark business. He thought he would be staying within the confinement of his RV meth-lab and living his normal parallel life.At the beginning the purpose of the series was for Walter to justify the ""righteous"" act of providing for his family's future when it meant going to the dark-side of money-making by not selling, but actually making the drugs: cooking meth (a.k.a crystal meth, ice, clouds, crystal, glass, tik, catch my drift?). It felt wrong but somehow, the fact that he was desperately struggling to keep his family from falling into the brink made the illicit act seem righteous.Molecular visuals of METH.Did you know that meth has a medical use? It's used for ADHD, narcolepsy, and treatment-resistant depression.After many attempts to sell what was renown as the purest meth out there, ""the blue stuff"", Walter and Jesse (his partner, a former high school student who is known to be a mediocre meth-cook) found trench after trench, failing at their attempts to make money by selling their product, which albeit highly addictive, always seemed to fall into the wrong hands. Fail after epic-fail, they found themselves delving into the dark-world of selling drugs, not at all expecting it to be such a treacherous path. They then recur to an alternate source of selling their genius-formula by contacting a fearless and very well respected business man and drug lord, a strategy they would eventually regret.For me the series has been very enjoyable, with more than just a great story-line and more than just action-and-adventure psychological excitement. Character development was the biggest takeaway for me from this series: How a man in search of a path, once thought righteous and bittersweet, found that he, in the contrary of rejecting the darkest parts of himself as he deepened into the dark-side, embraced them--the bitter portions of darkness gone after a prolonged dose of positive reinforcement upon earning heaps of cash by selling batch after batch of meth. How the character devolves was supremely achieved by the actor, Brian Cranston, winning him the Prime Time Emmy Award for three consecutive years in 2008, 2009, and 2010.In parallel with Walter's charter development, I also admire Jesse Pinkman's (Aaron Paul) devolution into a darker creature, more menacing, less tolerant and much less merciful. If he started out as a meth-head, he slowly turned into an character of many layers, of half-patched hidden depths. After having suffered beatings, the death of his true-love, and warming up to the idea of shooting people in the face, Pinkman becomes a man to fear, a man who has seen too much and is willing to die even if it means to defend what little is left of the world he loves.At the beginning of each episode, I was a little bothered by knowing I would have to watch so many more episodes that were fifty minutes long each, but hell, the production and quality of each one is so good that once you start watching it, you're lured into its mind-gripping world; you can't just shake it off. You'll end up watching the whole series in a matter of weeks.Season 5 is said to bring us a total of 16 episodes, divided in two parts. The first part was debuted last year, and the second part will be premiered in August 2013. It will surely be a blast as Mr. White's, Jesse's, Skyler's and Hank's future is wagered by the odds.DISCUSSION:I've asked myself many times these two questions in the midst of each episode:Could a series like this one actually increase the production of the drug ""meth"" by amateurs in their own ""RV super lab""? Or could it, in the contrary, decrease the amateur production and consumption of the drug after seeing what effects it has on peoples' lives and the appalling consequences it could have to their families?"
1,This was started as a very good show. It was on for only one season.It could have been a great show but you decide.
0,After watching the first episode I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and watch the second episode.  I made it through about 15 minutes and knew this was not for me.  It seems to be a dark mafia type show.  Some people may enjoy all the &#34;shoot them up&#34; but after watching The Glades and Justified Dar Blue just doesn't measure up.  I would not recommend it.
1,"After the first two seasons, I lost interest. The doctor was going to solve case. The show lost all appeal."
1,"The availability of these wonderful BBC series and miniseries is the reason Amazon Prime is my preferred streaming service. I found this dramatization satisfactory in every way. Dickens was so amazing in his ability to illustrate the social injustices of his time while still managing to give the reader that happy ending that we wish for, after suffering along with his protagonists the travails and mistreatments they've endured.Using the art of literature to engage the sympathies and expand the understanding of his readers, he became a major driver of social change, just as Harriet Beecher Stowe did more for the cause of abolition with the publication of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" than much of the direct political action of her day. He also shows us that people of ""property"" can live in prisons of their own making and be far less happy than those with less money.Dickens is a great reminder that ""pure"" capitalism and a class system which perpetuates it can be nearly as cruel as ""pure"" socialism (Marxism) or any form of dictatorship. Any system which prevents opportunity for all, and stifles the individual, is wrong. It's too bad our governments keep surging towards political extremes and historically have rarely reached any balance - equal economic opportunity for all, with a decent social safety net, only for those who truly need it! I would say the closest any society has come to that ideal is the United States during the 1980s and 1990s, but now we're doing what humankind always does: heading for another extreme (socialism). I wonder what Dickens would have to say about it."
1,I I like my brothers did to that was a very very very good show... All Kids like to show that ...is a very very very good show.
1,"Because its curious george. Lol he has so much fun! He has the best adventures, they may start off a little upside down but he knows how to turn it around."
0,"campy and often juvenile. actors are not believable. storyline is foolish and overplayed, could not get beyond a few episodes."
0,"Another nod to the grindhouse movies and based on a trailer in one of Robert Rodriguez's grindhouse films.  This action exploitation film has over the top horrible people doing above and beyond what you would normally expect.  There's a pedophiliac Santa Claus taking screaming children away in his car while nobody does anything, a corrupt police force that is in on the evil, an evil overlord with two violent sons who murder people wherever they go (including using a flamethrower on children on a school bus).  If you can handle the extreme violence there's a lot of tongue and cheek references and moments that take some of the edge off.  Naturally these evil people have it coming when the hobo pulls out his shotgun and goes to town on them all and we're glad to see it.  At times it feels like the scenes are more about the violence and very little about the story.  I like to think you can blend both but this doesn't always do it.  Dialogue is bad in certain place and I am not certain if that was done on purpose as a homage to the old films of the past.  Regardless I've seen better films of said genre and this was way over the top for my tastes. STORY/PLOTTING: C; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C minus to C; VIOLENCE/EXPLOITATION: B; WHEN WATCHED: end of of July 2011; OVERALL GRADE: C plus."
1,"Was unsure when I purchased the DVD what to expect.  With real joy I can say that it was worth every cent and I have already watched it several times.  The Storyline kept me interested and I loved the two main actors. (Gilmore Girls, the mother) one of my favourite series.  Anway If you are unsure then try it I think most people will be very pleased, I was.  With the extras along comes a commentary and I am watching it now and it sounds like they had a great time filming this movie.  Enjoy."
1,"Though widely-regarded as the weakest season (barring early feedback about the just-released Season Seven) of the TV series ""24"", I still found the season to be just as emotionally compelling and intense as any of the previous efforts.I will admit that, for (at least for me) the first time in show history, the late-season plot (regarding a piece of circuit board machinery) became a bit unbelievable.  Of course, all of ""24"" requires the viewer to suspend reality just a bit, but this time it seemed completely implausible that Jack Bauer would be allowed to complete his task.  Aside from that, however, this season created some very thrilling moments and acting, including (my highlights):-The introduction of some other Bauer family members (let's just say they don't share Jack's patriotism).-The ""Islamic prejudice"" storyline that mirrors the feature film ""The Siege"" in its high drama.-The acting of Vice President Noah Daniels (played by Powers Boothe), who mirrors the inspired performance of Gregory Itzin (Charles Logan) from Season Five, who also makes an appearance in this season.-The return of Jack Bauer from his detainment in China and how (or if?) he is able to transition back into normal society.As usual, the intensity of Kiefer Sutherland's Bauer as well as the ""staff"" of CTU Los Angeles turn in great performances, with special props given to James Morrison as Bill Buchanan.Thus, I cannot see where others saw this season falling short of previous efforts, as I found it to continue the ""24"" tradition of exciting plots, great acting, and mind-boggling twists and turns along the way."
1,"We have become big fans of several BBC mysteries: Inspector Lewis at the top of the list. To this we have added the Canadian production, Flashpoint. The two shows are widely different but both thoroughly enjoyable. While Inspector Lewis is about solving impossibly complicated mysteries, Flashoint is about a Toronto police tactical unit, similar to swat teams here in the US. Every episode is extremely intense: filled with quick action and the high stress/emotion that goes along with it. You can't help but get caught up in it as you watch. That said, the show is not dark like many of the BBC mysteries, just really intense. The members of the cast each get to &#34;shine&#34; in different episodes so you get to know them well. One other really good thing: unlike the BBC mysteries where each season may be made up of only a few episodes, this series has as many as ten in a single season. All the more to enjoy!"
1,Love this show......the characters- the depth and pealing back of each person involved....the fight between good and bad....the overwhelming feel of somehow things will come out ok by the end.....it's fascinating and the actors are superb ! Each episode is different and is compelling.
1,"This film is different from any other horror film I have seen. Once you get in the first 15 minutes of it, all hell breaks loose. One of the best foreign films I have witnesses this year."
1,"Love this show... Great characters and you have to LOVE Harvey! So trendy and like a great chocolate he hard on the outside with a soft and lucious center..... Love the story line and am enjoying season 2! Yay! for season three, cant wait. Great females roles also... Loving it!"
1,Liked the show but was expecting a little more.hope next season has more to offer.Will give it one more try.
1,Absolutely fabulous! The relationships between the characters keeps you wanting to know what's going to happen next. The &#34;hillbillies&#34; in this show are as conniving as any city person I've ever known.
1,"If my grandson were to rate this series, he would have given it 5 + stars - he loves it and requests it!  I find the series strangely annoying!"
1,This show is not slowing down. This is the modern cowboy without doing it cheaply. One might not believe Kentucky hillbilly crime would have more than one season's expression but this show finds a way.
1,I watched all three seasons and enjoyed all three. I like my Amazon prime membership because it allows me to watch series free and I watch them at my convenience . I always know where I stopped at.
1,"How can secrets get stolen their secrets??? So that why I didn't get it five stars, thanks for these shows"
1,"I read the other review and had to post my own.  Some good points are definatly a negative that they didn't divulge the episode listing on the set, and I'm glad it's in the other review.  Still will be happy to get this for Christmas hopefully this year.  The price for 16 episodes is not bad at all.  And at least it seems they are going in chronological order and the rest of Season 2 and hopefully a portion of Season 3 will follow next.This seems to be the norm (volumes rather than Seasons) for most DVD releases of current tv programs, wether History Channel or other stuff like Family Guy, American Dad etc.  Season 2 of AR still has 2 episodes to air in the coming days, so if they would have waited for a complete Season 2/Abreviated Season 1 set we would probably be waiting at least another 3-6 months for a release.So sounds like a good set for the money and will definatly get this along with American Pickers Volume 2 and Pawn Stars Volume 3."
1,"Don't know how my first review was lost, but I lauded this thing up one side and down the other!  Those who didn't like it ~ well to each their own, and there's no accounting for some people's tastes!"
1,Just more of the same. The show needs to be more realistic. And they should have more interaction with the local cops and with FBI. Some episodes are fairly entertaining but I would not buy the entire season.
1,I have Enjoyed all of her series very much good cast of characters and good show themes. writing is great
1,"Fun to watch, but may get a bit old if watched one after another.  Still a good watch for a evening of just wanting to kick back and not get too serious with story line."
1,This series was very well done and the actors were believable as their characters.  The series inspired me to read the book which also was enjoyable.
1,As I wrote in the review for season one.  This is a good show and the only thing I am unhappy about is that it is no longer being produced. Considering how many really bad shows are on the air I just don't understand why a good one like this fails.  Except the name and description don't sound interesting.  The show is though.
1,Wonder pets is great for young children.  It is entertaining and teaches kindness and the importance of helping others.  Also teaches children some portant facts about animals highlighted in each episode.
1,"at this time i would like to say that i am crushing like crazy on Captain Jack Harkness. i have NOT yet seen Miracle Day (it is due out on dvd tomorrow--FINGERS CROSSED!!!), but i am truly sad that the TINY MINDS of the world might let Torchwood die, without closure. i PRAY (c'mon, pray with me.) that the 50th Anniversary Doctor Who season will include Jack--it really should.John Barrowman plays Jack, and is a really lovely person--i hope nothing but happiness, for him, and everyone he loves."
1,As I said with the other seasons I love it and the actores are greatI have watched it about 10 times
1,"I don't think this season is quite as good as the first 2, but it is still good. entertaining way to spend some time."
1,The characters are excellent actors and this is an exciting series to watch.  I always look forward to the next episode.
1,I enjoy the crazy moms who really aren't aware as to who this child is they are raising. If you like to see bizarreBehavior this is the show for you.
1,"I loved the fact that this movie was 4 hrs long.It's staying on my shelf.The one flaw was the prop wash when the defending navy set off to torch the enemy ships.One would think that as much CGI was in the film, they could have done a quick erase.That being said ...I liked the 3 Kingdoms Chinese history.There wasn't a lot of wire foo which made the film more believable.You were rooting for the good guys in this movie.I have a huge respect for the cast & crew.Could you imagine filming during a monsoon with your set being washed away every few days?Yeah ... watch the specials."
1,"Casting could have been better here, as could some of the acting.  The music is nothing great either, and I don't care much for the fellow playing Henry.  The first season drags out all the business with Anne Boleyn, Catherine of Aragon, and Thomas Wolsey, also.The costumes and locations are wonderful, and there is some entertainment to be had.  Apparently the history is inaccurate, though I can't really comment on that since I am not that familiar with the era and people involved.Okay for a cheap rental, but nobody needs to purchase this."
1,"I guess the public felt this show was too dark. I may have been the only one, but I loved the show. I am glad to find the episodes on Amazon Prime and will watch them whenever I want to. I especially thought Dylan McDermott and Omari Hardwick are eye candy for the females."
1,"This is a banner series for this extraordinarily conceived and executed television series.  From its explosive opening through 24 hours of plot twists, exciting action, and devastating loss, this season is absolutely superb.  Be warned though---there's lots of unexpected killings in this season and several favorite characters are disposed of.  You just don't know what to expect from this Emmy-winning series.Kiefer Sutherland won his much deserved Best Actor emmy as Jack finds himself confronted with one impossible task after another.  The supporting cast is superb:  James Morrison as CTU director Bill Buchanan; Mary Lynn Rajskub as the neurotic but brilliant Chloe; Kim Raver as Jack's former love Audrey; William Devane as irasible Secretary of Defense; Louis Lombardi as the plump and human Edgar; Jayne Atkinson as the Homeland Security Director; Sean Astin as the pompous replacement; Peter Weller as the vicious assassin; Glenn Morshower as the stoic Aaron; Jude Ciccollella as Mike Novick; Julian Sands as the evil terrorist; and of course, Gregory Itzin and Jean Smart as the President and First Lady, who were robbed of their supporting actor Emmys, and who are just fantastic in these pivotal roles.24 is one of the best series out there and this season shows why."
1,Loved this show keeps you on your toes and always guessing till the end. The actors are not well known but they do a great job.
1,This is a favorite of mine from years past that I still enjoy.  It makes me laugh a lot and I enjoy it.  I don't really usually watch cartoons after raising my children but this a great show.
1,"Come on it's SpongeBob! I've been watching since my 16 year old was a kid, and 3 kids in it's just slapstick fun."
1,"I have never watched MTV but the advance notices on this show piqued my interest. I was hooked from Day 1. Some of the actors were already familiar from other shows (e.g. Colton Haynes from THE GATES - who played a werewolf there; Ian Bohen from earlier British work, etc.).  The show is much more than just ""boy gets bitten by werewolf"" and ""boy becomes werewolf"".  It's also a mystery as to who has done the ""original biting"" and who is the ""Alpha Wolf"". There are werewolf hunters with their own personalities and conflicts; there is depth to the characters; there is plenty of eye candy; great cliff hangers. Haynes, in particular, evolves as an interesting and conflicted character; the central character (Posey) is in love with a member of the werewolf hunters' family; a mysterious veterinarian and a hospitalized young lady who was also werewolf attacked add to the mix along with the new putative ""Alpha"" werewolf.  This show was far better than most of those on the higher rung of network and cable TV.  Can't wait for Season 2 and the DVD. An excellent ""guilty pleasure""."
1,"If you've not seen the newer Battlestar Galactica, you really should.  It is great Science Fiction.  Heck, it is just a great story, period!  This is a series best watched in &#34;binges;&#34; that is, watch an entire season in one week, preempting your normal TV viewing.  When you do that, it is much more like watching a movie, or a serial movie, than it is a TV series.  There's action, adventure, romance, war, life-or-death situations and decision, emergencies, subterfuges, blackmail, treachery, even treason!  Not to mention some of the prettiest Cylon models this side of the Galaxy.One could nitpick this little thing or that minor nuance...but hey, this is great television.  Enjoy it.One caution:  There are many scenes inappropriate for younger than 14, and more probably up to 17 or 18.  Even as an adult, I find myself keeping the remote in my hand to be able to fast forward through some of the spicier scenes.  That is the single negative critique I'd have of this series, and it is not a trivial critique.  The newer BG is NOT something to let your kids watch willy-nilly; just because the old series was PG-rated.Again, a very good show...just keep the remote handy."
1,"Each show is an intriguing tale of a strange disappearance, some solved and some leaving everyone scratching their heads.They interview family members, friends, law enforcement and main search participants and  take you through a gradual process of discovery. In my opinion, much better than a fictitious crime show."
1,"I thought this season was okay.It was still a cute romantic comedy/dramedy type of show.The problems that Gavin and Stacey faced were realistic.Although,they were handled in a ridiculous manner in some instances,it did not take anything away from the show.The last episode was a bit too predictable,but it tied in with the premise of the show and wasn't disappointing.I rated it a bit down for predictability,but then again,it is a comedy and we'll worth watching."
1,"This is an absolutely fascinating series, rich with the history of London hospital, life in the slums and tenements of the era, and an engrossing look at the development of medical advances, such as xray and anesthesia.  Highly recommended!"
1,Stumbled into this movie after watching Hansel and Gretel. I thought Gretel is a great and sexy actress and wanted to check out other movies. She is definitely hot in this movie..the story and other actors are somewhat lame and it takes dedication to watch the movie to the end. Still great scenes with Gretel..reason for the 4 stars.
1,One of the best shows I've seen in a long time! Great story line! Something I've never seen before. Love it!
1,"I love this show. It is adult-themed, witty, and hilarious to watch. It streams extremely well with all of my devices. It is free to stream if you are a prime member."
1,"This show revolves around the main character-Tara, who has multiple personalities. It takes a good actress to be able to pull this off convincingly but she does a great job.  One of her personalities is a guy and she even pulls that off.  I think this is an award winning show.  I'm disappointed it didn't last more than one season.  I highly recommend this show."
1,"My wife and I just finished watching Season 5 yesterday.  We know we're coming to the end of the line, so to speak.  If/when it ends, I hope there is something just as good.  Success like this isn't automatic.  It takes a lot of talented people - writers, producers, the backstage technical experts, and of course great actors.  This series has had it all for us."
1,"Daryl Loomis, DVD Verdict --I've seen quite a few films now where an Israeli falls in love with a Palestinian and I'm starting to get the sense that, in essence, they're all the same. It's clear from the opening moments how romance between the characters will work out and Strangers does nothing to make me question my notions of these films. It's not a bad movie by any means; the performances are strong and the story makes sense, but there's no drama here because everything they do has been played out by every other film that uses this cross-cultural matchup. Granted, it's rife with political baggage, but it seems like these films are afraid to actually approach the politics. Guy Nattiv and Erez Tadmor, the writer/director combo of Strangers, appear to try to breach those boundaries by using the Israeli attack on Lebanon, but it winds up only being used as a roadblock to their romance instead of the drama it might have had. Eventually, these films all feel like Romeo and Juliet knockoffs played during modern times, pushing aside any actual relevance for the rote progression of a romance film.Still, Strangers is a decent filmed, well made and solidly acted. Even if there's no question as to how the relationship will work out, the performances from Levo and Azabal are strong. They have good chemistry together and it's easy to root for their success, though there's no suspense in the drama to make you wonder. The story is well-filmed and there are some interesting soccer sequences that try to parallel the political struggles going on outside of Berlin, which the lovers see and deal with together, but none of it ever gels into anything substantial or all that interesting.Strangers comes to us from Zeitgeist Films in a very standard package. The anamorphic image is nothing spectacular, but is an adequate image with good detail and colors. The sound is a standard stereo mix with nothing to laud, but nothing to complain about, either. The only extra is a trailer.Strangers is a frustrating film. There's much about it that could have been great, and the setting could have made the politics behind the romance both muted by the distance from the action and more explosive for the same reason. Unfortunately, Nattiv and Tadmor cut the corners on all counts, using the national conflicts to force some personal conflict, but betraying themselves by allowing it to all be okay with a smile. In the end, it's cheap romance that, while competent in all facets, is a film I have a hard time recommending.-Full review at dvdverdict.com"
1,"I have watched this show for years but catch it by chance now to have it where I can view whenever I want is great.  I love the actors and the story line, just a great show to watch and relax."
1,Rubicon is straight out of the conspiracy theories held by those who are our most fearful and perhaps least logical citizens. It makes for sad commentary but also for greatly enjoyable viewing. So suspend disbelief and wade in you will not regret it.  Is there going to be a season two? I hope so.
1,"I've purchased the first and second season and I'm in love with the show and all the characters!BUT, my problem is now the third season is unavailable for purchase.  Please Help!!"
1,You can see your own family in this show!  Life-like situations we all face when raising and communicating with family and children.
1,"This is a totally unusual and interesting series about a business that is in the business of restoring old mechanisms of various kinds -- one of the projects was a go-cart made originally by a chain saw manufacturer -- to their original if not better luster.Another was an airbrake tester for a railroad museum that was actually used in the day to test airbrakes on trains so they would not fail on downhill grades -- truly an unusual machine.What I liked best is the variety of the restorations plus the ingenuity of even building replacement parts that are no longer available on the market.  For those folks looking for a change of pace, this is a neat series."
0,I did not enjoy this movie at all.  It was boring from beginning to end.  Not worth watching.  Pass it up.
0,"Too long to get going I did not watch it completely through to long to start up,  these are seals let me see some action"
1,Bones are the best series and if you like crime and love storys then this is the best series for you
1,"This movie angered me a little, saddened me a little, and even scared me a little, but I was interested until the end. I need closure and I have my suspicions, but I recommend for fans of stories based on real-life instances."
1,It says 'guy movie' all over....great acting and story all together. will not disappoint for action. I suggest to the hubby for movie night every couple of months
1,"Loved looking at, and hearing ""Alyssa Milano"" since the very first ""CHARMED"" episode. So, once this flick began with her name and face showing up, it was going to be a bearable agony if the story-line was not pleasing. Surprise! Actually, the only difficult part was that I wasn't her character's love interest.Easily a warming, while mildly complex romantic melodrama well filmed; crystal clear, good sound, with a theme that is ages old [boy meets girl, girl meets boys] including a tryst and a twist that places ""MY GIRLFRIEND'S BOYFRIEND"" in a category with the Olde Days' movies that ""Katherine Hepburn"", ""Spencer Tracy"", ""Cary Grant"" and ""Lauren Bacall"" made.Putting aside my personal desires, ""Alyssa Milano"" provides a much broader look into her talents and craft, tossing aside that playful youthful persona when necessary, allowing the Viewer to see the more adult maturity that is probably closer in actual realistic proximity to her physical nature. I'm not very big on Love Stories, but this is a nice one---easy on the eyes, brain and heart...  ---GBJ"
1,"Super cute cartoon right in line with Mickey Moues Clubhouse and Little Einsteins. The previous two being played over and over in our house, I didn't think we would find another that captivated her imagination. This cartoon does very well in trying to keep viewers engaged. We can watch it together and it doesn't make you crazy either. Very well done.Thank you again amazon for putting this on prime."
1,"I love this show, it is fascinating and Neil DeGrasse Tyson is an excellent host.  He makes difficult subjects easy to understand and can be very funny.  I would recommend this series to anyone.  I write down some of the names and look them up later to share the ideas with my friends."
1,"I give this season 2-3 stars but my GF says 3-4...so it gets rated 4. Yes I realize that averaging our votes would yield 3 but you gotta pick your battles :-). This was Amanda and James first seasons, two characters that will go on to be fan favorites. China made for a unique setting, not the usual beaches, and there was some exciting and original challenges. There was okay strategy and pretty interesting characters, just not the best in survivor history."
1,"Some people will say its an amazing piece of film because it wasn't a major release, but in all honesty, it was just ok.  While the graphics weren't amazing, I still found the monsters themselves to be good.  The acting was alright but I just cannot get behind the instant love story.  There was a whole lot of build up to the infected zone and very little happened with it. All of that said, it wasn't a bad movie.  It is worth a watch if nothing else."
1,so far it has not made much of an inpression on me as a sifi series hope for better soon.
1,"I love this series, it's a traditional period piece with just the right amount of happenings and social dilemma.  The actors are all great and the story line is good, you can't wait to get to the next episode despite the rather dreary circumstances of the citizens of cranford"
1,"Engaging and suspenseful crime drama. Takes place in London, has all the elements of good crime drama stories.Luther is a detective and has many typical and many unusual problems of policemen."
1,"One has to love the Brit adjectives that are new to us yanks: tidy, brilliant, genuine, crackin', etc.  This show is a hoot but only if one has closed captions."
1,"Exceptionally well presented documentation of the pathway to Auschwitz (Poland). This presents the Nazi ideology from the inception of the T-3 euthanasia program for disposing of those (ethnic Germans) who were mentally ill or suffered from other medical problems to the extermination of all peoples considered 'unworthy of life' and prisoners of war. . .  Poles, Russians and Jews. From a small pre-war barracks for Polish soldiers, it follows the path to the mass slaughter house it became during WWII. Included are multiple aspects of the killing process and how it evolved. Original architectural designs, diaries and personal interviews with both the SS and survivors accompanied by original footage (Ukrainian) and psychological profiles offers an overview of all that became Auschwitz.Video and narrative are well suited for those who prefer not to be exposed to all the sensationalism and gore often found in so many of these documentaries. Education and informative, an accurate presentation of Nazi ideology and euthanasia.The BBC series offers the opportunity for a comprehensive review of the consequences for both perpetrator and victim. For those that survived death, the path 'home' wasn't as simple as one might think. Russian POW's were suspected of being 'spies' and relegated to the Gulags of Stalin's era. Others trying to return home found themselves victims of the Russia army and perhaps worst of all, deprived of their homes and possessions without any legal recourse.  A tragic end to what is still considered one of humankind's worst nightmares."
1,The Doctor is pure nonsense and I really enjoyed it. Rose is a great addition to the show.She is great.
1,"This was a very entertaining series.  Good plots, good acting, interesting characters.  Plenty of humor to go with the crime stuff.  Even my wife liked it, and she is not a t.v. person in general.  Can't imagine watching these series on network t.v. with constant commercial breaks.  But they are great on Amazon Prime."
1,"The crazy, absurd police officers of the Reno sheriff's department return for more wild antics in season six of Reno 911!, Comedy Central's popular mockumentary-style parody of law enforcement documentary shows, most specifically COPS. In this show, comic actors play the police officers and engage in a series of improvised (and absolutely absurd) sketches using a broad outline and minimally scripted material. The cops aren't real. The situations aren't real... but the laughs are definitely real.At the beginning of season six, viewers are introduced to two new characters: Deputy Frank Rizzo (Joe Lo Truglio) and Sergeant Jack Declan (Ian Roberts), who were brought in to pick up the empty spots left by Deputy Sergeant Class II Clementine ""Clemmie"" Johnson (Wendi McLendon-Covey) and Deputy Cherisha Kimball (Mary Birdsong) after they were (supposedly) killed in the massive explosion at the end of season five. While it's easy to miss the fallen deputies, Frank and Jack are acceptable replacements who help inject new life into an aging series.Rizzo and Declan are quickly inducted into the wacky, everyday occurrences in the lives of the Reno sheriff's department. From roller-skating prostitutes and serial killers to awkward dinner parties with exes and a ""stoner Jesus,"" Reno's finest continue their eccentric adventures while refusing to shy away from ""unacceptable"" topics.As in previous seasons, the all of the characters are brought to vivid, zany life by a funny funny cast with some of the best improvisation talent on television. Lieutenant Jim Dangle (Thomas Lennon) is particularly notable as the in-the-closet head of the Reno sheriff's department. This season also features guest appearances by Rachel Harris, Scott Thompson, George Lopez, and others.This DVD set includes all 15 episodes of season six in their complete, politically incorrect and uncensored versions. The set also includes a collection of alternate and deleted scenes, hilarious extended outtakes, in-depth audio commentary from the cast members, and two profiles that introduce newcomers Deputy Frank Rizzo (Truglio) and Sergeant Jack Declan (Roberts).While much of the humor here is highly juvenile and politically incorrect, it will send viewers rolling with their sides splitting open. Some sketches are incredibly dumb, while others will leave viewers cringing or even make viewers wonder why on earth they are laughing at something so indecent or inappropriate. Reno 911! is filled with the kind of humor that will offend any and every group on the face of the planet, make proponents of politically correct humor cry, and those with weak constitutions lose their lunches.For viewers who can get past all of that, this series is absolutely hilarious. It hits nearly every taboo subject right on the head -- ranging from cultural slurs and stereotypes to highly adult content. While not every sketch is packed with laughs, each episode leaves something funny with viewers and will make them hungry for more Reno."
1,"Good and fun program, but there is just something missing.  However, after seeing Season 2, I know why in Season 1."
1,My husband and I enjoyed watching these shows after my daughter-in- law and granddaughter recommended them. I think they are watch worthy.
1,"We are watching this again, something we almost never do, because the writing, the acting...you miss so much the first time. This is easily the best written show on TV, and the acting is superb!"
1,"The series Private Practice just gets more interesting.  It is the type of series where the characters are likable and you cheer them on.  The series can go from a light hearted fun to a really tense act of terror.  Adults will enjoy this series as there is plenty of sex going on and a lot of bed partner change overs.  As new characters develop,  you are anxious to see where their stories will go."
1,still one the most talked about shows among sifi fans always has the best twist ever no explaining needed just watch this show
1,"I hate to say this, but I was not aware of how good this series is until a few weeks ago my sister-in-law told me to give it a try. I had seen the series available for purchase but never felt compelled to watch it. But with the recommendation my wife and I sat down to watch at least one episode. Holy sh...! The experience was so much better than expected that it was almost funny.The premise of the series is truly interesting. Dr. Cal Lightman is one of the world's preeminent authorities in deception detection. He studies the micro-expressions in people's faces and can determine if they are lying and what is the emotion that dominates when asked different questions. He has a company with a huge team of people that help him use these methods to help different organizations and private individuals to find the truth.The cases presented in this episode are varied and always engaging. We typically get two cases per episode, which allows the creators to blend in Lightman's sidekicks in each of these. The other thing I do which I love is illustrate the emotions characters in the series are experiencing by showing them in slow motion and then also showing still images of public figures with those same facial expressions. Many times I found myself laughing at this, and no public figure is spared.Besides the main plot lines in each episode, we also get to little by little see more about the private lives of the characters, which I always enjoy. In particular, there is a portion of the story dealing with Cal's business partner, Foster, and her marriage that gives an added level of complexity to the story. We also have ""the natural"", a young woman with a hard past that has the ability to read people before any formal training. Her relationship with Cal, her mentor, is always explosive and keeps us on our toes.The whole case does a great job with their acting. There is a significant portion of the action that has to do with facial expressions, and they are all proficient in this area. However, I do have to mention Tim Roth separately because he is truly amazing. The role of Cal fits him to a T and he is really convincing in his performance. Without him the series would not be the same.The bottom line is that this series cannot me missed. We have devoured this first season and are already a few episodes into the next one."
1,"This definitely was one of my most favorite shows, can never get enough of Stargate Atlantis, great plots, great acting, great team, except when McKay keeps wining, great effects."
1,"This film has a reflective undertow. It spends quite a long time casually making the journey to the infected zone. There is only the banter of a film-journalist and a blonde ( who he's tactfully trying to get off with) and stoic mexicans,almost taking for granted the monsters in their midst. There is deceptively good film-making going on because in other hands the script and plot would have become innane; it is more nuanced than it appears.It is a good film but my interest sagged probably because my idea of the film isn't its aims. For me, the film felt pregnant with metaphor. For example,  they are not monsters but an allegory for an inner state of mind etc....That is the film should have developed the meanings or possabilities of its reflective under-tow when the monsters appeared , but didn't. ( The female also became dumber in it )"
1,I like the group of misfit characters they have assembled as NY police detectives. The stories are good and the characters interact very well with each other. I wish there were more than one season to watch.
1,"i have loved all the sg series. it can get a little slap stick every now and then, but its still one of the great series of the last few years"
1,I liked this show and the chemistry between Adam Arkin's character and Damien Lewis.  I would have liked to have seen Damien Lewis' partner throughout the season rather than a &#34;guest&#34; fill-in temp partner.  Like Damien and Sarah's chemistry on screen.
1,"Best show for little ones. All I have to do is say Bubble Guppies and my 4 1/2 month old goes nuts, I am happy!!!"
0,I often have to watch what my child is watching and usually its entertaining but this was like torture.  It was so boring I was very glad it stopped after 4 episodes.
1,This season is a great follow up to season one.  The show continues to be fun and engaging.  I have been mini marathon viewing 2-3 episodes a day and have not gotten tired of it yet.
1,I like the people and the story I miss florida so good to see ti again.Good looking guy too
1,"I think my 2.5-3 year old mostly just likes the opening song, but he spends a lot of time watching the episodes too.  The show tries to teach some good lessons but Caillou is kind of whiny until they get to the part when they teach him the lesson."
1,Awesome show.  Season two continues to deliver everything that makes this show so great. I Highly recommend this show to Flashpoint lovers.
1,Loved this series.  We were so into watching that we had a hard time stopping.  We watched the total season one episode after another until we finished it.  Great season.
1,"There are many inconsistencies with this show, A homicide detective partnered with a coroner? His on again, off again girlfriend goes from being a nurse to the coroner's assistant, and his future partner; officially or not? This show appears to be more of a writing class of don't's than do's. Everything they teach you about writing and storytelling seems to have been thrown out the window with this show. I find myself doing something other than watching. If you're one of those people that likes to have the TV on for company and don't really need to watch it, this show is great for that. SPOILER ALERT; whoever is the least likely killer... did it! And like Clark Kent's glasses, only he and you can see it."
1,I enjoyed the show but I guess it didn't have enough viewers because I believe it was cancelled after the 1st season
1,Great show. It is also a difficult TV show to quit and do something else that I have to do. It is worth spending time to watch the entire episodes.
1,"i enjoy watching all the seasons of prison break,it is a very interesting shown,and its very different.the charactors in this show are extremly smart and different."
1,"""Law & Order"" stars Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni in 22 Season 8 episodes heavy on drama.  The scripts deal with sex crimes, their perpetrators and victims with often frank language and disturbing, emotionally provocative scenarios.  Guest stars in the eighth season include Marcia Gay Harden, Tim Daly, Blair Underwood, Bernadette Peters, Kim Delaney, and Kal Penn."
1,"""South Park season 15 is... South Park. This March, South Park s***s in your eyes, ears and mouth. South Park, season frrrp, rated Arg for Pirates, f*** you!""Oh, how many times will I head on down to South Park? Likely until the series ends. Still, these last two seasons have found my interests shift, not that I don't love the show and respect Matt and Trey as much as I always have, but priorities change and like Stan, I fear I'm getting old. There's something poetic about Stan only turning 10 and my having found this show when it started airing right as I turned 10. While I'll always follow this unique trailblazing show these last two seasons have found me picking up a lot of the episodes after initial airing due to life circumstances. Many times I forgot a new episode was on or that the new season had started. That said, when I found time to watch the episodes I enjoyed the majority of them.I will say this is a standout season from recent years. Many episodes this season follow the series' best of formulas, they aren't one-off episodes as much as they are a cumulative effort. A lot of quality ideas tossed together in a blender with some weirdness and some abstractness. You know what you have when you do that? You have yourself that classic South Park we all love. It's a shame not every episode can capture that old fresh charm the show once had but shows have to evolve and viewers change/desensitize. In the end this is a season worth owning for anyone who is still a fan or for those who possibly grew up on this more recent evolution of South Park. The purchase for those individuals is made even easier to justify given that they've included the insightful, and hilarious, documentary ""6 Days to air: The Making of South Park"". I actually think that is a highlight of this set along with the Getting Old/A$$ Burgers episodes.So what exactly are you getting yourself into with this season? Well, ""frrrp, dee derp frrrp"". But I'll break it down in a simpler fashion. 14 Uncensored (Yes Actually Uncensored this time) episodes:HUMANCENTiPADKyle doesn't know what he's signed himself up for when he agrees to iTUNES latest terms of service and user agreement. This episode perfectly mocks apple, social networking and the low budget horror film about a human centipede. Some people I know thought it missed the mark but I think they were unaware of the HC reference.FunnybotGermans create a robot that plans to take comedy to its logical extreme, global annihilation. Jimmy and Tyler Perry must save the day. To me the funniest part of the episode was Token being unable to keep a straight face at Tyler Perry. ""Oh Lor-awd!""Royal PuddingMatt and Trey have always loved Terrence, Philip and the Canadians more than their general audience. So an entire episode about mocking the Royal Wedding with Canadian characters probably didn't sit well with most American viewers. As a Canadian I likely found it more enjoyable than I imagine they did, you know what I mean, eh there buddy-guy!T.M.I.When Cartmen believes the school has posted the boys wiener sizes he freaks and lands in anger management, soon after Randy joins him and they start a riot and the form a political party with demands for the government. A simple concept that I found enjoyable, the notion that all anger management is correlated with small manhood size may have some merit.Crack Baby Athletic AssociationKyle gets roped into Cartmen's new racket of helping crack babies by making them play basketball and raking in profits. I'm told, and it seems to be a commentary on the NCAA but I don't know enough about that to say anything meaningful. I know the episode all started from wanting to mock those commercials with the sad Sarah McLachlan song and I now know that Slash may or may not be real, but he is definitely a feeling in your heart.City SushiButters is diagnosed with multiple personality disorder and the City Wok guy deals with new competition in town (and within himself). I found the idea of Butters being diagnosed MPD for playing pretend to be funny, then the idea that his therapist is the real sick person really topped it off nicely. I wonder, do younger fans appreciate the Psycho reference at the end as much as older ones? I liked it.You're Getting Old (1)Stand turns 10 and everything looks and sounds like crap to him. This episode, as mentioned, sparked a great deal of interest in the show again. Leaving off on a potential cliffhanger and actual serious moment like the show had never really seen. This episode will hit so close to home with many fans of the series, it sums up not just the majority of thoughts on the series itself, but a true aspect of growing up.Ass Burgers (2)Stan's negative attitude might be the result of a mild form of autism. Meanwhile Cartmen and Kyle start selling burgers of a special variety. This episode was hilarious. ""If there really were a social developmental disease you wouldn't call it ass burgers, that's, that's just mean"". Unfortunately for me this episode is funny and comes up with a resolution to the last episode that seems fitting but the continuing storyline will end here. The answer to all life's problems seems to be becoming an alcoholic.The Last of the MeheecansA game turns Butters into the last Meheecan (or Mexican). Cartmen becomes a boarder patrol guard as Butters travels to Mexico and a lot of the stupidity regarding the hysteria over illegal immigration is mocked.Bass to MouthA new gossip website is posting about the students at South Park elementary. The funniest thing here is that nobody cares until a post effects them and then they are all on board. Also nice to see Lemmiwinks return to take down his rival Wikileaks.Broadway Bro DownRandy learns the secret rewards of taking you wife to a musical and decides to write his own. A good episode that satirizes the Broadway scene, or 'Brod Way' in this case. All this is obviously on account of Matt and Trey's huge success with their own broadway hit, The Book of Mormon. It's fun to see the guys get to satirize something you know they've been wanting to.History Channel ThanksgivingA history channel documentary leads the boys astray in regards to Thanksgiving and Natalie Portman's wormhole must be opened. A nice satirizing of how pointless and speculative the supposed history channel has become and the movie Thor among other things. This was a good episode that is sure to become a Thanksgiving classic.1%Cartmen's screw ups in phys. ed wind up finding all the other students being punished for his failings. Then they all gang up against him. A relevant episode that satirized and mocked the whole OWS movement in a classic South Park fashion.Poor KidKenny's parents get taken away for shouting loudly and Cartmen doesn't know who to rip on for being poor anymore. Mysterion makes a welcome appearance and the concept of parents not being allowed to parent anymore is well explored. This was a well done finale for the season and if the giant reptilian bird at the end through some for a loop, think back to the agnostic foster parents speech.So there you have it. I think some people have stopped caring about the show as much after Comedy Central seemed to castrate it by foolishly censoring the 200&201 episodes last season, even on DVD/Blu-ray. I still and always will have a soft spot for this series. I may not keep up with the new episodes like I used to but it doesn't seem the show is going away just yet (3 more seasons) and I can always catch up on Blu-ray if I start missing the episodes altogether. I do hope that when the show does end Matt and Trey will find a way to give it a fitting end, obviously not a resolution exactly (there can't be one to a series like this) but something hilarious or shocking enough that it encapsulates the true spirit of the series. There would be no Animation Domination without this series. As much as people can say this series was possible only because of the Simpsons opening the door, none of the recent animated comedies would have been possible without South Park being the first ones to really push the boundaries, break down some more doors and punch some people in the face. This series truly founded adult oriented animated series'.I'll be buying this season because I loved the getting old episode and enjoyed most of the others in this batch. I always enjoy Matt and Trey's mini-commentaries. Then there is the great documentary I've already discussed which is included as a special feature along with behind the scenes of City Sushi and some deleted scenes. I felt slightly compelled by Stan and others getting old who see everything as crap to give this season only 4 stars. But in re-watching it before this review I have to say it is a marked improvement over other recent years with only the usual debatable misstep or two. The second half is especially solid.I opened with a rephrased quote from the season and another one seems to fit adequately in regards to my purchasing decision, lol:""Is this season worth owning? It's the boys from South Park in... whatever, you'll pay to go see it, f*** you, coming March something. Derp-dee derp frrrp."""
1,"Such as &#34;What happened to the cornerstone of the White House?&#34; Brad Meltzer sends out a team of three investigators to find answers to the episode's question. The shtick of the program is a cross between Mission: Impossible and Charlie's Angels. The three investigators are given the assignment by Brad, who contacts them only via telephone. Unlike Charlie Townsend, you do see Brad, but his interaction with the team is from afar only. As with similar programs (PBS's History Detectives, for example), what you see and learn during the journey to the answer is often (for me, at least) more interesting that the answer itself."
1,"I couldn't believe when they said they were going to crowd source the funding for this movie. But they actually did it and then some. my wife and I have always loved the series, and couldn't believe that they stopped it like they did., a la deadwood, pushing daisies, Fire Fly etc. anyway we loved the movie, we didn't see it in the movie theater, but we have Amazon prime and were able to rent it for 4 bucks....What a great deal. They left the ending so it almost looks like they could do another movie, which would be great!"
1,"Nice wrap up to the ""Michael going on his own"" mini-adventure. Reestablishes the relationship among all the staff. A great funny episode with just the right combination of seriousness and levity. A must have."
1,"Always fun to watch, never too improbable.  Keep it on your list fo sho mo, dont take a no and go!"
1,"This show is based around a  Long Island divorcee who, needs to make ends meet, she can't even pay for her divorce. So she gets a job as a therapist for a professional football team. Her career begins to take off when athletes, musicians, politicians and other celebrities start to request her tough love therapy. She must learn to balance her new career with being a single mother.Very good show. I thought it would be some drama blindside thing, but I really really liked it. It has humor and a woman struggling with her husband's infidelity. She is one tough lady though, she goes head to head with these guys who gives her a hard time, she holds her own. I have to say when I first heard about the series I thought it was based on the actually movie with the same title, but it's not so if you know what movie I'm talking about it's not based on that.PS: as a female I have to say T.K and Nico are hot."
1,"The movie starts out with a movie projectionist reading about the lost colony of Roanoke. Then the power goes off. When he investigates he finds empty clothes where people should be. There are eerie shadows and he too disappears. Hayden Christensen wakes up and finds the city in a similar state, with clothes, but missing bodies. 3 days later (apparently he was unable to walk out of the city in that time, Christensen is walking around the city in the dark scrounging batteries for flashlights (HEY! TRY THE STORES!) and discovering the city has been hit by a discriminating EMF that effects car batteries but not dry cells. He is not yet ready to embrace the dark side of the force.In the midst of it all he finds a bar with the lights still on (own generator) and decides he needs a bracer. People start to congregate at the bar one at a time. Outside, when your light goes out, computer generated blackness quickly swarms around you to eerie music. Sunlight becomes a thing of the past as Detroit becomes Dark City. Apparently these are not the people who know how to set the city on fire every Halloween.The characters discuss tons of reasons why this is happening and the best one was that God/ the universe hit the ""reset"" button and they are the stragglers."
1,This guy is so funny. The writers are excellent! IT's non-stop entertainment. Only he can be high-brown and uhm very low-brow at the same time. love it. Can't stop watching.
1,"This is a not a good film in any sense. But it is a good film within its genre. Its pure violent pulp exploitation with no pretensions and in many respects its the purity of the concept which elevates it to something more than it would otherwise be. Its kind of like the old Sergio Leone westerns or something like the original Beastmaster or Road House or the first Boondock Saints.The film had its start as a phony trailer in an earlier bigger film. The trailer was a funny two-minute joke. But they managed to make it work for real as a film.A nameless hobo gets off a train in a new town with dreams of buying a lawnmower to start a business. But the streets are out of control and the hobo is forced to clean up the town on his own. The town is run by a violent goof named ""Drake"" and his two sons...one of whom looks like he stepped out of old Tom Cruise film like Risky Business. The villians are really easy to hate. The hobo is a no-nonsense hero.The film is slightly different than the old ""Death Wish"" formula because there is a clear wealth and class subtext to it. Most vigilante films feature middle class or rich victims taking revenge on psychotic criminals. But ""Hobo"" is about a man at the very bottom taking revenge on a corrupt system run by the wealthy and powerful who exist beyond the reach of any law. Going after the ""bumfights"" guy, going after the rich goof (Drake) and going after the idiot sons of the rich goof are all powerful concepts.And like all exploitation films, we get things that just don't make a bit of sense. Two Junior Iron men eventually show up with no particular explaination. But its so goofy, it works.The only thing that I have against it is that its too violent. Its in the nature of explotation, but I think the material was good enough that they could have done without it. An edited version would probably run on cable forever.The acting is 10x better than it has any right to be. Rutger Hauer was perfect for the role and delivers (as usual) a really solid performance in a third-rate role. This is not award winning acting, but its a role that some people would sleepwalk through (but he did not).Most homaige films are derivative and so tied to the source material that they can't ever even be as good as what they are swiping. But this film was better than the original films.Again, this isn't a work of art. But its honest to what it is and it was well done within the parameters of what it is."
1,"The plot was great and Bruce Payne was outstanding -- he was new to me.The story has some interesting twists and a surprising ending.  I stayed put for the duration, not wanting to miss a single second.  There were a couple of moments when the acting was slightly disappointing, but they were minor in comparison to the enjoyable time I had watching the movie.  I recommend it!"
1,Love this show. I found I had to keep watching and watching to see what would happen.Looking for the next season soon.
1,"Dr. Peter Van Dorn (Greg Bayan) has developed a nirvana drug for the brain that he is testing on live subjects. The FDA has shut him down. Meanwhile there are weird murders going on in town and Peter's daughter (Elizabeth Shevock) is being bullied by a cheerleader (Sarah East). A dumb doughnut eating cop (Joe Hansard) is investigating the whole thing.The film has high camp value. The dialouge is far better than the delivery. Initially the movie uses camera angles so you don't see the killer, but after a few kills they show the killer which most of us have figured out. In an effort to cover up the bad acting, worse special effects are used.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Campy Sexual situations. Watch at your own risk."
0,"I initially watched this movie because the general storyline seemed to hold some promise. Once started I continued to watch the movie hoping that eventually something would happen that would pull it all together; I was, however, doomed to disappointment as nothing ever came to its rescue. The movie just plods along with darkness threatening and people disappearing with no effort at an explanation or resolution.It has an interesting premise where people disappear and leave clothes, shoes, glasses, jewelry and false teeth behind but the implementation of that premise is a sorry disappointment, the devil is in the details. One keeps hoping that some sort of reason will be revealed but that never happens. The problem, whatever it might be, involves not only 7th Street but all of Detroit.As a Christian I see the resemblance to the Christian doctrine of the Rapture of the Church but whereas this doctrine has a cause and an explanation and is fundamentally good; the disappearance of those in the movie is never explained and is represented as fearful, threatening and evil.When the movie stops the story is continuing but the movie isn't; that's sort of a relief really, one has the feeling whew, it's finally over. This is definitely one I suggest watching before you buy; I'm quite sure I'll never watch it again."
1,"all the characters are developed immediately which makes this an interesting series from the get go.This is a better series than some of the other super hero series on TV. Plenty of believe-ability, yet,those super powers come to the rescue ..... OK for teens and most pre-teens."
1,"I found I got caught up in it, while I don't like some of the characters finding out what is in the storage units is fun. I like the part after the bidding when they open the units.  I have learned about some of the items and had no idea.  I know people who lost storage units and I think of them each time I watch wondering if I am going to see their stuff.  I tried the Texas version and them I could not get into at all."
1,"I would have given this season 5 stars, but overall I'm a bit tired of the direction Moffat has taken this series and the Doctor. Although this season had some stellar episodes, the mediocre episodes were really bad and not worth buying. Not sure I will purchase the next season on amazon, I'm hopeful I will be able to catch them on BBC America. Season 7 will definitely be what makes or breaks me from my continued viewing of the program."
0,Did not care for the story line.  The series was too far out to be realistic.  Just not my kind of movie.
1,"This is the best price I have found, I do check all the places and always come to my trusty amazon."
1,"Have seen a lot worse, and a lot better. This is one of those SciFi Saturday Specials that falls in between; not quite a pile of crap - but a far cry from the smelliest pile that's ever been produced.What I would have appreciated was primer, something a lot more clear than what's provided to us at the beginning of the film. So that's what I'm going to do for you here. If the premise sounds ridiculous - it is. So you need to make up your mind as to watching it based on the primer itself.Ready?Okay here it is: For some unknown reason an alien enemy has decided that it needs to destroy mankind. Now, normally that would be via war or invasion. But in this case the aliens have decided to use a manufacturing plant that pumps out humans converted into zombies.These zombies are very difficult to kill, very strong, and come equipped with their own arm pike/blade/pick-axe. Their mission is to destroy humanity, and those that somehow survive their initial rabid assaults, are then pulled back to the manufacturing plant for conversion to new zombies.Got that so far?So when this first happened mankind was nearly destroyed. But with one last ditch all-or-nothing supreme effort - humanity fought back and won a stalemate by burying the manufacturing plant and sealing it off.We now jump ahead a few thousand years. The previous global destruction bought about vast changes in civilization and (importantly) most of what happened before the aliens attacked has been forgotten; mankind has rebuilt themselves to a version of the world circa 1915 - a time when we are literally reliving World War I. Trench warfare, doughboys, kaiser inspired troops, gas attacks, etc, etc. A few notable differences are that the world is run by corporations not governments and they have steam powered flying ships.Got that?Okay, so during this continuous corporate battle for resources - battle troops accidentally release the seal holding back the zombie manufacturing plant and then all hell breaks loose - literally.Again on the verge of being wiped out - a small band of heroes sets off to end the threat once and for all, led ostensibly by a monk/priest of the old order. The same ones who led the battle against the aliens the last time. They are the only remaining believers - the rest of world, especially the corporations, think they're quaint ridiculous religious nuts. But they held onto the records from the last battle and are the only ones who have the secret to ridding themselves of the zombie machine.That's your primer. Now it's on you to decide whether or not you want to watch the film.I will add this - the director seems to have borrowed much from the same team that brought about the Angelina Jolie film ""Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow"" in that much of the film is digitally created with real actors working against a green screen. But that's not a bad thing. The CGI driven scenes are surprisingly good and mostly believable.The storyline is an another thing altogether. I will say that Thomas Jane does a pretty bang-up job as the hard drinking, war weary veteran enlisted to stop the aliens."
1,"What a great series. If you like lawyers and always bet on the underdog then this is for you. Would love to see some more of the genius memory feats, but exceptional the way it is as well. Just a great show to watch on TV and very interesting.denzil."
1,"The characters have depth and the story lines kept my in interest.  Of course, the cast wonderful and Judy Dench is superb (as usual)!"
1,"""Ondine"" is a romantic Irish drama which stars Colin Farrell as fisherman Syracuse (or Circus as he is known by acquaintances). Syracuse is a recovering alcoholic who goes to confession and unloads his burdens to the resident priest; he is also a divorced father with a young child, Annie (Alison Barry) who is a very sick child.Syracuse's life changes in an unexpected manner when he finds an unconscious young woman in his fishing nets one day. The beautiful young lady is very evasive about her true identity, and is adamant that she does not want to be taken to the hospital or be seen by anyone, so Syracuse takes her to his home. He calls her Ondine (played by Polish actress Alicja Bachleda), and Syracuse's daughter Annie is convinced that Ondine is a selkie (a seal that can shed its skin to become human). Syracuse himself begins to believe that Ondine might be an otherworldly person when her beautiful singing nets him bountiful amounts of fish on each fishing trip. But is Ondine truly a magical creature from another world, or is she harboring some dark secret that prevents her from revealing her true identity? This forms the core of the story.The romance that develops between Syracuse and Ondine is credibly woven into the story, and is a gentle, unfolding romance. This is a movie that moves at a leisurely pace, yet does not impede the momentum of the plot. It is a gentle, ethereal story of two people - a lonely, ridiculed man fighting his own inner demons, and a lost young woman searching for a place to call home. It is also a story of an amazing young girl who retains a fierce spirit and positive outlook on life despite her physical limitations.Watching this mesmerizing Irish drama with its entrancing plot, gorgeous cinematography, and haunting soundtrack reminded me of another movie also centered on the selkie mythology, the Hallmark dramaThe Seventh Streamstarring Saffron Burrows. Oh, and I also loved the Irish animated featureThe Secret of Kells, which features Celtic mythology. Final verdict - engaging romantic drama with elements of suspense and mythology."
1,"On the one hand, when a studio bankrolls a remake or a 'reboot' in this case, I feel the need to lament the lack of creativity, the lack of original thought at work in the Hollywood studio system. Can't anyone come up with anything new and original? But when the 'reboot' is as good as ""Star Trek"", I kind of wish J.J. Abrams was at the helm of them all. His new film adds richness and depth to a once ailing mythology bringing it back to life by going back to the beginning.""Star Trek"" introduces us to Kirk (Chris Pine, ""Bottle Shock""), Spock (Zachary Quinto, TV's ""Heroes""), Bones (Karl Urban), McCoy (Simon Pegg, ""Shaun of the Dead"", ""Hot Fuzz"", ""Run, Fatboy, Run""), Sulu (John Cho, ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle""), Chekhov (Anton Yelchin, ""Alpha Dog"") and Uhuru (Zoe Saldana, ""Drumline) on the first voyage of the U.S.S. Enterprise. As this is ""Star Trek: Origins"", if you will, writers Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzmann (""Transformers"", ""Cloverfield"") and director J.J. Abrams (TV's ""Lost"" and ""Alias"", ""Mission Impossible III"", ""Cloverfield"") have taken some liberties with the timeline and stayed true to other parts of the mythology. What this mix accomplishes is to give us a fresh take on these characters, allowing us to see how they got started and how they would become what they would become.A rebellious kid, Jim Kirk (Pine) likes to race vehicles he doesn't own in his Iowa hometown. One day, he enters a bar filled with Starfleet Cadets and starts hitting on a beautiful woman. But Uhuru (Saldana) isn't interested and asks him to leave. A fight quickly develops and Kirk gets a bloody nose before Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) puts and end to the bar brawl. He sits Kirk down and explains he knows about him, about his father and challenges Kirk to join Starfleet and do better than his dad did. His dad died trying to save as many lives as possible when the U.S.S. Kelvin was under attack. The next morning, Kirk takes up the challenge and meets McCoy (Urban) a doctor who is also headed to Starfleet for training. Three years later, Kirk is taking the infamous Kobayashi Morou test again. And passes. Much to the astonishment of the test's creator, Commander Spock (Quinto), causing the two to become, at best, rivals. Just as an academic tribunal is called to investigate the charges against Kirk, Starfleet receives a distress signal from Vulcan. They quickly dispatch the recruits to new ships and eventually, everyone ends up on the Enterprise under Captain Pike's leadership. As they head out to assist the other star ships, Kirk becomes convinced they are about to enter an ambush and proves to be right. A Romulan mining vessel, led by Nero (Eric Bana, ""Hulk"", the upcoming ""Funny People"") is drilling into the core of Vulcan, causing seismic activity and he has just blown up the rest of the ships. The Enterprise takes evasive action, but Pike is soon summoned to the enemy vessel leaving Commander Spock in charge. He appoints Kirk his First Officer. The first order of business is to stop the drill and then save the Captain. But Nero proves a persistent villain and when he reveals what he really wants, everyone kicks into overdrive and start working together, becoming the team we all remember. Will Kirk and Spock learn to work together? Will everyone find their place on the Enterprise? Will this vessel staffed largely by new recruits be able to fight off the bent-on-revenge Nero?Abrams has achieved the right balance of reverence to the characters and universe of these people while taking them to new and exciting places, bringing them alive for a new generation. It's really quite remarkable work when you think about all of the other needless remakes and reboots littering the Hollywood landscape.All of the characters seem to have the trademark mannerisms of the television cast. Pine develops a telling swagger and bravado, very similar to William Shatner's portrayal of the role. More importantly, he doesn't display these mannerisms from the beginning; he grows into them as he develops the courage and bravery he will become known for. A friend saw a copy of Entertainment Weekly with Quinto as Spock on the cover sitting on my desk. ""How do you feel about them using a CGI character in this film?"" After a brief conversation, I learned he felt the character had to be CGI because he looked so similar to Leonard Nimoy's Spock, only a lot younger. I explained that an actor was playing the role and he was just amazed. Quinto was, reportedly, the first person hired for the film and he does an excellent job of making the character his own, while paying homage to Nimoy. Karl Urban seems to have a lot of fun paying the perpetually cross Dr. Bones McCoy, again adopting and paying homage to many of the character quirks DeForest Kelly used in his portrayal. Zoe Saldana is good as Uhuru. She and Kirk meet in the bar the night before they leave to join Starfleet and he continues to pine for her throughout the film. Her Uhuru is a little more fully integrated into the plot, a little more active, involving herself with Kirk and Spock. Anton Yelchin has some fun moments as the very young Chekhov. And John Cho. Well known for silly, raunchy comedies shows he may have some action chops on him. Sulu is also new to the Enterprise and has some growing pains. When Captain Pine picks Kirk and Sulu to lead a mission to stop a Romulan drilling device, they team up on a pretty terrifying and thrilling mission. And Sulu's unique skill set quickly comes in to play.And that, is your crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Wait! Who am I forgetting? Ah yes, Scotty. Scotty is played by Simon Pegg, a British comedian who stars in a series of memorable films he co-wrote and co-directed (the best is ""Shaun of the Dead"") and he is clearly having a lot of fun playing the role. At one point, he shouts James Doohan's trademark phrase ""I'm giving her all she's got"" and it's nice to hear it even if it seems drowned out by the cacophony surrounding their battle. It is also interesting to see how Scotty joins the crew as he isn't on the ship when it leaves Starfleet.Bruce Greenwood plays Captain Pine, the original commander of the new U.S.S. Enterprise. He does a good job displaying the right mixture of knowledge, leadership and mentoring to his young crew. More importantly, this is Abrams way of giving a little wink and a nod to the fact the original television series pilot was filmed with Captain Pine, not Kirk. The network didn't like it and Gene Rodenberry recast the role making William Shatner Captain Kirk. This pilot episode would eventually become the basis for a later two-part episode reusing much of the footage in flashback. An interesting move on both Rodenberry and Abrams' part.Eric Bana plays Nero, once a simple miner trying to make a life for he and his expectant wife, who is now so hell-bent on revenge, he will destroy entire planets to achieve his goal. He is good, surprisingly, and displays both the right level of menace and humanity as displayed through his reasons for wanting to extract revenge. Bana was once the next big thing and starred in a series of films, none of which ever achieved much critical praise or box office clout. He is more interesting as the villain in this film than he was as the ""Hulk"" in the version directed by Ang Lee. He is following this film with a role in ""Funny People"", the new film from Judd Apatow starring Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, Leslie Mann and Jonah Hill.And I don't think I'm spoiling anything for anyone by mentioning that Leonard Nimoy makes an appearance as Spock. It is sort of thrilling to see him return to such an iconic role. Better yet, rather than a quick cameo, his appearance plays an integral role in the plot and he has a significant amount of screen time.Perhaps best of all, none of the characters goes without creating at least one moment of levity. It is nice to see that while the material is taken very seriously, they also recognize we can have a bit of humor, to lighten up the serious nature of the story. Just a little.Abrams has created a plot involving black holes, time travel (allowing him to include Nimoy) and revenge. It is an involving, complicated story that makes good use of the characters, their mythology and their backgrounds. It's a great ride and an almost perfect film.I read an article about the making of this film and Abrams noted that when he was researching the material and watching the episodes of the television series, he noticed a lot of scenes had lens flares in front of the character's faces. This is yet another aspect Abrams chose to pay tribute to. And it is an interesting visual device the first dozen times or so. But when this continues throughout the entire film, sometimes more than once in a scene, it becomes distracting and annoying. In almost every scene, a bright light or a lens flare partially obscures at least one character's face for a few seconds before disappearing or lowering to return again. A few times, this is used as a transitional device, but more often than not, it simply becomes distracting.Despite this one annoying (and constant) distraction, Abrams and his writing team have done an amazing job of bringing life back to familiar characters and a familiar mythology that we don't have to give up just yet. I can't wait to see what they come up with for the two sequels. Can Khan be far away?"
1,I love how the Brits portray the times of Charles Dickens. All of the acting is worthy of note and all stars gave excellent performances.
1,Plots for individual episodes are average. Dynamics between the regular characters are high octane entertainment. Recurring theme of season is riveting--- who REALLY killed the people our hero was framed for. And how will they be brought to justice. And how will our hero survive all the conspiracy surrounding him in his quest to make things right?  Stayed tuned  keep watching. I will
1,It is a catchy plot line similar to The Finder. I enjoy the mind games Crews comes up with. The plots were good and kept me interested.
1,My husband likes it. It's science fiction I  personality  do not go for shows like this.  This show is on his favorite list  if I am busy he puts this on cause he knows I do not care for it. If you like science fiction you will like rhis
1,Is it a surprise that allies who should have been friendly to each other had elements on both sides that didn't like each other at all?  This is evident in the early seasons of Foyle's War as Foyle solves the crimes during the American Occupation.  The idea that the Americans and English were all devoted buddies was basic WWII propaganda and the dialogue of this show does not support that concept.  The fact that Roosevelt showed a preference for Stalin over Churchill and that Obama returned a Churchill bust that had been displayed in the White House for about half a century is an indication of the continuing distaste a reactionary element of our population still holds for our English brothers.
1,"I am still mad about them canceling Sarah Conner Chronicles. Its one of the few TV series that I really, really wanted to know what was going to happen next. The people who cancelled that series should be a;lsdk kdfjklFII!!! (its too bad for a Amazon review).Ok, so, if you haven't seen that series watch it. The second season is even better than the first.This video is animated and has graphics about the level of todays consoles (PS3/Xbox), but don't let that stop you. Its pretty good and lets cross our fingers that if the Terminator mythology is persistant enough we may see some more great content."
1,"Men and women always show their best side before marriage, but sooner or later watch out. My first wife was a paper hanger (bad checks), stayed with her 13 years. I had to declare bankruptcy twice. She was also good at covering up outstanding bills and several months rent. WHAT A WOMAN"
1,"This show is for you if you have an open mind. Some of the women you can relate to in some way or another. But some women can be a little out there. Not because they married who they did....but because some have issues. But there are some women who got it together, jobs, family they just....well like the saying goes sometimes you can't help who you fall in love with!!!!!"
1,This was super cute with n unexpected twist.  This is not a typical chick flick.  My husband actually like it.  From what I remember it was pretty sweet and clean.
1,"The 1st  season of Cranford was absolutely outstanding with complex  characters adapting to changes in their lives.  There were some oddly dumb moments, but for the most part,  it was very very  good.  I was  eager to see how the relationships played out in the next  season.  What a  huge disappointment.The Return to Cranford  is tooooooo  different.  The characters have changed,  the sets are silly,  the story is extraordinarily  STUPID.  A total waste of time and money."
1,"Movie, actors, scenery, sequences were excellent.While acknowledging it wasn't designed as a &#34;Prime Time&#34; series (sorry for the pun),  I grew very tired of the constant use of that ubiquitous &#34;F&#34; word.  History has recorded the crudeness of their vernacular, so the screaming reminders, tailored no doubt in reference to our own evolving society,  added little historical authentication or credibility.  In fact, I found it quite contradictory as most conversations were so grammatically proper."
1,"I wrote seemingly in my title because when examined from a sociological viewpoint, one begins to recognize patterns, and realizes not only are most of these stories tragedies, but all of these women who victimized were also victims themselves. Truly a national tragedy."
1,Some movies are better the second time around ...this one definitely is worth seeing twice at least. Interesting story and very good writing and acting.
1,"In unimpressive Lima, Ohio, the kids sing impressively. With Fox as its network launching pad and feeding off that AMERICAN IDOL fervor, GLEE is FAME for the 21st Century, with obvious whiffs of POPULAR and FREAKS & GEEKS. Like those shows before it, GLEE demonstrates that ""misfits and spazheads and cripples can make it, too."" Sure, the episodes tend to be silly and breezy and over-the-top. And we get that predictable high heap of teen angst and snark and we're subjected to that time-honored high school caste system and even some drawn out baby mama drama. But the joyous and sometimes sublime musical performances make everything gravy. GLEE is exuberant and fresh and drags its fans along its giddy wake. Just you beware the predatory slushy.The premise hangs on high school Spanish teacher Will Schuester taking a crack at reviving his school's woeful Glee Club, at the time a repository for the school's teen social outcasts (members include a stutterer, a fat chick, a guy in a wheelchair, etc.). The season follows the Glee Club's journey as it comes together and competes in the Sectional and Regional show choir circuits. The cast makes it all work, with particular nods to Lea Michele (really terrific as Rachel, the talented but abrasive teen diva), Matthew Morrison (the idealistic Will Schuester), and the outstanding Jane Lynch (she won an Emmy as that colossal ego, Coach Sue Sylvester). Everyone does their own singing, some of them professionally trained, some not. It's ridiculous how popular this show got so quickly, and the prestige it's gathered.Some very noteworthy performers have added their talents (or given their blessings) to GLEE. There's the episode devoted entirely to Madonna, and another that is Olivia Newton-John-centric. The sensational Kristin Chenoweth demonstrates her pipes as she guest-stars in two episodes. Neil Patrick Harris shows up as an embittered glee club alum and sings two duets with Mr. Shoe. But, really, it's all about the underdog kids who stop being underdogs the moment they belt out a tune. Their performances are amazing, many are showstoppers (and, I dunno, I think it's a particular bit of awesome whenever the big bully Puck sings). The song selections cover a wide range of genres, from Broadway to rock to rap, from contemporary and old school, Color Me Badd rubbing elbows with Journey and Kanye and Queen; and the mash-ups rock the hizzy. I think it's funny that Mr. Shoe every now and then busts it old school with a Young MC or Vanilla Ice track. So the storylines may go down like a tall drink of whatever; that didn't matter. It's all about the kids singing their hearts out, man.And because we all like making lists, here's one of my favorite performances: Rachel's ""Gives You Hell"" and ""Don't Rain On My Parade,"" Kurt & Rachel's ""Defying Gravity,"" Kristin Chenoweth's ""Maybe This Time,"" Mr. Shoe and New Directions' ""Golddigger,"" Puck's ""Sweet Caroline,"" and New Directions' ""Ride Wit Me."" And that's just off the top of my head.GLEE - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON has 22 episodes on seven discs and with impressive bonus material (but no audio commentaries):- ""Welcome to McKinley!"" - Principal Figgins conducts an amusing orientation program for the William McKinley High School (00:05:03 minutes long)- GLEE music video (""Somebody to Love"")- ""Full Length Audition Pieces"" - Rachel singing ""On My Own"" and Mercedes singing ""Respect"" from the pilot episode- ""Casting Session"" goes into the casting choices of Lea Michele, Cory Monteith, and Chris Colfer (00:11:59)- ""Deconstructing GLEE with series creator Ryan Murphy"" is self-explanatory (00:02:50)- ""Dance Boot Camp"" - Cast interviews about their undergoing dance lessons (00:03:13)- ""Jane Lynch: From A to GLEE"" - just a few of Sue Sylvester's bon mots (00:00:54 seconds)- ""Meet Jane Lynch"" (00:01:05)- ""5 Things You Don't Know About Jayma"" (00:00:41)- ""7 Things You Don't Know About Cory"" (00:01:01)- ""6 Things You Don't Know About Amber"" (00:00:59)- ""7 Things You Don't Know About Chris"" (00:00:43)- Video Diaries from 8 cast members, centering on their trip to New York to promote the show (totaling 00:17:11)- Glee Music Jukebox (musical performances from GLEE episodes)- ""GLEE Sing-Along Karaoke"" - sub-titles provided for four songs performed in GLEE: ""Alone,"" ""Somebody to Love,"" ""Keep Holding On,"" and ""Don't Stop Believin'""- ""Unleashing The Power of Madonna"" - the cast & crew reflect on Madonna's music and influence and talk about the episode ""The Power of Madonna"" which is devoted entirely to her (00:10:37)- ""Staying In Step With GLEE"" - the show's choreographers break down the dance steps to the ""Rehab"" routine (00:06:20)- ""Bite Their Style: Dress Like Your Favorite Gleek"" - the costume designers demonstrate the various wardrobes and styles worn by four of the show's  characters: Rachel, Kurt, Mercedes, Quinn (00:08:53)- ""Making of a Showstopper"" goes behind the scenes of Vocal Adrenalin's rendition of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" from the season-ending episode (00:17:22)"
1,"High profile mysteries covered by some of my favorite authors!! It is a very good show, that keeps you entertained."
1,"I was soooooo very excited once I found out about this movie, because I was completely bummed when the series ended.  The movie is awesome!  Again...  I found myself sad as the ending approached because I knew it would finally be over.  Farewell Veronica Mars...  you will be missed."
1,"When we watch this show, both kids have a blast, and I notice that it teaches kindness, gentleness, and assuming positive intentions. This is wonderful for kiddos. I love it because it's got good values woven through and my kids love it. Plus the length of programs is just right at about 15 min."
1,This show has more laughs than clowns at a circus.  Great adult humor.  Now my wife and I are both hooked.
1,"Season Four is a great return to form.What mesmerizes me is, even today, we can have a TV show without ending! Can can this be possible? If NBC did not want another season, they should warn the producers BEFORE they shot Season Four! This kind of attitude help us to never forget the obvious: the ratings are Gods. TV executives simply don't care about the quality or boldness of a show (in that sense, it was real miracle that Seinfeld survived its first season - not because it was bad, but because the ratings were very weak).We followed Earl for four seasons. We wanted to see the final destinies of the list, of Crabman, of Joy, Randy and all the fascinating recurring characters. But no, that was not to be. NBC killed it, and killed it without mercy.But why was that? I think that's because rating fell during Season Three, which was by far the worst, to the point that, in some episodes, I was wishing then to END, instead of whising they did not end, if you kown what I mean. But it was not crap by any standards, it was still above-average TV.Well, Jason Lee and Greg Garcia did their best. And it's best to finish the whole damn thing than to work with ridiculous small budgets."
1,Not bad for a BBC production. The story lines are dark and suspensful and the acting is top notch. I highly recommend this if you're into British television.
1,My son loves this show and it is so awesome to have it at my fingertips. The download is clean and starts right up.
1,"""Heroes - Season 3"" did start somewhat weak, but picked up around the middle of season. As in previous seasons, there are multiple plot threads running concurrently and it is now easier to see how many of them are interconnected due to more familiarity with the core characters.The strong collection of actors are a great asset to this series and really helped to retain viewership through the slow second season and into the beginning of season three. When the plots and scripts are good they really make this show worth watching.We enjoy watching Heroes on DVD since it gives us flexibility around our family schedules. This is a good release and the DVD extras provide some decent insight to how the episodes come together.Recommended for fans of the series.CFH"
1,"Not used to something this violent but I have to say that I have enjoyed the show.  It is sexy, well written and I am counting down the days until Season two is delivered.  So if you are unsure about this programme then take a chance on it because it is filled with interesting characters.  Do Yourself a favour and given this one a go."
1,"The Colony season one takes place in an abandoned area of L.A.  There ten volunteers must some how survive and make a new start.  They face such perils as no electricity, no running water, lack of food and threats from outsiders that will gladly steal what little they have to begin with.We watch as they use junk and mismash of parts and equipment to better thier situation and try and find ways of making things better.  We witness as they work as a group and what happens when they fight as one.  Marvel at the ingenuinuty of the volunteers and the things they do to help the others along.I never got the chance to watch this show when it was on and when I watched the second season first I had to get my hands on the first and see what they did.  I was blown away by the broad spectrum of skills and backgrounds that brought this group together.  It was not only fun to watch but learned some things along the way.  While I watched both season I have to say the first hands down cast wise was a lot better then seasons two lot.  So check out The Colony season one to see what so many other reviwers are talking about."
0,"I wanted this show to work..it has a good premise for some nail-biting moments, but the characters are all a bit ordinary. No one compelling role that drives you back to watch the next show.Quite disappointed actually. Acting not up to the usual standards of British TV and although the lead guy is decent, he is a little too low-key to work the &#34;drama&#34; in the show"
1,"This is a very entertaining show. Con games are fun to watch, and con men are usually charming, that's how they manage to fool people. But some of us feel uncomfortable cheering for the con men, so in this show the twist is that the con man is recruited by the FBI and is using his skills to assist the law, so we are free to enjoy his tricks.I have to add that Matt Bomer, the handsome gay actor who plays Neal the con man,  is not convincing as a flirtatious straight man. He doesn't seem to have any chemistry with the women he was involved with, flirts with or tries to con. I have seen gay actors play straight men with much more conviction than he does."
1,"I love how this show reminds us to appreciate the &#34;little guy,&#34; and how we take for granted a lot of the work that goes on around us.  I also like that the &#34;big guys&#34; end up seeing much more than the bottom line when they go out and mingle with their employees."
1,"Good writing and acting make this show engaging season after season.  At the end of each you wonder where it could possibly go next, and yet the writing team always pulls it off."
1,This is a great story told about a flawed man who is just trying to do what's right (most of the time).
1,"I bought it and it is on my computer... I love the ingenuity of these men and the children who went with them.  This was a great and inspirational story of survival and the continuity of life, the good life, the healthy life.  The actors expression was quite believable and I say it was very well done.  Thanks Amazon."
1,Renner in a funny cop tv show!! How did it get droppedafter only two seasons?? Gotta see it if you like off beathumor!
1,"I had never heard of this show until I saw it available on Prime, with high ratings. Now I am hooked!! I love, love, love this show! I can hardly wait to see what comes next. It is the whole package, action, drama, romance!!"
1,"Some Episodes are better then others, but some Episodes are really good I enjoyed the season opening and ending I thought really good tv which is why I gave it 5,  Sometimes I wish Seasons were shorter so they could drop the weak episodes.  but in this case the weak episodes were not unwatchable  which is why I gave those a 3, so average out a 4It does have the cliche drug war view of 'drugs are the worst thing in the world'  and 'police have to bend the rules to get results' but not so bad that it distracted from my enjoyment."
1,"Get the idea I liked this series. I think the whole production was well done. Writing, directing, acting, all of it...just loved it."
1,"I had seen various episodes of this series when it was on TV, although I hadn't seen them all, since I'm not a big TV watcher. But I liked what I saw enough to buy the series when the price was right (and with my daughters recommendation).It gets a bit violent in places, but the overall premise (and the subtle motives) of Magnus's 'path in life' keep you on your toes, wondering what will happen next.Great cast, and behind the scenes team. The camera crew is amazing."
1,This is a good season. Dean has contracted to go to Hell and they're try to find a way to keep him out. Only thing I don't like is that the shows don't play the lead-in without you having to go some work to get to see it. I enjoy the lead-ins to each episode. As far as I know this is the only season that doesn't automatically play them. Still a great show and well worth watching.
1,"I bought this dvd and 5 other seasons on the recommendation of my back doctor. So, far the first episode has been very dry and dull. The second episode picked up nicely. I am up to the fifth episode and still unsure about this show. At times, it's a series about a psychotic serial killer with morals. Other times, it's about a man who has no feelings but shows emotions like anger, frustration and fear. Oh, and there's the relationship between the main character and his damaged girlfriend. Who he feels is as damaged as he is. Now, I do hope these are not considered spoilers, as they are the central focus of the series it seems. There are more things going on in the series, such as his past relationship with his foster father, he relationship with his foster sister, his relationship with his coworkers etc. At this time, I can see the character developing into a very interesting but bizarre person. And of course the series will follow suit. We hope. After all, I have 6 seasons to watch. Can I recommend this series, sort of. I am not quite certain it is for everyone. It's growing on me though. So, I gave it three stars. Perhaps I should give it four, but time will tell.Ralph J. Fitcher."
1,I enjoyed every minute of Season one and two.  I was very sorry there was not more.  Excellent acting.  Very realistic. I enjoy the historical aspect of the show as well as the drama that was weaved in to make it very interesting.  I would definitely recommend.  A little graffic but so were the times in medicine.  Knowledge we limited and they did the best they could.
1,"The creators of The Shield introduced an even better show to Fox in the Spring of 2011, The Chicago Code. You probably never heard of it though, because in their infinite wisdom, Fox only gave the show three months. The rating weren't spectacular, but they weren't bad either. In June, The Chicago Code became part of Fox's mass cancellation, which saw Dollhouse, Lie To Me, Human Target, and Alcatraz gone in the blink of eye. It begs the question, did the Fox executives ever bother to watch these shows? The Chicago Code was well written, fast-paced, and featured a tremendous cast of new and established talent. If it had been on cable, I have no doubt that this show would still be on the air and at the top of the ratings.The Chicago Code features Jennifer Beals as Superintendent, Teresa Colvin, hired by the Chicago Mayor to help clean up the police force. Colvin has greater ambitions though, as she plans on cleaning up local government and taking on the Irish mob as well. To do this, Colvin covertly puts together a team, that has the power to choose it's own cases and make a case against their prime target, Alderman Ronin Gibbons (Delroy Lindo). Gibbons has been on the city counsel for half a century and thanks to his mob connections, he is considered to be the most powerful politician in Chicago. Everyone knows he's dirty, but the hard part is proving that in a court of law.Colvin's team is led by Detective Jarek Wysocki (Jason Clarke), who has a scarred past, that has led him to his own unique and chaotic way of doing things. Wysocki is paired with a young, ambitious, clean cut college boy, Caleb Evers (Matt Lauria), who tries to keep Wysocki in check, while putting everyone else to shame with his incredible good looks. The third member of the team is an undercover officer, who has infiltrated the mob and is trying to work his way up to the politicians.Every episode contains different stories that follow the shady dealings, some case the pair is working on, the fallout for the Superintendent, and of course the undercover who has an in with the wrong crowd. The stories are edgy, intelligent, and really entertaining. A lot of shows get cancelled every year, but for the life of me, I can't figure out why this show wasn't given more of a chance. The chemistry the cast has, along with the terrific writing, and edge of your seat police drama made The Chicago Code one of the best shows to come out that year.Two years after it's cancellation, the show is still on my mind and in fact, I just recently watched it again, as it's streaming on Netflix. The story of The Chicago Code teaches us one very important thing about network television, it's all about the money! You can have an original idea, a great cast, and the most entertaining show to come along in years, but if it doesn't make more money than it costs, it's as good as gone."
1,"The spirit of those men gives the USA a point to aim for. We are our brothers keeper, is true in every sense of the word and it is shown without question, very good and one for archives."
1,It was pretty good. I'll definitely watch the other episodes. Especially enjoyed Jeremy Renner. He's a pretty good actor and does a lot with his various roles..
1,If you don't keep up with each and every episode ... you totally lose the whole spectrum of what is going on in this series ... but I am hooked !
0,"As I wrote in my review of season one, season two was going to make or break Sanctuary. And it broke.Only watched the DVD set, so perhaps if I had spaced it out a bit, it might not have been so bad. Ms Tapping's acting ability failed to come to work with her, effects didn't improve (in some cases were worse), the werewolf guy is still a miscast (it shows more in this season). And just before I started writing this, I see there's a season three!?! Poor sci-fi/fantasy fans. There's so little really good stuff to watch, that some of us will take anything.No more Sanctuary for me. Ever. No surprise amazon has season two ""on sale""."
0,"While ""Sanctuary"" is a clever science-fiction show, it's never especially compelling.  Much of the time, I find myself falling asleep halfway through an episode.  (If, at that point, I happen to switch to some other time-shifted TV show on my DVR or a DVD, there usually isn't any nodding off, so it's not a question of fatigue.)  Every week, a wild not-entirely-half-baked storyline is thrown out, a lot of crazy business ensues and, by the end of the episode, the whole Sanctuary team is sipping tea in Helen Magnus' office.  While the show touches upon interesting topics such as giant abnormals living in the earth in some sort of collective Gaia-like symbiotic relationship, every week this sort of thing is being fired your way en masse.  Sanctuary blends steampunk, religion (Kali, for one), abnormal myth (vampires, werewolves, etc.), historical figures (James Watson, Jack the Ripper, Nikola Tesla, etc.), science and adventure together and then funnels the concoction down your throat.  It's all a little hard to swallow.  **1/2 out of *****.That being said, I was glad to see the loss of one regular character this season (hint: it's the worst actor on the show) and the introduction of a new one.  The whole Cabal storyline is wrapped up entirely too quickly.Despite my issues with the show, I also watched season 3, which introduces hollow earth into the mix and is an improvement over season 2."
1,"I have noticed reviews that shine a negative light on this film get slammed because it is a posthumously released script work of Shelly's, but honestly the execution of her story falls flat.Meg Ryan plays the psycho wife who duct tapes her philandering husband, played by Hutton, to a toilet in hopes of him re-discovering his love for her. Kristen Bell plays the easy to believe other woman and Justin Long plays the bad guy that provides the needed fear for everyone to learn about themselves. The Blu quality is poor to below average throughout, with grain, artifact, film degradation and bad line definition. The colors look decent though. The DTS is mostly unused, only getting around while Long is busting up the house. The performances are fine but this is nothing I would want to re-watch or say is a must see. The supplements include:* Making of, 12:21 minutes, in lodef. Very dry containing all interviews talking about the 2-week shoot and wanting to get Shelly's work to screen. I liked the commentary better.* HDNet ad plug, 4:40 minutes. Usual long trailer.* Commentary with Cheryl Hines, Ostroy (Shelly's husband) and one other producer. The commentary strains at times to be tolerable, but there are some vital pieces of material there for those creating the nagging arguments about the ending and entire premise of the film. Nice tidbit about Hutton being injured by one of those plants thrown at his head. For those that have been speculating 50 different ways about what the ending means - just turn on the commentary when Ryan is dragged into the bathroom by Long, or for the last few minutes of the film and all will be enlightened.They are very proud of their work and short shoot, and understandably so. English language, subtitled in English and Spanish, no region coding listed. Rental recommendation maybe, but not a valid Blu. Three for the film and supplements, zero for the Blu."
1,"I wanted to like this movie, I have great respect for our armed forces who risk their lives every day. However, the whole film felt too even, lacking highs and lows. The story was a bit jumbled, and often I wasn't sure what of significance actually happened, because the story was so muddled. I've wanted to see a movie about the SEALS for years. Not really this one. Still I appreciate any attempt to bring what they do to public awareness."
1,"Call me crazy (go ahead, do it), but a town dominated by a bunch of grown men who all dress like bikers and commit crimes is about as credible as a white-collar married father-of-three being a massive pothead well into his forties.  Let's get real.  You might have difficulty getting into this show because most of the people on the show are, how you say, sorely lacking in reedeming qualities.I watched all the episodes as they premiered on FX and found them to be well-written and well-executed, but I originally tuned in because I'm a Ron Perlman fan.  I've never ridden a motorcycle or broken a beer bottle over anyone's head, but I do enjoy shows that are different.  Katey Sagal and Ron Perlman do a very good job with their characters.To be honest, I had (and have) a hard time caring about the main character, Jax Teller, played by Charlie Hunnam, who seems like a bit of a turkey and hardly the cool-biker-dude-with-somewhat-of-a-conscience that he's supposed to be.  His tall friend Opie is way cooler and much more likeable.  And it's frankly hard to buy Jax's off-and-on-again relationship with his old flame, Tara, who happens to have gone off to medical school and returned a doctor, but who still digs that biker guy she used to date!  (Jay Karnes of ""The Shield"" guest-starred on a few episodes as an FBI agent who stalked Tara and I suppose he summed her up appropriately: ""Once a biker wh*re, always a biker wh*re!"")  Well, come on, how could she resist such a bad boy as Jax Teller!  I mean, he's like Einstein 'cause he wears the same clothes every day!Despite my misgivings, it's a unique show with an interesting albeit not-always-believable storyline.  I'll be tuning in for season two.  But remember, ""Sons of Anarchy"" is no ""Mad Men""!"
1,"This show is great.  They could just be hilarious, but almost every scene they are wearing ties.  I love the counterpoint to their outrageous behavior.  Constantly funny, never remotely predictable."
0,"I was very disappointed in this production; I suppose there are only so many ways to bring to film the events and tragedies of the Kennedy family, before it becomes simply a rehashing of commonly known facts. This in no way compares to the 1983 NBC Miniseries ""The Kennedy's"", for one's money that is DVD to purchase."
1,"We love NCIS and for some reason, we did not watch it when it started on TV.  Later when we discovered it we wanted to start watching it from the beginning."
1,"I've been a Mythbusters fan for a long time and while I'm still not used to the US narrator (coming from the UK where it is narrated by a Brit) I made my way through all the Mythbusters series again on Amazon Prime.The show takes us through those things we always thought we knew about but often didn't. Watching the whole seasons through, it is obvious that while Adam and Jamie were younger in this season they were also a lot angrier at each other. Perhaps they learned each others quirks as the seasons progressed but it is interesting to go back to the early days. You can also view how the budget for the show started increasing over time as their initial experiments were low cost and generally done near the shop, now they have massive explosions in man made lakes and mining quarrys.I recommend this show to my friends and it is often discussed in the work place. Everyone with an interest in science, explosions and humour should be watching this show."
1,"Jake: Isn't this something you should be covering?Journalist: Nah, Cheyenne [the new capital of the western states] doesn't like incidents like this covered.  They control my credentials.Jake: What the hell kind of reporter are you?Journalist: The working kind....Jake: So nobody's reporting the real news, that gets you off the hook.Journalist: I used to work for the LA Times before the attacks, I won two Pulitzers, so I got a pretty good idea about what it means to be a journalist, and they don't exist anymore....Journalist: People get the news they deserve....Journalist: When I was a kid, two guys took down the White House with a typewriter because people listened.  They got angry, they acted.  If I thought anybody was willing to listen, believe me, I'd be talking.Heh.  And they call this fiction.  In the years since the show was broadcast, we've learned that the above is true regardless of who is in office.The show's as good as the previous season, which, since this is a continuing story, you'll need to watch first.  However, the story comes to no resolution in either version of the final episode (which only differ in where one of the characters end up.)"
1,"Best children's T.V. show out there! It provides great entertainment, and in each episode Curious George makes learning fun by teaching the child audience interesting things about our world. Highly recommend this show!"
1,"This is, as I said, a nice show. It has a few good twists but I really like what it doesn't have--no violence and no gratuitous sex.  After bingeing on Breaking Bad, I needed a smart show without the all-in commitment. This fits the bill.P.S. I'm now halfway into Season 2 and it's growing on me!"
1,"I love the characters, the dynamics are captivating and the love interests are lots of fun!!  Can't wait for season 2 to go prime!"
1,"the in character detail that David Suchet brings to the role is, well Over The Top.I watch it every evening - chapter by chapter."
1,I will love poirot always.  David Suchet is the best. Please add more seasons to prime as well as miss marple also.
1,"Another season of a fun show! I didn't realize how much I missed this show until I was in the middle of this season. Daria's dry wit and observations aren't at all dated, and they still play true all these years later. I wish more things were on the air today like this show!"
1,"Warning: slight spoilers ahead.You'd figure that for a show going on it's eighth season (a season shortened by the WGA strike to boot) that things would get a bit stale to say the least, especially considering the horde of network TV imitators to pop up since it's original inception.  Fear not, C.S.I. still manages to keep going strong, and it picks up by grabbing the viewer by the throat and not letting go either.  Grissom (William L. Petersen) and his team race against time to find and save Sara (Jorja Fox) as her life hangs in the balance, which eventually leads up to her departure from Vegas, as well as a heartbroken Grissom.  Things don't get much better for the crew as Catherine (Marg Helgenberger) receives a threat, and Warrick's (Gary Dourdan) life begins to spin out of control, leading him to be charged for murder, and concludes in the explosive season finale which only promises more changes to come.  While some moments may come off as a bit hackneyed, C.S.I. manages to still be spectacular thanks to the depth that the principal characters get in this eighth season.  Even lab-man Hodges (Wallace Langham) gets an episode to shine as he and the lab techs play some ""murder games"" in the inventive episode ""You Kill Me"".  There's also a crossover with Without a Trace, as Grissom and FBI Agent Jack Malone (Anthony LaPaglia) team up to solve a murder and kidnapping.  All in all, C.S.I. still manages to wonderfully deliver the goods even in it's eighth season, and still remains the best prime time, network TV crime drama on the air today."
1,I have always loved sci-fi stuff but real science intimidated me a LOT. I went back to college in my 40s and found out not only did I like science I was pretty good at it. This led to an interest in shows and books I wouldn't have touched earlier. This show takes the people on the cutting edge of science and tops in their field and presents their ideas in laymen terms as much as possible. Since I am definitely a layman I appreciate this very much. I am looking forward to season 3 :-)!
1,The third season has Sam and Dean trying to save Dean soul from hell. They have killed the yellow eyed demon and are now trying to save Dean from going to hell because he made a deal with a demon to save Sam. As we have learned from this series that this family keeps makking deals with demons and pay the price. It cost them there father life. Season was very good. They hunt down demons and other stuff. Gets slow in the middle but the ending is very well done! A jaw dropping ending that will leave you speechless. They also have that actress who plays Maggie from the Walking Dead in it when she was younger. She was ok.
1,"Great series, I loved all the characters. I'm not usually into macho movies, but could not stop watching it. Hope they make more like this."
1,"What can I say about the entire series that hasn't already been said? Pure delight, great attention to detail, extremely high quality for a TV series. Casting, writing, directing, screenplay, acting..I shiver with delight every show."
1,"Surprisingly effective entry into the ""found footage"" monster film oeuvre (and also seeming to owe a little bit toMan Bites Dogwhich preceded the supernatural/monster films). The trolls manage, astonishingly, to be both goofy looking and credibly threatening."
0,"My daughter and I struggled all the way through this  . . . movie. It was almost impossible to understand the dialogue. We had to look up the summary online to even know what was going on. We spent a good part of the time saying to each other, &#34;What did he/she say?&#34; I love movies with character and plot development; but if this movie had those, I must have missed it. We dismissed the review that said it was boring - need four more words - boring, boring, boring, boring. They were so right. The only good part that was noted was Colin Farrell's lovely accent. If only the movie had had a good sound engineer!"
1,A fitting end to an exciting show.  The second season is only 6 episodes long but very worthy to watch.  There is an ending to the show though it leaves an opening for something more.  Very nicely done.  I wish there could have been more.
1,"Enjoy watching this series while on Amazon prime since it no longer exists in production.  I was not able to see any of this series when it was shown on A&E television. So now I can watch on prime without all those commercial interruptions. The locale, cast, and plots are worthwhile my time. I love this show and am sorry this series was cancelled after only four seasons"
1,"Blue's Clues is both educational and entertaining. Kids enjoy it,  it doesn't get annoying, and it's not crude humor."
1,"It really doesn't matter which episode you watch, Fawlty Towers has just the very best short comedies ever written.  John Cleese, in this role, will never be matched for intellectual slapstick (an oxymoron that only he could make real).  I have watched it so many times that my wife prefers I watch it on my netbook (with earphones on) & yet she continues to chuckle, undoubtedly recalling a scene trapped in her memory, when I break out laughing in spite of her admonitions."
0,This series was not as funny or interesting as I remember it to be.  I was disappointed.Why is there a minimum word usage
1,"Quick Overview: Detective Crews was sentenced and served years in prison for a crime he is now exonerated for. He received a hefty settlement but decided to return to his work where he got a new partner. Together they solve murders. When he is alone, he is tries to solve the murder he was put away for.Love the Life television series. I don't know how I missed it when it was airing. Damian Lewis is great. His character, Crews, is eccentric but smart. He often looks like he is about to board the crazy train and then suddenly it all makes sense. Then he does it again! He is a little crazy and a little genius. Pretty obnoxious sometimes too."
1,This is my favorite animated show and I loved this 3rd season when aired on TV as much as I loved the first two seasons. BUT PLEASE STOP CENSORING THE DVD SETS!
1,"AMC : did it again with a new series. A murder mystery with plenty of twists & turns to keep your mind wondering who did it. The first 2 seasons are on prime which is free to subscribers too bad the 3rd is not. This show has everything from murder to love,to betrayal police corruption and police corruption thrown in.I thought this show was great it takes place in Seattle Washington."
1,"The first two seasons of 30 ROCK the series managed to accumulate every imaginable award, not merely Golden Globes and Emmys, but the highly prestigious Peabody.  TV Critics proclaimed it one of the greatest comedy series in TV history.  Despite all this, no one was watching the series.  NBC renewed it twice simply because it was far and away its most critically acclaimed show.  And as I said, it had a shelf full of awards to prove it.  In accepting the show's first Emmy show creator Tina Fey summed it up perfectly:  ""I'd like to thank our dozens and dozens of viewers.""Then came the 2008 election and John McCain chose as his running mate a photogenic but outrageously under qualified governor from Alaska.  She was a comically awful choice, but for a while not everyone realized that.  Then on Saturday Night Live Tina Fey returned to portray Sarah Palin.  Her impersonation devastated Palin's public perception and more or less destroyed her political career.  It helped that many of the most hilarious things that she said were incredibly close to what Palin actually said.  While her impersonation was not crucial to McCain's loss, it definitely played a role.  But in addition to the political effects, Tina Fey's Sarah Palin called attention to her and by extension 30 ROCK to a degree not previously possible.  In its third season, 30 ROCK's dozens of fans grew to millions.  NBC suddenly had a hit show.Before going on, we should pause and reflect on this.  Today the networks do not exhibit much patience with shows.  If they are not instant hits, they are canceled.  Even if they get considerable critical acclaim, like PUSHING DAISIES, they will still get canceled.  30 ROCK had survived only because it got such an extreme amount of critical acclaim.  Its critical success more or less tied NBC's hands.  But my point is that after two low rated seasons, the show was a sudden hit.  I wish the networks would keep in mind that great shows always have a chance to become hits.  In fact, they have greater chances than the vast majority of new shows.  Patience with good shows will usually pay off.And what a brilliant show it remained in Season Three.  No doubt their collection of awards will grown once again and it will deserve it.  30 ROCK isn't merely the best comedy show on TV right now, but one of the best ever, possibly the best ever after only ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.  Absolutely everything was perfect.  The writing was simply jaw dropping, with the jokes spilling out at a breathtaking pace.  Most comedy shows pad out the script, pacing the jokes because they don't know if they can keep coming up with the good ones, spacing the jokes with mildly humorous dialogue.  That isn't the way of Tina Fey and her team of writers.  They just assault the viewer with jokes, one right after another.  There are so many jokes that you simply can't keep up with them.  You just can't digest all of them.  What is more, sometimes the jokes are presented not one at a time, but in layers, two or three operating at the same time.  The jokes are verbal and they are also visual.  I still can't get the image of Liz Lemon showing her female friends her yoga pose out of my mind.This is as brilliant a set of characters as has been seen since the Bluth family made their premature exit from television.  Liz Lemon is an absolutely brilliant character, a lead character plagued by feet of clay.  Liz never really does the right thing for the right reason, but at most does the right thing for the wrong reasons.  She might not have an evil bone in her body, but neither does she have a good one.  Much the same is true of the magnificently self-absorbed Jack Donaghy.  Everything he does, no matter how bizarre, is done to further the interests of Jack Donaghy.  And Kevin the Page is one of the most unexpected hit characters on TV.  I'm sure when they started the series they knew he was going to be good, but who knew he would be as good as he ended up?  I'm sure they were confident that Tracy Jordan was going to be a great character, and they were right.  And Jenna Maroney might even surpass Liz and Jack in seeing the world as revolving around herself.  What makes this incredible group of characters even more incredible is that every actor portraying them is extraordinary.  Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin are simply the two best comic performers on TV and together they have created one of the great comic duos in TV history.There were some great comic arcs in Season Three.  Jack has a bizarre and out of character romance with his mother's nurse, played by Salma Hayek.  There is an unexpected glitch in it when her mother hates Jack because of his sharp resemblance to a villain in a Mexican soap (the villain is also portrayed by Alec Baldwin).  Liz persists in her efforts to adopt a child.  She also has a near romance with a very good looking neighbor, played to perfection by Jon Hamm, better known as Don Draper on MAD MEN.  Jenna wears herself out by simultaneously continuing to appear in THE GIRLIE SHOW while starring in an unauthorized biopic based on Janis Joplin (its being unauthorized meaning that in singing the Janis-like songs they can't use the real lyrics, something that leads to excellent results).  In short, hilarity results, again and again.The season ends on a highlight.  Jack learns the identity of his father, who just happens to need a kidney.  Much to his relief, Jack learns that he is not compatible, so they need to find a new donor.  So Jack twists the arms of Elvis Costello and other musicians to do a celebrity single.  The season ends with a group of musicians begging in a video for a kidney for Jack's dad.  Those performing on ""Kidney Now!"" include Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow, Clay Aiken, Mary J. Bilge, Steve Earle, two of the Beastie Boys, Adam Levine of Maroon 5, Norah Jones (who proudly sings that she is sober), Cyndi Lauper (who confesses that she is not), Sara Bareille, Michael Moby, Michael McDonald, rapper Talib Kweli, Wyclef Jean of the Fugees, Rhett Miller of the Old 97s, Robert Randolph, and Rachael Yamagata.  All in all, it is a pretty amazing assemblage of talent for a fake music video.So, once again 30 ROCK was a show that was hitting on all cylinders.  And now the ratings are strong enough that those of us who adore the show don't have to worry that the season that has just ended will be the last."
1,The third season was filled with eventful twist and turns. This show is addicting. I want to see more and more. I recommend go back and watch all the seasons. I have seen every single show. I highly recommend this show.
1,"These stories are lots of fun to watch.  Sure, it's funny that all of the murders just happen to take place where one of the detectives are involved, but it's entertainment at its best, in my opinion.Great way to spend some time."
1,"Jack Bauer is a moral avenger and  just when we need such a phenomenon.  Jack treats terrorists like they treat others.  Also the series allows a lot of good acting and shows off a lot of articulate minds.We get to see justice, something the federal government is in the business of squashing."
1,Seasons 1 and 2 were so fun and entertaining.  The rest of the seasons were less than great and the new wives were too crass.  But Season 1 is the very best of all seasons.
1,"Good writing, good acting and great directing has delivered a product that is thoroughly satisfying entertainment. From the special effects to the props and scenery, the producers got this one right;the story lines are multifaceted and loaded with action that never quits (for mature audiences)..enjoy"
1,"Being a student and author of historical fiction, I must say the British production companies do ""history"" better than anyone else. ""Rome"" is an outstanding production with well done story lines.The writers developed well-known, but rarely published facts about common Roman life; graffiti, treatment of slaves--and the love of blood. The realism is sometimes a bit ""raw""--but accurate historically. Greeks loved beauty--Romans loved blood.The casting is excellent and the props superb! I first noticed Max Pirkis in ""Master and Commander"" (One of my favorite movies) and think the boy has a lot of talent. He is growing into adult roles well and we will see him in some excellent thought provoking roles--if his parents can protect him from ""Hollywood.""Well done Brits! (American studios should be jealous!)"
1,"I like Dora. Both my kids like to watch this show. The music and lessons taught are very helpful. All the interaction with other characters are great and telling Swiper to stop swipping is hilarious, Love all seasons of Dora."
1,"I love Dexter, who knew being so bad could be so good. love the concept of the show, its something different for me to watch with all the detective shows out there. Would most surely recommend. The show is about a serial killer who only kills bad people and serial killers."
1,"This show really makes you appreciate history and why it's important to remember factual information.  The haggling price is half the fun.  The best part is knowing who and where the item came from.  You never know what will come through those doors.  It's history, that's what is interesting."
1,There's always a lot of plot twist which makes it very interesting and the characters are believable. Hope they continue to make these.
1,This isn't a well-known Dickens tale but this is a first-rate production with an exceptional cast and wonderful camera work. The story is very compelling but not the least bit maudlin or cloying. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Dickens.
1,This is such a great show I can hardly put my kindle down. The actors are the best. I am so glad season. 2 & 3 r on prime also
1,"Sorry to see that this show had only one season.  I really enjoyed the &#34;his & hers side of the story&#34; format ... & how, after the verdict came down, the viewer was always let in on who actually committed the crime, irregardless of whether the jury got it right.  The only thing that was a bit irksome (as I did not find it plausible) was the sexual attraction of many of the male characters in the show to Kathryn Peale, who reminded me of an ex-nun, given her hair cut & dress.  I just didn't see it at all."
1,"I actually found myself laughing out load as I watched this all by myself. There are some incredibly funny performances here. If you like The Office, Parks and Recreation and those types of shows, you will love Better Off Ted."
1,Off beat but still interesting show.  I like the back story involving Det. Cruz and I hope to find out who and why he was &#34;framed&#34;.The supporting characters are great and the writing makes you care about them.  I want this series to continue.
1,"In the first half hour or so of the film I thought that there were not really going to be any monsters, that we had just walled off part of the world for some other reason.  Well, I could not have been any more wrong about that.  There are monsters although I don't think anyone really knows if they came from space or are giant genetic mutations occurring on a poisoned planet.  (We do see an atomic mushroom cloud in the distance at one point so obviously the world has been busy poisoning the air and water.)  This movie reaches its monsters gradually and in the dark which to my mind makes it more believable.  Our first sightings are all at night. Our best sighting is at night too but because it is at a lit service station with an ongoing electrical storm, we get an incredible view of them.The two main characters are a photojournalist male and the daughter of his employer.  He must interrupt his photo assignment to escort her back to safety in the USA.  She is in Mexico, near the infected zone and that is no place for her to be.  Through some misadventures though, they end up having to make their journey by land with the natives. They do encounter the monsters and have to make their way nevertheless back to the border and over to the USA on foot. It is quite a journey with no over the top comic book moments."
1,Love this series.  Takes me away from any mundane work!
1,"This was free on Amazon Prime. After watching for three and one half seasons, suddenly they want $2 plus meaning about $100. Feel like this is a bait and switch. Amazon Prime offered me $5 and told me to complain to the studio. Feels like reading half a book and losing it."
1,-I love season 1 and 3 and would like to give them all 5 stars but season 2 had too many character turns for my liking.  Almost every character... it was like they changed writers or something.
1,"This is a promising reboot of the Star Trek series, with the decided influence of JJ Abrams and friends. It's obviously hard to judge this one movie versus the existing Star Trek universe, but that's all we have for now.Skylar-Spock definitely stole the show as he was/is ideally suited to play a young Spock. Not quite as logical as Spock Prime - having an affair with a student is quite illogical after all. But as attempt #1 and playing a younger Spock one could not ask for a better performance.The rest of the characters need work in future movies before they establish themselves. New-Kirk was a bit too much 90210, New-Checkov was over-done with the geekery TNG-style, New-McCoy felt out of phase at times, and New-Sulu was not quite right. New-Uhura and New-Scottie are a step ahead of the rest of the main characters. Tyler Perry, talented and creative as he is, he was not very convincing as a high-ranking Star Fleet officer. It sort of stood out.The other issue with the movie is that the villain du jour was actually not particularly impressive considering the grand stage. Other than the scary-looking space-ship, this was a typical TNG villain. The best they could come up with was an angry miner with a mining ship destroying the galaxy?On the plus site, Abrams and Crew paid a lot of attention to a number of details from the original Star Trek universe, mini-homages to fans of TOS. Also very nice is the very efficient way they split the JJ Abrams Trek into a new timeline/reality, thus not risking the wrath of TOS fans. This clean-cut also opens up the possibility of more ""visitors"" from the original Trek timeline/reality in future movies without ""ruining"" TOS :)"
1,"A nice, more quiet cartoon but still captures kids attention!  It encourages problem solving and also shows real child segments at the end of each episode (2 mini episodes per show).  The kids love it because it has many animals and funny moments...when George gets things mixed up or is too curious!  I prefer shows like this that are fun, educational and not annoyingly crazy or loud."
1,"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, was released in 2001.When I watched that video game movie, I could not believe how realistic it was.There is no salvation for T4 or this game. They are both mundane & trite.They took no time to doctor up this movie. The chapters are short. The video is grainy & flawed, just like a video game, only not as engaging.You would have to be a machine to enjoy this movie.:(FF is still on my shelf. Salvation is going bye bye ..."
1,"This is a good series.  A little more drama than action, but some storylines follow each episode.  The more you watch though, the more you start to connect with the characters.  This one gets better the more you watch it."
1,"This concerns only the first season of this series and I know some of the things will not seem right to those who have watched the next seasons. But that is just the point. The first season has characteristics that will change later and the meaning will change too. I will keep within the very limits of that first season. What we gather from the first episodes is that this blood technician working for the Miami PD is the adopted son of a police officer. He was adopted at the age of four by this police officer because he had been traumatized by the killing of his mother with a chain saw by some drug dealers. At once the series insists on the fact that this trauma caused an irreversible damage in the psyche of the child who is fascinated by death and needs killing just like junkies need their drugs. He is addicted to inflicting death to other people. We will only learn quite late in this season who his real father was, after his death actually, so we will never know the man really. We will not be given in this season any detail about the death of the mother beyond what I have said. And all the detail that comes up now and then is always flashbacks in the memory of the child that Dexter was. Dexter recovers that memory little by little just like any child or even adult would do in the case of a traumatic event. His foster father just tried to bring this death impulse of his within some acceptable limits, within a certain code: you can kill but to survive hence you have to kill people who are just plain dirty (I sort of remember this is the code of Anne Rice's vampires). And that's what he has been taught and trained to do. First hide your impulse. Second pick the proper criminals. Third do it so professionally that you can never be suspected. This ideology then is very typical. You can survive any trauma if you know what you are, if you accept what you are and if you find out why you are what your are. When you finally know, then you are clear. The term comes from Hubbard but it is the one that is needed here. It may change later. This concept of clarity is doubled then with the Skinnerian concept of absolute determination of your whole being and future by the mould into which you have been cast in the very first years of your life. In this case, Dexter is a killer because of his trauma that happened when he was four, hence he will be a killer all his life. No one can change that. One can only teach the kid a code, a method, an art to do things along a certain ethical line and not to be caught. That is pessimistic but that is not the main interest of this first season. The main interest is that another serial killer, the Ice Truck Killer, though not being a copy cat, is obviously aiming at this Dexter. And his crimes that are very special in their style, method and delivery are there to titillate Dexter, to chase or bait Dexter into a trap or a corner. Little by little we will learn the connection between the two and that I won't reveal. In the end Dexter will have the upper hand and kill his competitor, along his own method, more or less.  The second interest of this series is how Dexter can keep his secret for himself in his own private life, hiding it from the women he is going along with, from his own sister (foster sister for sure but sister anyway), from his direct colleagues, from his department, etc. It is subtle and difficult and there the actor is doing quite a good job, though the series is more building the meaning with the environment of the character than with the acting of the actor. As usual in American series the actors are rather static and the stage director, the series director and the set designer are building around him or her a composed visual moving environment that builds the meaning of the expression or speech of the actor. Note in this case most of the discourse of the main actor is his own voice over the pictures. He is telling us a story and it is often a commentary of what we can see. The next and essential quality of this series is of course the real artistic and artful suspense that is built in each episode and in the twelve episodes of the season and that lets us absolutely breathless most of the time, even when we finally know who the Ice Truck Killer is, and then the suspense does not go down one iota. In other words this series is so far, first season only, Dionysian, quick, fast, dense, exhilarating, inebriating, intoxicating and many other things of that sort. In one word it is addictive and habit forming. You may, if you have ten hours and a half at your disposal watch the twelve episodes in one go and you will never be bored, tired, de-concentrated. Try it and you will like it I am sure.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"
1,"Numbers, shapes and colors for ages 4 and under . . . interactive learning that's fun! My grandchildren choose this series and I must admit that Season 1 was a feat of endurance for me. Not to misunderstand! This isn't intended for adults and I do encourage other activities instesd of 'just' tablet time. Considering the programs available, this series offers creative learning with a reasonable format. Definitely recommended!"
1,"This is obviously a minority opinion here, but I was not especially high on Season One of THE BIG BANG THEORY.  I first have to confess that sitcoms are my dead bottom least favorite genre of show.  I barely make room for HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER, but all in all it is a format that I find pretty dreadful, on the same level of reality and talent shows and crime procedurals.  I hate the limitations of the camera work, the lack of character development, and -- the worst invention in the history of television -- the laugh track.  Moreover, Season One of TBBT did not get the formula quite right.  Much of it was that they hadn't sufficiently found ways to soften Sheldon's character, who can at times be very funny but at other times -- especially in this season -- be excruciatingly irritating.Season Two saw a number of subtle alterations of the show, mainly softening Sheldon, but also increasing the dynamics between the various characters.  But Season One felt slightly off to me.  I can't help but contrast it somewhat with HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER.  The latter almost acknowledges the limitations of the format and constantly stretches it, including a pretty large number of exterior shots on the Warner Brothers lot.  The show also uses their laugh track much more lightly than TBBT.  Both shows suffer from too small of a cast (a common problem with sitcoms).  The  best comedies are not sitcoms, don't have laugh tracks, are not restricted to sound stages, and have large ensemble casts (cf. MODERN FAMILY, 30 ROCK, ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, PARTY DOWN, early SCRUBS, and THE OFFICE).On the other hand, it is fun seeing a show with lots of nerd references.  Plus, I've actually known a couple of people who were geniuses along the line of Sheldon (though I should say that perhaps my greatest nerd moment was that when I worked in the University of Chicago Bookstore -- before it became a Barnes & Noble -- Chandrasekhar would always do a beeline to me to get help finding books [hey, having a world class genius -- another Nobel Prize winning physicist told me that in his opinion Chandrasekhar would rank as one of the two great twentieth century physicists after Einstein -- acknowledge your competence on books, even as a lowly book clerk, and nod to you as you walk across the campus may be a faint form of achievement, but if you don't understand this you don't understand the guys on TBBT]).  And as a comic book lover it is fun seeing a show with a lot of references to comics (though they seem to be limited entirely to superhero comics, while that makes up only part of my interest in comics).  But all of this was not quite enough to overcome the sitcom limitations, the laugh track, and irritating way that Sheldon was written in Season One.  The good news is that Season Two represented a huge improvement.  It still isn't among my favorite shows (no sitcom ever could be), but it is one that I will continue to DVR after having caught up on DVD."
1,I have missed Veronica Mars so much. It was so sad to see it leave the airwaves after 3 seasons. Seeing this movie was as if it never left.
1,My grandkids love watching this on the Kindle.  It's wonderful to get an entire season of episodes for them to enjoy.  Robot Rampage is their favorite.
1,"To me, this series can be pretty darn good...I hope they keep it running and not saddle it with idiots and break it as they have done with so many decent tv series that get chopped and cut by studios and then rehashed into dung heap reruns...this series is a pretty good one which I can personally relate to as a medical professional.  Enjoy the show, it is pretty decent...This season was a bit weird not having the old staffers with House but they did some rather odd things and came out ok.  Some of the plot ideas I think could have used some rethinking but they did the student stuff ok overall.  I will be interested to see what happens with the old staffers in the next season."
1,Such a great show. Love George and his adventures. He always fixes his messes and helps out whenever he can.
1,"I hope they continue to make more. The pace and acting is great, I also love the plot lines. They aren't the usual cookie cutter stories hollywood turns out, these actually have depth, the characters also have depth. Clearly the fans love it to put up the money to make it. Maybe now some smart producer/director/studio will see the wisdom of developing stories for Amazon. This is the first time I've heard of a film being made to order for fans, and I hope it's not the last."
1,Both my 4 and 3 year olds love being able to watch these episodes anytime. Even though they have watched them a thousand times. Recommend to parents of small children.
1,"This was crude but funny and downright hilarious. One of the wittiest, funniest, bawdiest comedies. The voice actors hit their mark, the writing is creative. Certainly for any kids under age 18. My hubby and I only watch it after the kids are off to bed."
1,"Curious George has been a classic for years, however, I believe that the Curious George show is better than ever.  There is always a lesson hidden in these adorable episodes.  My son LOVES to watch it, and I am happy to let him watch.  They discuss topics from counting to instruments, colors, nature etc.  The graphics are wonderful and sharp, music is so cute!  I truly find myself singing the opening song with him&#8230;always! It is nice for our children to have shows that are fun, as well as educational."
1,"My 18 month baby loves him!!! And it's really educational, promotes rational thinking and caring for animals and the planet"
1,I love this series he makes me feel like a normal person.  This is fun series allowing you to enjoy the oddities of others with the ability to solve the crime.
1,But very sad ending.  I really enjoy the black comedy of this series and here in season three as a teacher...oh come on.  The series is funny and sexy and well written and this season might just be the best. All the players are in top form.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
1,My daughter loves Sesame Street and I love that's its quality educational programming. She counts and sings along with them the whole time. Its very interactive and she stays entertained.
1,I could watch a whole lot more of this series.  The character development is very interesting and easy to follow
1,"I just love the series Heroes and have all of their seasons, it a great TV Show which I highly recommendpeople to see it! But to Understand it, you will have to start out watching the Seasons in order i.e. do notwatch season 2 without watching season 1 First, or you will have problems figuring out who's the good guysand who's the bad guys!  Same thing with seasons 3 and 4"
1,"Another good TV series cancelled while still in its prime.  I'd heard nothing but good things about this series, so I watched and was NOT disappointed."
1,"This series is one of the classics of all time. The characters are unforgettable and painted from  the broad strokes of good and evil and many shades in between.  The themes are here to examine the human condition on so many levels that at times it makes your head spin, particularly when you compare it to todays events. What a show!!!!"
1,"I was watching the night the original Star Trek premiered on NBC, wrote several letters to the network advising them to renew it for a second and third season and attended the first Star Trek convention at the Statler-Hilton in New York in 1971.  I've been a Star Trek fan for over 40 years.  And I love this new film.  I saw it the first day it opened, later on an Imax screen and on an airplane flight to Las Vegas.It is a great film from its incredibly exciting pre-credit opening to its conclusion.  Yes it does change the history and continuity of Star Trek.  However it has added an excitement to Star Trek that has not been seen since Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.I'm not going to go into detail about why I enjoy it so much:others have gone over that ad nauseum.  The entire cast is terrific, although I must point out Karl Urban who nails DeForest Kelley as Dr McCoy better than I could possibly have imagined.The picture and sound quality of the blu-ray is terrific, the extra features are good and the deleted scenes help flesh out scenes left in the film.  (I have no doubt Paramount will be releasing another version of the DVD and blu-ray with additional scenes sometime in the near future.)In conclusion, whether you are a Star Trek fan or not, if you'd like an all-around terrific film and you haven't seen this one, you really should."
1,"Inexplicably, this is my granddaugher's favorite show.  She can watch it over and over.  She's entranced by the characters and dances to the music.  It never gets old for her.  No other kids show does that for her."
1,"This is a movie about real people, and not necessarily the so called pillars of the community. Sort of like the outlaws, backwoods, these characters are something to watch. A lot of pride and drug usage, plenty of members, it is what one would call a no nonsense view at a very particular family, where music is always present in that neck of the woods. Video and Audio were acceptable. 4 Stars for sure."
1,I never started watching the show but with Amazon prime I was able to watch when I could. I really like the show. You quickly identify with certain characters and loathe others. But the singing is AMAZING!!!!
1,"I purchased the entire seasons (1 - 4) and have found them both entertaining and worth the cost.  Over time, the re-watch high-lights the missing in-depth interactions of the characters, but also brings out details that might have been missed on the original broadcast. Again, I am biased becuase of being a fan of BSG."
1,Just a very good show that keeps you interested throughout as you see detectives pick up clues that leads them to suspects that often results in the guilty party being found.  Wish they had more seasons on prime than just the two....
1,"Season 5 24 is fantastic.  Each episode gets more and more exciting!  I keep thinking, it can't get any better than this, but guess what!  It does! Fantastic show, no show can beat 24!  I am a wreck when its over, but I love it so!"
1,"This movie is a bit of a twist on the classic themes of Catcher in the Rye. In Ceremony, a younger man falls for an older woman who's engaged to be married soon. While it might sound like a typical romantic comedy plot, in fact the characters in this film feel much more real. There are no heroes or villains but just a group of people struggling with their emotions. Ceremony isn't a hilarious movie, but it does have its moments of genuine comedy. Michael Angarano does a particularly good job of making is character a mix between a used car salesman and lovestruck boy. Best of all, the movie isn't predictable. Things aren't always what they seem. Overall, not bad for a romantic comedy."
1,"This show really did deserve to have played for more than one season.The storyline was very good, with a few good surprises, especially the season finale.There were times when it stretched poetic license but the action just kept on going.I thought it was an intelligent science fiction production and would have enjoyed more seasons."
1,"Season III is what i expected it to be. Informative, interesting, intriguing, inventive, marvelous, brisk, fast paced, and fun too."
0,First program in series was OK but not great. Evaluation will depend on whether we watch other programs in series
1,"I liked Benedict Cumberbatch very much in this show, but even more in Sherlock Holmes, too bad they did not make more of those."
1,Not nearly as funny as it could be with the great cast that they have.. A well thought out punch line here and there do not make for a great show. Maybe some new writers might the help the show. And it only got an It's okay because of the actors otherwise it would have been one less star
1,I love the realistic drama that is on this show. It keeps you interested in the show as it moves along.
1,"Good quality picture, no problems...makes me wonder why I did not watch the series when it was on network tv"
0,Really cheesy with really bad acting. Reminded me of one those terrible B- movies that play late night on cable Tv.
1,"This season introduces one of the best characters NCIS Director Vance.The director is now a political operative with real field experience attuned to the realities of Washington.Gibbs begins the season with a new team.  Vance disbanded the team we know and love as punishment for Jenny Shepard's death.Pulling the old team back together and the real reason they were disbanded is the crux of the first few episodes.An on-going storyline is the conflict between Gibbs and Vance as they learn to live and work together.Many of the stories are intensely personal.We meet Gibb's father, Ziva's lover and see McGee work under extreme pressure in a woman's prison.We are back to 24 episodes in one of the best seasons of a top-notch show."
0,"It is riddled with detail. It was  hard to seperate the wheat from the chaff; intrigue that added up to a crime from chaff.  Naturally since this drama cannot focus, neither does it have any pace."
1,i say 80% of the episodes of this season is awesome. I watched most of I almost got away with it already.
1,Loved this show. I hate that it was cancelled. I like the shows theme and the smart people. All the members are smart. I love it. No stupid-b----e style.
1,"Great writing, and compelling characters in a dramatic situation, are some of the reasons why Jericho is very compelling serial television.  The story centers on the events in the fictitious town of Jericho, Kansas, after a nuclear attack.  The immediate concern is survival, and then maintaining basic government structure, medical facilities, and utilities.  As characters are defined, past lives and secrets are disclosed, and roles, old and new, are formed.Exactly what happened is a mystery, and while some things are revealed, it is evident to viewers that there are several hidden conspiracies.  The situation gets more complex, as new characters appear, and a hazy picture of the new America slowly takes shape.The key figures in Jericho, are from the Green, Richmond, and Hawkins families.  The ensemble cast is great overall, but Skeet Ulrich's performance as wayward son come home, Jake Green is superlative, and the glue that holds much of story together.  Gerald McRaney as Johnson Green, the mayor of Jericho, brings incredible toughness and leadership, to a situation that demands it.  The wild card that separates Jericho from being just a post holocaust survival tale, is Robert Hawkins (Lennie James), a newcomer in town engaged in something very, very, deep.The writing is often clever and suspenseful, with unexpected developments springing up.  Although things begin slowly, the season finishes in a flurry, with the town on the verge of all out war.  Quite sobering, for a network television series.  The writers mix things up, using creative flashbacks, and bringing back characters, and even a tank, in later episodes.  While there are inconsistencies and illogical events, and some things have to be toned down for television, the story builds to a riveting conclusion, leading to a second season, that almost never was.  Family values, morals, and patriotism, are some of the values that led to the founding of America, and this series effectively touches back to them.Executive producers Jon Turteltaub and Carol Barbee provide commentary for a few episodes, and Skeet Ulrich and Lennie James, also contribute commentaries.  'Building Jericho' is a 24 minute documentary feature, about how the town of Jericho was constructed, and some interesting background information.  A series that will make you think, thrill you, make you cry, and remember what it means to be an American.  Jericho is a remarkable program that should not be missed."
0,"This movie has gushing blood and lots of use of the &#34;f&#34; word and not much else.  Not even the women were spared from punched out eyeballs and blood oozing everywhere.  They had their lipstick on though.  It could have been worse, but only with lots of effort."
1,"Pretty depressing, but pretty compelling, too. Dakota Fanning plays Lewellen, the lead character, to perfection. Even if the movie were no good otherwise, I'd recommend it just to see how such a young actress can make you believe you're really in the middle of a story, seeing a real little girl in her real life. She raises protective instincts in most of the audience, and I don't want to think about what she raises in the rest.Lewellen is 12 years old, lives with her father (David Morse) in a run-down house in a run-down part of the south; near Nashville, I think. Her mother is gone, but it is not clear where or why. Her maternal grandmother (Piper Laurie) lives nearby, and is a fundamentalist authoritarian who seems to be always angry, always saying no.Lewellen loves to imitate Elvis, singing ""Hounddog"" with a floor lamp for a microphone, and all the hip movements. She is therefore shocked when her friend Charlie introduces her to Big Mama Thornton, who sang it ""all wrong,"" because Lewellen figured it was Elvis' song. But in fact Thornton had recorded it years before Elvis.Lewellen says she can't sing the blues because she isn't black. Charlie explains that singing the blues isn't just for black folks, and cites Elvis as an example. Hounddog thus becomes a symbol of Lewellen's emotional development, when she can sing from the heart and not merely from imitation.But the story is not primarily about music. It's about the vulnerability of a young girl to injustice, to the demands and whims of adults, and even of older children. But it's also about her inner strength, her sense of responsibility in caring for her father after he is struck by lightening and ""turned stupid,"" as her friend's father put it. Believe me, he was not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree before the lightning hit his tractor.The dynamics of the family life, and facts about the past unfold slowly, and I'm not going to spoil those revelations for you. But I do have one nagging question. Early in the story, Daddy has a Stranger Lady move in for awhile. The credits list this as Robin Wright Penn. Later we get to know another lady who is perhaps Lewellen's mother or her aunt; in any case, the daughter Grannie rejected. She looks a lot like Stranger Lady, but I'm not sure. There is some critical information in knowing this, and it bothers me that I am not good enough at recognizing and remembering faces to be sure. Anyone know?"
1,"If you have never watched this show before, get ready to laugh. This series has great writing and actors and you will find yourself laughing out loud in many places with the wit and humor that is shared in this series. I had missed some of the episodes in this season, but I was impressed with the quality of the DVD itself and above that there were some great special features that were offered for the true fan! I highly encourage all to check out this DVD set!"
1,This is a good series.  This is the granddaddy of all police series.  I recommend this series to anybody seeking good entertainment in this type of entertainment.
1,I so enjoyed this series.  The costumes were awesome!  The main theme behind the story is the cost of progress and how it affects the lives of a town.  I loved every single character and loved the surprise ending.  I haven't read the books but now I am going to.
1,first season was great could not wait until the second season came out.  first season was a great whodone it
1,As with any extended series the fringe characters get a lot of development and this is the case here.  Really adds a lot to the series.
1,"Season four was not as good as the previous ones, as the story drifts apart from its original idea. It's kind of ""A-Team"" mission of the week, but the characters are still growing. Still worth watching it!"
1,"at its best! The collection of characters makes viewing an adventure. Each of their quirks turns the ordinary into the hilarious. Must viewing for anyone who appreciates small town life, or clerical committee work."
1,I like the characters in this show and love the setting.  Raylan Givens is a bad man with a good heart who carries a badge.
0,"I thought I was really going to like this movie and was very disappointed.  Right away in the beginning there were so many things that were just unbelievable.  Very shallow, just plain not good."
1,Awesome series! Will continue watching. The cast seem to be fused as one - of course some have relations outside this series so maybe that is why they act so well together. Looking forward to future seasons.
1,"This is a great show - I don't know if it is a spin-off of Blue's Clues or what, but I wish there were more than the four episodes.  Fantastic!"
1,Season 1 was really good and season 2 did not disappoint.  Morgan Freeman's narration and hosting is like that warm cup of hot cocoa on a winter night.
1,"Love the &#34;boys&#34; , even Louis.  The continuous story line necessitates having the entire series to get the full effect.  Plan on buying the second season when it is released."
1,"In an effort to capitalize on the audience from ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"" the FX network has tried a number of promising shows. ""Sunny,"" to me, has always been a completely inspired bit of lunacy that defies everything about the age of political correctness in which we find ourselves. It is so wrong--but that's what makes it so right. Unapologetically demented and offensive, the show has moments of brilliance. ""Archer,"" of all the programs that have followed the ""Sunny"" time slot comes the closest to the ribald and irreverent tone and works exceedingly well as a companion piece.""Archer"" is a terrifically entertaining animated piece featuring perhaps the most obnoxious and oblivious central characters you're likely to encounter. Sterling Archer (aka Duchess) is a spy who fulfills every sexist cliche one might expect from a boozy, clueless, womanizing James Bond wannabe! In other words, he is awesome! Voiced impeccably by H. Jon Benjamin, it is sheer madness to follow Archer as he blunders his way through assignments, familial entanglements, and romantic assignations. His flirtations with fellow spy Lana (Aisha Tyler), his rivalry with Lana's new beau Cyril (Chris Parnell), his workplace banter with easy Cheryl and inappropriate Pam (Judy Greer and Amber Nash), and his wonderfully dysfunctional mother love (the incredible Jessica Walter) are juggled nicely amidst a bevy of ""Get Smart"" missions. It's all great, but patently disturbing, fun.Season One represents 10 episodes. Two standouts to me are ""Mole Hunt""--the first episode, and perhaps the funniest, that strikes the perfect balance of wackiness and character introduction--and ""Honeypot"" where Archer must put his life and his body on the line as an irresistible gay boy toy. By all means, check this series out if you like comedy that straddles the line of good taste and then jumps over it! I loved this creation named Archer and his relationship with his mother is one of this great show's true highlights. Benjamin and Walter are a perfect pair! About 4 1/2 stars. KGHarris, 11/10."
1,"Quirky, clever, and very satisfying, Life is an excellent police procedural that takes place in Los Angeles. LAPD detective partners Crews and Reese are perfect foils, seeming opposites that play off each other's best and worst personality traits in such a way that the viewer ends up liking both characters, a difficult feat. Actors Lewis and Shahi do an excellent job. Lewis' American accent is spot on, and Shahi (a very beautiful woman) does the tough-cop, no-nonsense, recovering addict role just right. Other characters/actors are also great. Although I wanted the series to go on and on (it was cancelled), please don't be hesitant to watch the 2 seasons that are available. The underlying mystery, developed a little at a time through each episode, is satisfyingly (if perhaps not completely) resolved at the end. I watched the last episode last night, and I'm a little sad now. I will miss Crews and Reese."
1,I love these episodes!  True crime stories are so interesting and I love being able to watch them on my Kindle while my husband watches other things.
1,"My favorite things about this show: Paolo Costanza looking like a young shiny Jerry Seinfeld and being so charming; Reshma Shetty so cool looking, owning an English accent (which isn't always pleasing regardless of authenticity) and wearing outrageously mediocre Western knock-offs of Indian style (Season 2 even has a yoga episode where she gets to roll her eyes) and last but not least, arguing in Hindi - more please; and the freakishly hilariousness of Campbell Scott as a German baron/duke/prince thing.  OMG - his accent is ridiculous and sometimes he slips out of it and it is the weirdest most hypnotic thing about the show.  It's jarring and hints at ""something nasty in the woodshed"" and really enhances what is sometimes too bubblegum and broad to entertain me.  I like tuning into Royal Pains but I wouldn't want to own it.  I liked it more in earlier episodes when I was dazzled by pretty Paolo and Reshma and enjoying the idea that a menschy NY Jewish Doctor was the main character but the biggest enthusiasm killer for me as I watched the episodes has been the scenes with the hospital administrator.  It's not the charm and bloom of a new relationship between two nice people - it's boring and worth fast forwarding pass.  And her clothes are ugly.  This storyline killed the momentum of this series for me.  Yes, the beach background is stunning but you can see similar scenes on Burn Notice and CSI: Miami.  Beach real estate rocks, we know."
1,"Doctor Who series Six brings us the Doctor (Matt Smith) traveling through out time and space and leaving hints as to when he is returning to take Amy and Rory back through time and space.  Meanwhile Amy and Rory have been given a strange blue envelope with a time and a place and corridantes that bring them to Utah in present day Earth in the 21st century.

So check out series six of Doctor Who and be amazed and surprised by what transpires in this series today."
1,This series only ran two years and the writers tied up the story line beautifully and it was very satisfying.  It got a bit complicated mid-season but it was well worth watching all the episodes.  The actors and the characters are great.
1,"Saving Grace is the show I love to hate. The main character, Grace Hanadarko is a completely unlikable character with very few redeeming qualities. She is in a down spiral into self destruction (and hell) and she does everything in her power to hasten it. A cop, Grace has many inner demons. She is very promiscuous and uses sex and alcohol to escape her inner demons. Sex, adultery, alcohol and violence, that is Grace's life. She is a good cop though and, although a bit violent on the job and an affair with her married partner, she has an interesting sense of justice and a desire to get the criminals.One night, while drunk driving, Grace hits a man and in a moment of desperation asks God for help. Well, God answers in the form of Earl, her own Guardian Angel, her last chance at redemption. Well, Earl is far from the traditional angel with wings, he is a scruffy looking, tobacco-spitting, and rather sketchy looking angel. He tells Grace she is headed straight to hell and that this is her last chance. Earl provides Grace with guidance and clues to something that she has to figure out (the big reveal of the season). Through Earl and the rest of the cast, we delve into the inner psyche and past of Grace, a deeply troubled and scarred woman that has suffered through many things including the death of her sister (Oklahoma bombings).Grace's self destruction is even more interesting when we learn that her brother is a priest, her sister is a perfectionist and a bit OCD stay at home mom and her best friend (San Giacomo) is the voice of reason in more ways than one and offers unconditional support. The way all these characters are contrasted against Grace provides a very interesting view of Grace herself and whether she will straighten out. Although I dislike the show and I dislike Grace, one must admire the multi-layered and complex character that Holly Hunter plays with perfection. Truly, her acting skills shine through and although I hate the show, I can't help but watch. It is just like those reality TV shows that you really don't wanna watch, but can't help doing so."
1,"When I first watched the pilot, I saw too many pretty people with nice hair and though they suffered from a nuclear attack far away, no one suffered from soap and water much less styling goods.  As time went on, people complained about lack of goods but it never really makes much of a dent.  The lack of gasoline, etc. is discussed but in the end it really doesn't affect the residents much.  Besides these concerns, I became more involved in the show and the realism of the setting didn't bother me as much.  Actors meld with their characters and they become more interesting and human.  Jericho in Kansas is a place where the bombs were not supposed to go off and be a safety zone for the terrorists who have detonated the bombs.  The residents don't know what went on and only gets bits and pieces as the series moves on.  The main characters are Jake Green, the son of the mayor who has been mysteriously absent for several years.  He seems to have been in Iraq as a soldier.  The other main character is Hawkins,  an African-American man who mysteriously appears with his family for unknown reasons just before the bombing.  As time goes on, Jake and Hawkins appear to be the heros who will save the day.  The series becomes more and more detailed and exciting.  I was impressed with the choice of great actors in the series including Gerald McRainey who plays the mayor, Pamela Reed as his wife and Lennie James as Robert Hawkins.  One of the most impressive things in the series is allowing Lennie James, a British-African actor. to rise up to be a star.  There aren't many black actors being allowed to act and participate in a show except as the buddy and Hawkins is a character who surpasses everyone else without argument.  The series only lasted a year and a half but if very impressive.  It began when the networks were attempting to challenge cable channels with higher quality series just as they did with Lost and Desperate Housewives.  Those shows lasted longer and lost their impact so maybe it was luck that this show was short and still impressive."
1,"Real-seeming leading character.  Innovative craft. This is a good show and stands out from the crowded field of predictable, over-staged shows of its type."
1,"Was hooked immediately.  Painfully proper, as those times were, and quite heartbreakingly so.  Great writing with some shocks thrown in.  A must see program."
1,"Apparently the little genius town of Eureka hasn't quite run out of disasters yet, even with the destruction of the Artifact.In fact, Eureka's problems get worse as the show's writing becomes better, starting with the citizens bursting into flame. The second season of ""Eureka"" is more confident and well-balanced than the previous one, and it takes the characters, quirky humor and tight writing into brand-new territory. Including Carter walking around naked.The timeline has been restored, and Carter (Colin Ferguson) and Henry (Joe Morton) are trying to adjust to their past lives. Carter also is convinced that the future will unfold just as it did in the other timeline.But during a solar flare viewing, a guy violently combusts -- and soon other people start combusting. Carter searches for a link between the victims, and finds that someone near him may be next. Meanwhile, the Pentagon decides to remove Nathan Stark (Ed Quinn) from Global Dynamics' big chair, and replace him with his estranged wife Allison (Salli Richardson-Whitfield). My, that's awkward.Other problems pop up over the season -- shared dreams, personal forcefields, ""ice funnels of death,"" falling debris clouds attracted to the GD headquarters, invisibility projects, Fargo's frozen grandpa, Biblical plagues, Carter becoming unnaturally attractive to all women, and an attempt to recreate the Big Bang that apparently turns everyone (except Carter) into driveling idiots.But while the Artifact has been effectively destroyed, its presence is still felt -- Allison's autistic son Kevin has formed a strange connection to it. And when a brilliant scientist creates a deadly alchemical bacterium -- which turns all iron into gold, then rust -- it may lead to a showdown over Kevin's future....There's a darker current running through the second season of ""Eureka"" -- Henry is more subdued and haunted, and a little boy's life is in danger. But don't worry, because thankfully the writers don't switch too far into the dark zone -- the focus is always first and foremost on our Everyman Sheriff, and how he tries to deal with the Horrific Crisis of the day.In fact, the second season flows very easily, with a more relaxed pace and a colourful, diverse array of science-based problems -- including robot geese. There's lots of great dialogue (""Jo made it seem like the sky is falling."" ""That hasn't happened since 2004, and that was more of an igniting of the ionosphere"") and hilarious comedic moments, such as Carter's naked public shower and the shared Zorro fantasy. But there are some sweet moments too, such as Fargo's grandfather coming to terms with the life he missed out on.I wasn't too impressed by Ferguson in ""Eureka's"" debut season, but he really gets to blossom in this one -- he's quirkier, cuter and has a knack for physical comedy. He fits in better with the Eurekans. And he brings a lot of life to Jack's problems, whether it's the weird stuff, or the more realistic threat of his ex-wife taking his daughter out of Eureka.Quinn and Richardson Whitfield also do well, as Allison and Nathan try to adjust to their new positions, as well as some renewed sparks. And the other characters get rounding out -- Jo gets in touch with her inner girly-girl, Zoe clashes with some genius ""mean girls,"" Taggart has a maternal experience, and Fargo gets in touch with some family members. Also has to deal with the possibility of dying.Of particular note: Morton brings a feeling of dark pathos into many of Henry's appearances, reminding us what he's lost and leaving us wondering what he's planning. And it's worth noting that a trio of ""Stargate SG-1"" actors make some very solid guest appearances -- particularly Michael Shanks as an embittered, myth-obsessed scientist.The second season of ""Eureka"" sticks to the humorous sci-fi angle, but expands the characters -- as well as some of the darker subplots. Definitely a great little series, and promises to stay fun and suspenseful."
1,It's a shame that it is no longer on air. It was one of the few comedies that actually made you laugh. The characters and the actors who portray them are wonderful. Everything clicks.
1,my life is not so bad compared to tommys life. i realize that is a dramady. his house is the constant in his life keeping him sane (kind of).
1,"Such a fun show to watch and it is educational, too. Wonderful, vivid colors and characters that children love. My 17 month old granddaughter loves this show. She dances to the songs, smiles at them and has learned animal sounds watching it."
1,"To start, I'd like to mention that this season is only 13 episodes, due to the writers' strike. That being said, I actually think it's still on par with the previous two seasons. Some say it seemed a little rushed but I actually think it may have been a bit too much to have an entire 22 or 23 episode season of breaking out of a prison in Panama that only has guards on the outside. They do a great job once again of keeping you on the edge of your seat with this one.A lot more is revealed about ""The Company"" and the massive conspiracy, and of course, Burrows and Scofield find themselves neck deep in it. Some old faces and new alike with Scofield continuing to outsmart pretty much everyone makes this another satisfying and addictive season of Prison Break."
1,"Truly wonderful series.  I especially love the statistical information that is shared before each episode, then following which helps to explain some of the things and the way they were done in that era.  Beautifully written and acted."
1,"Having been only a moderate Louis CK fan prior to catching Season One of FX's stellar ""Louie,"" I found the initial 13 episodes to be absolutely fantastic.  Without a doubt, this is his breakthrough moment and performance.  ""Louie"" expertly blends the mundane with the profane.  It can be awkward, hilarious and surprisingly real.  I thought Season One had some of television's biggest single laughs of the year as it juxtaposed comedy club footage with Louie just trying to be a good person, a good father, and a good comedian in everyday situations.  Oftentimes pushing past the edge of good taste, Louis CK leads you right into the crudest scenarios possible but never loses you.  This is a guy you can identify with and share in his frustrations and challenges. I feel like Louis CK really lets the viewer into his world and invites us to partake in the unified silliness of humanity.  Nominated for two 2011 Emmy Awards (one for writing, one as Best Actor in a Comedy), this show was also included on the American Film Institute's Best Program of the Year roster.So I was really looking forward to this second season.  I'm going to be honest.  In its totality, I don't think the show was quite as funny as last year.  But in many ways, the show deepened and became far more unexpected and interesting.  While still the champion of the awkward exchange, many episodes didn't play for laughs at all.  I'm not sure how others would compare this second season, but I found myself really respecting the chances that Louie CK took in his increasingly personal stories.  Some of the memorable moments include life lessons from Joan Rivers as well as Louie's continued painful pursuit of a relationship with Pamela Adlon.  But many of the episodes (including the season's loudest and most obnoxious entry about Louie's pregnant sister) defy categorization.  The show is unafraid of dealing with parenthood in a way few TV programs even attempt.  There is a quiet poignancy and truthfulness behind everything that happens.  What do you say when your daughter tells you she likes her mother better?  Well that's the question that opens the season.The 13 episodes on this 2 disc set are: (1) Pregnant, (2) Bummer/Blueberries, (3) Moving, (4) Joan, (5) Country Drive, (6) Subway/Pamela, (7) Oh Louie/Tickets, (8) Come On, God, (9) Eddie, (10) Halloween/Ellie, (11) Duckling, (12) Niece, (13) New Jersey/Airport.Some episodes have two vignettes, some are self contained stories.  More than anything, this season shows a confident and creative show runner willing to push the boundaries of conventional sitcom fare.  Without a doubt, my favorite of the year (one I'm convinced will be Emmy nominated) is the expanded episode ""Duckling"" which has Louie participating in a USO tour of Afghanistan.  It's a great set-up with lots of laughs that turns into one of the most heartfelt and memorable moments that I saw on TV this year.  Seriously.If you didn't love Season One of ""Louie,"" than this simply isn't a show for you.  Nothing here will change your mind.  As I stated, I didn't think this season had as many laugh-out-loud moments but it more than compensated by an increased depth and honesty.  It's strange to talk about a sitcom like that, but this is as close to real life as you're likely to see in a sitcom.  KGHarris, 5/12."
1,"For a pure documentary presentation, this show is pretty interesting.  The acting is good, and the plots are suspensful.  I gave it 4 stars because I don't normally watch documentaries."
1,"Season five has fulfilled a lot of expectations  I had from the beginning.  While not tying everything in a neat package in the end, this one has loose ends.  Not enough to turn off those who stuck with the program for five seasons.  Rodney McKay, John Shepard and the rest, don't meet a terrible demise.  The show ends on a positive note. The evil Wraith, while not entirely finished, won't be bothering earth for some time.I recommend the program because it follows the tradition of SG-1 with a set of likable characters.  Woolsey, portrayed by Robert Picardo (of Star Trek Voyager ) does an incredible job as station captain.  It was good to see Colm Meany and the actor that portrayed the chief engineer on Enterprise in other roles.  I was glad to see Nicholas Pellegi (from the X-Files) in the role of a starship captain last all five seasons!What impressed me about this saga was the quality of the writing.  If only this studio was in charge of the Star Trek franchise!  They seem to be delivering much more in terms of action and dramatic possibilities.  There was more adventure in five years of Stargate: Atlantis than in seven years of Star Trek: Voyager.  The writers were fans of Star Trek and it shows in the writing.I wonder if they had to get permission from Paramount to use the beam up gimmick Trek utilizes so frequently? This show leaves open the possibility of a sequel or future films.  The last episode in paticular shows the fans there will be more in the future."
1,Highly educational and entertaining. Kudos!
1,"This series is a study of an adorable sociopath.  It is hard to &#34;justify&#34; as many shootings as they come up with.  Even so, it is riveting TV"
1,"Crude? To be sure. Rude? Absolutely. Lewd? Possibly. It is tempting to dismiss ""Ugly Americans"" as an amusingly offensive trifle, but I'm not going to do it. Dreamed up from the demented psyches of creators Devin Clark and David M. Stern, ""Ugly Americans"" is not only uproarious--it is perhaps one of the most on-target and irreverent satires about immigration services in existence today! An animated comedy/horror hybrid developed for Comedy Central, the show is populated by creatures from every realm--humans, demons, aliens, zombies, vampires, wizards and other freaks too numerous to outline.Set in New York's Department of Integration, the show is built around liberal milquetoast Mark Lilly--a human social worker trying to acclimate various beasties into jobs and society in general. Mark is surrounded at work by a bombastic demon boss, a half succubus/half human girlfriend, and a 500 year old wizard caseworker. At home, Mark shares his digs with a zombie roommate Randall who is misplacing body parts on a regular basis when he's not trying to eat his friend. As bizarre as it all may be, ""Ugly Americans"" actually does a nice job making its central characters relatable. Randall is a real dude, Leonard (the wizard) is the world's worst co-worker, Callie (the girlfriend) is the beautiful girl with issues, and Twayne (the boss) is a bureaucratic nightmare. Mark is the everyman who holds it all together.""Ugly Americans"" is an impressive mix of ridiculous sight gags and biting humor. Not every joke is a slam dunk, but there is so much going on visually that even peripheral material adds to the overall hilarity. Season One contains seven episodes and I think they get progressively funnier as the characters become more fleshed out. My favorites include ""Treegasm"" when one of Randall's appendages (I'll leave which one to your imagination) develops a life of its own and ""Blob Gets Job"" which demonstrates how difficult it is to gainfully employ a pile of gelatinous goo. Morbid fun AND relevant social commentary make this more than a curiosity. A surprisingly good animated show, ""Ugly Americans"" walks the fine line between bad taste and droll wit perfectly! KGHarris, 10/10."
1,"I really liked seasons 1 and 2, but it seems like life aboard the battlestar Galactica is becoming redundant.  I guess there are only so many things you can do in space when finding new planets and interacting with new beings isn't your thing...."
1,"all the way to the last episode, I truly enjoyed I would like to join other friends who want the show back before too long!"
1,I sooo wish this show hadn't been cancelled and had caught on like Dora did. I cannot stand Dora and my toddler loves Kai-lan. She loves the music and animation so much more. Kai-lan is adorable. Our toddler has some crazy mood swings and when we sing Kai-lan's songs about dealing with feelings they REALLY help.
1,Turned in to marshmellow! Love this show. Wish it had lasted more seasons. Hope that with the movies's success they will restart the seasons
1,"I would catch this on TV while late-night surfing from time to time. When it was available on Prime, I would turn it on as background while working on other things. I always got sucked into the drama and how crazy the moms were and how much money they put into clothes and make-up. I confess I watched every episode and felt miserably sorry for the kids in every one. If you don't mind the drama, it is entertaining in just the ridiculous-ness of it all."
1,I love &#34;It's Always Sunny!!!&#34; Who wouldn't? I love Frank. I wish I were a part of this cast. The stories the come up with get zanier and zanier everytime and I LOVE IT!
1,I liked  this series a lot. It's too bad it was canceled. I thought it was interesting and entertaining I am glad the woman who played the mother V is now on Homeland.
1,Always humerous and all age groups can enjoy this show. It's no wonder it was so popular for so long.
0,"I have issues with monster movies where the female lead is always dressed and looking sexy tousled, her hair and face just so, even as she sweats her way from one near-death to another. That was the funny part for me. I laughed. There is no chemistry between these two as they try to make their way home to the US from the alien-infected jungles of Mexico. Yes, the movie tries to make a social commentary about immigration and keeping the Mexicans out. Here, a huge wall is there to keep the aliens out, unsuccessfully, it turns out. I'll credit the film with not overdoing the scares. There is more threat of scare than actual scare. The aliens looks like giant shrimp, and while not entirely believable, they look okay for cheap special effects. The other effects are better, such as the wreckage left behind where the aliens have been rampaging. The script stinks, and the two lead actors are bad. Should you watch? Maybe. Just don't expect much."
1,i enjoyed her in high school a bit better.  Though the show still is enjoyable and i would recommend nice fun show that is not completely dumb as many are today.
1,"Chicago Code was answer to the stagnant Reality TV trash that has been shoved down everyones throat these past few years. Chicago Code had outstanding writing, each episode was entertaining, exciting and a show that you looked forward to each week. The cast was outstanding, honestly; I was not sure how Jennifer was going to be playing the Super"
1,Little Bill is a family favorite. The program centers around Little Bill and his daily adventures. There are good lessons big and small to be learned and they're not all by Little Bill as may be the case for other shows. All family members and friends are involved.
1,"Totally enjoyed Season 2. The DVD shipped fast however,one of the disks was loose and has signs of some rubbing during shipment. The DVD played fine with no glitches so all is good."
1,"It is a mildly funny, romantic comedy, British television show. Not terribly funny but good acting.I watched the entire series and I generally dislike the romantic comedy genre. Even though it is a love story of sorts, this show isn't too mushy nor is it highly sexualized like many romantic comedies of present day. I recommend it to females between 35 to 55. I think that group might enjoy it."
1,I simply find the series very entertaining! The stories usually catch my attention and hold my interest all the way thru. Bravo!
1,"Although the plot at times lost the &#34;find Earth&#34; focus, the season maintains high levels of tension, drama, lightness, loss, and surprises."
1,"I love they way she reels them in and lowers the hammer! That, mixed with a love for chocolate and a southern acdent."
1,"You have let reality go to believe this could happen and the characters pretty stereotyped, but fun. The guys are also very cute!"
1,"They may be speaking Chinese, but you almost feel you can understand the actors. Well done film that held my interest throughout. It is one Hollywood should watch to get back to what they used to do well."
1,"What rich characters Roth is amazing!!! Too amazing to be real!!! and of course it is TV!! I enjoy the very divergent plots, and the different emotions the players go through as they slowly reveal their history. Keep it coming!!!!"
1,"I love me some Veronica Mars!  No, the movie does not give you all the same joy, anticipation and frenzied excitement as the TV show but it was a well done story of people who have moved into the next stages of life with all the decisions, dramas and regrets that can come along for the ride.  Throw in murder, intrigue, and a love affair for the ages...and you have one heck of a movie.  if you like film noir, suspense, and detective movies, check it out.Also, when you do, you support a movement. I believe that if we get a Veronica Mars movie every few years, they will just get better and better because the creator is committed to such excellence and has the vision.  Let's support it and keep the dream alive.  This has been a PSA brought to you by this one fan of Veronica Mars."
1,This is one of my sons favorite shows along with Bubble Guppies.It teaches him while he watches and doesn't realize it.Great show for kids
1,"Answer Man is a sweet movie. The opening scene will probably deter a number of potential viewers; otherwise this is a straightforward charming love story.That opening scene is a bit like George Carlin's 7 words you cannot say on television; Jeff Daniels is upset that his doorbell rang (it interrupted his meditating) and as he walks down the stairs says just about every single foul word ever invented. I mention this not to say that is a bad thing, it is simply a warning that the language is coming. From there the film just gets better. It threads together three stories that seem to be unrelated, a young alcoholic checking out of rehab and trying to make his book store work, an overly protective single mother starting her chiropractor practice, and an incredibly popular author trying to remain anonymous. The film telegraphs very early how all three of these people are related. And yes the ending is a bit predictable.On the surface, this is just another pot boiler standard love affair film. It reminded me very much ofGhost Town, but not as funny. And as such would just be a middle of the road OK film. In the bonus features, I discovered that this is the first film for screenwriter / director John Hindman. This is truly remarkable, an unknown to Hollywood person, writes a screen play, shops around to get the film made, has never directed a movie in his life, and convinces somebody to back his film. Technically, there are seasoned directors that have done a much worse job with a film like this. Bravo Mr. Hindman, you do have talent.The film appears to be shot almost entirely in Philadelphia. The setting is beautiful, and not a bad view of the city. I think Philadelphians will recognize the locations, 2nd street and Market in particular. Every shot is in focus, exposure is across the board spot on, and random annoying handheld camera movement is minimized. The film has a fairly standard pacing, nothing remarkable, just done right. Sound is well recorded, dialog is very clear.Jeff Daniels is outstanding in this role. He is the central character and carries the film well. Lauren Graham is radiant as a quirky, troubled, happy woman trying to make her way in the world. In real life Lauren Graham is only 11 years younger than Jeff Daniels - the age difference in this film appears a bit more, although not creepy. The real surprise is Lou Taylor Pucci, who plays the recovering alcoholic. I really liked his role a lot. He played an addict that sees the good that will happen in his life, as opposed to the sad drunk that sees nothing but bad in his life. Kat Dennings (Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist) is wonderful as the hippie assistant in the book store. And Norah Dunn (Saturday Night Live, 1985-1990), played the snotty driven agent in a solid manner. The cast is nicely chosen for this film.The film is rated R, due to strong language. It's hard to imagine this film working very well crippling Arlen by not allowing the strong language. That is the only reason for the rating, there is absolutely no nudity, no suggestive scenes, no implied sex, no violence, and a brief moment of showing a few people drinking alcohol. At an hour and 35 minutes, the film is the right length.The DVD includes three bonus features. The only one worth watching is about how this film was made. That 9 minute piece is excellent and very revealing. There is a super lame HDNet featurette where the story is more or less retold (I wish they would stop including these horrible featurettes on DVD's, they add nothing to the film). Finally, three is a 10 minute discussion with each actor about their character (another pointless piece - view before the film and it will ruin the film, view after the film and it is simply redundant).I liked this film. It is heartwarming. It is sappy, but sometimes that is just a pleasant thing for a film. This isn't a film worth watching many times; it's simply a wonderful piece of candy to enjoy."
1,Good show.  Wish there had been more seasons.  It is definitely worth watching if you like detective shows.  Also watch the other two seasons.
1,"Loved Season 2!  Thoroughly enjoyable.  Some of the camera work can be a little odd, lingering on an insignificant detail.  I don't remember if it happened in Season 1 or 2 and it happened again in Season 3.  Well acted, well written and each episode always ends on a cliffhanger."
1,I choose this 5 star rating because you can learn so much how thing are made. I would recommend this to everyone.
1,"I was never into curious george s a kid but as an adult and a mother of three i hae absolutelly fallen in love with this monkey.  George is alway's entertaining and of coarse curious.  I appriciate this show because it teaches my little one some very important lessons like standards in measurements and sociaization kills, you cant go wrong with this show."
1,Great show for preschoolers.  My grandchildren love it! Emphasizes friendship and helping friends and those in need.  Focuses on math skills including patterns and measurement.
1,I have always loved Tim Roth and think he does a great job in this series.  This is such an extraordinary topic!  I don't know if there is scientific evidence to back up the theory around which the show revolves but suspect there is.  I will be looking into it a bit deeper.  I just don't understand why it only ran 3 seasons. I guess mainstream America didn't get it but I love it!!
1,"The scenes, interviews and explanations made this series intriguing.  I'd like to see the show based on this introduction and feel that I understood why it is so popular."
1,This is a very good mystery.  I believe you will enjoy this movie and is good for the whole family.  Very good acting in this movie.
1,"There are rescue missions in every episode. Diego is a animal rescuer. In each episode, A animal is in trouble."
1,I enjoyed this clip so much I was disappointed it was not longer.  Now I have to read the book after the tease. Excellent information .
1,Program is put together well. Covers various topics and how alien contact could possible be an interactive part. Each show is well put together and easy to follow and understand.
1,I thought I wouldn't like it but I really enjoyed watching. It started good and ended well. I think most young people would love it
1,"I enjoyed this series, it was well paced and kept your interest. Not to bloody or too much foul language but a show you could with teens or your older parents with out being uncomfortable. Good stories."
1,This season is even better than season one.  It continues to provide excellent interesting stories.  Wish it had more seasons to watch.
0,"Potentially this is a great series, but after a few episodes I felt it wasn't getting anywhere. There seems to be a lack of intensity, with story lines that just drift off. I am sure it will all come together in the end, but I don't think I will stick around since I am not enjoying it enough to wait. However, the concept is fascinating and the acting is excellent."
1,In the era of stupid reality shows and boring movies Suits is a breath of fresh air!!! It's smart witty & funny with a lot of modern drama and pretty ladies thrown in as well!!!  Well worth the time to watch it USA hit the ball out of the park with Suits & Necessary Roughness!!!!
1,"when i first started watching this show,i quit watching it 2 or 3 times. i couldn't figure it out. but when i sat down and gave it a third tryi really started to enjoy it. once i understood the characters. i would recommend this show to others. i love it!"
1,"It seems that the legal profession is a great backdrop for drama.  Add lots of witty dialog in the &#34;Suits&#34; scripts, and you have a winning combination.  Love this show and the unusual father/son relationship between the two main characters.  I'll be happier when more seasons are available on Prime."
1,my daughter loves this. she will sit and watch this and interacts with all the things that they ask you to do
1,"I am a huge Top Chef fan- I have watched and own every season of Top Chef, and Season 6 is definitely my favorite. The contestants are the most talented, the food and the challenges are the most interesting (it's the first season they started doing &#34;High Stakes Quickfires&#34;, and I almost don't hate who ended up winning!If you watch any season of Top Chef it should be this one!"
1,This was really good.. had issues with streaming. But is so worth the cost of paying for to watch. Great story line and did keep one s attention from start to finish!!
1,"This was the final season and a good season it was.  Personalities died and others emerged.  The show started the way it ended, with Tony in therapy (w/Carmella), Meadow, her usual brilliant self, truly growing into daddy's little girl, becoming a lawyer as a result of all the stuff she saw growing up, voicing her very strong beliefs.  Tony Jr., well, he lived up to the potential of uber rich New Jersey kids, dumped  the brown GF and took a BMW and an easy trail to his dreams.  Tony was facing another potential indictment, his solution, take the family to a dinner.In the end you could make him out to be a gangster, or just a guy providing for his family in the best way he knew how."
1,"You got to love Leverage!This show is a modern day Mission Impossible (Mission Impossible: The Sixth TV Seasonis the current release of the classic show). The team plays these caper straight but there are so many laughes and twists of the tale.Timothy Hutton channels his inner Jim Phelips as Nat Ford, The mastermind of the operation. Gina Bellamn as the grifter Sophie Devereaux who can steal your heart as well as your wallet. Beth Riesgraf is Parker , Who channels her inner Alexander Mundy (It Takes a Thief). Christian Kane plays Elliott Spencer , the hitter , who is brain and well as muscle but cannot work a computer. To roound out the cast is Aldis Hodge as Hardison, the hacker who can find a file in the world wide web.Those who love caper movies this show is like a mini in 50 minutes.Always remember as you watch this show that the best Good guy is a bad guyBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
1,I don't normally care for paranormal shows but this one is pretty good. I'm on Season 3 and have enjoyed each season.
1,I thoroughly enjoyed this season. It is a good show. It does not have a lot of unsavory language or behavior.I  highly recommend this show!
1,"As stated in my previous review of Season 1, Flashpoint is a Canadian-produced series about a SWAT-like paramilitary, police unit in Toronto.  Like the first season, it features terrific scripts and acting, likeable characters, great weaponry and action scenes.  I enjoy this show greatly.  (It started its 3rd season, 2 weeks ago, Friday nights on CBS)  There are a couple extras on the set concerning the weaponry of Flashpoint and one of its stars: Hugh Dillon.If you want to check out an exciting and highly enjoyable and suspensful action series, you should check out Flashpoint.  If you have not seen season one or two, you should definately pick us these sets."
0,"I like paranormal shows, but this one seems a little more hard to swallow than some of the rest of them."
1,"House is my favorite show, combining the drama, tension and intelligence of a amazing medical series with believability, quirkiness, oddities, subtle humor, endearing charm and wonderful casting."
1,"i'm not knocking dora, but there is only so much dora we can watch around here before mama starts to go crazy. when a kid is sick and video limits are extended, i pray for diego to be the favorite over dora! plus, it's educational."
1,"Interesting concept for a superhero, with the consequences to their family and friends. Again well written and well acted, and nicely done special affects."
1,"There is very little in this Brit com to date it.  It continues to amuse.  Acting is superb, especially in the role of Richard.  Video and audio quality is excellent."
1,I find this seasons very entertaining and the interactions between Sam and Dean refreshing.  This is one of my favorite series that I never get tired of.
1,"This show is cute, witty, humorous, and just plain entertaining.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants some clean entertainment for them or their family."
1,The little short videos is just right for her.  It helps her learn to count and limited Spanish as well as sequencing. Very helpful for learning to read.
1,"My son and I have a lot of fun watching Kai-lan.  It shows my son how to work together to solve each others' problems, friendship and good conduct.  Plus it teaches him Chinese (Manderine), a language I've been interested in learning since thee 6th grade. LOL"
0,excellent acting but do not like such fast moving dialogue and switching back and forth between different scenarios.  looked like excellent story line though.
1,"You will enjoy this show. It has just what your looking for, excitement, drama and those scenes that almost take your breathe away!"
1,Not a fan of this series. It has its moments and can be funny and has good drama and action at times.  Charactors are weird and crazy. The perso I got it for loves this series and really enjoyed it. So I am glad my friend is happy.  One of his favorite series. I can do without it. Take it or leave it.
1,"So sad that addiction takes over ones life the way it does. Not only does it affect the person, but the family is torn apart as well. This program goes step by step from their daily life, the affect on the family, then the intervention with the outcome."
1,"Really enjoyed Season 1 and that's why I purchased season 2 - but the roles became a bit too quirky and totally unreal and I did not like that Detective Reese was replaced - did not like the chemistry between them.I have one last episode to watch and am not rushing to watch it.  However, Damian is a fabulous actor - great facial acting."
0,"Only the first episode is included with Amazon Prime, so I'm only rating that.This series, despite its intriguing title plays on sensational claims that are not supported by evidence.  I wouldn't consider it worthy of a channel dedicated to &#34;history&#34;."
1,Amazing start to the greatest tv show that has yet to come out. No show has ever induced so much binge watching out of me watched the first 4 seasons on netflix over the course of a few days
1,"Dragged out in the beginning. Was interesting to a point. The others I have said are a bit better. Event, Defiance, and Falling skies where better. Hope that helps. Looking forward to seeing more of those and grim. This has the cast, just needs better to the story line."
1,Its amazing that a first season of a show is so awesome. Just all around good wholesome fun show for the whole family.
1,"I found this movie just an okay movie because they all (the husband, the wife, and the mistress) all get robbed while heis trying to get away to Paris with his mistress..I guess this movie was suppose to be a comedy, however I did not see it that way.Its just your typical husband wants to leave wife because he's found someone else,but she does not want to turn him loose.  There is a terrible twist at the end of this movie,as the Husband who stayed with his wife are leaving town and he happens to pass by two of thefour people that held all three of them  captive.  I didn't know if this was a drama or a comedy.  I sincerely doubtI will ever watch this movie again because it was a really weird movie.  His mistress leaves and he stays with his wife andhas a baby together."
1,I wish I could have went to one of these when I was a kid. Maybe I would have stayed out of trouble and away from the scumbags I hung out with.
1,Season 3 started with a Roar....just like a good movie....and that went on for afew episodes...till drama got in the way....crying babies and more drama that wedid'nt really need.... i dont mind knowing a bit of the crew's relationships butthis season they waste a lot of episodes on this crap. And if you are smart youcan see where this serie is going and how it possibly gonna end.So ..yep lots of great single episodes that gives Science Fiction a big boost butwe known that drama and Religion will eventually take over.So ..at this point...im only looking at the good episodes and i am fast fowardingthe social drama parts that are making me fall asleep.But by the end of this season....things once again are getting interesting...very interesting...and cant wait to watch season 4.
1,"As MST3k is sort of a show within a show within a  movie format, it is good to look at each part as one part can ruin an entire episode.The movie: Even though this movie is from the 90's, it basically ignores all movie advancements since the 50's (like character development, plot, camera angles, lighting, etc.).  Yes this is the man-turns-into-monster plot (or in this case about five men who turn into five different monsters) that was already over used by 1956.  I at first thought they colorized ""Mad Monster"" until I realized that the actors in ""Mad Monster"" didn't have such strange accents.  So yes the movie is bad although the accents and the nonsensical soundtrack are funny enough to make it slightly watchable.Segments: The last two with Mike and Crow were hilarious.  I did like the how Pearl presented the movie with a one word introduction - about the same effort that the producers used to make it.Riffs: No outstanding stingers but a good job by Mike and the bots from start to end.  They of course have fun pointing out that the monster and one of the character's hair are different in every scene.Overall:  Not a classic but a very good episode."
0,This was probably the best season so far. Luckily I saw 200 & 201 when they were aired on TV (censored of course) but the fact that they are censored on DVD is complete BULL****!!!! I can't believe that Comedy Central released this DVD and still censored it.Usually I buy the seasons so I can watch them without commercials and UNCENSORED but I'm content with watching this season online for FREE. I returned this DVD to the store the next day. Comedy Central doesn't need my money anymore.
1,Mental Illness and the family relationship of that person is explored. Both in humor and real stresses to Tara and her family. Worth watching-definitely the entire series is needed to get a complete profile of these characters.
1,"Was sorry to see this quirky, entertaining series come to an end. A great show that ended way too soon"
1,I'm enjoying watching a few episodes every few days. I missed a lot of this series when it was on. I think it's a great show showing that police officers are people too and have feelings and emotions like any other human being.
1,"There were some good entertainers, and some are just dumb.  I kept a paper and pen and wrote down names of the ones I wanted to see more.  They keep them in fairly short bits.  If you are looking to laugh continuous this may not be for you.  But each person has a different sense of humor so give it a try, but don't expect greatness."
1,"This series is so well done! I don't buy all the conclusions that are presented here, but this series will definitely open your mind to some amazing possibilities about our ancient past."
1,"If you like British humor and/or subtle humor - you will like this show it is intelligent warm hearted, it has characters who are multidimensional which makes you care about what happens to them."
1,"The future is now.  I know this was released in '08, but it couldn't be more spot on with everything in the news today.  The same use of words we hear everyday.  Our protection.  For our own good.  It will make life safer and better for the (here is the expression I hate the most) &#34;Greater Good&#34; - whose good?  Not mine that is for sure.  This is how liberty is destroyed.The story line is fiction the premise is not.  The government has the ability to do all of this now; sans the vaccine.  Then again how can you be sure?  Answer:  you can't be sure.  Nano technology is already here - at least the part we know about.  In today's medicine you can swallow a capsule equipped with a camera...ahem or a &#34;Tag.&#34;  We already have this for our pets in case they are lost any vet can scan them to see who the owner is.  And...it is the size of a grain of rice.No, I didn't find the story at all far fetched.  I did find it very creepy because now we are becoming the pet with all of our personal and private information available tot he highest bidder - the guy with the scanner.I found this a very intense story.  The acting was superb and the moral is yours to decide."
1,This series is one we will enjoy watching over again and again. The characters are so nicely developed and the story is so poignant
1,"I really enjoyed watching this show. I don't necessarily agree with the moral lessons it promotes, but the scenery is incredible, and I love listening to the Irish brogue."
1,"The Bob Hope MGM Legends Collection contains seven of the funny man's films, spanning over two decades of Hope's illustrious screen career.  Bob Hope (1903-2003) got his start in vaudeville, and enjoyed a successful career in radio and on the stage, and became a huge star in film and on television.  In the movies, Hope's style was usually characterized by fast talking, witty repartee, and generally being light on his feet.  After teaming with Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour, in The Road To Singapore (1940), the first of the seven ""Road"" pictures, Hope's career elevated to new heights.In chronological order, the films in this collection are They've Got Me Covered (1943), The Princess and the Pirate (1944), Alias Jesse James (1959), The Facts of Life (1960), The Road to Hong Kong (1962), I'll Take Sweden (1965), and Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number (1966).  A quick summary of the films follows:They've Got Me Covered (3.5 stars)Set in Washington D.C. during World War II, Hope plays a newspaper reporter who is on the trail of some Axis agents who are trying to implement a nefarious plan.  Dorothy Lamour co-stars.The Princess and the Pirate (3.5 stars)Bob plays an entertainer on a ship bound for America, who gets tangled up with a princess (Virginia Mayo), when the ship is captured by pirates.Alias Jesse James (3 stars)Set in the American West, Hope is an insurance salesman who sells Jesse James (Wendell Corey) a life insurance policy, and then has to try and make sure that no harm comes to the infamous outlaw.The Facts of Life (4 stars)Comedic legend Lucille Ball co-stars with Bob in this sensitive and funny drama about marriage, love, and fidelity.  Not to be missed.The Road to Hong Kong (2.5 stars)The final installment in the ""Road"" series finds Hope and partner Bing Crosby involved in an out of this world escapade, as Russians agents send the pair on a rocket trip to the moon.  Joan Collins co-stars.I'll Take Sweden (3 stars)Hope is a father worried that his daughter (Tuesday Weld) may marry the wrong guy.  He takes her to Sweden to derail her wedding plans, but once there, both father and daughter find romance heating up.Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number (1966) (3.5 stars)Elke Sommer plays a starlet looking to get away from it all, who gets a misrouted telephone call from a real estate salesman (Hope), which instigates a kooky escapade that threatens to break up two marriages.These seven films illustrate that while Bob Hope's unique comic style evolved through the years, in many respects, it remained essentially the same.  Ranging from Westerns, to swashbuckling tales, to wartime adventures, to the close of the Crosby era, to coming to terms with the beatnik generation, the affable guy with the quick wit, endless quips, and ski slope nose was there to entertain.  As this set has apparently gone out of production, getting a copy may unfortunately be a difficult and expensive proposition.Due to a glitch at Amazon, this set and the film Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number are linked as being the same product, so this review is listed for both products."
1,"REVIEW FOR THE BLU-RAY:This isn't your father's ""Star Trek"". For good or bad, rebooting a franchise often means reinventing it and J.J. Abrams does a terrific job establishing this alternate ""Trek"" universe in ""Star Trek"". ""Trek"" rises from the ashes of the last ""Trek"" film ""Star Trek:Nemesis"" and became both a critical and box office success breaking the record for the most profitable ""Trek"" film. Be prepared for familair characters behaving...a bit differently in Abrams take on ""Trek"".EXTRAS-we get some good ones in this set.We get a commentary track featuring J.J. Abrams, Damon Lindel (producer), Orci & Kurtzman that focus on everything from discarded plot elements to happy accidents that made it into the filming.The deleted scenes aren't all finished; for example two involving Nero's ship and another one involving Sarek returning home have unfinished CGI work. The bulk of the rest of the scenes are pretty well finished. We get an extended scene of Sarek and young Spock as well and finally find out how (at least this Kirk)reprogrammed the Kobyashi Maru simulation in the deleted scenes. In the finished film we're not told how he did it. A nice touch in the film is that Pine as Kirk eats an apple as he takes the test just as he did in when describing it in one scene of ""Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan"".We also get featurettes on ""Aliens"", ""Costume Design"", ""Ships"" (including some discarded concepts for the Enterprise), a featurette on Gene Roddenberry's Vision and plenty of interviews with cast and crew discussing tackling the new ""Trek"".The Blu-ray looks exceptionally good. Those lens flares that you see were intentional as Abrams is fond of using them to give the film a sense of ""reality"".The plot if you're interested--Nero (Eric Bana) an anguished Romulan captain of a mining ship gets sucked into a black hole taking him into the past. After the destruction of Romulus from a natural disaster, Nero wants revenge against Ambassador Spock (Leonoard Nimoy) who he holds responsible. Cadet James T. Kirk (Chris Pine)plans on stopping him. In this ""alternate"" glimpseinto the Academy years we see how Spock (Zachary Quinto), Kirk(Chris Pine) and McCoy (Karl Urban)meet, the obstacles including a lack of trust between Spock and Kirk that they must face to defeat Nero before he destroys Earth."
1,"Season 3, the last season of Gavin and Stacey, is the unfortunate end of a great situation comedy.  Not since the best addictive television comedies like Seinfeld and Cheers before it, has there been such a show worthy of a dedicated following--and sadly America doesn't even know about it. I just happened upon Gavin and Stacey and after a couple shows, I watched 3 seasons of it in 3 days. The best aspect of this show is that there are truly talented actors who wholly inhabit their characters.  The most annoying, off-putting, characteristic of any show for me, particularly a comedy, is when an actor is constantly aware of what he's doing--the audience is watching him act.  His/her, ego is on full display completely thrilled at this opportunity to strut his stuff in a show.  That doesn't happen in Gavin and Stacey.  Some of these characters are over the top, and you believe them, even love them for their idiosyncrasies.  Gavin and Stacey are two very nice people, who you might know.  They are genuine and sweet and innocently funny.  But the characters that surround them--their families and friends--are straight-up crazy, funny, flawed, sweet, loving, honest people--just like your aunts, uncles and friends.  Pam, Gavin's mom, so mom-ish--loving her prince of a son, sexy with her husband, sometimes trying to be who she isn't, giving and selfish, fussy and warm--is simply funny.  Smithy, Gavin's best friend, is somewhat rotund, cutting back on his eating with a 6-pack of chicken, corn on the cob and other sides, at the end of a night of partying; always greets Gavin with a shared hip-hop song and choreography--with Gav's mom and dad joining in when they're around--quite capably, I might add; rolling on the floor in a tussle with his younger sister--another hip-hop master; and, an all-round hysterically funny good guy!  Brin, Stacey's uncle is embodied by Rob Brydon, of The Trip...OMG, I adore him... Brin lingers just a minute too long when he hugs Gav, and he is harboring some secret experience...that happened on a fishing trip with his nephew, Stacey's brother...it was very cold on that trip... And, last but certainly not least, Nessa, Stacey's best friend.  Nessa is a hearty (like Smithy) Welsh lady, who is completely blunt in her honest, slightly stilted, take on the world.  She can assist her bouncer friends at the local night club, and go head-to-head with Smithy on a KFC mega meal, where a butter-dripping ear of corn becomes an unexpected bit of foreplay.  The only thing that an American audience might take a bit of getting used to are the British and Welsh accents...but please, give it a minute...the Welsh accents become another great joke.  This only negative about this comedy is that there are not 5 more seasons to hang out with these people.  This is a great, funny and very warm ensemble show."
1,This series should still be on but it ended. Don't miss it though. Interesting plot and great characters.  Loved it.
1,"This show isn't about feelings, but one of the best scenes in tv history makes two actors at the end really stretch their credentials. Shane and Lem really pull it off. The noose starts tightening for the strike team and their cheating ways."
1,"Both my sons loved it watching. Well made, good story line very appealing for the kids of 5-6 years old. good time duration"
1,"Awesome season. I love the show. I have seasons one , two and three. I will be getting season four when it comes out."
1,"I'm well aware that American dad has its haters, and I don't always disagree with the criticisms.  However, I really think the show keeps improving, both in writing and comedic jokes.  To me this deserves recognition as most shows rely on the same tired formula and writing, which eventually gets lazy and repetitive (see the office).  American Dad has really tried to make itself a bit better as it grows, and this season shows it.  I'm not going to argue that its shakespeare, or the best comedy going, but I give credit where credit is due.  This volume made me laugh constantly, and unlike most american dad episodes, they didn't feel quite so disposable.  If you're a fan of american dad, its a no brainer, get it, you'll love it.  If you have seen the show, and only kind of like it, this volume may surprise you, give it a chance."
1,"This was on of the best if not the best movies that I've seen to come from Spain. Just about every element of this movie was crafted with loving hands that put the finishing touches on each and every scene before you and I would ever see it. The acting from Laura  played by (Rueda) was very good as her emotions changed from a loving mother to a panicked, distraught woman on the edge after the disappearance of her son Sim'on. The other case members also give good performances, but Rueda is the standout in this movie. The director worked magic with his cast and crew to bring this story to life from the beautiful orphanage remodeled into the families home. The cinematography was noting short of spectactular from inside the home to the beach and cave to the shots in town where the accident occurs. The mood was thick enough to cut with a knife and is so seldom seen in movies of this genre where mood can make or break a movie. The writer and director were able to turn words into this increadible work of visual and audio art. My only real issues with this movie is it seemed to drag a bit at times and the tension buildup was not always rewarding or paid off (ok we heard that but?). I would have liked to of seen more from the ghosts prespectives than was shown. I don't need tons of cgi or gore to make a story good, but I do need payment and thats where this looses a few points. Did it ruin the story/movie? Not at all. It was just not as exciting/terrifying as it could have been. What happens to their child is a good and bad twist to the story and again kind of a let down after all that happens to the family and especially to Laura.Rating 0 to 5Story = 4Acting = 4+Direction = 4+Mood = 4+Fear/Chreepy Factor = 3.3Gore = 2 One scene was gorySex/Nudity= No/NoEntertainment Value = 4++"
1,"the interaction and balance of characters here is superb. kitchen is dry and charming, ms. weeks is excellent as the plucky young officer and the fellow playing milner is well done with just enough equal parts bitterness and practicality to make him believable. they are an amazing ensemble."
1,Loved it from the first episode and could not wait for the DVD to be released so I could watch the episodes over and over.  It is just that good.  I am hanging out for more as the first Season only had thirteen episodes.  I believe it has now been definitely picked up and therefore can look forward to many more.  Do yourself a favour and watch it you will not be disappointed.
0,"Gold rush season number two  was a complete wast of time, and I did not enjoy this program at all."
0,"Saw this on the 'Tube,pretty boring and usual envrionwhacko conspiracy type plot and bad corporation,good citizen defending the ""wetlands"" and nature.Conservationists ironically can only conserve Nature and nothing else in Human Form,The rights of The plants and animals trump Humans.Shame that Roberts and Denzel both good actors were in it."
1,"I'm glad this popped up as an instant play title on a movie rental site I subscribe to. I wasn't quite sure what to expect with a title like ""Infidel"", with a man dressed in Muslim attire eating a bagel! Well I was pleasantly surprised and entertained - this is a movie that pokes fun at two different cultures but does so in an irreverent and funny manner.Mahmud (comedian Omid Djalili) is a moderate Muslim who may not be fully observant but considers himself a true believer and takes pride in his family (wife, son, and young daughter). His mother's death brings a secret to light - Mahmud was adopted, and his birth name was Solly Shimshillewitz! This revelation predictably upsets Mahmud and causes him great confusion. What is he to do? Can he reveal his secret to his wife, children and close friends? Given the strife between the Palestinians and Israelis and the general climate of distrust between Muslims and Jews, how is Mahmud to reconcile his Jewish heritage and his Muslim identity?Fortunately, Mahmud finds help in Lenny (Richard Schiff). Initially, both men are almost enemies, constantly bickering and fighting, but when Mahmud discovers his Jewish background, he turns to Lenny out of desperation. This results in some truly funny moments - Lenny teaching Mahmud how to shrug, how to say ""oy vey"", and prepares Mahmud for a 'rite of passage', accompanying Lenny to a bar mitzvah! This may all be funny, but there is also a sense of poignancy. Mahmud's efforts at getting in touch with his inner Jew has to do with his attempts to meet his dying Jewish dad who is in a nursing home.Amidst all this, Mahmud also faces the problem of how to handle his son's impending marriage to the step-daughter of a radical Muslim cleric. The scene where the cleric comes to Mahmud's house to check his family out is one of the funniest in the film. Mahmud can't bear to think what will happen if his secret is found out...what is Mahmud/Solly to do? The acting by Omid Djalili is amazing, and he is able to credibly convey the comedic elements of his character's plight as well as the poignant moments. The portrayal of the Muslim and Jewish cultures is well done and though the movie does poke fun at both cultures, it is a balanced portrayal. The supporting cast is equally brilliant and the result is a farcical comedy that entertains."
1,Cranford is totally charming from the first moment.  I found myself watching 2 shows in an evening... and searching for the second season.  Please tell me there IS a second season???
1,It's a pretty good program. It is reenacted but still very good. I enjoyed it. I think you will too.
1,I have watched the first three seasons of this show and have always been more interested in the background and history of the haunted sites than in the sightings themselves. That leads me to believe that there are many great stories out there waiting to be told.
1,What can I say this has to be the best animation of a cartoon series I have ever seen not to mention it was way ahead of it time when it came out and still going strong as far as stories go directing and development especially with the first 3 season of the seasons.
1,"Pounded through this show, the 30 episodes has some bumps, but all and all is a great ride.  There are some great stories and intertwining of story lines with giving you just enough new information each show to keep you interested."
1,"I normally don't watch television during the week, so this was one of those shows I meant to watch, but never did.  What a shame, because it's actually very funny.  I like all the characters, even Veronica.  Everyone does a wonderful job in this one, and it's a shame that it didn't last."
1,We watched the series and was bummed that it didn't continue. We heard they were making a movie and glad that it released on dvd at the same time as the theaters.  The did a great job continuing the story and with a good ending.
1,"I just love the series Heroes and have all of their seasons, it a great TV Show which I highly recommendpeople to see it! But to Understand it, you will have to start out watching the Seasons in order i.e. do notwatch season 2 without watching season 1 First, or you will have problems figuring out who's the good guysand who's the bad guys!"
1,I enjoy these true story episodes and this one rates right there at the top for me.  If you are into this kind of thing you're going to enjoy these shows.
0,(1.) Dumb; not a comedy no matter how bombastically distorted the characters were.(2.) No lesson or message to be learned in these absurd caricatures.(3.) Only the genetic abnormalities found in the world of Hollywood and it's hanger-oners would find the perversions of romance a fascinating story.
1,"Mike and Frank always find interesting stuff in the back roads of America. Most of the things they find are of interest to many folks. They really seem to enjoy their picking, and have come up with a good show. It is well planned and produced. But Antique Road Show it is not."
1,"now we enjoy Cody and Joe...entertaining show for the adults and teens. Learn something, get entertained, and enjoy family time"
1,In Plain Sight: Season OneLow price.  Arrived quickly and just as described.
1,"So many movies about fat girls fall flat (such as Phat Girlz) so when I first heard of this show and its premise, I was very skeptical at first. Even with a good premise, a show can fail very hard.Fortunately, this is NOT such a show. You get this gorgeous, 24 year old model who dies in a traffic accident, and a little mishap in Heaven (or beyond, or however you see it) along with a bit of stubbornness on Deb's part causes her to crash back to Earth - in a body entirely not her own. She is now stuck as 32-year old Jane, a woman who might not be gorgeous but is very smart.Some of that smartness rubs over onto Deb, who gains surprising insights with her new brain. Deb does the best she can in the body she is now stuck with, and of course, this leads to some funny and/or sad situations. What is especially bitter for Deb is that she works with Grayson, her finance. At least, her finance back when she was still known as 'Deb'. As Jane, she has to start all over, which is so hard because she longs to tell him the truth.There's a lot more to this show than just this, each episode also focuses on a legal case (or two) and Deb, with Jane's intellect and legal experience, must combine this with her own knowledge of things from her model days.Overall, this is a very good show - better than what I would have expected. For some, this will have a 'chick flick' feel to it. If you absolutely hate that kind of stuff, then you won't enjoy this, but rest assured, this show has enough serious and thought-provoking moments to make it a solid series."
1,I rated this a 4 star because the film was grainey.  I suppose this is the best it could be after all of these years.  What a treat you start learning about Dr. Who's start
1,"I thought the presentation was done in an honest but fair way and didn't avoid the impact of the father on his sons, both positive and negative. The acting was well done by all...everyone in it should be proud they were a part of it."
1,"The stories and the acting is great, the equipment, cars, uniforms telephone etc. are true to the period, great mystery."
1,Great season. Colby does a great job hosting. The competitions are fun to see. You get to see some weapons that are awesome.
1,"Imagine if one of your old favorite TV shows was resurrected with a ton of special effects and a huge production budget. Here you go with the new Doctor. I really like all the new Docs, each has their strengths. Matt Smith takes the baton and keeps things going-you won't be disappointed.  (I predict.)"
1,"This show takes an exciting look at a crucial time in history.  If you can get past the sex scenes, the show does a great job showing this complex time in England."
1,Lie to Me: Season One Dvds. Good Delivery Time. Great Drama series.My husband wanted to see this after seeing two of the shows and we loved it!Amazon had great low prices and DVD in Perfect condition!
0,Very pedestrian. Not very interesting. Gave it up after first two episodes. Don't recommend it. Watch something else. Not very good.
1,"Revel in his awesomeness!!! For he is a god amongst men and he is deserving of all praise that can possibly be heaped upon him. The one time the Emmys got something right!! Jack Bauer is as close as any fictional character has become to being superhumanly powerful, and at some times his recurrent circumvention of the bureaucratic system, assaulting his friends and co-workers, his flagrant abuse of ""prisoner's rights"" and his uncanny ability to fight his way out of any trap... it may require a little bit more suspension of disbelief than would normally be necessary in a lesser show, but the very core of this show is Jack Bauer, or more specifially, Kiefer Sutherland and his increasingly better performance each season of 24. When he is having a particularly emotional moment, you feel it exude from the screen.... this is just an example of the power that Sutherland brings to this show. Also standing out as always is Mary Lynn Rasjkub as the wonderfully ascerbic and wicked-tongued Chloe O'Brien. The introduction of her character is one of the best things that's happened to this show. But this season has some other stand-out characters: one that was introduced in season 4 and a brand new one. Fans of the show know these as President Charles Logan (the wonderfully slimy Gregory Itzin) and his first lady Martha Logan (the amazing Jean Smart). Their interplay and their performances are almost as key as Sutherland in this season. Another thing that came to be almost an in-joke is that three members of the cast of the original ROBOCOP film appear in different parts of the series, which as a fan of that film was just really cool to see. Whether or not that was intended, it's still a nice touch for genre fans. Julian Sands has lots of fun chewing up scenery as the evil Russian-yet-English-Accented Terrorist. The premise is per usual: Jack must defy all odds to save the country and avenge his personal losses. But the plot itself is of a higher level of complexity and tragedy this season than prior seasons. The way it begins is ALMOST as shocking as the way the season ends. And the ending of the final episode of the season... that scream you heard in the whole of the United States and parts of Canada and Mexico... that was me. January 2007 CANNOT GET HERE SOON ENOUGH!!!"
0,"Season 4 was almost as bad as Season 1 was good.  I could easily write a 10 page review detailing the various issues I took exception with, but I will suffice with a complaint list.1. The plethora of plot twists.  Even M. Night Shayamalan would've said enough's enough.2. Bringing people back to life.  I know that they were never confirmed dead, but they were dead enough.  I thought Prison Break was making a bid to be a soap opera.3. The various coalitions.  How many bad guys can you work with just because ""you need them.""4. The sloppiness of The Company.  Whereas the General wouldn't even say a word in season 2, by season 4 he was a chatty kathy.  He was equally careless with who he killed and how.5. The slipperiness of T-Bag.  T-Bag left almost as many dead bodies in his wake as did The Company but by the end of the show I knew one thing: if a nuclear bomb went off the only survivors would be cockroaches and T-Bag.  He had more lives than a cat and the uncanny ability of always having just enough information to keep himself alive.6. The Scofield boyscout act.  In season 1 and 2 Scofield's reluctance to kill was an endearing quality.  It made you realize that he was no real criminal, he was only in his position due to trying to help his brother.  By season 4 I was sick of the ""I won't kill"" act although he repeatedly faced immenent danger.  Ultimately, that left others to do the killing for him or him accidentally killing people (i.e. the man he hit with a piece of wood then fell and cracked his skull).  The only time Scofield actually pulled a trigger... surprise the gun wasn't loaded.  Heck, Sarah killed more people than Scofield did.7. The resilient bodies.  I finally began to tire of the amazing faces and bodies of the cast.  I don't mean amazing as in stunningly good looking, but as in their abilities to heal so quickly.  Normally I afford a show a lot of leeway when it comes to suspended belief: manhole covers that weigh five pounds, concrete that easily crumbles, abilities to run long distances at top speed, etc.  But, I guess once a show starts to go south every annoyance is amplified.  From the beatings, stabbings, shootings and other abuse Scofield, Burrows, T-Bag, Bellick and Sucre took, they should still be hospitalized.  Scofield didn't even have a visible scar from getting his brain tumor removed.  Their abilities to take beatings and survive and make a full recovery free of any scars or lasting disabilities became unbearable.8. My indifference.  In season 1 I was at the edge of my seat.  I was holding my breath with every close call.  I was exhaling with every escape.  I was enthralled by Scofield's detailed planning.  I was even quite torn up when Lincoln was taken to the electric chair.  All of those emotions and feelings were dulled by season 4.  I was no longer at the edge of my seat, I was no longer exasperated by their capture or thrilled with each triumph.  And that was the single greatest disappointment of season 4.  Each scenario was one that had been played many times before in a different format yet the outcome was always the same.The show lost its umph and lost its luster.  There was a severe lack of imagination and hence a sharp drop in quality.  It seemed like actions of Scofield and The Company were directly proportional to the writing.  As the writing got sloppier, so did Scofield and The Company.  It just sucked to see the show flame out the way it did.  Even the ending was anti-climactic.  The show would have been better off ending at episode 12.  But, being honest about the entire show: how sustainable can a show called ""Prison Break"" be?"
1,"If you're not a fan of the Venture Brothers then I'm not sure why you're even here reading this review.  For fans of the show, I highly recommend season 3.  It's a decent continuation of the show, good story lines and entertaining episodes.  The humor follows the standard formula of the show.  Overall season 3 isn't as good as the first two seasons, but is still well worth watching if you enjoy what came before."
1,This show has a little more of a scientific approach to ghostly investigations.  I would recommend this show to everyone.
1,"I love this English TV show that focuses on the lives of many inhabitants of 2 small towns side by side in the Victorian era.  The characters are lively, loveable and their stories are heart warming, family centered and honest.  So many refreshing universal truths are emphasized in each episode. The writing is delightful!  I'm sure this was a huge hit in Europe."
1,"I like watching this TV Show because I'm an avid vampire TV Show (Vampire Diaries, The Originals and Dracula) and Vampire movie (The Lost Boys, Dracula, Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn 1&2) fan."
1,"As the season goes on, the characters of Morse and Lewis are more deeply developed. Views of England and customs enjoyable."
1,"We found this because I love Jeremy Renner and was looking for what else he has done.  He's great here and I was happily surprised with the quality of the rest of the cast. This is both funny and touching and quirky and weird enough but not too twee...  Actually,  it's charming.  It's a charming series about quirky cops going through their days.  I'm so sorry it wasn't continued but these few episodes are gems.And I have to plug Amazon prime here,  through it we get access to amazing shows that we would not watch otherwise.  It's terrific value!  So it's a win/win!"
1,"Not as much fun to watch as Inspector Lewis or Inspector Morse.  This is worth watching, but maybe I'm spoiled by the enchanting characters of Lewis, Hathaway, Morse.  I would watch again or more though, because in love the English acting and writing."
1,This is one series that from edition to edition you are in complete wonderment as to what will happen next. Each edition iscompletely different each time.
1,"I only recently discovered this show and have been watching episode after episode at a voracious pace. Sadly, I have reached the end of the line and was a little disappointed by the fact that they cancelled the show where there were still quite a few things to look forward to.In this last season, they changed a little Cal's character. Basically, he becomes a little more aggressive and obnoxious, which works great and Tim Roth has the ability to keep shining with his portrayal of the mesmerizing deception expert. I also liked the fact that they moved away from the FBI cases from season two and went back to the basics.There was some weird stuff going on with Loker, but that part of the story never went anywhere. Towards the end of the season we get introduced to a new character with quite a bit of potential, but I guess we will never find out if this is realized. Unless another network picks this up (hint, hint).This has been a very fulfilling show, with interesting cases presented to the viewers, personal stories that enriched rather than hampered the overall experience and outstanding performances. It truly is a shame that it ended when it did."
1,wow a good show. To good of a show not to have a second season or even more. I know firefly is the best show ever not to have a second season. this one is in the top 10. first 2 hours are a little slow but after that hold on.....well worth the power to run the tv. if You love science fiction you will love this
1,"Yet another blazing, edge of your seat thrilling 24 hours in LA.  We lose a few more personnel but still manage to muddle through large scale corruption and the worst terrorists ever"
1,"While it was only about half of a normal season (I assume due to the writer's strike), it was still filled with many different and varied situations along with some enduring story and character development themes.  I highly recommend watching the whole series (all 4 seasons).  I'm glad I watched them through all at once instead of waiting a week for each episode."
1,"American Dad was getting better with every season (or DVD volume) and now it has reached 5 star level.  The reason is that it is consistently clever and well-written.  There are many 5-star episodes here: ""Tearjerker,"" ""Office Spaceman,"" ""Stanny Slickers II: The Legend of Ollie's Gold,"" ""Spring Break-Up,"" ""The One That Got Away,"" and others that are solid 4-star.  I watch AD as often as I watch Family Guy and South Park.  Watching the episodes from this past season, it has now surpassed FG in writing and storylines.  Stan and Roger rule!  Now, here are the episodes:Disc 1:""Tearjerker""--James Bond takeoff where the main characters play different roles except Stan who plays himself, of course.  Roger is ""Tearjerker"" who has a plan to make everyone in the world cry themselves to death.  Can Stan and his new fiance stop him?  A lot of clever one-liners in this one.  My favorite: Francine's character asks Stan for a light and he pulls out a flashlight, ""Looks like you've got yourself a cigarette there.""  The opening credits are cool.""Oedipal Panties""--(Get it? Oedipus?) Stan's mom keeps getting dumped on the third date and she runs to Stan for comfort.  Stan and his mom's disturbingly close relationship and the fates of Stan's mom's boyfriends cause Francine and Roger to investigate.  Roger's fat woman costume is hilarious.""Widowmaker""--Francine wants Stan to share things with her like her friend's CIA husband who's gone missing.  When Stan complies, Francine finds out that some things are best kept to one's self.""Red October Sky""--Stan's Soviet nemesis before Communism fell (how old is Stan, anyway?) returns a converted Capitalist--until he gets hold of Steve.  Weak ending.  This is my least favorite of this volume.""Office Spaceman""--AD redeems itself with this episode. Roger poses as a photographer who has the uncanny ability of taking photos of a certain alien (himself).  He is hired by the C.I.A. to head the Alien Task Force.  Meanwhile, Francine throws out Steve's African American science partner but for different prejudicial reasons than the obvious.  Hilarious episode.  I like when Stan says, ""You have to take this seriously, both of our asses [Bullock walks in]...are equally nice, we both have nice butts.""Disc 2:""Stanny Slickers II: The Legend of Ollie's Gold""--After a near death experience, Stan is afraid he has left no legacy on the world, so he tears up his property looking for Oliver North's buried gold.  In the meantime, his daughter collects piercings and his son goes steady with a vacuum cleaner.""Spring Break-Up""--While Francine is away, Roger hosts an MTV Spring Break party at the Smith's and Stan hangs out with a frat girl who appreciates his jokes and quirks better than his wife.""1600 Candles""--Steve's going through puberty and, after the hell they went through with Hayley, Stan and Francine use their C.I.A. connections to postpone or prevent it.  Meanwhile, it's Roger's 1600th birthday and no one cares--well, one scaly friend does.""The One That Got Away""--One of Roger's personas has taken on a life of his own and, when he uses Roger's credit card, he experiences Roger's wrath.  Very creative story.  I like the Jimmy Stewart character, Sidney, and his girl Judi with her old school gangster girlfriend accent: ""figgas, I finally find the perfect fella and he's a fig newton of someone's imagination.""  I was told she is a takeoff of a character on ""The Little Shop of Horrors.""""One Little Word""--Stan becomes Bullock's #1 guy and he can't say no to his orders no matter how much they interfere with his family.  That Cocoa character is funny.Disc 3:""Choosey Wives Choose Stan""--(Remember that Jiff commercial?) When Stan finds out Francine was engaged to another man before they met, he fakes his own death to see if Francine will run off with her ex.  Also, Steve keeps being attacked by a stray cat.""Escape From Pearl Bailey""--Stan's girlfriend Debbie (is she going to be a regular character?  She just comes and goes) runs for student body president against Lisa Silver.  When she is slandered on the Internet, Steve takes revenge on Lisa and her cronies.  I like when Amy is driving down the hill and it appears Steve cut her brake line, ""Oops, that's the clutch.""""Pulling Double Booty""--Jeff breaks up with Hayley and she goes on a rampage.  To prevent future outbursts, Stan tries to find a man for her who is like himself.  It appears she finds the perfect man in Stan's eyes when she falls for his C.I.A. body double, Bill, until Bill tries to score with Francine.  Now Stan has to pose as Bill to keep Hayley sane.  Meanwhile, Steve has more bad luck with animals.""The Most Adequate Christmas Ever""--Know-it-all Stan dies chopping down what he views as the perfect Christmas tree and has to go to court while in Limbo for a second chance.  A silly episode but not terrible.Bonus Features: Deleted scenes that are best kept deleted.  ""Tearjerker: And Then They Will Cry""--The making of the James Bond episode, how the characters were created, etc. 15 minutes.""Roger: Master of Disguise""--Character designers, storyboard revisionists, the supervising director, etc. talk about Roger (my favorite AD character) which includes a discussion on his sxuality.  I like to think that Roger is to AD what Cartman is to South Park.  Cartman is without any moral conscience and therefore opens the door to a myriad of storyline possibilities.  Just as Cartman is capable of the most heinous of acts that anything he does works well with his character, Roger is so crazy that he is capable of getting into all sorts of predicaments and schemes and it works--not to mention all those disguises.  11 minutes.""Comic Con [2008]""--Live table reading of ""Pulling Double Booty."""
0,"I heard about this from my son, he said he just laughs and laughs. I don't. I find the mom character the most amusing, especially when her son said he used to pretend she wasn't his mother, she said &#34;me too&#34;...much like the comedy Arrested Development (I believe she is the same actress). Other than that, I haven't so much as smiled."
1,"What can one say?  Great casting, gorgeous and accurate costuming, detailed and accurate sets and great stories.  It is visual dessert."
1,"I just love this show, there arnt a lot of hero type movies anymore, Timmothy Olyphant is great for this role. Hope to see him in more movies.  I also plan on reading more of elmore leonard books ( The guy that wrote fire in the hole, witch is where this show came from)"
1,We really enjoyed Eureka. Has all the right ingredients for our type of Sci - Fi..comedy and drama with some thought provoking ideas thrown in. It's ashamed this series was cancelled while lesser shows survive.
1,I really like all of the NCIS episodes and enjoy the interactions of the cast. I've purchased all of the series up to and including season 10. In April when 11 is over i will purchase those as well. My wife is currently watching all of the seasons and is having a good time and laughing a lot.
