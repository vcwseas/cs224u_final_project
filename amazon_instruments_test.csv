1,I don't think this toner is all that great.  It doesn't seem to do anything.  I'll use it because I have it but definitely won't buy it again.
1,"Upon arrival, the bag that was containing the perfume was drenched with leaked oil. The writing on the bottle had rubbed off. Other than that, the scent is great and lasts a long time. Maybe you will have better luck than me."
1,"A fine product to help a bit in controlling acne. Works fine for controlling back acne. Not too harsh, but can make skin dry."
1,I love this Black Opium. I have had several compliments. After finding out that the original Opium is no longer &#34;Original&#34; I was not willing to spend the money for it. The reviews for this oil were very good and very well deserved. I will be reordering.
1,I use this for my husband and he hates me every time I ask him to put some on his fingernails coz it really stops him from biting it. LOL
1,Nice toner.  I used it at night and it does a good job at getting any makeup that I missed off.  It smells great too.
0,"I had high hopes for this product because of all the amazing reviews, but it really let me down! I switched over from Bliss No Zit Sherlock face wash because this one was cheaper but unfortunately I've experienced horrible breakouts ever since. My pores are clogged and I'm getting zits all around my hairline and chin.I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone who has acne. Very disappointed!"
1,"This color, Passion, is very light, sheer and subtle. It looks like you are almost wearing nothing, yet there is that little whisper of pinkthere. It stays on pretty well, especially if you use a good topcoat."
0,"I was very excited to try this toner, it's all natural and the price is good. I also read so many good reviews that I was confident about my purchase. I was first very disappointed by the smell. It smells like roses, kind of, but like an old grandma's flagrance. Fortunately the smell doesn't last, but I quickly realized that the toner made my skin very oily, even if I don't have oily skin and I started to breakout after a week. Not great... I'll look for something else."
1,"for any moisturizer you have to be careful to not put on so much because your face will get oily. But I must say overall, I love this product. I have been using it for years now, and it works every-time. I can definitely tell a difference by just using it just once. My face looks brighter and the tone is more evened out. This product is extremely recommended to those with sensitive skin!"
1,"This is the first Aquis Microfiber towel that I've purchased but I absolutely love them! These towels are very thin and lightweight, but are insanely absorbent and will get you dry in a flash (and all you have to do is pat dry very gently to accomplish this, there's no need for any harsh continual rubbing of your skin with this towel). Because of this, they're way gentler on skin and hair. They also dry rather quickly after use, so you don't have to really worry about any of the ickiness that usually comes along with soggy, damp towels. Just a note, it was strange to use at first because this towel doesn't glide smoothly along your skin like most towels do (which kind of makes it necessary for you to pat dry with it). It sort of sticks to you or grips you, if that makes sense. A bit weird at first but not a big deal. I love these towels and will not use anything else for my skin/hair again! Highly recommend, A+!"
1,"Love this Blush, it is the only brand of blush I will wear. NARS is quality and you will not be disappointed"
1,"I love this product and this color is beautiful! It also lasts longer than other products, thanks OPI!  It is so nice for summer."
1,"So far I have painted ""Sparrow me the Drama"" and ""Mermaid's Tears"".  I'll add photos as I remember to take them.  I love the creamy colors, and they look great on my yellow toned skin.  Two coats is sufficient, but it looks great at three.  Very long lasting color- I think the best formula since they dropped the big 3!They look beautiful!  I loved the mauvey Sparrow Me The Drama, it was feminine but still current.  Mermaid's tears is just amazing- so many compliments on it."
1,"My skin is softer and more supple.  It has reduced the appearance of lines and improved the texture of my skin, making it softer and younger looking.  It has also managed to reduce the darkness of my under eye circles, something that many other products claiming to do that failed at! I highly recommend this!"
1,"I wish I had known about these years ago!  They're the perfect shape for removing nail polish that didn't end up in the right place - much better than your average q-tip.  They're more firm than q-tips, which is great because they keep their shape a bit better and don't leave little pieces of cotton all over the place."
0,"I have suspicions that this  may be a counterfeit.  I purchased this because it was rated so high.  After washing and drying my face, my face starts to burn.  I then have to rush and put moisturizer on my face as quick as possible to avoid/eliminate the burning.  I have also noticed some dry patches on my face since beginning to use this.  Finally, my face burns during the day if I happened to sweat outside.All three of these experiences are new to me.  I have never experienced any of these things with any other cleanser."
0,Left my curls sticky and greasy...and I didnt like the smell at all. Im a 3c with very thin hair and this product weighed my hair down and left it super sticky and greasy even with the cowashes.....I used it once and ended giving it away to my 6 years old niece.I'll continue my journey testing different products...
1,One of the best anti-bacterial and viral on the market. This soap handles many problems associated with aging which is a bacterial problem.  Neem Oil not the kind for insect protection read the ones on how the Neem oil works in soaps & salve.  Neemaura Skin Salve and Thera Neem Leaf shampoo & skin lotion.  Most folks do not understand that you must detox your bod as you age and their are 180 different types of bacteria on the OUTSIDE of your body.  Two of which if allowed inside can kill you. While there is somewhat of a order that lingers I do not find it offensive.  What offenses are women who ware perfume to the guy. This soap also need to be tough to kill bacteria and so folks with sensitive skin should use on the backsides and legs and areas that are not so sensitive.  You will find itching is significantly reduced when these products products are used. Another must have in you 'aging kit' is Redmond Clay is also a fantastic product NOT TO BE WITHOUT.
1,"This glue did it's job perfectly, I had huge false feather eyelashes and they stayed for a two hours dancing show without moving at all and when I came home it was easy to take them away, so recommended stuff!"
1,"Bought Jamaica Me Crazy and Big Spender colors.  They are very close in actual purple shade but Jamaica Me Crazy is shimmery iridescent with jelly consistency while Big Spender is a flat creamy polish.  The actual purple shade is nice and bright, almost magenta like.  Because Jamaica has a thinner jelly consistency, I had to use 3 coats to get opaque coverage.  Spender goes on thicker so only 2 coats are needed.  Staying power is about the same as my other Essie polishes."
1,"Creamy texture is just right for my face--not too heavy nor too light.  I use it as night creme, and I wake up with my face smooth and no irritation!  I especially like its sensitive skin feature."
1,This oil has a very rich and long lasting scent.  Because of the pepper and cinammon it starts out a little masculine but after about 5-10 minutes the florals and vanilla start to make their appearance and this scent becomes very sexy and feminine.  Love it!
1,"This wash is really good at making acne prints fade away, and stops current acne from leaving dark marks. Normally I will get a pimple and it will leave a really dark mark that would take forever to fade. With this wash, I've noticed within the first couple months most of my old marks are gone, and even if I get a new pimple, it doesn't leave a mark, or the mark is really light and fades quickly.I really love this wash. I do think its pretty strong, so you should adjust to your skin's need. I first started using this wash once/ nightly. I love the way my skin looks really refreshed when using this wash, so I started to use this wash morning and night. However that was too drying for my face. My mouth and chin area would get really dry and flaky. It was so bad it looked like i had a fuzzy beard of skin. (horrible) Once I figured out it was the wash, I cut back to once /nightly and it stopped.I really recommend this wash if you have stubborn acne, breakouts, oily skin and acne scars/prints."
1,"I've been slowly adding to my Burt's Bees skin care collection since I started using the Radiance Day Lotion & the Citrus Facial Scrub (and loved them both). So recently I added this product, the Facial Cleanser - and I love it just as much. First of all I have to say I have super sensitive skin. With most product lines I cleanse & moisturize and end up with a burning, stinging face. This product is like most Burt's Bees: so gentle. I also have rosacea and extremely fair skin, so I can say for those fair maidens out there - this is good stuff!I love that it's 100% natural in a time when most beauty products are riddled with chemicals and preservatives. In fact, this cleanser is so natural that when a little bit of it got into my mouth, it tasted sweet like orange juice!The olive oil in it makes your skin feel delightful after use - typically most cleansers leave my skin dried out and parched, but not with this Burt's Bees cleanser. If you know much about skin care, you also know how wonderful olive oil is (for ALL skin types) and has been used for centuries as a ""beauty secret"" so I just adore Burt's Bees for including it in this cleanser. Since I began use my skin has seemed so much softer, more fresh, and healthier in general. I rarely get any zits or pimples, except lately I've been pregnant and sometimes get a few breakouts from the hormones. This cleanser does seem to help the mild breakouts as well.I've found my cleanser, will use the rest of my life, I'm sure."
1,I'm using this one the most since its my favorite smell and makes my hair soft and untangled.  Would buy again from this seller since the price was excellent and the bottle is big and authentic.
1,I am older and my very oily skin has become quite dry. I never realized how much Olay 7 in 1 Effects was changing my skin until I saw how I looked after about two weeks. I initially thought that a problem I was having with itchy eyes might be due to Olay 7 in 1 but it was seasonal pollen! I have VERY sensitive skin and Olay not only seems to be hypoallergenic it is the most fantastic product (not counting Olay Regenerist!) I have ever used.
1,really like this this wash.  i like the mild scrubbing it gives you and what ever it has in it that leaves your face tingling after you rinse off.  i use it morning and night.
1,"I've used Exuviance for years and it's worked great. I hate the pump for the night cream.I wish it would come in a jar, like it did decades ago. I find the pump annoying."
0,"I had to give it at least two stars because it is effective at helping nail polish adhere without chipping. However, if your nails are prone to peeling or chipping, this will make them more brittle, dry, and prone to peeling. Switched to Nailtiques #2 and it helped them recover."
1,"Judging by all the positive reviews I expect this stuff to work but it smells horrible. The stench is so strong to my nose. I collect colognes and so my nose is used to smell a lot of stuff and this stuff just offensive. After washing my hair and rinsing several times, I can smell this in my hair for over an hour afterwards. I don't even need to run my fingers through my hair and smell it... its just like an aura around my hair that stinks. Tried it for a couple days and I had enough.. If you don't mind the stench of tar, enjoy!I use head & shoulders instead. It works for me but is a bit damaging."
1,"I got this as a free sample with another purchase. It's creamy and works as a sunscreen. I have oily skin and after several hours, my skin looks ""dewy"" but not as oily as with other more expensive moisturizers I have tried. My skin also got more even colored (I tend to have redness in the cheeks). I can't give it 5 stars because my skin still feels oily to the touch, but otherwise I am pleased with it."
1,"Like some of the other reviewers, I do find it a little drying. My skin is very sensitive and does not react kindly to cleansers of any kind. I appreciate that it is fragrance and sulfate free and I have not had any major breakouts since using this cleanser so for those reasons I give it four stars, if it was more moisturizing I would give it 5 stars."
1,"My new find and obsession. It cleanses my oily (!) skin without drying it out. It is very important since most people with oily skin try to use something that will give them that squeaky clean feeling, except it only triggers skin to produce EVEN more oil! This product does the opposite: it moisturizes and cleans without irritating the skin. It's all natural and it smell wonderful, like fresh oranges! Absolutely definitely a must!"
1,"This is the only product that caused a market and noticeable reduction in my fine lines. if you are buying just one, buy this one.. and a good cleanser to use beforehand."
1,"This masque feels nice on your skin, but beyond that it had little benefit for me. It certainly didn't help clear my pores, in fact you could see the clay visibly clogging them even after I rinsed the masque off. If your skin is as oily as mine this will not take care of the oil much at all. I felt refreshed right after using it but within a few hours I was back to my normal level of oiliness. Overall, I'm not impressed. There are several other masques around this price point that work much better than this one for my skin."
1,I got the product in good condition.  Product as described.  Doesn't dry the surrounding skin.  It's ok for it's price.
1,"The wand is short, the entire product is short. I must have missed the size description. Does the job just a bit too small for my needs."
1,"After seeing the reviews of others who have tried Olay Regenerist and raved about it, I decided to try the Serum and the Night cream myself. I have been using it for a week now. Though I don't see amazing results like some of the reviews I read I will admit that the skin on my face feels different. It's definetly softer and smoother, but I didn't notice any lift, or wrinkles around my eyes dissapear. I am 42, and I thought that it was time to try something different, so I gave this stuff a try. I think I will keep using it, and I think it was worth the money for the softer, smoother face. Maybe I'll give that eye cream a try too..see if that diminishes the crows feet that are starting around my eyes. I'll let you know. The night cream is nice. It smells great, and goes on smooth. Oh, one thing I did notice is that my makeup (foundation) goes on smoother and I don't have to use as much."
1,"I must start off this review by saying that I am a faithful user of Bare Escentuals products (foundations, eye shadows, blushes, brushes, etc) for years now and I always will be because nothing can compare on my skin for me personally. However, unfortunately I must give their ""Full Flawless Face Brush"" 3 stars for 1 main reason: It doesn't last long, especially for the price. When I first buy this brush, it is perfection. It's extremely soft and does flawlessly apply Bare Minerals foundation. But then after about a month (give or take a little), this brush begins to shed its bristles a lot and also loses all of its silky softness that it has when it's new. I thought perhaps I was doing something wrong such as applying too much pressure while applying foundation but I have tried every sort of pressure as well as buff techniques and it always ends with the same result, being worn out. I also purchased the Bare Minerals special brush cleansing conditioner hoping that instead of having to buy yet another replacement brush that it would clean and condition the bristles to make it like new (or close to) again but no suck luck. So sadly this is the only Bare Escentuals product that I am not in love with. It is becoming too expensive to constantly replace my ""foundation brush"" so I am considering using a different brush that I have had for years that is still super soft and does well with application. I will add though that Bare Minerals other brushes such as the concealer brush and the white brighten and moisturize brush are wonderful. I just seem to have a problem with the foundation application brush only.I still recommend Bare Minerals for everyone to try because it's a wonderful line but I am disappointed that this brush hasn't been updated. I really hope this review helps you!"
1,"I am an African American woman with 4a-4b hair. I love this stuff. It moisturizes my hair, protects from heat and strengthens my hair all at the same time. I only use it when I am about to flat iron my hair. I've been using it for almost  year now and I will gladly keep buying. I am also interested in buying more products by this company. I just wish the 16oz container came with a spray bottle. I had to buy a cheap empty spray bottle so I could use it."
0,"We were pretty disappointed with this shampoo and conditioner. Had high hopes for it, and it did not deliver.The smell was okay.It was harsh and stripping on the hair follicles.Left our hair with that squeaky clean feeling, but not in a good way, more in a removed all the oil from your hair kinda away.Even in using the conditioner, my hair still looked frizzy. And I do not have frizzy hair! Mine is fine, thin, and straight. If anything I usually border on having my hair be too silky and need things to volumize it.Just cannot recommend this product."
1,"I love this product. It does everything it claims! I use the eye cream which is amazing, as well as the serum. You will not be disappointed."
1,"I bought this Revlon ""Kiss Me Coral"" lipstick about a month ago for the first time.  Although it is labelled as Coral, it is actually more like it looks in the picture--a slightly orange-y red.  I was nervous about that when I purchased it, but it turns out it actually is very flattering with my skin--I have very light, fairly neutral skin (I do get red cheeks, but with foundation it evens out). It works well whether it's applied and blotted just a little bit (for a nighttime look usually) or for a daytime look, if it's blotted a lot it looks like more of a stain.I also think it looks very pretty when I use it as a cream blush (very lightly applied of course).  It's a ""creme"" lipstick, so it's not sparkly and it's also not matte--very creamy and smooth.  It lasts rather long as a lipstick actually, and for me I need minimal applications throughout the day.When I originally bought this, I was looking actually for a lighter more true ""coral"" color (I was thinking more pink) but I guess I'm just attracted to bright reds!  I am glad I went with my instincts and chose this."
1,"This is one of my few constants in life ---that this product will ALWAYS work, it never changes, no matter how many years has gone by!I have been using this for years and am amazed at how well this setting powder  works---as long as you follow the directions!!!Frankly - I do go a little outside the box at times and use this with other foundations and cover products.  It still  it works a treat!  Of course I feel a tad guilty by not always using the Derma-Blend foundation and quickly go right back to it.Follow the directions and you will quickly find that this is not cakey, not overly drying (you must remember just why you are using this product) and will help cover nearly every kind of mark, veins, scar, tattoo etc.It will keep everything water-proof so if you cry with it being used on your face or get your legs wet  while using this to cover spider veins or whatever - while it will not bear up to a harsh and hot shower, it  will be no problem for quick dashes in the rain or a dip in the pool.I have dry eye -which means it constantly looks as if I am having a good cry -all my tears all day long, does nothing to dislodge my Derma-Blend until I takeit off just before bed!"
1,best conditioner ever- better than most shampoos and conditioners (salon brand included) out there in the market. Love the aveda-ish ajurvedic smell. Highly recommended.
1,"This brush iron is absolutely fantastic!  I have long, fine hair that has no natural volume.  Even using volumizing shampoo doesn't do much.  However,  I was able to add some volume by using volumizing mousse and this brush.  That combo finally did the trick and my hair doesn't go flat five minutes after I style it!"
1,Bought it out of curiosity. I don't really see the point. I think I rather just shampoo my hair. It'd be cool to have on camping trips or something but I don't camp.
1,"Love the smell of this. I can't say about its effectiveness, but I would think it is pretty good (not miraculous). Just buy it for the smell if you're in doubt."
1,This one is soooo GREAN ! And I love it...my daughter stole it from me after one use. My face feels so smooth...we love it!
1,"Olay's Regenerating Serum is marvelous!  I use it at least twice a day under other treatment or color products.  The serum does help heal little spots quickly, gives the skin a fine texture and makes a perfect makeup base.  If I were on a desert island, I'd want this product and some sunscreen--and a bit o' chocolate. ;-)"
1,"I have written on this product before, and so far it is working very well. I had an Amazon customer ask me a question. but I have been having a hard time reaching her. First of all I am a retired RN,  Licensed Court Reporter, and many more. So I do know many very difficult word.  &#34;You might wonder also&#34;. On the label the word PARABEN is tagged on to a larger word.  PARADEN is a natural preservative, and used in so many products even colognes.  I looked at my Opium and Evidence which is made by Yves Rocher, which are expensive products, and there were the word Methylparaben, and Ethylparaben.  The same words are on Lovely by Sara Jessica Parker.  I hope that this helps other customers also. It's safe.This is truly a great product, and I have been using it on my arms, chest, and hands.. I love to experiment. I am so pleased when I look in the mirror every AM, and there is a well rested person looking back at me.  But, remember a little goes a long ways.Fonnie Hall"
1,First of all let me tell you this preface:I am not an american and it's been only 2 years that I'm here in the US. I am white and my hair is too curly. When I arrived here I happened to experience massive hair loss because of the big differences in the weather and water materials between here and my native country Iran. I lost not only lots of my front hairs - frontal lobe of my skull - but also some of the back of my head. I used to use minoxidil some times a go in my country so I wasn't unfamiliar with the product but those that I used to use there didn't have a considerable effect on my hair growth so I assumed it would be same here. Despite of this facts I ordered this product for the first time 5 months ago  and I used it as I was supposed to: every morning and every night for more than 4 months and my hair grew back and still is growing. I had a haircut 2 months ago and my hair dresser told me so. My front head is having new hair. I wish I could add some pictures to my review but I can't because I am a Muslim and our religion is a little bit strict in these matters.I love this product and I will use it again and again because as you all know if one stop using minoxidil after some time it'll cause hair loss to return. I should wait and give some time to my hair to get stronger and healthier. There is only one thing that I should add to the Side Effects of this drug : Minoxidil is a vasodilator and some times it causes headaches in particular cases but it's not life threatening so don't worry and enjoy seeing your hair growth with it.
1,"What more is there to say? DUO glue is the best. My fake eyelashes have endured the windiest days to sweaty, brutal, headbanging concerts. Perfectly put every time I get back home. Duo glue is the best for sure. I use either the dark or clear formula, I put liner over the seam anyways and they both work just as well."
0,"This is the phoniest haircolor I have ever used. Been coloring my hair for a few years now for the &#34;grays&#34; and this is the worst. Looks like it's painted on, and &#34;dark brown&#34; apparently means black. Totally fake look. Can't wait until it fades and goes away. Beware. It's not very good. Many better, more natural looking options available these days."
1,"I have been using this product for several years.  It does an excellent job of keeping my skin looking its absolute best.  My skin is smoother and softer than ever before and it really helps diminish fine lines and wrinkles (esp. around the eye area).  Acne is also a thing of the past.  I haven't had any breakouts since using this product.The glycolic acid concentration is very high so if you have never used this type of product before I strongly suggest you acclimate your skin by using Level I products for a few months, then move to Level II for a few months before using the Level III products as it will burn and possibly irrate your skin"
1,"It made some of my hair look purplish. My hair looked really pretty in the sun, though; so thats a plus. But overall, this product was great!"
1,"Oh, I just love this stuff.  It lathered nicely, but not too much and left a wonderful fragrance.  My dog was VERY stinky prior to her bath with this item.  Not only that, but it seems like my dog is not shedding as much as before I bathed her with this.  I highly recommend this product."
1,I am happy with this mascara over all. If I apply it carefully it doesn't clump; it never burns my eyes. It does run if I sleep with it on. It comes off more easily with eye makeup remover.
1,"I decided to try this product when I came across it to see how well it works since everything else that I have tried tend to dry my face out and make it feel tight and stiff. This does the exact opposite, my face doesn't feel dry after using it and it has a certain glow to my skin after using it. The best part of it all is that I can use it daily without it irritating my skin. Love it and would suggest anyone to try it."
1,you cant go wrong with Hugo by Hugo Boss...still the same..kind of a gold standard fragrance for men..Mild yet smells wonderful...Can wear it everyday...great price at Amazon for a 5 ounce bottle...
1,this product worked great for my relaxed hair.it left my hair soft and smooth i use this and coconut oil and my hair turns out soft. this works better for my hair than herbal essence long term relationship leave in.
1,"I originally purchased this at Target to replace my very expensive Jurlique Balancing Cleanser @ $32 a bottle. Both are mostly organic products (70% or more organic) and I've found that to greatly benefit my skin. While I am just getting used to this product, I will say that it removes makeup without a problem.I am a pro makeup artist by trade so I use & try out TONS of makeup products from foundations to mascara. I don't understand the other reviewers saying that it doesn't remove makeup. I **does** remove makeup on a consistent basis without stripping or drying. Waterproof mascara is a whole other story, but there are special products on the market for that.This cleanser has a great scent, foams up great, and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. What more could you ask for in a cleanser that's actually good for your skin?I will be keeping an open mind and will update in a few weeks with my final thoughts so stay tuned for that!***1/26/14 Update: I am in love with this stuff! My skin has never looked better. It doesn't break me out at all, leaves my skin very clean, and improves texture. I recently bought the new Covergirl Bombshell mascara that everyone says is impossible to get off. This removes it with no problem. I will repurchase this!"
1,"I don't curl my hair every day so I didn't need to get a high-end curler.  I dropped my old curling iron (10+ years old) and had to buy one from an all-night pharmacy.  I paid twice as much as the Amazon price but was very happy with the curling iron.  What a surprise to save 50% thru Amazon for the exact same product.  Now I have one tucked into my overnight bag for visits to the grandkids.The iron does everything I need it to do.  Heats quickly, evenly, and has an automatic turn-off.  The barrel is the perfect width (you'd be surprised how much this can vary.)  It feels great in my hand without being cumbersome."
1,"Before I used this my hair was previously dyed an orange-red, with a bright fire-engine, semi-permanent, red.The semi-perm red had faded, leaving me with streaks of the original red mixed in. So already, I KNEW that this probably would not get rid of that red shade entirely.I'd been curious about this bleach for awhile, since I usually have light blonde hair, so I snagged a box of this.First off, the formula, when mixed, is MUCH thicker than any dyes I've used before, so I did find minor difficulty making sure it was covering all my hair and even getting it out of the bottle. Some of my true color (dark blonde) was growing in, so I made sure to leave that for last.As the bleach developed, the red became an amazing light baby pink color, My roots turned a gorgeous white and the orange-red is a slightly lighter peachy-pink.It's really pretty if you're into unusual hair colors (Which I am).Another thing I noticed is how SPARKLY my hair was after dying. I imagine if my hair had been blonde to begin with, this would be lovely.The conditioner is a nice touch, it's a purple toner which really pumps up the white-factor and I also used it to successfully &#34;tone down&#34; some of the parts of my hair that were too pink.So all in all, very pleased with this. If I had used it before dying my hair red, I'm positive that it would've gotten to a nice platinum."
1,"it does work but it works slowly.  i had very thin eye brows and now they are starting to be noticeabledejuan neilson280 wheeler rdgray, ga 31032"
1,"Love it.  Unlike most of the microfiber that you see today, this looks more like a suede than a typical towel. It comes with a little sturdy pouch.- Super absorbent- Small and portable, great for travel- Well made, quality and amazing detail- Very light- Not as bulky as a regular towel so it takes up very little space in the washer- Dries much quickly than a terry- Price is a bit steep"
1,"LOVE these. They do leave a lingering peach bellini scent and keep my skin looking even, feeling smooth, and staying clear."
1,I love the smell of this stuff! It's also very soothing on my skin and it feels refreshing after applying it. It doesn't dry my skin out too much either. My skin actually glows now and has a more refreshed look. I would highly recommend this product
1,"I hate lotions because it makea me feel like i have something on my face and some will make me break out as well.  Nothing I found made my face feel clean and refreshed.I have tried various different types (both expensive name brands and not so expensive ones from drug stores and other retail) and hadn't found one I like.However, i found aveeno face scrub wash worked really well with my skin, and decided to give this one a try.I can say, I have finally found something that i can wear without the weight or the break out.  I think i will be using this for a long time.i'm soooooo glad to have found this lotion.It makes me feel refreshed without all the weight nor the breakout."
1,This is my favorite color for this time of the year.  The price on this polish is great compared to buying at a salon or a beauty supply store.  Love it.
1,"I do like this face cream. It does not have perfume. The consistency is watery and my skin absorbs it quickly.  However, on those days when my skin got very dry, I found it to be not moisturizing enough. I recommend it for the summer use. For winter, it depends on your skin. If your skin tends to be very dry, then you may want to find something else."
1,"Eyebrow pencils basically color the skin beneath the hair, when it's the graying hair that begs to be colored. A very bare touch of the wand, followed by a tissue to spread it across the surface hairs solves the problem for those of us with graying brows that used to be brown."
0,"My breakouts had gotten worse just a few weeks ago, so I picked this product up from CVS. I adore Aveeno products, such as their haircare and their lotions.... so I had high hopes for this. I used it that night in the shower, and when I got out, my face felt like I had a horrible sunburn. I looked in the mirror, and it not only felt burned, but looked it too! I'd be lying if I said it didn't scare me. I've never had a product do that, and I've tried A LOT of things... not to mention my skin isn't 'sensitive', aside from breaking out. I decided to give it another chance, used less product and rinsed it quicker than I had before. It made my face slightly red, but it didn't feel like sunburn. I figured it was just a one time thing, and let it go. I used this face wash for well over a month before I gave up. It didn't help clear my current breakouts, nor did it stop new ones from sprouting. If anything, I felt like my face was more oily than it's ever been, due to this, I've been using baking soda to get my skin back on track. So far, the baking soda is working... then I'm going back to my Clean and Clear."
0,You get what you pay for... it's in my trash can. I've never used one of these before and never will again.I got the thing so tangled in my hair and almost thought I was going to have to cut my hair at the scalp to get it out.This is for short hair only!!!
1,"I got the duo brush on because i thought it would be easier to use than the tube, it actually is very hard to get it to work. It dries very quickly making the container all sticky around the opening and you cannot wait the recommended 30 seconds before applying. Actually the timing is hard to get right too, too early or late and it won't stick. It usually takes me 3 tries before i can get it to apply to my lash line correctly and gives the glue look after so many attempts.Although, because it has the vitamins in it, and the different formula it does not feel too heavy or itch my eyelids at all! and once it is actually applied correctly (on all sides) your lashes stay put! In fact they stayed on for 2 and a half days while I was on vacation and at a theme park, going 60mph plus on rollercoasters until the sides finally popped up.So, it is hard to get it to work, but once you get it to it works good!"
1,I wash my hands a lot and as a result they show it - this cream is the best by far in healing my dry cracked skin and cuticles.
1,"These are smaller than I expected, but they were able to keep my thick curly hair up. Plus there are so many of them. It's a great price and the actual clips are really sturdy."
1,"MMMMMM. Yummy smelling. I use it in a reed/stick diffuser and put a few drops in the water pot on my Wood pellet stove. Keeps the air moisturized and smelling nice, with the water/oil combo. Great for every home. Reliable seller. Trustworthy. I am going to make up the bug repellent brew i just read on here. Especially as a deterrent against spiders. This OlD home we live in needs such a product. Eco-friendly, here we come!"
1,"It's perfect for normal to oily skin and has SPF 15 in it :) but wash your hands before you touch your eyeliner brush it really stings if it gets in your eyes, a lot of moisturizers in the past haven't."
1,"I started using Avalon's Biotin shampoo and was so impressed with what it did for my hair that I thought I would try  their skin care.  I have back and forth with many products, Dept store to Burt's Bee's, to you name it.  Happy to say that I am in love with this product for my skin.I am a mother of twin toddlers, skin, hair changed after hormone changes and I have had quite a difficult time trying to find what would suit my skin.  My skin is now normal/dry, when it used to be oily/combination.  I have had quite a few breakouts but I think that had to do with products I was trying and that it irritatd my skin.  I have the crows lines, and a few lines on my forehead.I used both the eye serum and face moiture cream and it goes on so easy, very light and very moisturizing.  I noticed that my face is no longer dry, not oily, just perfect to where is should be.  Skin does get tight as advertised, but not in a way where your face is burning or dry.  Just taught.Pleasant fragrance of essential oil Lavender. Light, not overbearing.After using for a week, my face no longer has break outs, feels soft and appears brighter.Highly recommend."
1,"Light lotion, absorbs quickly, virtually no scent (no strong chemical smell.)  Excellent basic light night lotion especially if it's a hot night.  As with all neutrogena products, not a problem for my acne prone skin."
1,"To me it looks like a very deep charcoal, but some people have commented on my manicure and noted that it does have a hint of purple. I thought so too, at first, but after a few days of looking at it I just see it as being a deep gray.I really love it though. It has all the classic trademarks of a good OPI polish. It goes on nice and smooth and dries very quickly. Two coats is what I used to get a nice even color. It looks so rich. It's edgy, but not so much as black. It's understated and eye catching. A very classy choice for someone looking for a nice dark."
1,Not greasy and dries smooth on your body. Smells pretty pleasant and clean not so much of the scent but more of the smooth creamy feel.
1,"I've been trying many things to threat my acne and nothing works but this, it is like a millions dollars little jar. I abs love it. it stings a lot, specially the first week, but who cares, you are getting a prettier and healthier skin. buy it you won't lose your money. I been using it for about 4 months so it is time enough to see changes. I saw like ones I'm the first couple weeks, the blackheads in my nose were no longer there and my pores reduced their sizes. you won't be disappointed."
1,"This is the best (course) facial scrub I have used. It is course and does &#34;kind of&#34; feel like sand paper on your face, but this is what I want. I constantly have dried skin and this does an excellent job of removing the dead skin while cleaning my face. The smell is also very nice."
1,I have very oily skin so I am prone to getting acne. I've been using this mask for a few weeks now and I have seen a nice improvement. My pores have gotten smaller since I began using them and it dries out my acne. I apply the mask about once a week. I bout it from Walmart for about $3. It' a quality product for a reasonable price. I recommend it to everyone.
1,"This is a great roller set.  They heat up quickly and the clips hold well.Originally I couldn't imagine how 5 rollers would cover my entire head, but this does.  I have long, fine hair (past my bra line) and this is how I wind up doing it:  I use 1 roller for the top section, and then 2 rollers on each side.  I leave them in until they cool down, put on makeup or other stuff, and then a few minutes before I pull the rollers out I spray my head with a light hairspray.  Once I pull them out I flip my hair over and run my fingers through to loosen it up a bit. Spray a bit more hairspray to hold it all in place, and off I go!  The end result is a nice head of loose curls that seem to last me all day long.The only thing you need to watch is there is a slit that runs about halfway up each roller, which is where it sits in the heating section to heat.  I've read reviews where folks had their hair caught in this section.  I found that if you make sure when you roll your hair you stay 'inside' the edges of the roller (and not let any of your hair travel loose over the edges) you should be fine. I've never caught my hair in there (yet).Not sure this would be a set for travel, however, as it may take up quite a bit of room in a suitcase.  I've seen different units where you steam just 1 roller at a time and if I needed a smaller set, that might be a better way to go, but this one works for my everyday set and so far has held up well."
1,"This was a gift for my &#34;old fashioned&#34; daughter. She's been trying vintage hair styles and a bonnet hair dryer was required for many of those old styles. She loves it! It packs up easily and is easy to use. It doesn't get too hot so it doesn't burn your hair, It also doesn't have a long cord for mobility but grab a book and sit a spell. Your new hairdo will be a blast!"
1,"Yummy smelling and fun in the tub. It's got a lovely blue color and the seaweed is fun to watch float around, but if you want to keep that from happening, use a stocking. The saleslady at the store showed me how to make ""Mermaid Water"" and it was fun to do.To make it, toss in the bomb (or if you break it up like I do, just a bit of it) and then crumble up some of the Sunny Side bubble bar under running water. The water turns blue and foamy and it's like you're sitting (or swimming) in the ocean."
1,"I love the NARS brand and did enough online googling to figure out what color works for me.Purchased Funny Face & Shanghai Express, so far I have used Shanghai Express 6 times in the past 4 months, and Funny Face only twice.  I am more comfortable with red than I am with pink I guess.It stays on better than Bobbi Brown Lip 12.  It's very pigmented and appears smooth not cakey."
1,"I've been using MD Forte products for 18 months, and have seen a noticeable difference in my skin. I've progressed from Level I to Level III. My dermatologist suggested I use these products containing glycolic acid--not for sun damaged skin--but for congested, combination skin. It works! I often times layer different MD Forte products: lotion, cream, and sunscreen! It works for me! I also use a Clarisonic brush..."
0,"This is probably one of the sissiest exfoliators I have ever purchased. It has beads so small I might as well use my Aveeno face exfoliator because it's not doing much. Smell is ok, packaging as in the container is less than ideal... some of mine started leaking rather quickly."
1,"Unless you buy this by the caseload, I THINK you will get a better price at your local drugstore.  The jar I received was tiny (my abd for not checking the size more closely).  The product itself is great for my very sensitive skin.  It takes off makeup and eyemakeup like nothing else can."
1,"I am African American with relaxed hair that is thinning in the crown area, due to medications.I recently cut my shoulder length hair to about 2"" (Halle Berry cut). My thinning area really shows now. But, I love my cut. So, I went online looking for a solution. I  felt encouraged after reading the reviews on this line of products.I purchased the shampoo, conditioner, serum and hair spray.Upon arrival, I used the hair spray. I saw no difference in my thinning hair. A few days later, I decided to wash my hair and try the other products. My expectations were low, after seeing no results from the hairspray. Boy! Was I surprised.After shampooing, conditioning, and using the serum, my hair felt thicker. It was also smooth, soft and shiny. I couldn't believe it. After allowing my hair to air dry, I applied DermMatch to the thinning areas in the crown. I combed the DermMatch through my hair until my hair was completely dry. Using a paddle brush, I brushed my hair thoroughly to remove any excess DermMatch. I then flat ironed my hair. I finished with the hairspray. My hair looked amazing. It looked like I had just stepped out of a salon. It was so full, shiny and healthy looking. I then applied a small amount of Enjoy smooth and shine to add more sheen. Although my hair felt a little stiff from the spray, it really wasn't. My paddle brush and comb ran easily through my hair.Before bedtime, I put a few of the foam rollers that are wrapped with satin in the crown area. When I removed them the next morning, I could not believe how my hair had curled. My hair is normally hard to curl even when I use setting lotion. I had rolled my hair dry and got curl and body. I brushed out the curl, added a little more Enjoy smooth and shine and the hairspray. Voila! I couldn't believe the results. It looked as if I had grown more hair overnight.This line of products seem to work in synergy. So, results are best when shampoo, conditioner, serum and hairspray are used together.I love that the products have little to no scent. They just leave my hair smelling clean and fresh.I am very very pleased with this product line.***UPDATE***I must revise my review of this product line. I forgot to research if the products were sulfate free. My bad! They are not. I have a keratin treatment in my hair and sulfates would strip it. Thankfully, I only used the products once.I have seen a great improvement in the condition of my hair since discontinuing the use of shampoos containing sulfates. My hair stopped shedding.So, I will no longer use any of these products, since they work in synergy.I think I'll try RegenePure products that are sulfate free and also claim to stimulate hair growth.I've also discontinued the use of DermMatch, because I am tired of it getting under my fingernails each time I massage my scalp."
1,Matches description. Gets really hot. This product just didn't work to well with my hair. The curl doesn't stay like it does with other curling irons.
1,"as expected, bought to go with steam set. easy to use, nice results. Good price. Clips can leave a dent but no biggie just go over that with reg curling iron"
1,"Philosophy's line of bath, lotion and fragrances help to perk up my spriits without fail.This lotion is one of their best, especially when layering as it seems to last longer without that cloying, too sweet scent that some women's bath products have, besides that it is a great moisturizer.It is part of a retirement present I am giving a very special friend who I have had the privilege of working with the last 22 years.  I would only gift her the best on the special occasion of her retirement.Enjoy the product!"
1,"When searching for appropriate colors in nars blush for my skin tone it wasn't so easy! So I'm writing this not only to review these blushes but as a color guide to anyone with a medium dark complexion.It's important not to go too light because the blush WILL look chalky or there will be no color payoff. So far these colors have been most flattering1. Mata hariMatte mauve pink. Gorgeous for everyday adds a natural looking flush to the cheeks. It is lighter than MAC slave to love blush which was one of my old favorites before I tried NARS!2. TaosDescribed as a dusty rose, but has coral tones on my skin tone. Has some shimmer but not very noticeable once applied to the skin. This one is very long lasting. Nice for brightening up your day...and your complexion!3. Taj mahalLooks very gold in the pan but adds such a pretty warmth to the cheeks that's a little shimmery and lit from within. There are many ravs about this blush on beauty blogs and YouTube and its true!4. DesireA scary bright bright bright pink in the pan but also very good quality giving cheeks the natural flush you crave for everyday. I've also seen this one on deeper skin tones and it still looks natural and flattering5. Love joyI was wondering if this would show up or just look like shimmer on my skin. After application it was a brownish berry color with slight shimmer and the blush I choose when I'm doing a strong smoky or colorful eye look. Looks very natural on my skin tone. Can't really be used to contour because it has the berry tone. The nars site describes this of a bronzed rose but on skin tones similar to mine would be berry toned.6. Exhibit AI've seen this on light medium and deep skin tones and it is widely flattering! Turns more red than orange on my skin but can look more orange on you depending on your undertones. Every woman should have this one in their arsenal. Some people believe this gives the most natural looking flush of all. It also photographs really well and looks good on video! Lol :)Start your collection with any one of these if you're skin tone is similar to mine. NARS blush is one of the best blush brands out there I encourage you to try at least one even thought they have a higher price point. They are very pigmented and last a long time too!"
1,I love this stuff...I usually order it through QVC but saw it in Amazon and plan on ordering it through this site from now on.  This cleans your face so clean and no fragrances.
1,"Goes on easy, last the entire day/night, moisturizes better than lotion, no odd smell too. Not goopy or thick or oily like others. Heck, if I want goopy thick I would use petroleum jelly. Major drawback is co$t."
1,"The first time I ever went to get a manicure, the aesthetician was taken aback: &#34;You're cuticles are perfect,&#34; she said with incredulity. Since I've been using this cuticle creme at nights for about three years, I have to guess that whatever this product is supposed to do, it does well. What a &#34;cuticle creme&#34; actually does, I'm not totally sure. I'm a guy -- I don't know how cuticles are supposed to look. I just know that Burt's Bees makes good products, and this smells great, so I use it.I've stopped getting manicures because I don't believe a man's hands should be overly pretty. But apparently if I keep using this creme, I don't really need manicures anyway."
1,I have been looking for an organic hand cream for a while and this is it. Absorbs into skin immediately and softens hands without a greasy residue. I will not use anything else now that I have used Camille Beckman.
1,"I found this in Walgreen's once, tried it and loved it!!!  The next time I went back, though, they didn't carry it.  I went to the Bye Bye Blemish site and read some good press and testimonials, so now I want to try the peel, etc., as well as the drying lotion.  I haven't found a substitute that comes close.  I was glad to read that you could add alcohol when the clear layer dries out."
1,"This isn't a gentle or moisturizing soap -- I don't use it on my body much less my face. But it's cheap, it smells good, and it looks cute stacked in baskets or big jars (plus it has wrappers that are great for decoupage), so why not grab some for the kitchen sink?Not to mention that if you grate it or soak it in warm water overnight, it makes a great scented laundry soap for all your natural fibers -- you can have all your clothes or linens smell like sandalwood. Or scrub your linen shelves with it ad have *those* smell spiffy."
1,"steamer is ok.  I think you can get the same results with hot water running in a sink, lowering your head with a towel over your head....oh well."
1,"I'm only 5 months pregnant but I have no stretchmarks (so far), no itchy belly, and it's kept dryness to a minimum in this cold weather. I use it once a day after the shower, all over. I've been using it since I was 3 months pregnant. I took off one star because it's a big oilier than I'd like, but I did try another (more expensive, lighter oil, mamma mio) product and I started seeing dryness, so I switched back to this Mother's Special Blend. The initial smell is nice (chocolately!) but it goes away in a few minutes."
1,"When my curly, thin hair strands go limp after sleeping on them I reboost them with Botanical Boost.  It's just ok, tho.  I won't be buying it again as I still think there is a better revitalizer for those curls out there."
1,"If Caruso ever stops making this product I will be in trouble and seriously sad.  I have baby fine, super straight hair that I have ruined in the past by coloring, blow drying, hot roller, and hot ironing to death all in failed attempts to make it appear as if it had a little oomph.  I've braided it wet, I've have had long uncomfortable nights sleeping on a head full of rollers, I've wasted countless dollars on volume shampoos and still was not happy with the results that would end up a stringy mess within hours.  Until, that is, I discovered the Caruso Steam Hairsetter. This roller is easy to use, very affordable, and versatile.  I use the biggest rollers because I'm looking for more wave/volume than curls but can wrap up my hair in a spiral for nice wave or roll them up loosely for volume.  I use them on dry hair that I've washed the night before, and spritz each curl with a bit of hair spray after rolling up and before putting the cap over the roller.  Then I put on my makeup and take them out for tons of volume that will last the entire day.  I'm not going to claim that my curls ""last for day"" because my hair is too oily and it's just not true but I'm thrilled they last one day and all without contributing to the damage I've already done to my hair.  All you need is an outlet, water, a comb and hair spray (if your hair is as fine as mine), a little practice (if you're new to rolling up rollers) and your hair will look like lovely. I can't recommend this product highly enough."
1,"this one happens to be my least favorite. it has an extremely pungent alcohol smell to the point that it will have your eyes watering. applying it to the skin is like applying very, very thick honey. on the plus side, it is EXTREMELY cooling and invigorating as it is drying. i also enjoy peeling it off and find that the majority of it does come off in one piece, but some glue-like remnants sometimes get stuck to my eyebrows and that is not fun to scrape off. i most likely will not be buying this product again. i recommend sticking to the clay masks that freeman has to offer."
1,Great leave in. My hair is much thicker and holds a nice sheen and bounce.  Moisture without a drip.  Great body and my hair feels much healthier
1,"I was so excited to receive my rose water. I'd never used it before. I was planning on putting it on my hair (mixing it with my hair products).It really does smell good. I would say soooort of like roses lol. And it made my hair smell really good.But all in all, its just water. I just bought some nice smelling water lol. And I knew that from the beginning, but its all so special until you get it. Nice product."
1,"I'm now 62.  I have excellent, wrinkle free skin which I attribute to 3 main things, and if you are much younger and want to reach 62 with good skin, I'd advise you to read these 3 things and consider following them:1)  I never was a sun worshipper in my youth.  In my teens and 20's, we didn't have the knowledge about sun damage that we have now.  In fact, when I was a teen people slapped on suntan OIL to increase the sun's effects!  Lucky for me, I just hated baking in the sun so I rarely did it.  I've only had a few real ""tans"" in my life.  I always hated being so white, but of course now I'm glad about all this in retrospect.  So the lack of suntanning was possibly the #1 thing that was good, and that was actually pure luck as it turned out.  Now, when I'm in the sun I really slather on the highest SPF possible and I just don't allow any tanning to take place.2)  I was never a smoker, and I was also a very light, occasional drinker.  Lifetime smokers (particularly women) really do pay for this indulgence in their later years. Drinkers as well.3)  A certain degree of good genes probably helped, but I think it's mainly lifestyle, ladies.  Everyone I know who was either one or more of these...a constant sun worshipper, a regular or heavy drinker, a smoker....these people now look 15 to 20 years older than I look.  I am always mistaken for my 35 year old daughter's sister.  My daughter has girlfriends who have been solid drinkers, and they now look older than I do.  Drinking takes a toll on your skin.  My suntanning/drinking/smoking classmates now greatly regret doing these things because of the cumulative bad effect it had on their looks.  I didn't know my own lifestyle would  so positively affect my skin 25 to 30 years later, but I'm oh-so-glad I made the choices I made.  It was just luck, I guess, but those of you in today's world have the knowledge about all this and can affect your own outcome years down the road!The next thing I feel has been hugely beneficial in keeping my skin great is that when I was in my mid to late 40's, I started using Retin A on a daily or every other day basis, and Retin A is now pretty affordable (generic now, but still prescription, though). A small tube goes a long long way because you use very little and spread it on your skin very lightly, and after the initial redness that goes with adjusting to its use (this ends fairly quickly), it is pretty much the only ""miracle"" product out there for good skin because it stimulates collagen production, a thing which diminishes with age and leads to wrinkled, less firm skin.  Retinol products are good but much weaker, so go for the real thing.  Get a prescription for Retin A and consider it a big part of your anti-aging regimen, but know that your results won't be as good if you continue to get suntans, if you smoke, if you drink a lot.  You've got to make choices if you want good skin.  Don't do body-damaging things and then expect to find a miracle cream to erase the damage magically...that's not going to happen with any product at any cost.  No matter what they say in the ads, there is no real magic, and the closest thing to magic is good lifestyle choices and Retin A.  Don't damage your skin, clean it properly, moisturize it properly, protect it properly with sunscreen.Now to this Olay serum:  I have extremely sensitive skin, so my challenge has always been to find good products that moisturize (more has been needed as I have aged) but don't irritate.  Over the last 15 years I have tried an incredible array of ""magical"" products, especially the expensive ones in the department stores, brands including Lauder, Lancome, Chanel, Clinique, Mac, Prescriptives, Creme de la Mer,  everything out there.  The cost was horrendous trying these things, and most of them irritated or did nothing exceptional I could observe, and a great many of them were very irritating and I had to return them.  I realized I merely needed moisture on my skin after a point and I needed something that didn't irritate or look greasy.This Olay serum in its unscented version is THE best I've found, in the end.  I use it in the morning only, and it is the best base for moisturizing prior to putting on foundation.  It isn't the only product I use, by the way.  I put it on LAST because of its silky texture.  Before it, I use a moisturizer or sunscreen first.  These days I use a mineral makeup (although I can get away with no makeup at all, and in fact, for most of my life I never used foundation).  This serum goes on great with this product as a final base and leaves a lovely, silky texture. It never irritates.  I usually buy  3.4 oz bottles at Costco for around $29 and it lasts for 6-8 months or more. There may be equally good buys on Amazon, which has the advantage of no tax.I've tried most of the other Olay creams and lotions, and I like this one best."
1,"I alternate between this cleanser and their Fresh Foaming Cleanser.  This one makes my skin feel a bit more ""squeakier"" which I like when the weather is warmer.  This is a great cleanser and should work for anyone except someone with very dry skin. This does not dry out my face and I have combination skin. This is a must have for a gel cleanser."
1,"I have been using this product for years and it never gets old.  I love the herbal scent, the creamy thickness of it and the natural ingredients.  I use it about once a month so the bottle lasts forever.  I have thick, coily, afro-textured hair and this products helps to give it strength and elasticity."
1,I have tried other serums and always come back to Olay Regenerist.  There is one other serum I have liked as well however it costs over $100.00 for an ounce and smells really good but does not work any better.  Olay Regenerist leaves skin silky and makes my skin feel very protected.  I highly recommend and will continue to buy this serum.
1,This is the only makeup that I use and it is the best I've found on the market.  The product does everything it says it will.  Thank you!
1,"This is a great cream for me to use in the winter. I use another, more expensive cream regularly, but if it is a particularly very dry winter, I will use this cream at night. It is light, non-greasy, and has the same reputation as the Cetaphil washing lotion. It is designed for severely dry skin. It's perfect for my skin areas prone to dryness like hands, feet and elbows, yet it&#8217;s even gentle enough for my face. It's non&#8211;greasy and absorbs quickly. Once applied, it leaves my skin feelingAccording to the information, &#34;Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream has quality humectants, emollients and occlusive agents that provide intense, long&#8211;lasting hydration. These attributes of the cream make it ideally suited for dry, sensitive skin and symptoms of dry skin associated with eczema and psoriasis.&#34;I apply as often as needed, usually in the morning and before bed. For best results, use directly after bathing, wetting the skin or washing hands. I use it with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser to cleanse my skin before moisturizing. It is recommended by dermatologists and pediatricians.Recommended. prisrob 01-08-14"
1,very good at bringing out your skins color and giving you a healthy glow. I would recommend this to anyone
1,"It's only been about 2 weeks since I started using this and I have to admit, it does appear to be lessening those vertical lines above my eyebrow and the tiny but frustrating lines around my mouth. I'm hoping this trend continues! And it hasn't made me break out or made me too oily. So we'll see..."
1,"I received a sample (3 oz) of this in a kit. I was wary because the product does not say it's oil-free, and most oil that touches my face makes me break out in acne. However, this stuff works really well. I feel like my face is less oily and more fresh throughout the day. I just don't like how pricey it is since I can get similar effects from a $6 discount store cleanser."
1,"I was excited to try this new fragrance from Mrs Meyers since we've used many of her other products.  Parsley?  I thought... what in the world does parsley smell like?  Not sure  this smells like parsley per say, but it has a very nice scent that is not too sweet and smells very fresh and clean.  As a point of reference, I like the geranium and the lemon verbena scents, and really DISLIKE the basil scent as I think it smells too sweet and ""perfumey""....This is a great price for these and a really nice product... give it a try, tastes vary, but I like this soap a LOT!"
1,"what can i say, it cleans my gray and black hair very well and it also cleans my hair well."
1,This gets the job done. I have the most horrific marks on my leg due to mosquito bites and I'm black so these marks are even darker. This is able to conceal the black marks without coming off too much  I do suggest getting another fix-it spray because even though this does not come off all the way with water it will still come off if it repeatedly gets wet. So I don't suggest using this in water. And don't let it touch anything because it will rub off on it. But it does give your legs a glossy finish and my modeling company uses it on my legs when they put me in shows. So if they're using this then this is beautiful. This does not require you to wear sunscreen with it as well.
1,"this mudd masks works really well and dosent cost that much.  i purchased it from walmart.  it leaves your skin smooth , clean, and it dosent over dry."
1,"Egyptian Goddess is such a lovely exotic fragrance. It has the ability to unleash the goddess in you as it delights the senses. My body chemistry seems to blend better with musky aromatics so this is the perfect fragrance for me. Once I glide the applicator on my wrists, inside my elbows and the pulse points of my neck it tends to transport me to beautiful places(I adore the roll on applicator). I consider it a fragrance that whispers, yet loud enough to be heard without being offensive."
1,"This is a large bottle, of the fragrance-free Aveeno Skin Relief Body Wash. With the Oatmeal it is really easy and gentle on sensitive skin like mine. I've never had a reaction to it, and I can only use this and one other product on my skin. It lasts a long time as well, great product."
1,I love that this serum is non-sticky; does not make me break out and i can wear it under makeup and at night when i go to bed.  I will definitely order again.
1,"I'm sold! I love these things!  I've never used hair rollers before, but I was looking for a new way to style my hair.  I've considered hot rollers for several months, but was always nervous that I wouldn't be able to use them correctly.  I searched on Amazon for several months for the appropraite rollers for my skill level and hair type.  I came across these Caruso rollers and read several of the reviews.  The idea that these are steam rollers was very appealing to me, as I've done enough damage to my hair with constant coloring and highlighting through the years.I tried these rollers out at night (just to make sure I could use them correctly - and hopefully reverse any big mistakes I would make before going out for the day the next morning)...They were actually very easy to put in (and that's something for a first time hair roller girl)!  My hair turned out beautifully and I was super excited about the results!The next morning, I woke up and my hair looked even better!  I barely had to do anything to my hair for the day, and the body and curls stayed all day.I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  I could have spent much more on another set and would have completely given up on the idea of hot rollers.  Wonderful product!  Recommend completely!  5 stars!"
1,"FERIA DOES NOT COVER GREYS VER ELL, WHICH IS WHAT I WANTED. IT MAKES THE HAIR VERY SHINY. NICE LIGHT COLOR WITHOUT TOO MUCH RED TONES."
1,Put it in a sprayer and spray on before bed :)
1,"I love olay, but this is nothing compared to my purple olay night recovery cream. This is still a great product, I just like other Olay products more for my skin Type: Dry, aging, crows feet."
1,I truly love this soap. I have very sensitive skin and this is one of the few soaps that doesn't dry out or break out my skin. Would recommend to others. It smells soft as well
1,"I really like this stuff. It goes on a bit oily and melts into my skin. I've used it on hands, lips, and face. I like it most on my hands. It is 100% natural from the ingredients listed on the back, and smells lovely. I already use most of the herbs from the ingredients, and this is a nice store-bought alternative when I don't have time to make my own salves. It comes in a large 3oz tin. This stuff will last a long time. I would repurchase!"
1,I won't use any other lash glue anymore. This stuff is the best I don't have any complaints will buy again.
1,"The Solia is the hair iron that the three bears would have chosen: Neither too hot or too cold, too cheap or too expensive, it's a product that's just right.These irons can go for as little as $25 or so, and on up to about $150 and more. The cheaper irons can damage your hair, and the more expensive ones can put holes in your hair.  As described (very well) in the ""features"" section here at Amazon.com, the Solia combines ceramic with tourmaline, a gem that creates six times more negative ions than ceramic alone. These ions, combined with the heat (which the user can ""dial"" to a temperature between 140 and 450 degrees Fahrenheit) give you the capability to change the direction and texture of your hair.More than just a hair straightener, the lightweight Solia can give you flips, curves (both towards your face and away), and generally shape your hair.  It's lightweight and heats up quickly.  I don't know exactly how the ""patented Dynamic Alignment System"" works; I do know that the iron glides easily and without pain through short and long curly hair.  Extra curly, thick hair will conform to the new straight look your stylist gave you, and there's a beautiful sheen due to the hairs' alignment.  It comes with an instruction booklet; I'd also recommend the product's website at folica.com.  A product that consistently works well at a resonable price make this an excellent value."
1,"This hand cream has one of the nicest fragrances I've ever come across and it seems to be one that everybody likes.  The cream is non greasy and absorbs quickly but leaves your hands feeling soft and moisturized.  This is the of those products I buy over and over again and have for several years.  It also makes a nice gift in a basket with a pair ofAngela's Garden 7120-921 Kids Garden Glove, Honey Bee, a hand gardening tool and a couple packets of seeds. The people I have given it to tell me that it's become one of their favorites too.  Everyone seems to like it's nice clean smell."
1,These caps are large and are well-made. Plastic is thin but strong. The elastic is quite nice and stretchy too.
1,have been looking for the perfect nude lipstick that offer higher pigmentation for dark olive/tanned skin. this lipstick does not disappoint- matte with a sheer finish. a great match for a smoky eye!
1,Great retinol product that works without the extreme irritation of prescription retin a. A little dryness but still tolerated well
1,Product was okay cord was short curls didn't last. But for the price what do u expect .thats all I could say
0,"This does the job but not easily.  The handle is large and a bit difficult to maneuver.  The brush gets hot fast so be prepared.  I tend to use it on the lower or cool settings.  Finally it is loud, loud like a leaf blower.  I put ear plugs in  whenever I use it otherwise it is too troublesome.  All in all it styles well but I am going to search for a quieter product."
1,"My husband wears hearing aids, and this is a life saver. His ears become irritatedand very itchy, and this saves the day."
1,"Sorry about the title. . . I couldn't help myself . . . . Anyways, Let me begin by saying there are few things more subjective than a fragrance, especially a woman's fragrance. I'm a woman (and proud) and I know how finicky we can be. But that's besides the point, let's focus on Stella.Instead of expressing a biased opinion I'm going take a objective POV. I'm going to explain the ingredients . . .Yes you heard me . .the ingredients . . .Sure . .The /are/ listed here, but do you really know what they are . . .I'm not going to explain them all, but hopefully enough to help you understand the science of the scent as well as the actually scent itself. H'okay, here we go!*Centaurea Cyanus = the common Cornflower aka ""bluebottle"" aka the Buttonierre Flower*Squalene (which may or may not come from the bladder of a shark {most likely its just synthetically created now}) = a natural moisturizer. It penetrates the skin quickly, but does not leave that nasty greasy feeling (not to mention the fact that Squalene blends well with other oils and vitamins)*Glyercin is used to preserve the essential oils and chemicals from the herbs (aka the flowers) . . .it may also be used as a bonding agent.*Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis aka ""Sweet Almond"" (think Amaretto) is used to add a sweetness to the fragrance (durrr)*Cetyl Alcohol is the surfacant which is a wetting agent that allows easier spreading*Cetyl Palmitate is basically just an compound found in most oils . .*Gylceryl stearate is basically a lubricant . .It's used in all types of cosmetics . ..Mostly it comes from animal fat but it also can be obtainesd from some unsaturated vegetable oils (I'd check up on that . . .if you are an animal rights person or whatever . . )*Polysorbate 60 is used to solubilize essential oils into water-based products . . .*As for Dimethicone is mostly used is usually listed as a ""skin protectant"" whatever that means  . . . .*Jojoba oil is an exceptional moisturizer and more importantly, it's used in a lot of cosmetics as a replacement for whale oil (some scientists even claim it's superior to whale oil)*Tocopherol contains Vitamin E which is considered good for the skin :-)*shea butter is said to be a good skin softener . . .*Triethanolamine = a Ph balancer (makes sure the perfume/lotion/whatever isn't too acidic*Citronellol is an oil found in roses . . .It should be avoided by those who tend to have perfume allergies*linalool is a typical chemical found in many flowers and plants . .It also contains Vitamin E which is good . . .*Lavandula Stoechas is simply a type of lavander. it is commonly used in air fresheners and insecticides . . .*rosa gallica = a type of Rose*limomene = a hydrocarbon; you can thank the citris note in fragrance to this*There are multiple other flowers added to the mix so I would l put this fragrance in the flowery category . .As for some beaty tips considering this scent I'd say it's of moderate strength, it lasts around 8 hours or so, it's a casual scent . .not to fancy, but definitely far from plain; and I'd doubt a kid/teen would like the scent. It takes a mature nose to adjust to the kalaedoscope (sp?) of smells that is STELLA."
1,"My wife has been a redhead ever since I met her about six years ago. Well, it was dyed red and looked real nice. She said it was ""hot."" Well, it made her stand out in a crowd, that's for certain. Her natural hair color is a somewhat ""mousey"" medium brown.Lately she's been dissatisfied with her appearance and asked for my advice. I thought she might look nice as a brunette with a slightly darker shade  than her natural color. We went to the pharmacy and picked out a Natural Instincts #20 hazelnut medium brown dye. She loves the new look. Me too. The only problem is that she's now much harder to find in a crowd. However, we're booth very satisfied with the new look and she's going to stay with it for at least two or three years.Gary Peterson"
1,"this is great, soaks in quickly, light scent, only thing that stinks its its kind of liquid like.  i would recommend it."
1,"I like the green-to-black color so much, which can be hardly found in other brands. As usual, it needs to take two layers to enrich the color."
1,"I love this stuff so much. When reading the other reviews I was really concerned that I would end up getting some in my eyes and that it would hurt like mad, but I use it to remove my mascara and I haven't had an issue yet. I only use this stuff at night, because it's a bit too much for my skin to use as a morning and evening cleanser. I recommend it for oily/combination skin!"
0,"In my quest to find the best products for my hair, I purchased this leave-in on a whim, thinking the spray bottle would add convenience to my overall hair regimen. I was so wrong. This product left my hair extremely dry and difficult to manage. I expected it to work like other leave-ins and provide moisture, but all it did was suck the moisture out and leave behind something resembling a helmet. lol The bottle states that the product contains silk protein, but I think there is more protein than moisturizing ingredients, hence the hard hair. I will not be purchasing this again in the future and would not recommend it to anyone."
1,makes any makeup look i do perfect!! i stock up on these and find that i get a better deal on amazon than anywhere in my area so i buy them on here everytime i havent had any problems with shipment so thats really cooli use these lashes with the clear duo lash glue thats the best it last all day for me i already have length in my own lashes so these add great volume without looking drag queenish (not a bad thing ;p) without having to pile on lots of mascara i can do quick sexy smokey eye curl my lashes add 1 coat of mascara add these lashes do a light curl so bring my lashes together with the fake ones maybe one coat of mascara if i feel like it and thats it i have the perfect eyelashes every time without having to fuss about mascara like i use to on somedays they would be spidery and other days they wont hold curl not anymore with the power of fake lasheswould i repurchase ? YES!if you have any questions comment below
1,"This is a great product. It completely covered my grays and the color lasted for a very long time. In fact, I think its coverage and color longevity is better than some of the more conventional brands of hair dye (Revlon, Clairol, etc). The sulfate free shampoo that it comes with is probably the best sulfate free shampoo I've ever used. I'm considering buying a larger sized bottle to use in stead of the one I use now. (Sorry, Renpure.)Only two minor drawbacks. Because the color lasts for so long, my roots grew out A LOT before the color faded. I wish the kit came with some way to mix up a smaller amount when you just want to do a small touch up. I'm not enough of a DIY haircoloring expert to measure out the correct amounts myself. Also, the conditioner is a little bit runny and doesn't seem to soak into may hair. I added a few drops of sweet almond oil to my hair while it was still damp as an added moisturizer/conditioner."
1,I love these cushion hair brushes.  It allows the bristles to have a little more give when you're brushing your hair which provides extra comfort.  It especially makes trying to get tangles out less painful.  It works well on wet or dry hair.
1,"Every winter, my scalp gets dry and itchy, and nothing has seemed to help. I had read that brown sugar scrubs (brown sugar mixed into some conditioner with a few drops of tea tree oil) would help, so I've been using those once a week, but I wasn't getting any long-term relief.  Someone on a hair-care forum recommended this, and, after just one use, it cleared up all my winter itchies!The liquid comes out pretty thin, and it's fairly easy to distribute through your scalp by pouring a bit out and using your fingers to rub it around.  Although the label says that you can apply this in the morning or night, I applied it at night and went to sleep with it in my hair.  It made my roots a bit greasy-looking, but mostly that was because I had the spout open a bit too much and used more than I probably should have.You can use it up to six days in a row, before you need to take a break from it. As I mentioned above, I found relief after just one use, and the hydrocortisone in it calmed my itch right down.It's also Curly-Girl-friendly, for those following a no-silicone, no-sulfate routine.  (The 'cone it has is water-soluble.)Overall, this works really well, and I wish I heard of this product years ago."
1,"I use this with my Mia, as suggested by others, and it cleans nicely while being gentle on the skin."
1,"I am an avid user of OPI nail enamels since 2002--which is to say, I find them excellent.  Easy to apply, long lasting, and beautiful.  This color is one of my favorites.  In the old ""Color Me Beautiful"" world, I am a summer.  The blued pink works wonderfully for our color needs."
1,Works well for its intended purpose and really fills a need for inbetween colorings and touchups. I would definitely recommend.
1,"Great color, great polish -- this stuff is great. OPI always has great quality poilsh and this color is so great for the fall."
1,"This is a very unique scent! It's deep and mysterious and light and floral at the same time. The deep purple bottle is so fitting for the scent- it's dusky, smoky (it doesn't smell like smoke, but it gives off that vibe), with a hint of feminine innocence. This is a hard scent to describe, one that invokes images rather than particular notes. I've not smelled anything like this anywhere else."
1,LOVE OPI.  and all their products.  This one leaves shine on top and is a great base coat too. Will buy again for sure!
1,Love this cleanser. It has something like a soft bubblegum scent that is very refreshing and It really deep cleans and leaves your face nice and soft.This is my favorite cleanser and I have not found anything even similar to this.
1,I love it! and will continue using it but it's fade out after 2 hours :(Great price BTW. in the duty free it's cost $80
1,"I bought this hand soap after discovering what a joy Mrs. Meyer's housecleaning products are to use.  I love that the company is truly green, that they don't use animal products, and that there is no harsh chemical smell because they don't use harsh chemicals.  Cleaning, whether your home or yourself, is all about staying healthy and fresh, scent included.  Unfortunately, this new parsley scent smells more of an artificial honeydew perfume, muddled with something unpleasant that I haven't been able to put my finger on.  If pleasant soaps are one of your small joys in life, then this scent is not for you."
1,"Without the shadow of the doubt this blush is so far the most flattering on all skin. I have read the rewiews of this one and many different ones. I have purchased all kinds of blushes, chanel, Dior, L'oreal,... Name it, I probably used it at some point. Then I read last year about this one and bought it for myself last year. I am obsessed with this one, my daughter is using it, too :)I highly recommend it to anyone. It blends well, has a very delicate shimmer and stays on for a long time, but its not too much! There is something about that particular color as well."
0,"Uhh, did I get a bad batch? I love Cetaphil's face wash, but this was a dud. I couldn't use it on my face because it made me break out. It also was impossible to blend into the skin, leaving a white film for a few minutes until it soaked in on its own. When it did soak in it left a sticky feeling on my skin. Cetaphil failed me here."
1,"I basically lived in the isles of Rite Aid before I found this thing.If you combine it with a sacylic acid cream is it amazing.at night when I have a zit, I clean the area with alochol and apply the cream in the morning wash it off and its shrunk.I repeat everynight until it is completely gone. of course I rub my face in shea butter every morning~ and sometimes bio oil.But, this product is amazing and the price is a lot less than clearisil and others. it really isnt a bad product it is the SAME as clearisiljust less money. (SAME INGREDIENTS) don't be fooled by impaitent and oblivious people. this product works!! :)and if you apply it during day time be sure to rub it in good and apply a moisturizer over it lightly~ hope this helps!!this dosent cure dark spots but it will have yuor face smooth within weeks~ (for me 1 week... for you; mabye more (3weeks?))"
1,"I love that it has more heat settings than a lot of other curling irons, because let's face it, no two girls have the same texture of hair. I typically use a medium setting. It's important for my curls to last all night because I'm a professional wingwoman by trade and my profitability is based upon my appearance. I've had good luck with this curling iron."
1,"We purchased this for our very smelly Basset Hound.  No matter what we did to keep that dog from being stinky, that is just part of being a hound.  This shampoo neutralizes that smell and does not cause any dry skin.  My husband and daughter are very sensitive to perfumes.  We do not even use laundry soap with a scent.  This was a perfect solution for our stinky dog."
0,"My small toe rubs again the forth toe and gives me painful blisters. These toe separators did not work for me. I have given myself a chance to get used to them and suffered with them for 2 weeks wearing them every day.  They slipped out from between my toes.  They were not comfortable in my shoes. I felt them all the time.  And they irritated the skin between the toes while they were in place.  I threw them out.I found a better solution chatting with an avid biker.  He uses BodyGlide to prevent saddle sores, I decided to try BodyGlide between my toes and it worked for me.  Now I use BodyGlideBodyglide Advanced Technical Formulato put between my toes every day.  The toes glide against it each other rather than rub, and I don't have any blisters.  I have no ill effect from using it as frequently as I do.Ali Julia review"
1,"I got this as a gift from my sister! I love it so much that before the bottle was to run out, I ordered another one! The thing which is so nice about this product is that it is SOO MILD on the eyes  that you're gonna have to love this, once you try it out! Yes, it leaves an oily residue, but for that price, you can't have better care for the eyes...I usually wash off my face with my daily facewash (not neutrogena) and the oil comes off easily...You wouldn't even know after washing it with any facewash that you may use, that you had some oil residue from the makeup remover! But really, it's the perfect price and the best thing - it's not harsh like other eye-makeup removers that are out there - which for me is the first and foremost consideration. And when that comes at such a nice price, then why not??? Some makeup removers may not feel harsh when you put them on your eyes to remove makeup, but you'd see the sign that they are... How so?? Well , here's how you know that they are harsh...With almost all others that I have used, I would have an eyelash or two fall off, when taking the make up off! And that is one thing I don't want since I have long lush eyelashes! But with this, no matter how heavy makeup I have on - on my eyes - it's still so mild and smooth that never has a single eyelash fallen off while taking the makeup off. And before I know it, with a little dab on the cotton ball, the makeup is off already! Which is great!I just love it...Thats all i can say...Go ahead and buy one and you'll know for yourself!"
1,I've been using this product for years.  There is a lot of rough scrub in it but yet it really is good on sensitive and dry skin.  Which I have both of.  I don't see myself changing from this product anytime soon.  Probably a lifer on this one.
1,"**Updated review--I've continued to use this product daily and found that it also works on razor burn. I found the product to be incredibly soothing on any surface used to shave (legs, face, etc), and of course the product absorbs immediately. With highly sensitive skin that is prone to break out for any reason under the sun, this product continues to get an A+ from me and from those in my family that use the product as well.**This item was pricey, but well worth every penny. First of all, this product is extremely thick so a little goes a very, very long way.This is an intensive lotion meant to treat dry skin and restore it to it's naturally soft condition. I found that it is best used at nighttime. I've tried using it with nighttime gloves, and that works well too. I just prefer to rub it on my hands and go to bed. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because I don't prefer to wear gloves at night, and because it takes time to absorb, you pretty much need the gloves so you don't chance getting the lotion on other things while it dries. I figured it out to be about 20 minutes before it fully absorbed, but I put on quite a bit!Because this takes longer to absorb, I wouldn't recommend using this as a daily lotion you might leave by the soap dish by the bathroom next to the sink.I use this daily, and because it's so concentrated, that's all I need to maintain smoother skin. It's no easy task when you have kids of your own and are around kids at a daycare where germs spread like the plague. For every diaper change, sneeze, runny nose and shared food, I am washing my hands A LOT! This product works as advertised!It also works wonders on cracked elbows, heels and is soothing for skin conditions like Eczema."
1,"I'm Indian and have slightly wavy hair that's to my shoulder blades - that said, this is an awesome flat iron!  I had the Chi for many years before, which finally gave up on me, so my comparison is to that product.  With this iron, I can straighten my hair in about 10 min versus about 12 min with my Chi.  I think this is way better than the Chi though based on my hair after straightening.  My hair feels smooth and healthy and it's super shiny.  The Chi wasn't bad, but to me, this is way better."
1,"shiseido cotton is the best best cotton pads i have ever used!!! it is great for everything, however, it is kinda pricey."
1,"Some people cannot get around the smell of the soap, but I really don't mind and I just feel using natural products is the best for me and my family.  I also believe it is better for your skin.  Decent price and quick delivery.  Thank you"
1,"When I went to see my gastroenterologist last September; he recommended that I start using this product twice a day. He was making the recommendation, based on a family history of colon cancer, plus the fact that I had hemorrhoids and a weak anal sphincter muscle. While he said that Konsyl would not improve the hemorrhoids or anal sphincter muscle; the introduction of fiber to my diet would prevent them from getting worse. Little did I know that there were so many other benefits to using this product, including weight loss and lowering cholesterol. I'm finding that regular use of Konsyl completely eliminates the constipation I was experiencing, and it's great to know that it has so many other attributes. I mix it with an 8 ounce glass of water, although it's probably best to use a shaker. Mixing it in water with a spoon doesn't fully distribute all of the fiber, but it works well enough for me. I don't notice any taste to the Konsyl and have no problem drinking it down,. As mentioned on the label; I drink an additional glass of water right after drinking the Konsyl, to make sure it's all washed down. One additional note; my gastroenterologist said that he recommends Konsyl over every other brand of fiber. When I went to the Konsyl website; they display a graph which shows that it contains more usable fiber than any other brand. This product is highly recommended by me."
0,This product burns my scalp and doesnt get rid of my dandruff.Ive tried cutting down my use of this product so that I wouldnt cause irritation to my scalp but Im deciding to give up on it because I dont need to be in pain when I wash my hair for no results anyway.I have contacted the company because I am that unsatisified with this product. Its a shame because I really love nuetrogena products and this is the only time that I have had an issue with something they make.
1,"I love these cleansing pads, they feel good and make your skin feel super clean and healthy.  My only complaint is the size-it is too big!  I usually cut them in half which makes them not round anymore and a little more difficult to use.  I wish they would make these about 3/4 of the size and add a few extra pads."
1,"i'm very happy to smell like a coconut after my showers, i really like this body wash a lot. sweet scent"
1,"I purchased this product!! I've tried many, many products in hopes something could help my nails grow, stop the tremendous peeling, and breakage right at my quick. This was my last resort and when reading the reviews I really thought to myself, whatever we'll see. I've never seen anything like. It's so amazing that I bought this very brand names polishes and my nails have never looked better!! No more acrylics!! YEEEAAAAH!! I am forever going to by this product and couldn't be happier. - Shelby, GA"
1,"I've tried several face products and finally found Earth Science, which I have now been using for many years. It's hands down by far the best on the market.  Very gentle with all natural ingredients.  If you truly want to take good care of your skin use Earth Science."
1,"This is a great product for those of us with acne prone yet aging skin. I was reluctant to purchase ROC for many years because I am a bit of a high end product snob. But it delivers. My skin responded well right away with no ill side effects. The only downside to this product is the fragrance. I am very sensitive and was turned off by the perfumey smell of the product on my wrist. However, once it absorbs on the face you cannot smell anything. I wish all of the ROC Retinol Products could be Oil-free, Non-comedogenic (won't clog pores), Dermatologist tested, AND fragrance free..."
1,"I have been using Olay products for a number of years, and at 67 years of age, I don't have any wrinkles on my face, neck, or upper chest. This could, of course, be due to heredity because my 94 year old mother doesn't have much in wrinkles either. There is really no way to know for sure, but I do like the feel of this product on my skin. When I use it, my skin feels soft and moisturized, and not greasy as it does with some other products. I will continue to use this and other Olay products."
1,"A friend recommended the shampoo & conditioner for my excessive hair loss. Ever since I started using these products, my hair loss is under control. Also, my hair is shinier and less frizzy. I highly recommend these products!"
1,My favorite mascara! Makes my lashes super long and full without clumps. Will definitely be using for a very long time.
1,I like how well protected and fast it came. It's a nice Spring and Summer color. I do recommend this nail polish
1,"This is my favorite scen, I've loved this for years.  Product came as  quickly as was promised, protective packaging.  Very happy with the purchase and seller."
1,"I've used this product for 25 years on my legs and arms.  It keeps them smooth and soft.  It isn't sold locally so I have to order it online, but I'm a dedicated customer.  Good buy for the price and I love that they always state the AHA percentage."
1,I am a devoted philosophy user.  This is a staple in my facial cleansing routine.  Found it here at same price as philosophy.com but without having to pay shipping cost!  It is a very pure cleanser that works great with a Clarisonic.
1,Years ago someone gave me one of this type eye pillow and I have loved it.  The fragrance was very soothing and really aided my relief from migraines.  The company that manufactured it has since been sold and I was looking for a replacement.  DreamTime is the perfect replacement.  It has the exact aroma and is well made as was the first one.  I also have ordered one for my daughter and she enjoys hers as well.  I recommend to these to everyone I know who has migraines.
1,"Last few months, I've been researching moisturising things, mostly for my hands (but the rest of me too). Maybe it's age creeping up on me, or it's my endless washing of hands, but about a year ago I noticed I started to acquire those old-man hands with dried/parched skin, especially on the back of them. So I've been trying all kinds of cremes and lotions (go to my reviews page and see; I've reviewed some of what I've tried). A lot of them help, some more, some less, but amazingly, after all this effort, I was in a drugstore on an unrelated errand, and bought -- on impulse -- a jar of this thing here, Cetaphil. I'm not even sure why I did: I've never heard of it before, and I always look for the ingredients to be natural, w/o a chemical factory listed there. Well, to be fair, Cetaphil isn't bad -- no parabens, no fragrances, no colors. But otoh, it's got some chemistry in it though, alcohols and what not. Well, anyway, I got me a jar and tried: wow! It's perfect, better than everything I tried bevor, natural or not natural. It is:1. Bland and neutral (no smell whatsoever).2. Not greasy at all, not even initially.3. Thick but not hard to spread because it's somehow strangely slick, like frozen sour cream I'd imagine would be (except it's not frozen).4. Extremely effective: produces even-textured and even-coloured, supple and hydrated skin in one day; does not clog pores; skin stays hydrated at least a day; survives a handwash or even two somewhat (and then, it's easy to reapply if you need, 'cause unlike a lot of other things I tried, it doesn't smell and therefore can be used at the office w/o bothering anyone around).All my researches and expense, and the 100%-adequate answer was sitting on the shelf in my local drugstore (Walgreens, thirteen-ninety-nine a jar). Who would have known... and it's two to four times cheaper than other thing I tried. I also got the lotion, to compare. I like the creme better (it's more ""substantial"", persistent), but both are good though.Bottom line: Very highly recommended.PS. One thing I'd like to see that's not available is smaller (portable) packages. I can't go around with this bucket on me, it's too big: it's good for home, but I want a small dispenser in my briefcase. There was a small(er), 8 oz, bottle of lotion available there, but no cream in a small container. For now, I'm stuffing a small amount in a tiny tin from Burt's Bees Hand Salve, but it'd be nice if I didn't have to do that.Note 1: it's even cheaper in Wegman's (like ten bucks, +/-)."
1,"I have a giant wrinkle across the middle of my forehead and one that goes half way across just below it.Tried Botox First....I gave in and tried botox and while it did make the wrinkles go away, it felt just way too wierd to me to NOT be able to feel or fully move my forehead. The entire time it lasted (about 4 months or so...) my forehad felt heavy - like I had a piece of metal stuck in-between my skull and skin. It was just way too disturbing for me, so I decided early on that I didn't want to continue with botox. Plus - that needle in the forehead HURTS! So, big pain having it put in (yes, I'm wimpy, but for those who are more sensitive like me - it hurts!!!) followed by feeling like you have a metal plate stuck underneath your forehead skin. (Plus the knowledge that I'd purposefully allowed the injection a neurotoxin into my body...Aack!)Decided to give Frownies a go......I've been very pleasantly surprised. You stick these stickers on your head at night, peel them of in the a.m. (which also seems to remove dead skin, as my skin feels smoother...)and providing you do it regularly, your wrinkles decrease.I'm not good about doing it every night - I forget. But if I do it at least 4x/week there is a noticeable difference. I'd bet it'd be full-on smooth if I could remember to do them every night.They're worth a try!......So, for the cost, you may as well give them a go. Just try to be better about putting them on each night if you want the best results. Like another reviewer said, they only work as long as you use them. If you quit, your wrinkles come back."
1,"With my adult acne I have to pamper my skin or it gets too dry.  I love this face wash because my skin feels amazingly clean and SUPER soft and moisturized after washing.  It almost feels as if I have already put my moisturizer on and it does not leave it with a tight feeling.  When I am having hormonal breakouts I have to attack my problen skin with several different products and techniques.  This is a frontline weapon for use several times a day.As a middle-ages woman I look for products that are fierce on blemishes, but gentle to my skin underneath.  This satisfies."
1,This product does work but just don't use to much and its hard to match the color exactly so keep that in mind.
1,"The product I received didn't look like the picture.  I know that sometimes manufacturers change their packaging, but I think it's important to update the product photo ASAP so people know that they're getting a legitimate item that's not expired, in cases where expiration is a concern.I was very surprised by the size of this item.  It's much smaller than I expected it to be, even though the amount is clearly stated here.  When I first opened the box, I was really disappointed to have spent $10 on such a small tube.  The good news is that you don't need to slather this on thickly.  A relatively thin (compared to some other products) layer is perfectly sufficient, and the texture allows you to easily spread it thin.  Sometimes clay masks can be difficult to manipulate, but this one is not.The mask was very cooling on my face; akin to what mentholated products feel like.  Some people may find this to be strong, but I don't mind it.  As it was drying, I noticed that some darker spots actually appeared on my nose, presumably where the mask was working on my pores.  I let it dry fully and washed it off in the shower with hot water.  Afterwards, I followed up with my regular cleanser.  My skin was very soft afterwards, and didn't feel dry or tight as I expected.  I did notice an immediate improvement in the pores on my nose.  I'm not sure if they're any smaller, but they're visibly less dirty.  I bought this hoping to clear up the darkness of those pores, more so than to make them appear smaller (since I'm pretty sure that kind of claim is BS anyway), so in my eyes this did the job.One piece of advice: turn yours upside-down first when you open it.  Mine leaked some liquid from where the mask had separated a bit, but that's to be expected from a natural/organic product.  Turn it upside down so the lid faces up, carefully squeeze out any excess air, and then close it again and knead the packaging a bit to make sure everything is evenly distributed.  I'm relatively sure that if I dribbled out a teaspoon of liquid every time I opened the tube, the remaining product would end up being a dry lump in short order.I docked it a star for the smell.  It's so strong that I smelled it when I opened the envelope it arrived in.  Yeah, I could smell the product through the packaging.  I'm not sure if that's normal for this item or what, but wow.  I'm really glad it didn't impart any of that smell to my skin in the process of using it, or that would've been intolerable."
1,"i love this product for blemishes and bites.  it clears anything up over night, and instantly.  i use it to speed things along and it's the best.  lets you skin breath and heal quickly too."
1,"It did work. I bought this for my niece, who was three years old when she first tried it. She had always sucking her thumb during her sleep since her birth. My family and me were very worried that it would ruin her finger and the shape of her mouth. Luckily, she stopped it before the bottle ran out. She has not sucking her thumb for months now!!"
0,Bought this product at walmart for $10...  waste of money!!  I am mosltly platinum and had a few yellow tones and brassy streaks that I wanted toned out..  I've used feria before but just the darker brown colors.  It did tone out the yellow.. not so much the brass though....  the damage is horrid!!  It feels like it did the first day a bleached it from black..  save your money and your hair and go to sally's and get a quality lightening cream.
1,The was recommended by my dermatologist. I know it's a great product but it's just so expensive. To prices for my purse.
1,This has been my favorite hand moisturizing cream. I just use a small amount every night and my hands are always so soft when I wake up in the morning. It is a thicker cream so it feels better than a watery lotion. I definitely recommend!
1,"You cannot go wrong with UDDERLY anything. All of their skin products are wonderful. I am so thrilled with the last cream with urea for my son, I am now not going to use anything else.I also had no problems with shipping or the packaging. It all went fine.You will love these skin products. They are so silky and absorb so sweetly.Enjoy your new soft skin."
1,Love the great color.  Now I can do my own nails at home rather than go to a salon each time.  Great when combined with the OPI base and top coats.
1,"I had given up painting my nails because the polish would pop off same day due to the ridges on my nails.  Also, my nails split on a few that would weaken them.  My daughter told me about this foundation and from the first use it works amazing.  Now my nails are stronger than ever and polish stays on for four days before chipping."
0,"I feel bad giving this two stars- because it really is my fault that I do not like this. I have a hard time doing the quick swipe across the eyelid and typically do short strokes from corner of the eye out, but you need to be fast with this one. It dries too quickly for me and going over, even slightly, removes it or makes it clump up."
1,This is exactly what I have been searching for.  Does a great job and is very easy to use. Shipping was great.
1,With a touch of plastic.I still love it. I sprayed it in my room this morning before I left for work and I could smell it when I got home 9 hours later.
1,Love this! I actually use it for my bull terrier that has a bald spot on his tail and an expert told me to get Stridex and use daily...so excited to see the good results!!!!!!
0,"I had been using Clairol Natural Instincts Midnight Black for a long time.  I loved the original formula.  The color was excellent and the conditioner was the best (wish I could have bought it separate it was so good).  I bought the new 10 min formula to cover my gray with Black and my roots are brown!  It is too ugly.  I now have Brown roots and the rest of my hair is black.  I don't like it at all.  I don't understand why the formula changed.  Why won't Clairol tell us the reason? Was the original formula hazardous to our health?  If so, does this mean the new formula is even worse?  The 10 min formula is deceptive.  It does not color my hair the color I expect.  I will not use this formula ever again.  As a matter of fact I think I may be afraid to use even the original formula if I ever find it again.  So long Clairol and thanks for nothing."
1,"Nothing to say except excellent.  I use this daily.  I can find lots of ways to enjoy.I love that this product.  I have this little bottle and the giant one and I won't be without.I keep the aloe in the shower actually.I mix some in my conditioner for extra hydration  I apply to face after shower while pores are still open.  Mix with oil and apply to body.I also mix one tbsp of this with 4oz water and a tsp of jojoba oil (or argan ) in a mister bottle for a frizz fighting spray.  It works well.  You just can't go wrong with aloe in my opinion.Aloe also makes a great styling aid. My bf uses this in place of gel now and he loves how his hair holds without looking hard and &#34;wet.&#34;  It is also great for frizz free curls.I have troubled skin and I have really noticed that by adding aloe to my routine my face has calmed down a lot.  It seems to give my skin a more even tone.I do a raw honey/citric acid mask in shower.  Rinse.  Blot with towel lightly.  Apply some BP, spitz glycerin/ water, then apply a little aloe to lock it all in.  My skin has showed huge changes doing this.  My skin will never be perfect but this sure helped get it the best it can be."
1,"LOVE IT ---------------- As I age, 67, I wondered what would help ease the roughness and dark spots here and there, this has helped already with my skin tones and texture. I will keep this on hand from now on."
1,been using for years and seems to keep dandruff at bay.not the ageing scalp skin issues which require rx meds shampoos.i find that the generic coal tar shampoo clones are more watered down thenneutrogena whose products are more expensive but worth the price.
1,"I love the feeling of this stuff when it's on my face.  It's relaxing and works well, and a little goes a long way.  I would purchase again."
1,Arrived on time.  The perfect size and a great price.
1,"This blush is a very fine powder, and appears a little bright and dark in the compact, although this is deceiving. I am pale and the color really gives me a nice glow. Overall a nice flattering color."
1,"Go Overboard: this is a great color! I absolutely love it. It is,however, darker than it appears to be, especially after 2 layers. And just one layer leaves streaks (the nail polish is quite thin), so keep that in mind before buying. Still, loving the color. I bought it as the contrast color to the Mint Candy Apple and they go really well together if you want to do the one contrast nail thing that's really in right now!"
1,"Marshmallow is a pearl white color. Formula wise, it is streaky and I had to apply at least 2 (sometimes 3) coats for complete opaqueness. A very cute color. It's perfect for french manicure. It looks much better with a top coat than without."
1,"I have used the popular over-the-counter acne products over the years as well as the prescription Retin-A and had little to no results.  I found this product in my local pharmacy and had doubts but I decided not to spend money on products that I've already used and was disappointed with.  I was shocked to see the results!  I am 52 yrs old and still get blind pimples on my face that are a bear to get rid of as well as some on my upper thigh - a very weird spot.  This product is the bomb and either the pimple is gone the next morning or it draws it to a head - no fail (sorry, TMI). I thank the reviewer that says to replace the upper liquid with alcohol when it is used up - I'll try it when that time comes.  The bottle lasts a long time as you only need to dab a little with Q Tip.  It doesn't smell pretty but but it's not offensive to me and once it dries, the sulfur smell goes away.  That is the ingredient that works, btw. Clearasil, Oxy 10 etc. should take the clue and add the sulfur to their products to make them effective."
1,This product has a very light scent but most importantly does what it's suppose to!  It's also great for when you have a black shirt/dress on that is sleeveless; won't leave deodorant marks.
1,"I love that the the length of this allows me to reach all of those unreachable bits. It's so easy rinse and hang up to dry, and it washes well in the machine with towels. Agressively exfoliates without being too brutal...no special scrubs required...just soap. The 2-pack was a bonus!"
1,"Bottles of shampoo topple off a shower caddy.  Slippery bottles slip through soapy hands and plop on a shower floor.  It makes good sense to have a shampoo soap bar, so I was delighted to find this Karma Komba.It lathers quickly and richly, and has a nice subtle fragrance (a sort of a fresh green scent) that lingers in your hair.  Plus, the bar seems to last a lot longer than a bottle of shampoo for which you'd pay the same price."
1,"I've used Aquis microfiber towels and turbans for years.  I have gotten tired of replacing them frequently, though, because they develop a really nasty smell in a relatively short period of time....I just ordered a turban from another company and have my fingers crossed that maybe there's a difference in types of microfiber.  I already just switched back to my terry cloth for towels.It doesn't matter what brand/type of laundry detergent or additives you use, how often you launder them (even each time!), or how well they dry between uses (again, even if you launder/machine dry after every use)....they smell.  I actually wrote down the last time I started new towels/turban this last time....I didn't make it even three months for the towels....the turban made it for about five.I also noticed that the last turban I was using started to be less absorbent over time.  I honestly hadn't noticed that with prior ones...ones I replaced purely due to stink.I won't be buying more Aquis...just hope I can find a non-stinky microfiber replacement....especially for the oh-so-convenient turban."
1,"The item is really no more than okay, the 3/5 fits perfectly for it.The cream must be used for a very long period of time (talking about months) and all it does it to make the stretch marks the same color of your skin, no more than that. If once you stopped using it the marks stayed the same it'd get a 4 maybe even 5, but they get to be what it looked originally.So, what's the point? You have to use it everyday for months so it starts having some kind of effect and you stop using, the effects are gone? No, thank you."
1,This stuff smells so good and I am pretty sure it is because of this that my acne has gotten better! Will not go without this. Just ordered my second bottle.
0,"I bought this moisturizer extremely excited and hopeful, because I have very dry skin (especially in these winter months in colorado) and it had such great reviews.  I opened the bottle up and get this chemical smell that is fairly strong.  I couldnt wait to try it, so I cleansed and toned.  When I put it on my face it was very hard to rub in, and although it wasnt greasy it just sat on my skin in a white film.  I barely put any on!  A few minutes later it turned my skin to an odd orange-ish tint.  Is that the ""morning glow""? Ive been using it for about a week and it has started to break out my skin and hasnt helped the dryness even a tad.  I regret buying this product.  I wish it had worked."
1,"This is the hair color that I like to get, but I do not think it is quite the brown that I want for my hair."
1,I use this to help with nail and cuticle biting at night. I heavily moisturize my hands and sleep with these. I have much nicer hands as a result. Can always tell the difference when I forget to put them on for a night.
1,"I really love being able to get these in a 6 pack. Also, cheaper than buying one bottle at a time.Smells wonderful, cleans dishes well, and no harsh chemicals.Huge fan of the Clean Day line.What else can I say? The product does what it says- and beautifully at that- and amazon offers a great price.Love it!"
1,"Neutrogena Triple Moisture Deep Recovery Hair Mask - 6 oz.  I wasn't aware that Neutrogena made hair care, as well as skin care, products, but we have one right here.  I've been using this product for a while, and find that I like it: it has a pleasant scent; yet it doesn't seem to activate any allergies, so it's evidently not overly perfumed. The packaging is handy, easy to grasp and work with.  The product is simple to use, does not require the ultimately damaging utilization of a blow dryer, and gives good results: my hair feels as nurtured as when I have used beauty salon products that cost much more.  It can be used weekly with good results."
1,Just a wash of color over your lids with mascara is all you need. You can amp it up with a dark color in the crease and eyeliner. Very versatile and looks gorgeous on my med dark complexion. I can wear this to work or a night out...love it!
1,"I have very sensitive skin and during the dry winter months I get so dried out I sometimes get dermatitis. My clothes will make my skin feel like it's burning or cracking (although it isn't). Now I put this on every morning. All I can say is Wow. My skin when I go to bed is still moisturized, soft, not dried out. It's a life-saver. I think I'll probably use more Aveeno products now because of it."
1,"Never had a white nail polish before, this is perfect, for my wedding that I got this for.The thing is it is impossible to put this on my nails, as the brushes are big and the polish is runny, hard to put evenly.But im planning to wear false nails so it's not a problem. Overall it's nice."
1,I DEVELOPED SOME KIND OF MILD RASH IN MY EYEBROWS AND AROUND MY NOSE.  ONE NIGHT I HAPPEN TO TRY THIS NIGHT CREME AND NOTICE THE RASH WENT AWAY.  NOW I USE IT EVERY NIGHT AND MY FACE IS SMOOTH AS SILK.
1,"I used this when I was a teenager to keep my skin clear. I never really had very bad acne, just a few bumps here and there. This really helped keep it under control. Luckily when I reached my early twenties my breakouts became only bothersome once monthly.I used this with the Morning Burst products and the Blackhead Clearing products from Clean & Clear. I mostly used this at night and used the Morning Burst with spf moisturizer in the daytime.When using this, my skin was squeaky clean and I was constantly getting compliments. Now that I'm older, this is too harsh for me. I switched to Olay once acne was no longer a daily concern."
1,"Wonderful way to start the day.  Smells just lovely. If you love patchouli, you'll love this soap.  Make the smell last longer by just cutting bar in half (STILL bigger than little sample bars so I have no problem with the size) and use half and put other half in a baggie for later.  Will keep the scent and your soap will last a lot longer."
1,I love how it makes my skin so soft and even makes your lashes and brows grow!!!! Will be getting more!
1,I have used this product for 10 yrs. and love it for my face. A Very little of this product goes a LONG way. It is so worth the price.
1,Love Opi...one of the best nail polishes on the store shelves and spas today. Big Apple Red is my go to color all year round for my pediucures. Gorgeous deep blue red...get so many compliments on this color. The brush that Opi uses is thick and makes the product glide on to a fantastic end result. Love it!
1,What the heck? I swear I had to read the label twice. It comes out smelling plastic-y with no lather. Did I buy Extra Gentle Lotion or what? No... label says cleanser..I'm really not sure if this thing helps moisturize my face. I don't think it hurts it either... Meh.
1,Aveeno Positively Radiant scrub is easy on my skin yet also effective at brightening my skin tone. It's not all that easy to find products as compatible as this with sensitive skin. Recommended.
1,"I have yet to use this. I purchased this for my daughter to use. She is not a fan of scents, so I am hoping she will love this product. I am a big fan of Dr Bronners products though"
1,I love all of Philosophy's products and this one is no exception. It really does a good job with cleaning and it also smells wonderful. Great company with lots of great products!
1,"The product didn't do what I wanted it to do, so I ordered a Conair Hair Setter to replace it.  The conair Hair setter is a much better product."
1,"I haven't found any other lotion that works as well and as long as this lotion does. I really hate that it contains petroleum-based ingredients, but, like I said, I haven't found anything better. When you have severely dry and sensitive skin, you just have to go with what works, and this is my go-to product for skin issues."
1,"I think that the organizational system behind this is great - the bottles are reasonably easy to load and prime, the little windows let you know when you're running low on anything. There are several different labels included in the package, including a blank one, in case you want to fill it with lotion instead of body wash, or whatever.The mirror is rather small, but useful for checking your brows or, if you're a dude, your facial-shave job. It doesn't steam up, there may be a coating? Or I'm just getting lucky :)The flat shelf are on the top is useful for holding your razor, while the many hooks on the bottom help organize the scrubbies and loofas that seem to overwhelm the bathroom shelves normally.My only wish is that it's just a bit smaller, as the whole thing is maybe 14-18 inches across, which is a lot of visual space!"
1,"Several members of our family have winter dry skin and eczema. Vanicream is a life saver. It's so thick that it really holds in the moisture, and keeps us from constantly itching. Plus, because it is a thicker moisturizer, we don't use buckets of it, like we do with cheaper lotions.  It was actually recommended to us by our allergist."
0,"I have relied on Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo for many years for its ability to clean my hair and slightly oily scalp at a reasonable price.  It was an excellent alternative to theNeutrogena Anti-Residue Formula Shampoo.The last time I purchased this, I noticed that it was in a fancy new bottle and was tinted pale blue rather than being colorless.  When I got home, I was dismayed to find that Suave has also added a vaguely floral and unfortunately artificial chemical perfume to the formulation that irritates my eyes and sinuses and gives me a headache.I can no longer use this product.  I certainly hope that Suave will reconsider this change and go back to the original, almost-odorless formula."
1,"I thought it was more on the nude side, but it is very shimmery, like a summer tone. The quality is fine and the price was great though."
1,"I was really nervous about purchasing this product due to the fact that I have very oily/acne prone skin and not to mention the fact that I suffer from eczema. However, since using the product I haven't experienced any breakouts or reactions, the product smells so good, and it leaves my skin feeling so soft. When I wake up in the morning I seem to have this nice glow. Also I was a little concerned about the price since the product is a little on the small side however, this will definitely last a VERY long time so the price was well worth it.."
1,"I've tried almost all of the Olay facial products and this is one of my personal favorites, especially because of the light scent (my husband has not complained about this one when we go to bed). I have normal-to-oily skin, so I have to make sure to use the right products that won't clog my pores. The cream seems to absorb well into my skin, so it does not feel greasy or thick. The price is affordable, especially on Amazon's Subscribe-and-Save Program, where you can set it up for 1-6 month automatic purchases at 15% discount and cancel at anytime without penalty. Sometimes I wish that it came in a pump-style (like it's sister products) instead of a jar, so that I can control the amount. I'm still on my first jar after 5 months BUT I do rotate in between products. Therefore, I gave it only 4 stars because I can't say that I've seen much of a difference on my skin though... Regardless, I would recommend this product to friends and family."
0,"I received this item on time. Well, I should rephrase. I received something I didn't order on time and in great condition! I received a product in the Sun Kissed Caramels line of products when I ordered an ASH brown. Ash is not caramel. I'm scared to use it and guess what? I CAN'T RETURN IT BECAUSE APPARENTLY IT'S HAZARDOUS. I will, however, enjoy the conditioner that was included and might consider re-purposing the developer. Just not with a caramel color. Caveat emptor, you won't get what you ordered. Fail, Amazon."
0,"Why didn't I buy this size brush iron sooner?  I have short, layered hair and have been usingInstant Heat Hot Brush, 1 1/4-Inch.  It does a good job, but some pieces of hair are just too short for its barrel. Any type hot brush is hard to find in a real store, so I started my initial search at Amazon instead.  1/2"" is the perfect size for short haircuts.  I prefer added body rather than outright curls, and this does that if the barrel is kept on my hair for about 6-8 seconds.It only has two settings (low/high) compared to Conair's many.  That's okay--once I found the perfect Conair setting, I never moved it elsewhere anyway.  The high setting on Helen of Troy seems to deliver the same amount of heat as Conair's highest setting, so I'm happy.Thank you, Amazon, for stocking a hard to find product and thank you, Helen of Troy, for making it.11-12-2013 UPDATE:  My five star rating has gone down to one because this brush iron lasted ten months before a row of teeth simply broke off, and can't be fixed or replaced.  I wasn't even aware it happened--found out the hard way by getting a big forehead burn.  This iron was not used everyday either--just occasionally when more body was desired.  I see now from reading negative reviews that many others have experienced the very same problem."
1,I discovered this in Montreal while on vacation and am now delighted that I can purchase refills back home. Please do not stop selling this wonderful hand soap for the kitchen.
1,"I've been using this creme for about 20 years now. It's amazing stuff. It's gotten my hands and forearms (and feet sometimes) through 84 rose bushes, countless tree prunings, landscape rehabbing, etc. I have found that even with cuts and scratches, this lotion never stings. All the herbs probably have an antiseptic effect on injuries, but who knows.The scent is wonderful too, at least I think so. Quite unique and natural, but not overpowering.Since the creme is very concentrated, I DO recommend letting it soak in well before you go driving or touching door knobs, etc. A little goes a LONG way! :0So glad they keep making this great product!PJ"
1,"I bought this flat iron several years ago from a different website.  I had used many inexpensive flat irons in the past and they really damaged my hair.  Plus, I'd only get about a year out of them before they would die.  I researched a lot online before I ended up buying the Solia.This is a great quality professional flat iron.  My hair is the healthiest that it's ever been.  The flat iron heats up quickly, gets hot enough to straighten my long curly hair in 15 minutes, and has a nice long cord that doesn't tangle.  The cheap flat irons used to take over half an hour to straighten my hair.  There are two things you need to keep in mind when using this flat iron:1.  This is a professional flat iron, which means that it doesn't have an automatic shut off.  That being said, I think the fact that this flat iron is made to be used frequently is the reason why mine has lasted so many years.2.  You must use some sort of heat protectant before you use the flat iron.  I usually put some Biosilk Silk Therapy in my wet hair, blow dry, separate into sections, and then flat iron one section at a time.I can't think of anything negative to say about this flat iron.  I love it.  Over the years, several friends have used it and have ended up buying the same one because they liked it so much more than theirs.  It was definitely worth the cost to me since by now, I would have spent much more money replacing with a cheap one every year."
1,This is a good sized bar and Basis soap lasts quite a long time without getting mushy. Box arrive a little squashed but soap was fine.
0,"This is the worst stuff I have ever used on my hair. You spray it, it is what appears to be perfect till you mess with your hair and your hands turn brown/black depending on color choice. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone. Also be advised it took me 3 shampoos in 1 shower to scrub this crap out of my hair, what a disaster."
1,"After I started using the Bare Escentuals products, my skin has improved vastly.  I used to get little pimples all over my forehead, especially in the summer (humid) months.  Covering up with liquid foundation just made it worse so I tried switching to these mineral makeup products and the difference is astounding. This foundation is not so much a &#34;cover-up&#34; as it is an &#34;evener.&#34;  I don't look like I'm wearing makeup when I have it on, but my skin tone is even and luminous.  I would definitely recommend these products to anyone seeking a fresh, natural look.  I went to Sephora for the first purchase so that I could get help choosing the correct color for my skin tone and I have just kept replacing it with the same color ever since.  I'll never go back to liquid or pressed powder!"
1,I was tired of leaning over the bathroom sink to put my make up on.  I wanted something that I could get up close and personal with.  This is it.I also love the color of the metal.  Kind of has an antique look which I like.
1,"Great Hair brush. I bought it because i bought hair extensions and it is recommended not to use a regular brush on them.It works great, very gentle on hair.I even started using it on my hair. I have very fine hair (almost baby hair) and I notice this brush doesn't pull on my hair like other brushes."
0,Don't know what all the glowing reviews are about. I bought this after reading all the reviews because I was curious to try it out. There is nothing special about this Chapstick and I do not find my lips to be all that more moisturized after I use it. It wasn't expensive so no love lost but I would not order again.
1,"I find that it does control egzema better than Curel, and actually promotes healthy skin growth.  It took an entire bottle with every day use to clear up the mess on my leg."
1,"They look natural and very sexy,  I have bought them twice, be nice to them and you can reuse them for about three weeks, easy to apply with the right glue, will continue to buy!"
1,"I will begin by stating that I have never had problem skin of any kind, no acne, no blotches, no wrinkles, and I'm in my forties.  I don't wear much make up and though in the summer I do enjoy a suntan with sunscreen protected skin, I by no means am a sun worshipper.  Over the years I've happily used the Philosophy line of 3-in-1 body washes but since they are on the expensive side, I use the product sparingly and seldom treat myself to more than 3 bottles a year.  When I tried a sample of this PURITY face cleanser, I was impressed that it was a one-step cleanser for face and eye makeup, plus it was fragrance free.  I shelled out the $32 plus tax for this 16oz. bottle (ouch!) and after using it for a week I began to notice that my face became extremely dry!  I was not expecting this at all.  In the winter I take extra care with moisturizers anyway, so putting a little extra cream on the face after using this wasn't a big deal just to get rid of the dryness, but I'm not so sure that for the price it is worth it at all.  I know that if you bought a facial cleanser and an eye makeup remover separately, you might pay the $32 anyway, but if it leaves my face dry and flakey, nothing terrific can be said for this product.  Yes, I expect this review will be unpopular, but I'm really just being honest with how the product affected me personally, and I may or may not be alone in my experience.  Had Noxema not changed their ""original"" scent from way back when, I would still be using that for a mere few bucks a jar.Noxzema Deep Cleansing Cream, Original - 14 oz"
1,"I use fake lashes to give extra volume to my lashes but sometimes it's just too much of a hassle. This is the only mascara that comes close to the results i get with the fake lashes. Truly, no other brand works this well. Some people complain that it's clumpy, but this brand isnt for a clean look, it's for a false lash effect! Anyway, dont love the price, but i have to use four times as much of the drugstore brand to even come close to this, so it's even."
1,Cucumber cool facial that is just what I wanted. My favorite was discontinued years ago and the Freeman brand isn't one I was familiar with until Amazon. Use a thin layer for best results . . . drying time is 10 min. or less. Soothing for sensitive and mature skin. Can be used daily. Product information and description is accurate. It does feel a bit sticky so just rinse your hands and remember that a thin layer accomplishes the desired results. The tube makes it easy to use and store.Consider the other peel masks offered by Freeman . . . Pomegranate is another good choice from this line of products.Definitely recommended!
1,I use this product everyday.  It cleans my face really well.  I recommend to all woman and Teens to help keep your face looking great.
1,"Oh my, this is a beautiful color!  The OPI products have yet to disappoint me.  This is creamy, smooth and gorgeous!"
1,"This works really well for me. I feel like basically what it does is dries my skin out and that makes my acne go away, but it doesn't get too dry. I don't think my skin is oily or dry, it seems just right, but the next morning I can see that if I had some acne it looks dry, but my face looks great after I put on my foundation.When you get it you will see that there is like a beige paste in the bottle but then there is also like a clear watery substance in the bottle as well. The first time I got this the person that gave it to me told me if it runs out of the clear stuff put rubbing alcohol in it, well I spilt it of course and added rubbing alcohol and it still works great.Also I want to mention, this is really not a lotion in my opinion. It is definitely different... but I don't know how to explain what it is like, possibly like calamine lotion? I think that is what it is called. You have to use a Q-tip to apply; you are not supposed to shake the bottle."
1,"I have a fair to medium completion that runs on the slightly dry side.  I also have contact dermatitis on my left temple area because I sleep on my left side. This leaves my skin in that area with surface 'bumps'.  Additionally, I often have problems with facial products because I develop a resistance to them.Initially, I had doubts about this cleanser. It feels a little greasy when applied. It doesn't lather. What it does have is an amazing orange scent. I think of it as Orange Glo for the skin. I wasn't sure it was doing anything. However, I massaged it over my face and neck and then rinsed with warm water. My skin felt incredibly soft, clean, and supple. After cleaning, I used an astringent pad to see if there was residual dirt on my skin. The pad was clear. My skin sort of glowed, didn't look greasy, but it wasn't dry either. Extended use over a couple of weeks improved the texture and eliminated the dermatitis.Four years later, I am still using this on a daily basis. Sometimes I apply it with my Clarisonic or Neutrogena cleanser pad. Regardless of season, this cleanser works. On occasion when I don't use this for a few days, I notice the difference and it isn't good.I've been using the Burt's Bees product line for a long time. I can't say I totally like everything I've tried in their line, but this is among my favorites."
1,"Formerly known as Olay's Perfecting cream. I've been using this for at least ten years on my combination skin. I think I've gone through about 20 bottles. It sinks in as fast as an expensive moisturizer, and it has a very light fragrance. Some moisturizers sit on top of the skin and leave you shiny. This one won't do that. It always leaves my skin soft and smooth. The fragrance can be overwhelming to some people, but I like it.I just started accutane and my skin is now extremely dry. This is still my favorite moisturizer. When I ran out of myPhysiodermie - Oily Skin Cream - 50ml, I bought Neutrogena, Cetaphil, and Aveeno because my local drugstore did not have Olay in stock. None of those moisturizers measure up to this one. This is my gold standard drugstore moisturizer. Will repurchase over and over again.Tip:I have never liked the packaging. The cap, the dispenser, and ugh, there is so much product left when you think it's empty! I just cut the bottle open and spatula it into an old moisturizer jar that I've cleaned out. Much better."
1,"First, other reviewers are correct that what is pictured is not what you'll receive. The shape is different, the handles aren't the same shape, the pads are silicon rather than the rubber we're used to, etc. It threw me for a moment... but then I used the curlers. I have used Revlon lash curlers for as long as I can remember and love them. This actually curls my lashes better than all the ones I've previously owned so I don't care that they aren't what is pictured. I don't know if it's the slightly bent shape, the larger head, the silicone pads, or what, but my lashes are completely curled - nice sweep-up effect - and the curl seems to stay much longer. I highly recommend them."
1,"I really enjoyed the perfect spiral curls this curling iron made.  It took me a couple tries to finally get it right.  I give it four stars only because it took about double the time it takes me to use a clipless wand, and for some reason even though I had it on the highest heat setting and used hairspray, my spirals became loose waves after a few hours (They were still pretty waves though!).  I will most likely use this as a back up or for special occassions only because it was so time consuming."
1,"Well I thought the product would be much bigger cause the box picture just makes me thing its huge. Guess I should of known 2oz is not much. The smell of the product I like, it smells like a field of flowers. Now I haven't seen anything different with my skin I'm not sure if my skin was already soft or what but I still like the product."
1,"I used my old favorite on my left hand and this on my right. knowing the right hand always chips first. I used the same top coat on each. the right hand out lasted the left by 2 days. I'm, sold!"
1,"This is a great product for removing sticky residue.EX: (Labels off jars, band-aide residue, tape including duct tape, probably even gum). The price is great for cleaning purposes.Nice lemon scent. Although some of Now brand is organic, I have found Young Living to work the best medicinally."
1,"Thank you to all the people who reviewed this face wash. I have been having a horrible time with my skin due to the harsh Wisconsin winter and this face wash is just what I needed in conjunction with the new serum and moisturizer I am using, that I posted reviews about.This face wash didn't irritate my already extremely irritated, itchy red skin that was not enjoying the fact that I was having difficulty figuring out what to do with it, because it became that way out of no where. I have had to completely change my skin care regime, because my normal routine suddenly stopped working...badly. I tried multiple serums, moisturizers, etc. This face wash along with the other two products I have reviewed were the only things that saved me from scratching my skin raw. It definitely doesn't hurt that my skin looks amazing too!FYI, in conjunction with having very sensitive skin, I also have rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disorder that I am on multiple medications for and my skin is extremely picky about what I can use on it. This skin cleanser is a life saver."
1,"I have purchased many many products and this one is the ONLY product that my 41 yr old skin has responded to. I am a redhead with fair freckily skin and adult acne.Well.... I use to have acne. Not anymore!!!! Seriously!I will continue to use this product and brand.My routine is to put it on morning and night. And I am telling you I have not seen better results EVER!My freckles are fading, and my skin is smoother than it has been in YEARS!!!! Also my once HUGE pours are also decreasing.I love this and will use it for as long as they make it.I already have another extra bottle on hand- am considering getting a couple more- lol!!!"
0,The price may be right but it doesn't work for me. I have olive tone skin color so maybe it works better on someone with fair skin. I find it to look thick and way to yellow.
1,"I gave this 4 stars because of the mess of cleaning--but its a thousand times better than a tampon or pad.  Won't be going back to those!Here are my impressions of using the Instead Softcup.Do not try to do this in a public bathroom--it's too difficult (messy) and may not be sanitary. And because these cups can be used for 12 hours, in my case, I was always home to do my changes.Follow the instructions!  Read them twice.I found I didn't have a hard time inserting the soft cup, but getting it out was another thing.  Make sure your hands are clean and if you are having a hard time inserting your finger and pulling out the ring you need to RELAX.The first time I pulled it out (after a lot of sweating), I made a mess trying to empty it out and dispose of it.  By the third one, I was more prepared.  After emptying the cup, I wrap it in toilet paper and then place it in a small plastic bag.  If you have small plastic bags to reuse then put them in the bathroom where you will be doing your changes.If you insert it correctly, you will not feel anything there.  If you have problems inserting due to dryness, then try some lubricating gel.  The cup was so comfortable for me that I had to remind myself when I needed to change it.I had one time that it leaked.  It was on the second day of my period (the heaviest day for me) and I had a cold.  I coughed and coughed and suddenly, yep, you guessed it, I felt a warm gush--good thing I was home.  Like I said in the beginning--READ the Instructions.  I should have been changing it every four hours--it was about six hours that I had it in.  So that leakage was my fault (operator error) ;-).I wish I had known about this product while I was going to school--would have made me a lot happier not to mess with pads and tampons at school."
1,"I purchased the Nars Sheer Lipstick in Cruising.  It is a beautiful nudey pink color, very similar to MAC's Viva Glam V.  It is very sheer, but it imparts just a lovely hint of color to the lips.  I'm not sure why it's listed here as a semi-matte.  I wouldn't categorize it that way.  Overall, it's  a lovely shade and I will definitely repurchase."
0,"I love OPI nail polish. and i've ordered many from amazon, and usually they are on point. They look just like the picture. But in this case, I was expecting a Dark bluish toned Gray Matte color and instead I received a Dark Brown with a slight blue tint. I was shocked and thought there was a mistake, but sure enough the name of the nail polish color was the same as advertised. The picture is all wrong. And nail polish is non-refundable. I feel ripped off. False Advertisement.This is not a color I like or would ever buy."
1,"There is nothing like it in the world. I love this moisturizer and use it every day. If you have yet to try it, you owe it to yourself to give it a go."
1,"The smell is too strong on this lotion. I prefer the lighter scents without the eucalyptus or whatever the strong smell is. It DOES soften, but so does the rose, or the Nantucket Briar, and the smell on those is so pretty. Those do not burn if I accidentally get them in my eyes, either. (Within reason)."
1,"The first product in this line that I tried I freaking hated! The Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose. I absolutely hated it! It did not moisturize my hair in the least I have no recollection of if it made it softer or not and I was never a fan of the smell of roses. It's a light scent but I still am not a fan. I decided to give the GPB conditioner a try based off of a review on YouTube. And I love this stuff. It goes on very smooth, I love the smell of lavendar. I recently started to mix in olive oil with this treatment! It makes my hair very soft and since it is a light protein treatment it makes my shedding...less. I totally give this 5 stars. I have 4a hair."
1,"These little lip polishes are extraordinary, depositing color, shine and smoothness. The plumping ingredient can be irritating. Recommend applying an spf lip balm or other product over it."
1,"I was attracted to this product because of the reviews and ingredients. I am in my 40's and was thinning at age 26. I also recently bought nulockz (with a z) and the two are like magic! nuLOCKZ is a topical that I think helped the hair follicles to be stimulated again, and the vitamins were what my body was lacking I guess. Not sure how it all works but IT DOES! My husband laughs at me because I show off all of the new little hairs I am getting that we both haven't seen in YEARS!"
1,"I bought this to add moisture to my dry hair.  Its suppose to add strenght and shine.  I havent seen either result, but I like it better than using water to re-wet my hair as I roller set.  It also smells just like roses!"
1,"I made the classic mistake of ""the fancier and more expensive the better"" when I was a dedicated Aveeno user. I thought my skin was moisturized and protected, but I didn't know what I was missing out on until I gave this a shot! For MUCH less money, I get double the SPF (unheard of to find a 30 spf face moisturizer at this price!!) and fewer breakouts because of the minimal additives (fragrances/skin ""brighteners"" read= literally GLITTER!)It leaves my skin soft without being oily and never feels tight or greasy after using. Now, I can slather this stuff on in the morning without wondering if I'm truly protecting myself from the sun and before bed without worrying about gross pimples popping up overnight!My mom was right - she always had Eucerin products around when I was a kid, and I've found out now for good reason! I hope they never stop making this stuff. It's done wonders for my skin and doesn't break my already tight budget."
1,"I wouldn't buy this unless you have VERY, VERY sensitive skin. The little beads they use instead of ground-up apricot pits in this one hardly does a thing for me. And the scent is not as nice as the regular non-sensitive skin scrub. It smells like baby powder, which I really don't like."
1,"I came across this product by accident and was intrigued.  I love the scent of Lavender and Bergamot, and who couldn't use a sleep balm.  Plus, it's USA Organic, in keeping with all Badger products.It's suggested you rub a little onto your temples, face, neck, or lips, and use it regularly for best results.  I find I miss it when I don't use it.  I love the fragrance, and it's been well documented that lavender is a calming aroma.I'm not sure it helps me fall asleep faster, but it certainly does induce a degree of relaxation, so maybe it does.  Even my dog loves it and snuggles up to me when he smells it.I've found that I love it most when I'm sitting for meditation.  When you're doing the deep breathing, the wafts of the scents takes you away from other distractions.  It's also great for de-stressing, bedtime yoga programs, like 'Candlelight Yoga'.The ingredients include:  Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Castor Oil, Beeswax, essential oils of Bergamot, Lavender, Rosemary Verbenone, Ginger, and Balsam Fir.The tub contains 2 ounces of product, but it goes a very long way.  I've been using it for a while and hardly have made a dent in it.Interestingly, it doesn't bother my allergies, either.  I have a dab of it right under my nose, right now, and there's no sneezing, or other signs of irritation.The only problem I have with the product is, that it is rather hard to remove the top of the tin.  You have to work around from all sides, gently prying until you can lift it off.  It's almost impossible if you have hand cream on, or you're re-appying the balm with oily hands.  But it's worth the struggle."
0,Not as good as the ad. The stay and stick is not as good as a great product should be. Cleans up easy after use.
0,Good for one day only.And OPI test this product on animals. Not good at all. Poor animals......So never again.
1,"LOVE this stuff! Ive been a fan for many years now, this one is my favorite! smells delicious! Would recommend :)"
1,"This is one of the wrinkle creams that my wife has used for years. Her face looks great, so this must be working. I have not found a better price than on Amazon."
1,"I ordered this product based on the reviews and price. I had to make a choice between this one and the Secura Hot/Cold Steamer. Price won out... When I received my steamer, yesterday, I was excited to be able to test it out. I have to admit that I have never used a steamer before and was a little disappointed in the amount of steam the product produced. However, I figured out that the best approach to using it was to put a towel over my head, and the steamer, and put the timer on 15 minutes. This allowed the steam to build up and it did a much better job. But, honestly, that is what I was doing with my hot water in the sink, prior to purchase, and it did just as good of a job. I guess having the steam does save money on my water bill though. I am not sure that the Secura would have had better steam but I am a little nervous about having boiling (may not be boiling but is definitely hotter than my faucet) water so close to my face when I am using the Conair. My only big concern is that I might accidentally bump the machine (especially since I am also using a towel) and the water will splash up into my face. Overall, I think this is a good steamer for the price. Just be careful using it!"
1,"I purchase this at my local drug store and watch for it to go on sale. I came here to write a review because of how amazing this product is. If you are not using a leave in conditioner right no no matter your hair type, thickness, anything buy this product!!! It is a miracle cure.I have fairly thin, straight, fine, shoulder length hair that I style daily and have always struggled with keeping the ends of my hair from drying out and preventing split ends. I use deep conditioning/moisturizing treatments a few times a week and while those helped this product sealed the deal.After I shower my hair is always matted and tangled, I take a quarter-sized amount of this and rub it between my hands then gently massage it into the ends of my hair. It soaks into your hair instantly so if you have thick hair you will probably need to apply more and you can see the improvement. It does not leave a coating, or worse clump up. Then I take a wide toothed detangler comb and it slides through my hair like melted butter. It takes me just seconds to comb out my hair and I lose very little hair. Before this products I was constantly catch on knots and fighting through them. I have no idea how this product works so magically but it really does. It has also greatly improved the dryness and my split ends adding greatly needed extra moisture. It also has UV protection meaning that it adds a layer of protection to your hair. Amazing! After faithfully using this product for over a year I cannot live without it and now vouch for when my hairstylist is constantly raving about the importance of leave in conditioner. It is an absolute essential, the equivalent of washing your hair or brushing your teeth. No matter your hair type you should use leave in conditioner. Just try it, you will notice a huge improvement in your hair.This cream is also much much better than the spray also by Neutrogena. I did not find the spray to be effective at all."
1,This was my first hooded hair drier and I love it! It dries my whole entire head compared to other people who have purchased this drier in the past. I deep condition my hair all the time with this wonderful Conair hair drier in about 30 mins or longer. Packaging and delvery was excellent without any problems from this seller.Thanks for the great drier!
0,"I did a lot of research on mineral make-up. I was looking for a solution that would be fast so that I could look half decent when I drop the kids off at school in the mornings! AFter looking at different companies, products, and infomercials - I decided on bareMinerals because they had a range of colors (I'm african american) and because they had longevity and credibility in the marketplace.I was color matched and then had the make up applied. It looked nice, but not as nice as other make up I have tried. I think it looked a little grey and she tried a variety of the colors that they offered - but it was good enough for me to consider buying the starter kit and play around with it at home.As I walked the mall with my new purchase, my skin began to itch. And itch. And itch! Twenty minutes later I went back and the sales woman asked me if I was allergic to sunscreen. Uh - no. I answered. She told me to go home and try it with my moisturizer at home - I agreed since there was a 30 day return policy.I couldn't wait to go home and wash it off. I didn't bother trying it again - I returned the kit and got a refund. Afterwards, I did a little internet research and found that I wasn't the only one with that reaction to the product. Supposedly because bareMinerals has an ingredient (bismuth oxalate) in it which can be irritating to lots of folks. Wish I read that earlier!THere are mineral make up lines that do NOT have this ingredient, but they did not have a lot of color options - so I just scrapped the whole idea and decided to stick with my laura mercier tinted foundation."
1,"What's the second ingredient in Dr. Perricone's Super Detox Elixir? What's the second ingredient in Murad Clarifying Toner?  What's the second ingredient in Olek Henriksen Grease Relief Face Tonic?  I could go on and on.....but I'll just let you know. It's witch hazel, which you can find in your local pharmacy for a few bucks,  is a great astringent. And its one in its purest form.What is witch hazel? It is the leaves and bark of the North American shrub known as Hamamelis Virginiana (sometimes you might see this on a label as an ingredient in your favorite toner or astringent instead of the words ""witch hazel"").  Witch hazel naturally grows in Nova Scotia in Canada, and Florida in the United States.Witch hazel can be used for so many things but using it as your daily astringent can not only give you great skin but also a lot of bang for your buck! In addition, witch hazel is an herbal and natural product and thus it is great for sensitive skin. You can apply it after shaving, waxing and any kind of skin care regimen.There is a reason you can find witch hazel in so many skin care products.  It has so many benefits: it reduces excess sweating and oil secretion, helps with large pores, treats acne, and helps with various other skin conditions.  The astringent also has anti-inflammatory properties. If you have ever had a facial, you will notice that usually after extractions, your aesthetician will apply with hazel to your skin. Witch hazel can also help prevent the development of acne as well as treat existing acne and pimples. This is the reason why it is frequently used in acne skin care products.Another approach for using witch hazel astringent is treating psoriasis, dermatitis, eczema, diaper rash and poison ivy rash in the natural way. Witch hazel is also one of the best herbal remedies for alleviating sunburns and windburns.And the best part is that you can pick it up at your local pharmacy for about five bucks! Hope you enjoyed this skincents tip! For more tips and reviews visit pimples and wrinkles. And look out for the launch of our new site this month which will feature product reviews, treatment reviews and spa reviews. See you at pimples and wrinkles!"
1,"To be honest, I wondered if this makeup was going to be good, because it was sold at a MUCH lower price than I paid in the store, but the ONLY difference was that it did not come in a box or package (except package it was shipped in, lol). The makeup itself is exactly the same. I like this L'Oreal product, it works very well for making my skin tone look even, and it lasts all day. I definitely recommend the seller, and will buy again myself."
1,This moisturizer is great in that it leaves a slight shine on the skin. I love a glossy look for my extremely dry skin and throw in the added bonus that it doesn't smell like baby powder...I absolutely love it! Who wants to smell like baby powder as an adult! To me this moisturizer has the smell and consistency of the Original Keri lotion. I gave the lotion 4 stars bc it contains mineral oil and petroleum which I really don't like to be in my products. Mineral oil and petroleum block moisture so this lotion is better used after a shower or bath. I wouldn't classify it as natural...but it doesn't contain parabens. Another thing is that this lotion is uber expensive...$13.99 at Target for a 10 oz bottle! If Keri didn't have parabens I would switch back and save money.
1,This is the best unheard of ever ! Lasts a long time and very distinct has a sweet but mature smell got tons of compliments !
1,This is my favorite toner. Cleans and refreshes. Love it and highly recommend this product.
1,"to hold curls in and to glue cute plastic things to for impromptu hair clips. fun! You really can't go wrong with these. and they are a MUST if you curl your hair. clip that curl to your head and wait until it's all cooled down (make a cocktail while you're waiting)... and voila, sexy curly hair!"
1,great for sensitive skin.  this dry winter this combo is a life saver.  keeps skin from drying out cannot be without it
1,I bought the biggest size of this curling just great but I want to say that works well with med_long hair as my hair.
1,"I have use this nail streighner for 3 years and it works amazing, my nails actually get harder when I apply this OPI and the amazing thing is that it dries fast unlike other nail strenghters. Definally will recommend this."
0,Did not like this product. Smells awful and it after using it I did not get that fresh clean feeling.
1,"This is just one of many, many products I've tried to clear up my skin. For the last 6 months I've tried everything possible & nothing has worked.Finally I came across this stuff & within the first 3 days my acne started shrinking & now it is still red, yet not bumps anymore, just spots that are getting smaller each day.Finally something that works without drying out my skin or burning. I wear this under sunscreen & makeup in the day & under moisturizer at night.Jar is small, yet worth every penny. It only takes a little for spot treatment."
1,"I love to use this foundation stick! It's easy, portable and perfect for full face if you want a full coverage or it's great as a concealer. I have yet to find a foundation stick that is this easy to apply and truly has a FULL coverage. I have olive skin and use the true beige shade, however, it really is ok if it is too light as you can go over it with a darker powder and it looks great!"
0,"when i brought this i was originally looking for something to spay in my hair every day but i decided to get this instead it really doesn't do anything for my hair and yes i followed the directions and applied heat to my hair after i washed it but i could live without it. i really dont see what it's doing and i've tried it a couple of times...so yeah, but the chi keratin mist does wonders for my hair i love that product but this i wish i could return it but i already used it"
1,"i have wavy, dry, thick hair that goes about half way down my back and chest. i bought this iron because of it's awesome review on [...] but i wish i read into other reviews first. i don't like this iron because i feel like it never gets hot. it goes up to 420 degrees, i believe, but i feel like the plates are never hot and i need to go over certain parts of my hair four or five times. also, in a couple hours my hair starts to get wavy again. i would never recommend this iron to someone i hated! but.. the iron makes AWESOME barrel curls, which is why i give it three stars."
1,"DUO is the best brand on the market for eyelash adhesives. I can't say anything else other than, place it on the band properly and give it enough time to get tacky and then place the lashes on your lid where you want them and prepare to look fabulous all day. I've never swam in them or showered in them so I can't speak to it's wearability in water but as far as this adhesive holding lashes in place all day and comfortably, it does what it's supposed to do. I have been using DUO in the moist humid heat of the southern U.S. so it holds well in humidity."
1,Although the smell is not the best I do enjoy washing my face with this. My face feels so clean after use. I just can not use too often due it drying my skin out a little too much.
1,"I gave it three stars, as I really could not say if it works or not. For me it has such a strong smell, kind of minty , makes my face tingle slightly that I decided for the high price it was not worth it.I did hear a lot of great things about exuviance products and will try out some others, their toner I know is really good, I got to try a bit of it, it definitely removed all remaining make up after you wash your face, it has a bit of a orangy smell, but the smell goes away within less then a min. and it might just be the way how I preceive the smell."
1,The tingly feeling is just amazing! You will feel & see the difference as your skin will truly glow! Amazon you are just amazing!
0,"If you like Bath and Body Works or youthful smells similar to that, you'll HATE this. I stupidly thought it would smell good based on other reviews. DUMB! It smells WORSE than Estee Lauder and that grandma stench. I kept it on for a while at home and thought that horrible smell would fade, leaving a not so bad smell. Nope. I had to wash it off my wrist after a while because it was so bad.  BAD I SAY!!Don't do what I did and buy perfume you've not smelled. Once I find a post office, I'm sending this sucker back. I'm going back to Bath and Body Works and Victoria's Secret for perfume. This was disgusting."
1,"it works great, i use it for my daughter a lot, she is 5, and gets a lot of tangles, and this works very well for that, and leaves her hair so pretty, i have used it on my own hair as well, and it works well, it heats up very fast, easy to use, no problems with it, have had it for a while, and still perfect. would hightly recommend!"
0,"Dryer does not dry my hair well at all.  I can sit under it a full hour, and my hair in some sections will still be dripping wet.  Total waste of money."
1,"I've never been thrilled with using blush, but after using NARS Orgasm blush, I will never go back to anything else. Holy crap. This blush goes on spectacularly. I receive constant compliments on it. I'm very fair skinned and it doesn't overpower my face. My freckles still shine through and it doesn't give me a ""make up"" look. It's just very blendable and very natural looking. It gives me a healthy summer glow. I can't say enough good things about this blush!!!"
1,"I work in a profession where hand washing is necessary, often many, MANY times per day. The bees wax based hand products seem to work best bc they can stand up to a soap/hot water washing or two. Of hand cremes that I've tried, this one has to be my favorite. I like the price point, light lemon scent and quality of ingredients. I haven't purchased from Amazon, so this review is only for the product.It does take a moment for the product to sink in and it's a little greasy feeling at first. After that you're good-to-go. It lasts, is great for cuticles, and one tin will last a normal person a year. I would definitely purchase this again and recommend it to people who wash their hands and live in colder climate!"
0,This is so dry it's like chalk. The color is just ok. It must be old. Not happy.  I have bought other products from this seller that have been fine
1,"Nice large size kitchen sink soap, with a pleasant scent; especially useful when handling shellfish... makes short order of odor."
1,"I have been using this DMAE for sometime now and my face loves it. I get lots of compliments about my skin.I believe it is a mixture of the DMAE and Preperation H . Mix together, WOW"
1,this skin cream is the best & I have tryed what I thought was the best & priced cheaply
1,"I have very sensitive skin but this works like a dream on my skin. I wasn't using a toner before this. It seems to sooth my skin. I bought it to reduce my pores, and it seems like it did to a minor degree. The Andalou Natural Clarifying skin regimen I started two weeks ago has made a dramatic difference. I purchased a starter kit for $5 at Grocery Outlet and didn't have high hopes, but it has been the miracle I was looking for. I use the Thayers after the Andalou toner.I love the smell of this. Some people have written reviews suggesting that it's a fragrance that has been added, but it is genuine rose water. The label also tells you that this witch hazel isn't distilled. It's a purer form of witch hazel and has all the natural tannins.This really seemed to do something because it doesn't stink and have that salty, briny smell that other witch hazels have. It made a noticeable improvement in my skin, and with the Andalou, it has given me a sense of price in myself that my enlarged pores had diminished. This product is definitely worth buying. I love it, and will continue to use, and gladly purchase it again. It's really worth a try if you have sensitive skin, rosacea, and enlarged pores."
1,Light coconut scent. Nothing really special about it. I thought it was a natural product but its not. Not very moisturizing either.
1,this is really strong oil but still. very gentle on the skin.  I got it based on amazon posted reviews.  It looks like the product will last  for a long time. I will buy again.
1,"I have many sets of hot rollers as I love hot rollers more than the curling iron due to the damage curling irons can do to the hair... I did not want to take any of my expensive sets with me when I travel but I knew that I enjoyed plastic rollers with metal hair pins more than flocked rollers... so I decided that for less than $16 I can get these for traveling. I was not happy that the lid is not attached but now I think it is good to use to spread the metal hair pins, then I did not like the deep well because hair falls in the well or it makes it a little more difficult to quickly put the rollers back in their place but the curl in this set is incredible!!! Better curl than my $100-$150 roller sets!!! I enjoy the Conair Blue Compact set for $15 more but this set is a great set for travel!!! Great shiny curls like the sets from Conair in the 70s!!!Try the Conair Blue Compact set for $15!!! Those are nice but I think the curl on these may be better, I just wish this set would look like that set!!!For a beautiful high end set, I love the pastel colors of the rollers on the Babyliss but I wish they had metal hair pins to hold the rollers rather than the plastic clips."
1,"My favorite of all LUSH's Bath Bombs!  Smells so good, and leaves my skin really soft and moisturized.  What I love best about LUSH's bath bombs (and the bubble bars) is the fact that you don't need to rinse off after using them.  You just relax in your tub, and when you're done you just towel off.The  Sex Bomb contains jasmine, which I am not really a fan of, however I found this bath bomb to smell SOOOO good.  It must be the other essentials oils as well.  The scent lingers and I can still smell it the next day.  Sex Bomb made my bath water (I don't have a tub, but I used my boyfriends tub) a really nice pink color, and the rice paper rose slowly dissolved.  It made the water so silky and soft as well.  As weird as that sounds, you know what I'm talking about if you've tried a LUSH bath bomb before.  For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, go out and get one NOW!  You won't be disappointed!Good things DO come in small packages!"
1,"Finding Egyptian Goddess Oil in a little shop in Jackson, Wyoming seemed appropriate. It's fresh and wild and deep and sweet and full of mystery... Being REALLY picky about scents,(I only wear two) I was possessed when this scent spoke to me and I knew I could not set it down. I ordered a case of it a week later. My husband LOVES it. My sister and her husband loved it so much I gave her some. It lasts the whole day, and changes throughout the day, always whispering ""goddess"" with its amazing empowering aroma. I get fantastic comments on it - and if you should order a bottle, and it is not for you, please find a friend to give it to.. they'll love you for it. This is an exceptional and timeless scent - I have been wearing it for almost 20 yrs - and it still possesses me."
0,"I tried this a few years ago as a teenager, when I had some acne.  It was nothing horrible, just a few pimples here and there.  I saw this at the store and gave it a try, did everything I was supposed to and the pores under my eyes increased in size.  I had larger pores after using this product and it took me a while to reduce their size.  I didn't have much acne to begin with and this did seem to help, but the increased pores were a negative."
1,"I had another brand of Tea Tree oil that did not work as well as this one. So I know the quality of this Tea Tree Oil is GREAT! I initially bought it to use on a cold sore and let me tell you it demolished it in a couple of days!! The cold sore had already grown and it was big and yucky. I wet a q-tip pour some drops of this on it and dabbed it on the cold sore 3 times a day, let dry for about 30 minutes and the cold sore and scab was practically gone!Please note: I did apply Neosporin on top of the Tea Tree after it dried because it dry the cold sore up so much that it can crack and make you bleed and make it worst!! Make sure to wash the cold sore three times a day, ice it with an ice cube for about 3 minutes, then apply the tea tree oil, let it dry for about 30 mins then apply the Neopsporin on top. The Neosporin and Tea Tree as a team does a hell of a job in getting rid of a cold sore!! It is also great on acne! get it!!!Update:: Be sure to take Lysine supplements this keeps cold sores away and they also have Lysine lip balm as well."
1,"Clean and Clear's Continuous Control Acne Cleanser is your typical run of the mill benzoyl peroxide wash. I can't tell if I like this product or not since it worked very well within the first week or two of use but then I started to get one of the worst break outs I have had on my face in quite some time. It is still going away. Maybe that was just because final exams were rolling around in school but, either way I have a couple issues with this product.First and foremost, the ingredients contain petrolatum, a petroluem based jelly. I can't help but feel that putting in petroleum jelly which can further aggravate acne in a good chunk of people with more sensitive skin to be a bit counter-productive. I am sure that for those without sensitive skin issues that the petrolatum would be no issue. I am guessing this contributed to my problem because the amount of the solid ""gunk"" that could be seen in my pores increased. I know some of you know what I am talking about.Second, I feel it takes a pretty good sized glob to get a good lather going. Otherwise it feels like I am rubbing mostly water on my face. With a small blob the cleanser just gets watery and runs down my arms, which is annoying I must admit. It's tough to find the ""right amount"" for this product.I decided to ditch this product for Stiefel Labs' Panoxyl. Much nicer ingredients list and I have used it before and been very pleased with the effects."
1,I am afan of olay 7in 1. it is perfect for my combination/dry skin. and it is non-greasy. and the spf is a plus.
0,"I bought my husband a ton of different man soaps for Christmas. This one was an impulse buy on Amazon. I bought him at least four other different brands, and this was, by far, my least favorite. I don't think it smells good, and the smell is STRONG. If I left it out, it would stink up the whole room. The other pine tar soaps I bought didn't bother me like this one did. If I'd bought it at a regular store, I probably would have taken it back (or better yet, not have bought it to begin with). I had to put it in a zipper bag when I got it, so it wouldn't stink up the house and so he wouldn't know what it was. I reluctantly gave it to him, and I'm not looking forward to him actually using it. Additionally, when I received it, the box was all mashed up and open, so the soap never stayed in there correctly. This is my least favorite purchase from Amazon in a long time."
1,"Superb. Very sour.Makes u stop smoking.WARNING: do not apply on finger skin. make sure u apply only a thin layer on the nail because if it is on skin and if u touch anthing u eat, you will feel a taste change"
1,I really like this product. I mix it with Olay Complete Daily Defense All Day Moisturizer With Sunscreen Spf30 for my morning routine. it works very well for me.
1,"Like the shadow ,but rather on the light side. Love it for daytime, dont suggest it for night wear unless you mix and match. Cant beat Nars quality and assortment."
1,"It's been around for ages. I use it as a toner, much cheaper then dept. store toners. Also good for other uses, I wipe off my nails prior to polishing, it removes any oils from hand lotion."
1,This is the best hand cream and I use it also on my feet. It makes them feel so soft. I love this cream and will keep on using it!!! A++++
1,"Not only does this stuff make your nails look healthier with moisterized cuticles, but boy does it smell amazing! I probably look like a creeper walking around smelling my fingers after applying this but I can't help it. I definitely recommend it."
1,"I purchased the Nature's cure spray, along with the pills and the lotion.  I started using their products about a week ago, and have seen some serious results!People are already asking me what I am using for my face, and it is completley clearing up like crazy!  I am recommending it to all of my friends, and I plan on using this for a long time.  I don't really use the lotion that much that comes with the pills, except for on my back.  A combination of the lotion and spray on my back is what is really helping out a lot I think.The spray hasn't had any problems spraying from different angles, and at has a slight ""clean"" scent to it.  I don't know if it works for the long term, but I know my face/back/chest are clearer than they ever have been, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.I told one of my friends about it that avidly uses proactiv, and she said that when she tried to buy Nature's Cure on here that it was sold out.  I will be checking into that, as I def. plan on buying more.And no, I'm not one of those paid people-I just wanted to let everyone know that this stuff really is all the hype that they make it out to be.  I have tried proactiv, and haven't had nearly the results that this stuff has.I'm 22 and still get acne like I'm a teenager-but I already see a huge improvement.  I wish I would have taken before/after pictures so everyone else can see too.  For the first time since middle school I actually feel comfortable not wearing a pound of concealer/foundation."
1,"No fault of the seller- my perfume oil sat for four days at a USPS facility within twenty miles of my home.  Finally, it was delivered, I get to try the product.  Goes on strong but does not last.  Each persons body chemistry is different, this could be one of the reasons for the scent of the oil dissipating within an hour. I had to keep re-applying the oil.  Fragrance is nice, I wish it would last on my body longer.Would I place another order (??????), I do not know ."
1,"Satisfied with the product, beautifully finished, well pigmented, good quality, I use it as blush cheeks with excellent results. What you purchase."
1,Much more worth it than buying it at Walgreens even though they're the exact same size. It doesn't have that weird smell that the one I bought from Walgreens does too! Yay!
0,"I had been using the DivaCup for a while and had a lot of success with it, but when I lost it a friend  gave me a pack of the softcups she had used once and didn't like. I thought since I had liked the other brand this would be much the same way... it wasn't I don't know how many times I tried to readjust things and try different angles or higher/lower inside the vaginal walls, I couldn't stop the cup from leaking. It wasn't horrible, but it was enough to ruin a couple of pairs of panties which ensured that I wasn't saving money on this alternative item and that I won't be using the brand again. It was an utter disappointment... I'd say try another brand instead like DivaCup or Lunette, I had good experiences with both."
1,"I used to buy correcting pens at the grocery store that included polish remover in the handle.  So you just opened the top and started cleaning up the edges of your nails.  This product did not have polish remover included.  It is simply a pen with a removable tip and can be dipped in polish remover.  Still works, just an extra step so less portable since you have to carry along a bottle of remover.  They also sell the replaceable tips here so I'll be able to make use of this for years to come."
1,"The Duo Lash adhesive works fine, no problems. Just follow the directions and it should work out well for you."
1,This is really nice and easy. I like that and love it. Have nice Great Day! No frizz! GOOD Job.
0,"Never actually used but returned this product and bought something in a local health food store. I know many woman like this shade, but seeing it online I didn't notice that is was that shade. I should have known based on the name Mahogany, so this was my mistake and doesn't reflect the product itself."
1,"Hands-down this is my favorite brand of liquid eyeliner so far. It applies easily and the tip is more like a felt-tip marker than a brush, which makes it easy to apply perfect every time. It's a great one to try if you're new to applying liquid liner due to this ease of control.I've tried almost all the colors and love them all. I've been using Prestige for a couple years now and have run them out, but never had one dry up or get goopy on me."
1,"I have thin, blonde lashes and this mascara did nothing to make them fuller or longer.  Gave it to a friend, who has nice lases, and she likes it."
1,"I have been using Buf Puf since high school (I am in my 50's now). It keeps the dead skin cells from clogging my pores, which helps prevent old looking skin."
1,"My favorite wish is for Jason to make a bigger, less expensive bottle.  This is my favorite shampoo but I rarely buy it because of the cost.  If you have fine, wispy hair this will do wonders for the texture and feel of your hair!  It smells great and, as an added bonus, does great things for your scalp too!  Simply adore it.  Wether it actually THICKENS your hair... I don't know about that, BUT my superfine hair certainly FEELS more lush and lustrous after using this shampoo and conditioner... I just wish I could afford to use it exclusively, but for me this will have to remain a special occasion shampoo.  :(Note:  This stuff is THICK.  I mean it.  Almost like honey."
1,"This successfully moisturizes my skin without being remotely irritating. It absorbs and dries a bit differently than your average lotion, but the slightly sticky effect wears off after a few minutes."
1,"This is an excellent starter kit for those just getting into the Burt's Bees swing of things.  It has all the little soaps and creams to get introduced to the line.  I like Burt's Bees a lot because it is very natural.  It is not organic, but it is definitely much better than the conventional commercialized beauty products."
1,For the last 6 months my hair was damaged due to a John Frieda lightening spray. It left my hair sticky and it broke off from the roots. I had chunks of hair missing. I originally purchased the Aphogee shampoo for damaged hair...I started to see some improvement after a few uses with the shampoo...but the leave in conditioner with the aphogee shampoo has helped eliminate the hair issues.(Sticky hair) I have spent tons of money trying to repair my hair and trying to remove the sticky crap from my hair...but these 2 products by aphogee were the life and hair saver.
1,"I have the driest skin... plus I live in the south and get too much sun.  I started using this lotion at the suggestion of my daughter who insisted that the colloidal oatmeal was the key for her skin.  So, I found Aveeno's version and LOVE this stuff!  My skin absorbs it like no other lotion and it helps keep it smooth and soft.  I'm 59 yrs. old and never expected to have this happen at this point.  I get this every two months from Amazon and love it much better than the over-perfumed lotions at Bath & Body and shops like that, plus it's a better deal."
1,"What can I say other than this is the best powder I have ever used and I have tried many brands. MAC happens to be some of the best and affordable (as compared to Dior, Estee Lauder etc), that actually works and lasts on..I have been using this powder (I use for minimum to medium coverage), along with Smashbox primer, and it looks fabulous..One compact lasts me about ONE solid good year..I highly recommend.."
1,"I bought this cream because of all the raving reviews on Amazon.com and on other websites.  I was very excited to use this cream.  After using it for 2 months, here are my thoughts about this cream.Here are the reasons why I give 3 stars:1) The ingredients in this cream is a lot better than most of the drug store creams that contains parabens, fragrances and irritating chemicals.2) It is a very &#34;affordable&#34; drug store cream.3) It hasn't caused any breakouts on my face yet.4) The thick texture makes it a great neck cream.5) I like the extremely faint shea butter smell.Here are the reasons why I DON'T like it:1) The reason why I don't think this is an unbelievably great face creme like other reviewers is because it's very thick and does not provide enough hydration for my face.  I only use a small amount of this cream and it forms a thick layer on my skin and makes my skin look matte.  If you use too much, you are going to have a thick greasy fatty alcohol layer (hydrogenated alcohols) sitting on your face.2) I can't use this cream during the day because it forms clumps with my sunscreen and foundation. So I can only use this cream at night.  My T-zone started to overproduce oils after a few hours.  I think this is because this cream only forms a BARRIER on your skin to prevent moisture loss, but it does not contain ingredients that penetrate my skin to keep it moisturized.  I use Tazorac for acne so my skin gets dry and peels, which results in excessive oil production.  So using a BARRIER type of face cream does not adequately provide moisture on my face.  My skin still peels during the day and T-zone produces too much oil because my skin is dry, despite that I have this thick cream sitting on top of my face.3) The &#34;JAR&#34; packaging is very unsanitary!  The packaging doesn't protect the antioxidants (e.g. Q10, biotin) in this jar.Overall, I think if you normal, dry, combo skin that is not acne prone, this cream will work great for you.  I have too many skin problems so my skin demands more than this cream can provide.FYI:  My skin type is sensitive acne prone with deep acne scars and very large pores that are easily clogged.  My cheeks are red, sensitive, dry and peels a lot."
1,"I like really hot showers, horrible for your skin but with this body wash I'm not itchy due to dryness afterwards. I can use it on my entire body, intimate places included.I'm allergic to fragrance items, so this item helps as there is no fragrance added. It smells like oatmeal, but to be honest I like the smell AND it gets the job done."
1,"I am a big fan of OPI nail lacquer.  I was looking for a new red.  This one has the tone I was seeking.  Bright, without being in your face.  It is a lovely, iridescent color.  Long lasting, and slow to chip."
1,"I've been using this stuff for years. Amazon's price is best unless you happen to find these on sale. I have dry skin and this has always been the best for me. Also, it smells amazing."
1,I have a slightly yellow complexion so pinks look bad and corals look orange.  This is just right.  Only con:  doesn't seem to last that long...have to re-apply during the day.
1,"O.P.I. Nail Polish has and always will be a favorite of mine.  Why? Many reasons really...it could be the way it goes on smooth, the color, the shine, the way it never chips and last for days or it could be the fact that it doesn't have that horrible nail polish smell.  It's a high quality polish and one of the best they have on the market.Whether I'm painting them myself or at the salon, OPI is always my choice and ""I'm Not Really A Waitress"" is one of the very best reds that they have to offer.  It's a true red with a little bit of sparkle but not gaudy at all.This color is perfect for year round use, but I prefer it in the fall/winter months. I found this color years ago and I haven't let go since.  This is a red that you can't duplicate!  Plus, how can you resist the names of the polishes that this company comes out with?If your dying to try an OPI color, this is a great one to start with. Not over-the-top and not under-stated!  I highly recommend this polish!"
1,"I have the powder Orgasm blush, and let me say, I like this much better. The first thing I did with it, was recycle one of Bobbi Brown's beautiful compacts, and melted down a coin of this, to pour into the container, (alone with a little grapefruit Chapstick) and that's the best decision I've made with it so far. It's such a pretty, shimmery color. PERFECT for summer.I'm also a fan of cream or cream to powder products to begin with, so to have this, and rouge a little on my cheeks after some nice, sheer foundation is the perfect pop of color and shimmer.WONDERFUL product!"
1,I've been looking for a neutral lipstick for years until I tried this product which was recommended by Allure's magazine for &#34;What's IN right now!&#34; I am highly satisfied that I don't have to keep searching for the right shade anymore. This is simply amazing!
1,"I have always had issues with my scalp from dandruff to mild psoriasis and I've tried numerous products to address the issue, but none have worked quite as good as this. I was of course skeptical when I first purchased this product because it was relatively cheap and I've gone through a multitude of products that are often double the price. I have to say that I felt relief the first time I used it. After a few uses it had helped stop the itch, the flakes and irritation. Plus, it actually left my coarse, frizzy hair soft and manageable which was an unexpected bonus."
1,"I am already very fond of this brush. When used for normal brushing (as an experiment), it made my hair soft, smooth, and super shiney. When used with a hair dryer for a nice blowout, my hair comes out fantastic. I haven't had the bristle issue that I saw mentioned on here, yet. My only complaint about this brush is the fact there there isn't a nonslip grip. The handle is glossy, so it is easy to slide when turning in your hair. I didn't feel that the handle was too small either, which was a commom complaint that I saw on here. Over all - a great brush and almost perfect!"
1,It's light and helps my skin to look great. I recommend it to everyone I know. I especially love it for overnight.
0,"The pump doesn't get the end bits, so you end up wasting 1/4 of the product. Very irritating and wasteful."
1,the package and the name of this product makes for a very nice gift for a guy.  the scent is also very nice.
0,"This is by far the worst thing I have ever put in my hair. I have long wavy hair, and I made sure it was dry and brushed before using this product. I put a small segment of hair on the brush (despite the fact that after 30 minutes of heating, it was barely warm), and when I wrapped a strand of hair around the brush twice, I could NOT get the hair out. It tangled and held on to my hair so tightly, I even considered cutting it off! Eventually after 20 minutes of struggle, I was able to free my hair. I immediately returned it to the drug store where I purchased it and even wrote a review on the remaining products on the shelves with a sharpie, directly on the packaging to warn other people (see customer posted images). Don't purchase this if you care about your hair."
1,"I have used many high end scrubs and this is one of the best and least expensive.  Each time I use the scrub, my skin feels really clean and fresh.  Makeup goes on better too.  Will buy again.  Don't need very much so the tube will last quite a while."
1,It is drying and has not made a huge difference on pore size yet. It may be that it needs to be used several times a week. I cannot do that because my skin is EXTREMELY dry.
1,"I just began wearing eyelashes, and it takes a few times to get it right!  With this thin line brush on glue, all you do is place a very small amount on the brush, put it on the lash, line it up and go!  I will not ever be using any other type of lash adhesive.  Overall the Duo brand is excellent, but whomever invented this one baby, let me tell you, they tried it, got it right and I'm thanking them for this product!  You GO DUO ,)!"
1,"This cologne is a beast if you like smelling like a real man then this is for you. It is farely inexpensive so dont worry. No kids allowed this is a grown mans cologne so step your game up without breaking the bank. best worn in the evening, oh yeah giggity giggity"
1,"It does stay on and that's a plus...no lipstick marks on glasses or cups.  I have found that if I don't entirely remove it with makeup remover, I will sometimes end up with a ridge of color at the edges which isn't attractive, but removing that and starting fresh, all is well.  I like the color very much...it has enough blue in it for me, but not too much."
1,"The texture of the cleanser takes some getting used to; it does not spread over the skin like soap so I can't get away with a couple of squirts on a washcloth to wash my whole body. I have dry, sensitive skin and mild adult acne that gets worse with exercise and the hot weather. In the month I used this (only lasted me that long) I realized I wasn't breaking out the way I used to. When I ran out I tried another, less expensive product that was also supposed to be dermatologist recommended. I broke out the next day and had itching in areas that weren't itchy using Cetaphil. I'm going back to Cetaphil but to make it last longer I'm just using it on my face and sensitive areas. I think it's worth it."
1,"I switched to this soap after finding out the ""cruely-free"" ones I had been using contained palm oil ""hidden"" in the ingredient lists under different names. Palm oil production is driving orangutans to near extinction. Not exactly ""cruelty-free"" as those soaps claimed. This brand is great for sensitive skin."
1,There is no 100% pure aloe unless you buy a plant. That's an option I'm considering but after a long search I bought this gel. It works well with no scent. I didn't like all the added ingredients including alcohol in most aloe gels. This has some ingredients but over for me the best choice compared to others.I still get dryness on my face but Rosacea dryness is really hard to combat. I was looking for something that would help with redness and not cause more issues. This fit the bill.
1,"I have gone through several brands of toners, alcohol and non-alcohol, and this is the best. It actually moisturizes your skin, instead of drying it out! And after I use it, I don't feel like I have to rinse my face. It feels so natural and still picks up dirt- not as much dirt as the harsher brands though, so if you have oily acne-prone skin. this is a good second toner after you use the harsh stuff. My skin is oily in the summer and dry in the winter, and in the summertime I use Sea Breeze before this and it prevents over-drying and still moisturizes without creating extra oiliness. Best of all, it smells great! Like sweet rose petals. If you don't like the smell, it's not potent anyways.This is the best toner I've ever had, and I'll be buying many more bottles."
1,"It is a good cleanser with a heavenly smell that has some moisturizing properties although it doesn't replace lotion, particularly in the winter a whole lot of lotion is still required if you have dry skin. I find in the summer when my skin isn't dry this is a gentle cleanser that supplies that bit of hydration that might be all I need that day."
1,I bought this product because of the rave reviews and my face has not had any negative effects from using it.  It feels good to use it but I don't actually know that it makes any difference to my face.  Not yet from what I have observed thus far.
1,"I've been dying my hair for 10 years, and this is my absolute favorite blonde hair color! Feria seems to last longer than most home coloring brands that I've used. It smells nice, and it lasts longer than your average box color.New improved Feria boasts of ""3X Shimmering Highlights""... and they're not lying! In the light, you can really see it shimmer. I can also pick out some highlights & lowlights if I look closely. I love it! This color itself (Dark Golden Blonde) is my favorite. I tell my sister it looks like ""gold in a bottle"", which is totally true!As a bonus, I love the conditioner that comes with it!If you want non-brassy color with rich golden/reddish tones, use this! You won't regret it!"
1,"I adore an all-natural company named LUSH from Canada and all their great but pricey products. Enter Skin Trip. This could hang on their shelves and hold its own for quality. It's paraben-free which is a good thing. Its coconut scent is down right delicious -- light, airy and far fetched from the artificial coconut scents we sometimes get used to. It goes on very smooth. It's not thick like a shea butter based lotion and spreads very well. I use it after a day at the beach to soothe my skin from the mild sunburn. Also great after waxing, showering and let's admit it.. any time! It hasn't clogged the pores on my face either but make sure you clean your face first or it definitely will! Covering dirt with lotion is a guaranteed break out. This is a luxe lotion you can find in boutiques if you're lucky. Amazon's price (16) is decent. It is more expensive than it's worth but with the free shipping it balances out. If you love coconut and hate parabens this is your Mecca. One 8oz bottle will really last."
1,I have used this product for about a year now. I had a large age spot on my face which has disppeared after using Help Me every night. I am serious!! I wouldn't be without it.
1,"But, it does not adjust up and down.  It moves sideways and forward.  That makes it a little ineffective.  Other than that, it is solid and does what it is supposed to do."
1,"I did a lot of research before I decided to try this product. I used it for about a month and my nails are so amazingly healthy and long. I went to the nailtiques website and purchased more formula 2, formula 1, avocado foot cream, and polish remover. They sent me a little gift package with my purchase. I will use naitiques for as long as they continue to provide a quality product that does exactly what it claims. Worth any price."
1,"This mascara is a classic and with good reason.  It goes on easily, stays where you out it. It doesn't clump too much and there are no fibers to fall into and irritate your eye.  You just get defined lashes without any extras you may not need.  Plus it is a value that you can not beat."
1,"Love the brush.. Works really great! Great value too! I would recommend it to my friends. If youre thinking of buying this, go for it."
1,"I was very skeptical, but these really work when you sleep in them overnight...but you have to keep using them to keep up the effects...love them."
1,"My recommendation for this hair dry is that the customers try. I really like to use it when my hair is wet. It dries your hair quickly,the hair is shinny, soft and manageable. I've had it for a few months now and I like it so far. I don't have anything negative to say about this product."
1,"I have had this for about a year. I use it once a month, but I still have more than half of the tube left. It lasts a long time, and leaves skin feeling soft for weeks"
1,"I was looking for a cheap, new nail polish to try and decided on this color. I did not expect to be this pleased with the result.  Yoga-ta Get This Blue is a deep, navy blue.  I was expecting a regular navy, but when I saw this polish in the sunlight, it has a certain shimmer to it which was unexpected and very attractive.  It also stays put.  My job is very hard on nail polish, but this stuff has remained almost chip free.  I will definitely be buying from OPI again soon."
1,"The color comes out darker than one would think fo the name &#34;light chestnut brown, 5N. I also don't like that you can't measure so you have to use the whole thing and buy a new one each time.... But it does make the hair smooth. I switched to herbatint, which I prefer overal."
0,"I have been using DMAE cream and wanted to add a serum to my daily regemine. This is not it. It is very sticky and pills up on the skin. It is very drying. Be forewarned, this is one of those products that cannot be returned."
1,"This product definitely helps keep the face well moisturized all day. I even saw a nice improvement in my skin tone. It's nice to not have to worry about UV rays when I have this on as well. There was no problems with acne at all - but I can't say it ""helped"" it either. Overall great investment."
0,"I've bought this before at the drugstore and used it until it was gone.  The smell is light, the formula is light; it was just a good option for using a dab to stay hydrated without feeling greasy.Problem is, either they changed the formula or I got a bad batch.  Now, even if I apply the thinnest layer to my face, using a dot smaller than the size of a pencil eraser, I get this weird greasy feeling all over.  Shortly after that is what I call ""the water stage,"" where as if by magic, my entire face seems to have a fine sheen of water just sitting right on top.  I seriously have to go pat dry with a towel, because it looks like I've worked up a sincere sweat.  I don't know what's wrong with this product, and I'm holding onto it to try in the dry winter months, but I'm not optimistic.  At this point, I would not order it again."
1,"i got this to get rid of a scar and it did just that, if you are looking to remove any discoloration (spot) this will get rid of it, i dont know about putting it all over your face but it def work for a spot"
1,"I bought this because I love the Aveeno Positively Radiant (non-tinted) moisturizer that is SPF 15 and now that winter is here, my pale skin needs some color. I also use the Jergens Natural Glow facial moisturizer, but it just doesn't keep my makeup in place throughout the day like Aveeno does. So, I bought this product thinking it was more like a gradual tanner. At first I was taken aback when I saw how thick the lotion is but I am pleasantly surprised. The Fair to Light is perfect for my skin and it evens it out nicely before I apply my daily makeup. I've typically tried BB creams in the past for this purpose but they all make me break out. I'd highly recommend this over a BB cream. Great product!"
1,This cream works fine for a slight progesterone deficiency to extend tge luteal phase by a day or 2. However if your progesterone is really low like mine this will not help much. I used the cream because my luteal phase was 9 to 10 days making implantation of a baby difficult. This cream only extended my luteal phase by one day using the max dose. I tried to use it to mantain progesterone levels during early pregnancy and had blood tests to see if it was working. It did not keep my levels high enough to maintain a pregnancy so my doctor gave me 200mg. Prometrium prescription progesterone vaginally. Whether or not it works for menopause symptoms or not I dont know because I did not use it for that purpose.
1,"I like this product as a whole because i'm big into to all natural products for my face. It refreshing, but I don't love the overall scent. I have tried others that are a little less potent. Otherwise it's serving it's purpose."
1,"This product was brought to my attention by a beauty guru/professional. I have been using this for about a week and my nails have not broken yet. I have been trying all different types of hardeners all my life and none have worked, my nails will still keep breaking farther and farther into my skin and bleeding no matter how short I keep them. This product is my favorite nail strengthener. Its thin, so I apply about 4 coats, it drys in seconds, and then two coats of nail polish and then two of a nail strengthening top coat. The one I use is Sally Hansen Diamond strength."
1,"This is the best brush ever!  I have tried many brushes, including very expensive ones, but this is the one my hairstylist uses so I bought it on Amazon.  Reasonably priced, works like a charm and doesn't get tangled in my hair, gives me fantastic volume!  I won't use any other kind ever again!!!"
1,"Ok, so I tried this a few years ago and gave it a thumbs down. Well I'm now 50 and in need of some light coverage instead of the more heavy coverage I needed before. A little background on me: I'm half Japanese, olive toned, oily T zone area and slight chin acne off and on. I've been using Everyday minerals but it's making my skin appear rough and too &#34;made up&#34; for my liking. I did try BB cream (Skin79 hot pink) but the color was too light and I am having to mix with another foundation to get a good color. While I looking around I came across this stuff in my old make up bin. Thought I'd try it again. Well it really does a great job of evening my skin out and keeping my natural skin color. This a BIG plus. It is really hard to find a good olive color and I tan quite well in the summer and pale out in the winter. It's really a pain for me to find the right color going back and forth mixing colors. This works no matter how dark or light I am. I also struggle with some large pores on my T zone area. This stuff really helps in that dept a lot. Though my pores are still there, they are no longer noticeable and I no longer have to use a pore primer! The only thing I use is a light under eye concealer underneath and spot treatment on my chin and then brush it on. Another great thing is that this has great staying power.Really keeps the oiliness at bay.  I really need that living in Texas! It's cheap but not that easy to find but it's big tub so I would imagine it will last a good long time. The smell if not offensive to me at all. It's nice girly smell, not like sulfur or something like that. So I'm changing my mind. For now this is what works for me ;)"
1,"This is my 4th month of using this treatment.  I still can't tell if there has been any improvement.  I will continue to use it because I know regrowing hair cannot happen over night.  It does seem thicker in the area where I am applying the treatment but I can't see the growth and don't know how it will appear.  I keep looking for some fuzzy growth but don't see it, although it does feel like that--I do see some short hairs (my hair is long and does grow very fast) and wonder if the new growth is already there and beginning to blend--only time and a lot of patience will tell.  My hair dresser said I would be surprised at the number of women who use the treatment--it is not something women are willing to discuss with other women."
1,Love this product.  It does all that it is supposed to do:-)
1,"Have been using this for years and no other cleaner I've tried gives me a fresh, clean, soft and smooth looking skin like this one.It works and also makes my skin feel great post wash. What more can i ask for!"
1,"I guess I had no idea what 4.5 fluid ounces really was, but I happily bought this to combat my dandruff. And it does just fine! I definitely have noticed reduced flakes with this. As a shampoo, it's more medicinal - it doesn't smell great, doesn't have a smooth luxurious texture...but it does what it says so, I guess I have to reduce my complaining :)"
1,"I have combination skin and I like my cleanser to clean well, leave no residue, and not drying. This cleanser has it all. Before buying I thought it was a cream cleanser that doesn't foam up, and worried it doesn't clean well. After using it I am impressed how well it cleans yet doesn't dry my skin. The scent isn't the best (smells like lavender and some kind of chemical).The price may seem a little high compared to drug store cleansers, but the bottle lasts a long time so it's in deed a good value. I use it in the morning only (use different cleanser at night) and a dime size does the job. My 8 oz bottle lasts more than 5 months."
1,This product leaves my skin soft and supple.  I always look for the best price on this product on Amazon Obagi had it this time.
1,"This is a good, thick cream but I personally feel that it's not thick and moisturizing enough for night. I actually wear this for day and it looks fine under makeup. I rarely wear foundation and powder but when I do I don't have any problems.I use this with other Olay products, and my face has not looked as good as it does now in almost 10 years. Olay products and switching to a vegan diet has done wonders for my skin's tone and radiance. The lines in my forehead are almost completely GONE. Yes! Gone! As long as I keep my skin moisturized, you can't see them at all until you get only a few inches from my face. My neck wrinkles look better too!Now, I'm 27 and I have a 2 year old. I started getting forehead wrinkles around the time she was born and my skin has been very dry. Since I started using this, my skin has gone back to what it looked it years before I even had my daughter. I've had wrinkles on my neck since I was 14, and this is the only thing I've tried that has made them look better. I could not be happier."
1,"I have combination skin (oily in some parts and dry around the T zone) and I have tried every type of face wash out there: Acne Free, Aveeno, Olay, Dove, Clearasil, Neutrogena, exfoliating washes, super expensive stuff, etc. I read the reviews for Philosophy Purity and thought I would try it.It took about a month for my skin to get used to it, and at first I wasn&#8217;t convinced it was worth it; however, once my skin got used to it, I will not use any other face wash out there. I love this stuff! I no longer have any acne, my skin is smooth and looks fresh, and I don&#8217;t need to use exfoliating products any more to get off my dead skin. This face wash seems to chemically exfoliate my skin without causing irritation or acne. If you have combo skin, I highly recommend this face wash! Just give your skin time to adjust to it!Every morning I use Philosophy Purity face wash, Dermalogica Active Toner, and Complex 15 moisturizer. My skin is soft, smooth, acne free, and looking better than it has in a few years. I highly recommend these products for those of you struggling with combo skin."
1,"Great color, it's a great alternative for black"
1,"THis power is great and it does cover beautifully but I certainly makes me break out. From talking with the woman who does my facials this is not uncommon with this powder. I use it only for performances and times when I really need that full matt porcelain vintage look. Otherwise I avoid it for my skin's sake. It goes on best over a smoothing serum but don't use it with a liquid foundation as well, it will cake and crack."
1,I have used this product for years and have periodically tried otherbrands but always go back to this.  The price is very reasonable.
1,"No scent or flavor. No color. Not oily or tacky. Feels soothing. And it has SPF protection, which is important for cancer prevention! Sounds so simple, but this is the only lip balm I've found that has all of these characteristics, which is exactly what I want."
0,"Due to arthritis, I have crooked toes, and thought these would help to separate them. However, they tend to slip out, and are uncomfortable. I have tried different sizes, but all had the same results. I wouldn't waste my time buying these, unless, perhaps, your toes are slightly crooked; they might help."
1,"Dealing with a bit of a breakout on my chin/jawline area, and I thought this might help.It cleans off makeup & dirt fairly well.  I still deal with my usual dryness.I'm sure it'd be fine for those who don't have acne prone skin, but I think I'm going to try something else now.Good luck!"
1,Excellent quality and fast ship.My husband loves it! He loves how roomy it is and giw soft the leather is.
1,Great makeup I use this all the time and go back to it. Color is good and am very happy with the purchase. Thanks!
1,"I was looking forward to a lavender scented dish soap. This dish soap had that but it also had a funky smell. It worked okay for washing dishes, but not well enough for me to continue purchasing this product.Recommend with caveats given.Penmouse"
1,"This is truly a high quality blush.  It goes on smoothly and doesn't need a touchup until, maybe, late afternoon.  So you really do use very little.  There are such beautiful colors from which to choose.  I recommend it."
1,"I am sure this shampoo will do more than fine for my dog.  It leaked a little in the box, but not much.  Good shampoo."
0,"I am 45 and have nice skin, but have a chronic illness which (I think) is making the fine lines on my face more noticeable.  I read a lot of reviews on a lot of different products and decided on this one because of price and availability (I can pick it up at any store as well as online).I've been using it for 8 weeks and can honestly say, I notice no difference at all.  My skin isn't brighter, the dark circles are still there, so are the fine lines.  So while it may or may not be working for others (it's all in your perception, right?) it didn't work for me.The first week or so, I noticed my eyelids and eyebrows itching and peeling A LOT.  It was very uncomfortable.  But it says that some of this is to be expected, so I kept on.  The itching/peeling has calmed down for now.I don't care much for the scent.  It's not that it's bad or overpowering, it's just not pleasant to my sensitive nose.  I like my face/body creams to have no discernible scent at all.This cream does not spread well, the tube just barely lasted the 8 weeks and that was with me being very careful not to use too much.  I found myself struggling to make sure I was covering my entire face & neck.So all that said, this might work for some, but it didn't work for me.  I have fair skin and do not sunbath & always wear a sunscreen, even in winter, so it's not like I was expecting it to remove road-map wrinkles."
1,"I got a free sample of this foundation and I love it, you can't tell your wearing anything at all. Its light weight, comfortable, and doesn't come off on clothing. I would recommend this product to all my friends and family."
1,Not sure this this product is helping or not i have been using for over a week. It does make my skin feel very smooth and clean after use so i have hope that it will!
1,"This is day two of the Caruso system and I am happy I ran out to buy it at Sally's Beauty Supply yesterday. So, I have to tel you my journey. I am a African-American woman who has always had decent hair until a few years ago when I decided to abandon my ""old-timey"" way of doing my hair. Which meant out with the roller setting after washing and in with the blow drying and curling iron/flat iron route. Of course my previous shoulder-length hair is now 5 inches shorter and is looking dry and frizzy and beat up looking. So in efforts to cure that, I went the route of extensions and such. Bad move again. This week I decided enough was enough. Back to the basics of ""low impact"" haircare. I don't like to sleep on rollers so I decided to purchase this set because of all of the rave reviews. I had used regular hot rollers but was not real happy with the look 2 -3 hours later after the curls had fallen. (And they were hot!!!) Day one of using the Caruso system, my hair was bouncy and beautiful. Day two, I learned a little from day one in how to put them in and today I feel like a movie star. I used the jumbo rollers to create soft curls and waves. I tried the system both ways, in that I heated the roller and the shield on half my head and just the roller on the other half this morning. I can see how the heated shield could make a longer lasting curl, but it took too long for my hair to dry that way. I ended up having to blow dry the rollers dry, not a bad idea, just an extra step I would take when going somewhere special. Also,try experimenting with how long to keep the roller on the unit. That can change your drying time also. My husband tells me I look sexy and beautiful and to be honest, it takes the same amount of time it used to take for me flat iron my hair everyday. I am 36 years old and I know for a lot younger women the idea of hot rollers makes them feel like they are going to end up looking like their grandma, but I can say that with a little practice you can make the hairstyles you see everyday on people without the damage to your hair. Your hair will be bouncy, shiny and healthy!"
1,"Ever since I discovered ceramic flat irons about ten years ago, I haven't been able to live without one. I've tried so many different brands from Chi to Fhi to Hai to Solia and Sedu... Each has its own benefits and detriments. The honest truth about all of them, though, is that none of them last more than a couple of years. The wiring goes out or the casing cracks. Or they just die. Either way, no matter which brand you choose, unless you're the most careful person on the planet, you aren't going to have this iron forever.Now that that disclaimer is out of the way, onto the Solia! I shop on Folica for all my major hair needs and I find they offer the best prices for hair tools. The Solia Tourmaline Ceramic Ion Flat Iron is one of the most reviewed items they had and at a reasonable price of $80 (with coupon I got it for $60), I figured it was worth a shot. Before I bought it my Sedu iron had just died, so I was comparing the Solia's performance to that one as soon as it arrived.The Solia, compared to the Sedu, feels like a solid iron. There is a little more weight to it and it doesn't feel flimsy or easily breakable. I've only ever owned the black model, so I can't comment on any of the other colors. I bought the one inch size since I wanted to try to curl my hair with it after watching several tutorials on youtube.This iron heats up to a pipping hot 450 degrees, which is nice. My hair is quite thick and somewhat wavy so I generally have to use these irons on their highest setting.Unfortunately, the Solia did not perform as well as the Sedu had. It took me about 30 minutes to fully straighten my hair and I would have to go over sections three or four times with the iron before they would be perfectly straight. The other downside of this was that the straightening did not hold up as well when I would go outside. Windy or humid weather would make my hair wavy all over again, somewhat defeating the purpose.Curling was out of the question since the exterior of the iron did not get very warm, although the plus side of that was that I never accidentally burned my fingers.Two years down the road when my Solia died, I shelled out the extra money and replaced it with the Sedu. However! Folica was running a promotion at the time that if you spent over $75, you would get a Solia 1"" iron as a gift with purchase. So I guess I know have a backup Solia iron for when my Sedu ultimately dies.If you have easily straightened hair and are on a budget, this might be the iron for you. I need something more powerful, so I prefer the Sedu. However, I can still get the Solia to work for me with extra time and effort."
1,I have been using this cream for many years and I have never been dissatisfied with the quality and I will continue to purchase it.
1,"I have eczema and it's hard to find something that will cleanse my skin and not be too harsh.  It's so gentle I even used it for my baby's bath since I couldn't find her baby wash! Perfect cleanser, I will be buying again!"
1,"Williams Lectric Shave Electric Razor Pre-Shave Original, 3 fl oz, definately makes an annoying choir a little easier. I've never been a huge fan of electric razors, because I haven't found any brand that gives me as good a shave as I get from even a cheap blade. Its been my personal experience that most electric shavers leave lots of stuble and it's hard to get a clean shave under the chin and throat area. For me, it usually requires more time to get a clean shave with an electric razor than is required when using a disposable razor. Williams Lectric Shave allows me to get a smoother shave when using an electric, but its smell, while not offensive, is almost overpowering.Please rate this review if you found it helpful."
1,"I've been looking for a reasonably-priced antioxidant serum, and this is the best drugstore version I've found. As someone with combination skin, I don't generally use a moisturizer, however this product provides all the moisture I need. It has an incredibly lightweight/silky feel on my skin, and dries to a matte finish. I use it on my entire face, specifically around the eye region.The combination of B vitamins and amino-peptides is great for my skin, and I wear it under my sunscreen daily. As a man, I like that the product is fragrance-free, and just makes my skin just look &#34;healthy.&#34;"
1,I just started using false eyelashes and I purchased a kit that already had the glue included. It was very thin to say the least and I was getting frustrated with the eyelashes. I saw the reviews here at Amazon and decided to try the Duo adhesive. It's a very good adhesive and I have to say that I definitely recommend it.
1,"My 4 1/2 yr old daughter has eczema and this was recommended by our pediatric Dermatologist.  I was using Cetaphil and even though it's &#34;unscented&#34; and gentle, it still contains a masking fragrance that can bother skin.  The Free & Clear is very silky and seems to clean even better than the Cetaphil I was using.  Makes skin very soft as well.  I follow it up with the Vanicream Lotion as well after the bath.  Will definitely buy again-"
1,"This is only my second time using it, and my skin is glowing! Don't just lather it on and rinse, make sure you really take your time and scrub. Then I paired it with a brown sugar and honey face mask afterwards for a nice second cleanse, and some burt bee's radiant cream. But without the two, this product still does wonders. I have blackheads coming off, and my skin tone is evening. This isn't even a week of using it, and I can tell it's working!"
1,Makes skin feel and look more visibly soft. Noticed after 2nd use. I've been using this and clinique face wash for almost 2 weeks now and my deep dark very noticeable acne marks are almost invisible. One of my favs!!!
1,I don't know what Jaag is talking about. I love this product. I have extremely fair and very sensitive skin and this doesn't burn my face at all. It moisturizes well and I really like it.
1,"This product is very rich and goes on thick so you only need a little to cover a large  area. After two months of consistent use, I have not seen any reduction in fine lines, but my skin is soft, so I think it's a good moisturizer.It  irritates my eyes if I get too close so I won't repurchase as I hate the feeling."
1,"*I purchase from a beauty supply storefront locally*I'm always trying new hair products. Some are amazing (ie, Nexxus Emergencee, Coconut Oil, Paul Mitchel Moisture lines, Sebastian, Tressemme, etc), while others are epic fails (read my WEN review). Well, I LOVE LOVE LOVVVVVVVVVE this Redken Anti Snap product! I've used it for several years and would have an attack if Redken ever discontinued it. lol It's a MUST-HAVE product if you bleached/highlighted/and, or, frizzy hair.I use this product after every shampoo/conditioner use.I apply Extreme Anti Snap to my towel dried hair and comb through. Follow with a tiny (tiny!!) dab of coconut oil and comb through. Then, I spritz with Tressemme's heat protectant spray and I blow dry. I ALWAYS end up with perfectly blow dried STRAIGHT hair that looks and feels healthy and shiny and thick/full/lush, even after a full head highlight service!I often rotate my shampoos and conditioners (from high-end salon products, to less expensive drug store brands), but I ALWAYS ALWAYS use Redken Anti Snap!I'm planning to try Anti Snap+ coconut oil after using my Wen Almond Mint conditioning cleanser and Wen 6 Thirteen Conditioner, in hopes that Anti Snap can make the Wen salvageable. If Redken Anti-Snap can't help me make Wen work, then NOTHING can. :/NOTE:I recently purchased the Redken ""strengthening plus"" treatment. Will be posting a review as soon as I use it. I'm hoping it's as fabulous a product as the Anti Snap."
1,LOVE IT! My skin feels so clean and refreshed without over drying.
1,"This is a great lip gloss for several reason, no smell no nasty taste and great color that last .as far as plump up lips well can't say that I notice that but I like the texture and color and looks great on."
1,"I have been trying to find a toner that isn't as harsh on the skin. Came upon this one and gave it a try. Must say its the best toner I have gotten. Smells wonderful not a harsh chemical nasty smell, smells floral but clean. Leaves my face beautiful rarely have to put lotion on after and thats rare for my dry skin. Skin is smoother and I feel like its more even. A must have!"
1,"Start with the face wash and end with this. Clean, smooth and soft skin you'll love. I won't go back to using anything else."
0,"Left a red tint in my light brown hair, didnt cover well and left the hair with a waxy damaged appearance.  I know it did not damage my hair, but it exaggerates split ends"
1,"I swear by this shampoo.  I've been using it for quite a few years and if I switch off to one of those fruity, flowery  brands with ""mule placenta"" or some other nonsense in it, boy do I know it.  I love this shampoo and it is very economical because a little goes a long way."
1,"This color is a great color, very complimenting! It is an all year long color for sure. If you want to paint your nails fir a nice event or just a color that isn't so loud then this is a great color."
1,"another great subscribe and save product. It's the only hand cream that I can rub on and it actually rubs in. Doesn't feel greasy and over time, do notice a softening of very dry, well used hands. I'm a dirt digger, so if it works for me, it'll work for anyone. I also have sensitive skin and can break out with the wrong stuff...not w/Cetaphil."
1,I like this product because it moisturizes my skin and protects it against UV rays. SPF 30 is critical in areas where sunlight is prolonged and intensive. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't contain Aloe vera which I love so much.
1,Used for a few days and just didnt feel clean using it. I have combo skin but our water is softened so anything should work BETTER than advertised. You need less of any cleanser in soft water. I will give to my Mom...she uses their lotions/creams.
0,Take to long. To much effort. Did not like at all. Did not like the steam and water. Regular curlers work better.
1,"Frankly, I used to have a Conair 1875 watts that was much better than this one.  It barely could blow and definitely not hot enough.  I gave it to my mom since it's small and very light and she doesn't have much hair, but it was unusable for me.  Still searching for a good hair blower..."
1,"Holy mac, I am super pleased with the range of colors available and especially the savings under the subscribe and save program.  This product is also great as it is 10 minutes maximum, no dangerous chemicals (no peroxide or ammonia) which means this is not a Level 3 graded coloring.  the colors are very good and my scape is not left itchy after use and easy to rinse off.I am buying this is because it is my preferred brand and now it has become a whole lot easier to buy: before, I had to scout for the weekly discounts in my local drug stores.  Now for the same savings, all i have to do is press a few buttons.  Love it."
0,The item I received was for a different curler with a black insert and black grips on the handle.  It pinched my eyelid.  Would not recommend.
1,"I've used the Gardener's Hand Therapy for many years, but always in that metal tube. This pump is so much more convenient! Lasts a long time and is the same, rich creme you expect from this line."
0,"These jumbo rollers are very easy and convenient to use, the box is small and light, so you can definitely take them with you on your trips. However, there is one thing you need to know before you purchase this product: it is completely useless on long and thick hair. I have tried heating them for over an hour and leaving them on my hair for over 2 hours. Still, when I take them off, there wouldn't be a slightest hint of a curl in my hair. My hair is naturally wavy, but after using these curlers, it would actually get straighter.I have tried using them on dry hair, slightly wet hair, right after washing my hair, two days after washing my hair, with or without product - all to no avail. I have tried using them on only half of my hair, as some readers have recommended but the result is still a slightly straighter hair and no trace of a curl.So if your hair is long and thick, this is definitely not a product for you."
1,"I LOVE Purity, its the best cleanser ever. It will literally melt off all your makeup without making the skin too dry.  I wear a lot of water proof eyeliners and this stuff works great on that. I use it as my everyday cleanser even with no makeup on.  Its just great and doesn't strip the skin. Its a true clean.  The price Amazon has for subsribe and save is AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING!!!! On a popular beauty site it was 32 bucks for this same size plus shipping. At the time of this review I paid about 27.50 here on Amazon with free shipping.  A WAY better deal for something I use all the time. Its great, you won't regret buying it."
1,"Certain celeb liked to brag about Head n Shoulders which is ok.....the real deal is T-Gel for any of you poor souls who are prone to dandruff, eczema, etc., I use it twice ....and I use it liberally....no quarter sized amounts....more like a silver dollar size or more and message into your scalp thoroughly, leave it and wash some other areas....then rinse off thoroughly, and rinse the T-Gel out, and do it again, maybe wash your back as you let it set, then rinse thoroughly again. Buying the largest size on Amazon let's you fill smaller bottles at home if you are self conscious others seeing it, or just leave the big bottle in your shower caddy. I've been using T-Gel for 30 years and I wear black shirts all the time. Every time I drift off to some sort of natural shampoo or expensive quality shampoo.....flakes come back and I go back to T-Gel!"
1,I had this at a previous home and couldn't take it with me due to the silicon adhesive which makes it very difficult to remove.  I left it with the home and had to purchase another because i liked it so much.  The adhesive is a definite advantage over double stick tape or other ways to affix things in the shower because it will never fall off despite the steam and condensation from normal shower climates.
1,"The container design is daggy as all get out, but the product inside is lovely!This product really smells wonderful and makes a great toner or just a refreshing spray to use to spray yourself with all over on a hot day or when you feel a bit ill. I love it!You can use it in cooking as well.It is a nice spray bottle too, it works well and never clogs. A glass bottle would be healthier to use but would add a lot to the cost I suppose.Watch out for products that say rose water but are really made with synthetic fragrances. This one is the real deal but some others are not! The synthetic versions are horrible, and taste awful if you ever spray it near your mouth accidentally too.Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E."
1,"A small amount goes a long way. I use this on my face and even on my 4 yr old son, and his scraps and scars heal quickly with no marks behind. I love this product."
1,"I am somewhat disappointed with these swabs.  So far I've pulled out several swabs that had hardly any cotton on the tip.  I didn't notice until I went to clear the water out of my ear and I ended up scratching the inside of my ear with the hard stick part.  Whenever I've purchased q-tips brand from the store I haven't had this problem, so maybe it's just the stock that Amazon is getting..."
1,"The only mascara that works , my eyelashes looks really big forget it about expensive mascara if u looking for quality this is the mascara you was looking for . I already order two more"
1,"I've used this for acne, keratosis pilaris, etc I love it! I wish it came in a big container! can't go wrong with this product"
1,This stuff works really great. It might be a little oily for some people's taste.  Don't forget that it's like $3 at walmart.
1,"Like many reviewers, I have elevens in between my eyebrows. I'm in my early thirties and definitely take care of my skin, but I've never found any magic cream that can deal with the deeper wrinkles between my eyes. I've also noticed that they are worse when I wake up in the morning from scrunching my face while I sleep.Frownies are definitely kind of strange, but the concept is very simple. Basically you take the small, triangle-shaped piece of cardboard, wet the side with adhesive, and firmly apply it to your skin before going to bed. It physically forces your muscles to stay put and not scrunch up with you're sleeping.I am shocked at how well it works. The very first morning I woke up, gently peeled off the triangle, and couldn't believe that my skin was totally smooth with no wrinkles. Obviously some of the wrinkles came back during the day, but every night my skin stays firm and I wake up without wrinkles. Over the course of the past month I've noticed the lines are slowly diminishing. Obviously, it only works if you use it consistently, but Frownies are pretty cheap and easy to use, so it really isn't that much of a hassle.Also, I've been using mine for about a month now and I've had no issues with it falling off while I'm asleep. Just make sure you're not wearing any heavy creams/lotions on the area where you're putting it."
1,"It's better than other shampoos I've tried for my problem scalp. Even though it doesn't stink of tar, it smells like old books. It does relieve my sore head better than regular shampoo. I bounce around my shampoo routine with different shampoos for psorais because it seams to work better, (for me).I do like dermarest, and Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo as well."
1,love the color and it stays on long.
1,"My skin is pretty resilient and not easily irritated, with that being said I started with one a day but quickly moved up to two. I use this between my CeraVe foaming cleanser and my CeraVe moisturizer and they've been working very well so far. They are pretty cheap and this order came with three boxes, but if you want the most bang for your buck you can cut these pads in half. I generally don't use the entire pad so half is perfect and now you have 540 uses for ~$11."
1,"The good thing about this product is that it contains a pretty good antioxidant.  The packaging, a pump as opposed to an open jar, makes it so the product isn't exposed to oxygen, so the antioxidents don't break down and oxidize.  The product isn't too greasy either, and I have cobination to oily skin.Now my gripe with the product is that because it contains SPF 15, this will lull many consumers into thinking they are covered for sun protection.  Unfortunately, it's not broad spectrum protection.  This product doesn't contain titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, avobenzone, or one of many other ingredients that protect against UVA rays.  UVA rays cause skin cancer.  Many moisturizer with SPF do not contain broad spectrum protection, so make sure to check the labels.Bottom line: This is a good, light moisturizer for sensitive skin.  Just be sure to use a full spectrum sunscreen along with the moisturizer."
1,"This shampoo is a good addition to any anti-dandruff regimen. The salicylic acid in it helps gently removes flakes with a fairly pleasant smell. It's not great for color-treated hair, but as long as it's used only occasionally, like once a week or every once in a while, and in conjunction with conditioner, then it isn't too drying. Over all, it's a beneficial shampoo that has stood the test of time."
1,Beautiful color with the right amount of shine.I am very happy with the purchase! Will buy more colors again.
1,"This product is the only one that doesn't make me look like Casper the friendly ghost. It is not greasy, not heavy feeling like makeup and not oily. I will do an update if I get any breakouts.Update- No breakouts so far. I forgot to mention one thing--the smell of the sunscreen is strong and not pleasant. It has a strong chemical smell but other than that everything else about this product is great! (hence the 4 stars)"
1,"doesn't run or fade or chip, so it gets 5 stars from me! :D altho its a pain to wash off."
1,I like the nail polish a lot--nice color. I especially like this vendor as they sold it cheaper than the Essie site and got it to me in absolutely record speed.  They are the best.
1,I love the smell of roses and this water has just the right amount of fragrance. I keep a spray bottle at home and at my office.
1,"I have fine, wavy hair, and this GPB conditioner perks my waves up and brings them to life each time I use it.  Since it really is heavy on the protein, I use only use it once a week.  I apply a thick amount, clip my hair up while I wash my body and shave, and then rinse it out.  The heat helps it permeate and my hair ends up much curlier than it was before washing it.You can also use this as a deep treatment if you leave it in longer and sit under a hooded dryer or use a blowdryer.It's also Curly-Girl-friendly for those who don't use silicone or sulfate products.The only downside is that the herbal scent is really strong, so you have to be sure to really rinse it out well if you don't like it lingering in your hair.  Sometimes the scent tends to linger, even though I thought I'd gotten it all out.Overall, this is a great conditioner, one that is a Holy Grail product for me."
1,"I have coarse, thick naturally curly hair (type 3b) that needs a deep conditioning at least once a month. The consistency of this cream is similar to vaseline and a bit greasy--which is perfect for my hair. If you have extremely fine or limp hair I would definitely recommend buying a lighter conditioner than this one. However, it works nicely for my needs.It's similar to using one ripe avocado and almond oil mixture (nothing else) on your hair as a deep conditioner (it leaves my hair incredibly soft). I actually prefer the homemade version, but keep the Burts Bees Avocado Butter on hand for when I'm out of fresh avocado."
1,"The gentleness of this product might be it's downfall. This is coming from someone who has very sensitive skin! Gentle is usually best for me. However, the product just doesn't do a very good job of toning my face or keeping the oil at bay. I expect toners to balance my combination skin, and this one doesn't quite make the cut. It does help a little though, and it's better than nothing. I will continue to use it until I get something better. Then, I will keep it as a backup. Probably won't repurchase though."
0,I was SO disappointed in this product.It is glitter mixed with moisturizer and foundation.I would be a full-time user of this tinted moisturizer if it did NOT have the glitter.Oily or Combo skin girls- AVOID THIS! Just make your own tinted moisturizer.It is cheaper and you control what is in it.
0,I really can't tell what exactly this thing is. It's not powder but a kind of oil-ish pasty fluid. And so far I tried twice but it doesnt really show any color on my face.
0,I have burned myself quite a few times because the little clamp gets stuck half way down ounce you release the tab. trying to maneuver the thing the rest of the way down without 1) burning myself 2) losing the piece of hair I was trying to curl is impossible!  This is a horrible product.
1,"As a child, I always wanted a &#34;Helen of Troy&#34; product but my mom would never allow me to have one.  I have used the Clairol 3/4 curling brush for over 25 years and have been pleased.  I would continue to buy other brands and styles thinking there would be something better - much money wasted.  Due to quite a bit of traveling, it finally started losing some teeth so I knew, it was again time to attempt to replace.  I was surprised to find it on Amazon but I came across this one and simply had to give it a try after being denied all these years.  Love the fact it's a solid inch and that there is an on/off switch and two settings.  The best part is that the cord does swivel and it swivels effortlessly.  Not a single complaint and have been using it on a few people who have now become sold on the idea of a curling brush (works spectacular on thin & baby fine hair)."
1,"I've tried nearly all of the major anti-aging creams out there. I've tried all the big drugstore brands (olay, Roc, etc), I've tried department store brands (clinique, origins, etc), and I keep coming back to this one every time. I love that it does not have a fragrance (the overpowering scent of perfume is what turned me off from Roc). I love that it's not greasy, but yet it gives me just the right amount of moisture before bed. Most of all, I love that this 30-something girl still gets carded regularly when I buy a bottle of wine at the grocery store. Really, what more can a girl ask for from a wrinkle cream?"
1,I tried this product and the cream made my face feel more dry than it already was.  I discontinued using it because my skin is already dry.  I was looking for a moisturizer.
1,"This is the best facial cleanser I have tried.  I have purchased about 6 or 7 times now and my skin looks great.  Why?  Not so much what this has in it but what the PH is.  It is very hard to find a facial cleanser that is at the right PH. Most are 7, 8 or higher - more alkaline.  Many companies formulate their cleansers that way to avoid eye irritation.  Unfortunately this is not good for your skin because it takes 20-30 minutes for your skin's PH to normalize after you wash it with a product with a too high PH.  That is alright if you wait that long before you put on an ""active"" like a BHA. AHA, Vitamin C product or Retin-A. However, with a cleanser like this one which has a PH of 5 you can apply your product immediately without worrying that it will be ineffective.  I have noticed a drastic difference in my skin with just simply switching to this cleanser but changing nothing else in my skin care routine; PH is very important in order for the products you apply to do what they are suppose to do!  This is especially true if you suffer from acne and find that your acne products are not working. Try to switching to a lower PH cleanser and see how much better your skin will look."
1,"I saw a dermatologist on Dr. Oz recommend glycolic acid for aging skin.  She actually said everyone should be using it because it encourages cell turnover and brightens skin, diminishing the signs of aging. On the show, one lady mentioned that she had used glycolic acid in the past but that it stung when she applied it, so she stopped using it.  The dermatologist replied that we've come a long way in skin care and that today's glycolic acid doesn't sting anymore. I'm here to tell you it does, especially around the lip area! I usually just blot with a cool wet facecloth and that stops the stinging. As far as effectiveness, it definitely works. Within a few days, peeling begins.  At this point I stop applying it and use a good moisturizer. When the peeling stops, usually in just a day or two, I resume using the product.  I alternate between glycolic acid and retinol, both of which cause peeling. I highly recommend this product. You can't get a better product for the price."
1,I hate anything with fragrances in it and this shampoo does not have a smell at all AND it works fantastic.  I would never use another kind!
1,"It can be hard to find a moisturizer without fragrance, and especially without sunblock (if I'm not going in the sun, I don't want sunblock) ! It's even harder to find these things in a product that actually makes a difference in your skin. This is good stuff!"
1,"Everything that we know that is in this product, does exactly as it's suppose to.  I've used it for years and it gently exfoliates the skin while making it soft.  Yes, it may sting a little going on, but that's very typical for those of us that have sensitive skin."
0,"This would only work if you have minimal hair thinning problems. (like no scalp shows to begin with). No better than ""Cowboy magic"" hair shiner (thin consistency reflects how its NOT going to work).If you have more severe thinning problems, use this:Samy Fat Hair Creme Thickening 3.5 ozAfter you shower & towel dry your hair, use some spray on detangler ie: No More Tangles (so as to not pull your fine wispy hair out combing it wet), then get a dime to quarter size of this, smear it in your palms, gently work it in your hair & leave it in (this is important!). Let your hair dry.May take a little longer to dry, but the feeling & look of fullness & thickness is worth it if you have thin hair."
1,"I can see a definite improvement after using the Deep Wrinkle Night Cream. In fact, my favorite RoC products are the night creams, and I've probably tried most night creams available. I get better results from using it than when I plopped down hundreds of dollars for department-store brands.I still use expensive brand-named foundations, but this cream has my face smoother and I have a brighter complexion. The dark circles under my eyes are better, much diminished, but not gone yet. I think I'll see continued improvement over time. I don't expect perfection until there is a total cure for allergies, of course.You really do have to protect your skin from sunlight, because it will be more sensitive when you use anything with Retinol. I like RoC products more than most. The tubes seem small, but you don't use much and it seem to last for me and I'm not very careful with it. Someone who is careful could make it last a L-O-N-G time."
1,This brush is great for synthetic hair pieces and also for real hair pieces.  I use this brush on my synthetic wigs and also my real hair extensions.  Does the job.  I would recommend using this over a regular brush for your wigs and hair extensions.
1,I just got this product and I still think it is too soon before I can accurately give an accurate review on what it has done for my skin.  But I can say I LOVE the Vanishing Cream.  This is the ONLY product I have ever put on my face that is completely scentless.  So many products have claimed to be scentless yet have a weird smell. This product is super hydrating (shocking) considering this product contains acne medication that is known to dry out the skin.
1,"I need a pure white for my french manicures and this is the best by far, its a white out! Marshmallow is sweet ! This Essie gal is happy again!"
0,"I bought this because I had heard so much about it. I LOVE all kinds of skin products and cosmetics, tried many and while I can say this is a decent one, I believe there are out there better ones for much less (such as Naive Aloe Facial Cleansing Foam by Kracie - 110g for less than $7). I will not buy it again"
1,"Non-greasy sun protection and face moisturizer in one, great product.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  No detectable fragrance."
1,"I really like this. It heats up quickly, stays hot, and that is all I need! It is easy to handle, also. What more can I say?"
1,"This is the best concealer I have ever used!! It covers great and is easy to apply. not heavy, has great smooth effect, I love it!!"
1,"Elizabeth Arden has been my deodorant of choice for many many years, after being turned on to it by my own mother.I love this stuff and it really works!!My only concern is the price. Over the years it has felt like the bottles run out much faster, that is sad, but I still buy this and the Green Tea flavor.It is by far the best deodorant I have ever tried and I am just going to continue to use it.I have never had any bad reaction from this product.If my review helped you, please click on ""Helpful"" (or ""yes"") below. Thank you! :)"
1,"While I have been wanting to try bar shampoo for a long time, I was skeptical about this product. Now I am really glad that I tried it. It leaves my hair soft and clean and I love using it. I have very thick, dry hair almost down to my waist that I wash daily. This bar lathers nicely with the help of coconut oil as opposed to sulfates. The smell was odd to me at first but it isn't bad. It's kind of what I would expect an ""old fashioned"" soap to smell like. I leave the bar on a ventilated rack when not in use. I would not recommend leaving this in a soap dish as it will get slimy and shrink faster. They sell holders for this soap, so I ordered the plastic case and will review it after it arrives.I do use a separate conditioner with this soap on most days (Organix Coconut Milk) as my hair does get tangled even though I wash it carefully. I use a cider vinegar rinse 2x a week and my hair has no tangles after using it.This is perfect for any one going ""low-poo."" I would also recommend this to people who want to be able to bring shampoo with them while traveling but do not want to deal with plastic bottles. It is also great for people trying to get away from sulfates, alcohol, and other damaging chemicals. Some people may go through a transition period when first using this and may experience some waxy, oily buildup on the scalp. Try to give this product at least a week to get used to. I personally only had the buildup for a day or two. I liked this soap so much that I ordered the herbal version and can't wait to try that one out.My only complaint about this shampoo is that it is not good for washing out hair grease (coconut oil/shea butter mix). If you use coconut oil to protect your hair, you may want to have a regular non sulfate shampoo on hand to wash it out."
1,I had surgery and tried pellet therapy with side affects. So after six moths I started this product and it's awesome. I will continue this because it WORKS and it is at the best price on Amazon.
1,It is a good product. Like the product. Goes on smoothly. Kind of sheer peach in color. It looks great with my fair skin. Wish it had better lasting power. I am happy with my purchase.
1,This stuff is very good for sensitive and oily skin. It mositurizes as it cleans and doesnt strip your face or cause a red chemical rash afterwards. My skin was so happy a week after washing with this and moisturizing with the neutrogena oil free moisture.
1,I use this daily and it is perfect for my skin.  It doesn't dry it out and my face feels fresh and clean afterwards.
1,"I started using Thayer unscented and loved it. I had rose water so I added it to it.  Well duh, I can just buy it with rose in it.  I don't find the fragrance to be too strong at all but then I don't have a real sensitive nose like some people do.  The fragrance is from rose water and fades shortly after it dries anyway.  Natural Witch Hazel, Aloe and Rose water all bring wonderful properties to your skin.What I noticed:Pour size:  I defiantly have seen my pours get much smaller! Especially on my nose.  Big wow for this one.Eczema:  I tend to get eczema on my face which really sucks. This takes it right away!! Thank you ,thank you.  For those of you that suffer with eczema my number one recommendation is to stop eating grain!!  That makes a HUGE difference. That is the only way I can get rid of it.  When I cheat my body can handle it once in a while but no on a regular base.  When I start eating grain it comes back.  And then Thank goodness for Witch Hazel it takes it away quickly.  I have used steroid creams which work, but this is actually faster and all natural!Wrinkles:  Yes, it does help. I feel my skin is tighter and I a youthful glow back to my skin.  It really is amazing. I'm 58 and look 40.  What I eat makes  a difference there too but Witch Hazel is fantastic.  (food, stay away from sugar!! Ages you fast.)  I never bothered with an astringent. What for.  I have no idea what started me on it but I will never stop.Cleans:  I know it moisturizes. I am not sure how but it does. I still feel squeaky clean,  I put the witch hazel on t though out the day. I leave it on the bathroom counter next to cotton balls and whenever I am there I put some more on. Love it.Acne:  I don't and never have had a problem with acne but  Every once in a while one will sneak up, usually back to when I am not eating right.  It does clear it up quickly when I use the witch hazel.  I would say in  two days. For those who say it brings on acne my only guess to that is it might be clearing out your skin big time and...what are you eating??  Can't blame it all on the witch hazel.Good stuff. I noticed there is lavender and many other choices.  A real keeper as far as I am concerned!!"
0,"I've been coloring my own hair for almost 10 years, and tried Colorzap after paying a ridiculous amount of shipping for it. First of all, the box was tattered and beaten up, and second of all, the product is horrible. Try Color Oops (which is what I usually used, but wondered if Colorzap would be better). I had a dark brown to blonde ombre, and was going to lighten my hair before going back to red. My blonde ends didn't lighten at all, the middle of my hair is still nearly black, and the top is a patchy, patchy bleach job. It's 10:16pm and I'm considering running to Walmart to grab a box of bleach to try and even out the color. I'm highly disappointed and, to be honest, pretty upset. The product was watery and horrible to spread, and gave me knots worse than a rats nest.Sticking with my Color Oops :("
1,My wife really likes conair. She had a smaller one (i believe a 1/3 or 3/4 inch curler) that has lasted years and years so we hope the same for this model.
1,"My husband and I both use this shampoo - he for light dandruff control, and me just because I like the way it cleans my fine hair.  It is paraben-free, and does not contain sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates.  The scent is not as refreshing as the scent of Jason Natural Cosmetics - Satin Shower Body Wash/Tea Tree Oil 30 fl oz Gel, which is a fabulous body wash, but it is not a bad scent.  You do need to watch that it doesn't get in your eyes, since tea tree oil can sting a bit."
1,"My husband & I do not like moisturizers with perfumes.  We both like this one very much because it absorbs into the skin and doesn't smell like a perfume counter.  We use it every day and before going to sleep.  This is a heavier version of the Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion; if you like a lighter lotion, you may want to try that one.  This lotion has shea butter which is super rich & moisturizing.  It will feel a little greasy when you first put it on but it absorbs quickly & becomes less greasy.It also works wonders on dry heels, elbows & chapped hands.  And it does this without perfumey stink!Lighter Version:Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion, 18 Ounce"
1,"After a couple of weeks of use, I have been able to notice a difference in my pore size.  I have some pretty big pores on my nose and cheeks, and with consistent use, I have seen a dramatic difference in the quality of my skin!"
1,"I used this for a little while. It worked very well for small fine wrinkles near my mouth. It also does a nice job with skin texture. It has a very light smell, which I appreciate because I'm sensitive to strong perfumes.What it does not do well is lighten spots. I originally got it to lighten some very light sun spots and freckles. After about a month, those had not changed at all. I also, like others, do not advise using it around your eyes. It will dry out that sensitive tissue.I switched to Ambi for a little while to lighten spots but do plan to go back to ROC because it is a good night cream."
1,"I really like this,either as a soft bronzer, along with a little bit of laguna.. or as a contour color. This was my first Nars blush and will def not be my last. I am glad i discovered this product. Trust me Nars products do not disapoint."
1,Comfortable handle and stiff bristles.  Feels nice if you don't press hard.  I've always had an itchy back so I decided to purchase this thinking it will help.  Have yet to use it enough to really say if it makes a difference but I feel like it can if I start dry brushing several times a week.  It definitely feels better than I thought it would.  Best to do before showering.  Would recommend this.
1,got this for my neice.  she absolutely raves about it.  says it works wonders with her natural kinky curly hair.  gets all the dead strands out and detangles the rest. i will probably get one for myself b/c i'm slightly jealous.
1,"I like this product very much, it does a good job of preventing heat damage to hair. I find I am able to run the hair dryer over a section of hair 3 or 4 times with the hair dryer so close it touches the hair, no smoke or bad smell emanates from the hair. It also is extremely light weight, I have never felt like my hair was too heavy or oily after using this product. The smell is pleasant too. The only cons are that I have to use 4 pumps to feel like it has totally covered my head, this has lead me to use 30% of the bottle from December 26th to February 26th, and I wash my hair 4 times a week. Perhaps I could be more conservative and still get the same effects, but it is hard to tell how much hair is covered because the product is so light weight. ."
1,"This color is so gorgeous and i get so many compliments on it. Looks good on any skin tone, but i prefer wearing this when i have a little tan because it makes the color pop."
0,"I read the reviews and I gotta say, all this magical tingly feeling some people feel... I didn't feel it. My pores seemed more noticeable and my face was even a little drier, making my fine lines look not so fine. I threw it out and told my mother not to try it."
0,This is a Terrible product. Made my hair turn purple. I will not use or purchase again sadly. Don't waste your money.
1,Okay product but it took forever to arrive and was overpriced.
0,This is not a true red.  It is closer to burgundy/ magenta. I have since purchased the OPI Over and Over a Gwen which is a perfect true red.
1,"This is a very good product for a reasonable price.  I have ordered this product several times and I will buy it again. This is a good seller, the product comes on time, wrapped well.  Do as instructed, its a good product used with Enhanced Lotion."
1,"Have used this for years. Recently the old one stopped working after several years of daily use, and I was unable to find the size 1 1/2&#34; anywhere. I had to use a smaller size that was not appropriate for my hair length. When this finally came back in stock I was thrilled and ordered right away! The model has been updated, but all good. Am considering buying a second one to have on hand."
1,"I will not say this is a miracle cream, I have always had younger looking skin and wrinkle remover is not something I need. But as a light moisturizer this product is great. My skin feels very soft and a little goes a very long way! In the winter I get very dry patches of skin on my chest and jaw line this cream has helped it immensely before I was having to go to the doctor who was giving me creams used to treat moderate psoriasis but this works just as well and  is much cheaper than the prescription."
1,I was really skeptical about purchasing this item coz i've always used very high priced department store brands. This one i'll have to say is almost similar to the Lamer serum. I've been using it for only 2 weeks now and there's noticable difference in the glow of my skin. I use it aloing with the regenerist daily moisturizer with spf. This product does a great job and i guess i'll never be looking back at the big brands.
1,"This soap is wonderful for dry skin; unlike commercial soaps which are largely devoid of glycerine today, Clearly Natural is pure glycerine with your choice of ""flavorings""--Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Jojoba oil, Aloe, etc.--do a search to find your favorite.My husband loves the Vitamin E version for his shaving mug--foams well, cleans great, no soapy residue.I find this soap cleans thoroughly without drying my skin; great for removing makeup.  A+."
1,"My first son's head never smelled good.  I wanted to embrace that whole ""his head smells so good!"" thing but he always smelled like a dirty pillow case to me.  And at 2-3 months he developed nasty cradle cap.  My girls' heads DID smell good...  and they never had cradle cap.  Now I am on my 4th child and his head does not smell good.  I am working on a theory that oily-smelling babies are more prone to cradle cap...  we will see,  At any rate I posted on a mommy board about this odd problem and one mom said she used this to make her oily-smelling kid smell good - so I gave it a try.  I have used it twice now and my son's head now smells like...  nothing.  Pure, clean, nothing.  Whether or not it will truly keep cradle cap at bay, I don't know yet.  But it's the only thing that makes my son's head smell good and that's something for now!  I love how it's foam and easy to rinse, but am told it is not tear free so you have to be careful with it.  My son is only 5 weeks so still at that stage where baths take just a few minutes in the kitchen sink so it's easy to keep out of his eyes - might be harder with a bigger child."
1,This shampoo does the best job at controlling the build-up of plaques from psoriasis and removing the greasy medications I have to use.
0,"I do not like the consistency of the product. It leaves a very greasy feel after using. Also, I used a toner following washing with this cleanser and there was a lot of face makeup that had not been removed with this cleanser. The smell is okay. Also, it says not to use near your eyes so now I have to have two cleansers anyway. I think I will just stay with Johnson & Johnson's Purpose which does both and is gentle also. I had just thought I'd try Burt's Bees as I like most of their products."
1,"#4 is not a coffee brown to my eyes, it is much mid range brown.Dark Brown(#4)made my natural black (middle east black hair color) a kind of golden brown,anyhow its lighter than coffee brown. I was expecting something like black brown, which was not. Unfortunately, It was not working as grey color hair concealer or cover.#3(soft black), on the other hand, has been acceptably matching my natural hair color. It has 100% gray hair coverage for my case and I probably stick to this number.#2B, black seems like leather black, not very natural in my context, but we could call it black anyway.I have also Loreal Feria black (#20), it is also a fake black for my hair, kind of leather black, like Crow's feather color!"
0,"Gorgeous fragrance for some 15 seconds, zero staying power. No one, including you, will know you are wearing it. Just like that 5 dollar stuff you get at the drugstore. Which leads me to believe the stuff is very cheaply made, despite the hype. Try ""Flowerbomb"" by Victor and Rolf- very similar but long lasting and totally worth the money, which this one is not. The same with all Philosophy fragrances and products. Hype, hype, hype. Are we so stupid to believe this is a quasi-religious experience ? Save your money for retirement. I will buy nothing from this hypocrit company. YyyyeeeeccccchhhhhhhhhhhEdit 7/29/13- I thought perhaps I would edit my review, in that it maybe was too harsh? Upon reflection, I increased the negative review intensity. This product is still a big rip-off.Try Al Rehab perfume oils, like Soft. Nice product, no hype, fair price."
1,"I use these mostly in the summer time when I go swimming. I do not wear tampons, and find these to be a much better alternative. They may take a little practice to insert, but it can be done. I recommend using a little bit of lube to make it easier. Sometimes they like to tilt the wrong way, but overall I like having these on hand. I don't know why they are so hard to find at the store."
1,"I would sincerely love to know how so many other people had such great results with this conditioner. It doesn't do much of anything for my fine, easily tangled/damaged hair. It doesn't smooth flyaways, it doesn't seem to moisturize my dry ends, and it doesn't detangle. If I get it near my roots it makes them look oily and grimy. However, the price for this very large bottle cannot be beaten in stores. So, if you like the product this is the place to get it."
0,"This is a terrible mascara. It smudges easily, it flakes, it doesn't even do much for volume. I'd say I can wear it for about 1-2 hours before it starts to melt. All I can say about it is it makes my lashes dark. That's all. This has got to be one of the worse mascaras out there. I would not recommend. Don't waste your money."
1,I have never used Castor Oil for my hair. Looking at a lot of Youtube videoes they said Castor Oil was a must for dry brittle hair. I put a very small amount in my hair every other day and my hair stays hydrated.
1,I have thick wavy hair and this product feels best on my hair - I have tried many!  It detangles and conditions.  Love it!
1,"I believe this has been the cause of my recent break outs. I noticed that my hyper pigmentation seemed to be improving but unfortunately, my obnoxious skin doesn't seem to like the face lotion and wash. I hadn't broken out on my forehead for a long time and then all of a sudden I have a bunch of pimples. Hopefully I can get rid of them with something else..."
1,"This products did help diminish lines and other skin flaws.  helped to make skin texture more consistent.  Wasn't the best wrinkly type cream I;ve used but for the price, pretty decent.  Haven't determined if I will repurchase again."
1,This product works but the feel is not as good as Head and Shoulder brand. I use this to avoid the headaches I get with artificial scents - for that it works great. For anti-dandruff it works great. Just use a scent free conditioner after this product and all will be well.
1,GREAT eye makeup remover for sensitive &#34;eyes&#34;.  Highly recommend. Also Neutrogena toner is great for sensitive skin.  Neutrogena has FANTASTIC products.
0,"I am turning 30 this year and decided it's time to pay attention to my skin since I'm starting to get some fine lines. After searching and comparing reviews for lotions on amazon I decided to give this Olay Regenerist with SPF 15 lotion a try. I wanted something that kept my skin soft, prevented lines, and protected me from the sun to an extent. I'm not sure if it is because it has the SPF protection but when I put this on it feels like I'm using sunscreen. It looks like sunscreen and feels oily like sunscreen. My face is not overly oily but this makes it feel greasy and so far has done nothing for my fine lines. I wanted something that I would enjoy putting on my face every day because it felt like it was making a difference in the quality of my skin but this just makes me feel like I'm putting some banana boat on my face. For the price I would expect better quality, at least better texture. I don't expect the miracles that advertisements claim but would like to at least LIKE the product. Thankfully I bought it on amazon with a coupon but it is outrageously priced in retail stores. I will not be buying this again. I do love Olay's Regenerist Night Cream, that stuff feels amazing! I wish they had something comparable to that for daytime wear. So maybe I'll try a different line from Olay or maybe one without SPF but I really want the sun protection. The search continues!"
1,I have been mixing this with emu oil cream and it works great! Not too sticky when mixed and absorbs in the skin easily.
1,"Creamy baby/Barbie pink.  Everybody loves it, it works with any outfit, a little fashion and flirty flare!  It is a must have for every girl."
0,"This color is great if you don't like using harsh hair dyes, I'll give it that, but when it comes to washing out, it DOESN'T. Even when you're only doing the ""root touch ups"" like they suggest IT WON'T WASH OUT EVER. I have dark brown hair and my hair has been stained black. Since it's not like the ammonia hair dyes, it doesn't come out with Loreal color fix and bleach...well bleach is horrible, but it's what I'm going to try next to get this out of my hair, because I refuse to pay someone at a salon $300 to fix it. I know I may end up with no hair if I do that, so please don't lecture me. I just want to warn others that this does not wash out as promised, you're better off using a regular hair dye with stinky chemicals."
0,"Did nothing to prolong manicure.  Many other base coats to choose from, this isn't a good one.  Too bad.  I really love CHINA GLAZE nail filled."
1,"I like the entire Mrs. Meyer line since it is environmentally responsible and  does a good job, but this soap is fantastic. I've been using it for a couple of years now. It is gentle to the skin, has this great subtle scent, and is one of the few soaps that can tame the smell of onions after I've been slicing and dicing.The scent is floral yet subtle. It reminds me of a sunny day in my garden.My husband is pretty much anti-scent and avoids anything perfumy or highly scented like the plague, but he thinks this falls under the parameter of gender friendly.I use this primarily in the kitchen and the powder room, but it is good anywhere in the house."
1,"This isn't anything like the Bath and Body Work's ""Sensual Amber"" fragrance, so don't expect it to be. This is a very potent natural Amber Butter and a little tiny bit goes a long way. Great for both Men and Woman. Im a Woman and I prefer bolder scents, so a little bit of this rubbed on the inside of my wrist was perfect. I also like to mix it with the Auric Blends Eygptian Goddess, or another one of my perfume oils, etc.If you love natural scents, you will probably enjoy this one.It comes in a small carved wooden container and inside is a small amount of the Amber Butter. Remember, you only need to apply a small amount. If it's too strong for you at first let it melt into your skin for a little while and then it'll be fine. You don't want this to be overly strong, just enough to mix with your natural chemistry. It's sensual, spicy, and unique. Try it!"
1,"I have tried so many conditioners before this one. My hair gets very dry and becomes quite brittle. Looking for a conditioner that would hydrate my hair and add softness. This conditioner has answered my dreams and more. Not only does it hydrate my hair and add shine, it also makes it incredibly soft. This conditioner isn't runny, which is great for insuring it will apply as a proper mask. It also has a nice peppermint smell and stimulates the scalp, so you know it's working. I will continue to use this conditioner forever. The price is amazing and so is this conditioner."
1,"I have problems with thinning hair.  I have been using this product for about a month.  I do believe that it has helped to make my very thin hair a bit thicker.  I don't expect miracles from a shampoo, but I'm happy with the results I've gotten from this product.  I like the fact that it's natural and leaves my hair feeling clean.  The scent is a bit medicinal, but by the time I use my other styling products I don't really notice it anymore. If you have a problem with thinning hair I'd give this product a try."
0,"The scrub did not live up to my expectations, no brightening of skin, didnt feel it cleansed well enough :("
1,"I have been using this for several  years--I have tried other products which have been good as well-but it seems I always return to Roc.  Used in conjunction with the Roc Resurfacing Disks, and the night cream--consistently-should yield you noticeable results.  I recommend all of their products."
1,"I always love  this stuff. It smells really good and works awesome! Once you put it on it's soothing, it dries, and then you scrub it off. I would only do it once a week to start to make sure your skin can handle it."
1,"I like many of the cleaning products form Mrs. Meyer's, but my family doesn't always agree on which scents are good. This dish soap is the one we all agree on.  It really is a SOAP and not a detergent.  Soaps clean a little bit differently in their action than detergents.  They also don't suds up as hugely as liquid dish detergents.  I have never had a problem rinsing this dish soap, and i wonder if other reviewers used way too much because they are used to detergent bubbles.The dish soap smells nice when I am washing dishes, and does a good job of getting the dishes clean.  I like filling up the sink of hot soapy water and a small squirt of this soap and using that water to clean my kitchen. The lingering smell is pleasant and not overpowering.I have put a squirt of this soap into my laundry as well.  I have an ionic laundry ball so I do not have to use much soap or detergent. This leaves my clothes smelling fresh and not too strong.  It also works well on hand washable clothing."
1,"OK, so admittedly, I am an amber maniac! Always have been. I have tried almost every amber perfume out there, oils and solids, but I prefer the earthy, more natural-smelling ones. I bought this amber butter on a whim, and all I can say is that I was absolutely blown away! It is this type of scent that originally got me hooked on amber!  The first amber oil I ever purchased smelled exactly like this butter, but I could never find the oil again, as the supplier went out of business. I have been searching for over 10 years! I have finally found a worthy replacement!  Thank you!OH, and the little wooden jar is sooooo cute! It has a screw-on lid, so I think it will be ok in my purse. Be aware that it is small, but a little goes a long way with this!!!"
1,I just love the intermediate scent that lies between perfume and cologne. This smells fresh and springy like taking a super clean shower. I just love how light and refreshing this smells and it's great for everyday use.
1,"this polish has a strong purple sheen that I had not expected from online swatches- still a gorgeous color. I'm glad to add this polish to my collection, but I'm still on the search for a pure navy blue!"
1,"I mixed this with aloe vera, water, sea salt, and mica and made a sea salt spray. I think this gel worked perfectly in this mix. I haven't used it alone so I didn't get it a 5 star but that's only because I haven't tried it neat yet."
1,"I receive many compliments on my skin/complexion. I used to get breakouts all the time, but since I dropped using the alcohol-based SeaBreeze and started using a tea tree oil based cleanser, my skin cleared up and pretty much stays that way 24/7! I can't recommend this product highly enough. It works great for adults, and probably for teens as well (although I didn't start using this until I was in my thirties). I normally buy it from my local grocery coop store, but I wanted to leave a review for Amazon shoppers, so they will know this is a great product to take a chance on, even if you can't find it locally. Go ahead and order some!"
1,"I agree with the other reviews that this brush works well for short hair.  I was looking for a brush which I could use to style my hair with a blow dryer, and this brush does the job on my hair which is short above my shoulders.  The brush handle is easy to grip and bristles are the right size."
1,"I like the idea that base can be separated from the brush for cleaning. Nylon is very good (first plastic, my grand-mom's kinda days) material. It can withstand any chemical abuse. The nylon bristles are sitting in rubber very tight,but they are still flexible. Made in England for over 5 decades!!! You can remove few rows of bristles & reset again later.The only thing that electrostatic still present, a bit."
0,"I really do not like this moisturizer. It's a bit too greasy for my taste, although it does make my skin very soft and smooth. The worst thing about it is the scent, which is really bad. I don't understand why Philosophy can't make this stuff smell better. I do not recommend it at all."
1,"I really like this product - it has no bad chemicals, and it does a great job of cleansing. It smells nice and is easy to use. Best of all, I notice that my pores really do look smaller - thank goodness SOMETHING works! It isn't magic, the pores are still there, but smaller."
1,"I've always loved Essie, and this time I wanted to try a nude color for the first time. I have a darker skin tone (more on the olive side) so I've always been hesitant to try something like this. The color goes on very thick (which is awesome because I hate taking the time to put on two coats), and it almost has a pink tone to it. I love love love it!"
1,Essie make a great brand of polish. The color is long lasting and it dries pretty fast. You cannot go wrong with this purchase.
1,"Clubman Bay Rum is one of the very few bargain priced after shaves that can still be found at some local drug stores. (It's available at Walgreen's here locally). Over the years I have tried a lot of different bay rum after shaves.  Its one of those old time scents that never seems to go out of style, and is widely available under many different brand names.  Clubman's bay rum is a blend apart from the rest.  Its dark color reflects its strength.  Both in its oil base and its alcohol content.  It is in my opinion the strongest bay rum after shave I have ever tried.  I would hesitate to recommend the Clubman if you're one that tends to avoid after shaves with a lot of sting to them, irregardless of whether you enjoy its scent or not.  However if its a strong, vibrant, stimulating after shave you happen to enjoy, I highly recommend the Clubman's.  Its the strongest most refreshing you will find if that is your preference.  And at 12 0z for what Amazon asks for it, it remains a solid bargain..."
1,"My dog had suffered itching for two years he is only 3, my vet insists that he is allergic.We tried all kinds of allergy solutions to no avail. My poor dog suffers terribly.Someone just mentioned yeast infection to me and I ran out and bought this product.I gave him a good long shampoo and he actually liked it.  He smells so good too. I was amazed at the outcome.Normally he would me scratching himself to distraction and I would be sitting here getting all upset for him. Instead he is laying next to my leg snoozing and very happy, he has scratched only about three times since the shampooing.I was not expecting a miracle but this is close enough for me.  I know I will have to shampoo him regularly but that is fine with me as long as he is happy.BTW, I bought this OTC from a local drugstore chain, for $11.49 for 4 oz."
1,"If you don't like lemon, don't order this product - if you're like me, on the other hand, and you do like lemon, order a lot!It smells wonderfully lemony and moisturizes very well.  You want to be careful not to overdo it since this is an oil, but once you have the right amount down oils make lotions look like a joke.  No lotion can beat the moisturizing properties of an oil for healing dry skin.This is the best bath and body oil I have tried, you'll be glad it comes in a pack of two!"
1,"Great product ...good price....Conair Facial Sauna Systems with Timer....Very nice for ""Me"" time works well and I would recommend to others. The brush is a bonus item!~"
1,This product deserves 5 stars!It curls my hair perfectly and you can set the temperature of heat that you want.It gives nice curls =]
1,"This scrub is simply wonderful. A thick, earthy feeling paste, like something ancient Aztecs could have made scented with ground almonds, pecans, rose petals, oats and orange oil. It smells like Christmas, cinnamon and orange spice that knocks deep down my nose and gently yet thoroughly uncovers soft, smooth skin. This little jar will last a long time but it's an addictive pleasure, so I recommend stocking up.I use this whenever my skin is acting up or it looses its glass like smoothness. No rough housing is needed; gentle is the word  when this is used often, it works wonders and is chemical free.  For those who are used to runnier scrubs in a tube this might be a strange experience at first but one that will get easier with time, it's worth it and it smells good enough to eat.Ingredients: glycerin, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) seed meal, avena sativa (oat) kernel flour, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel powder, rosa damascena (rose) flower oil, carya illinoensis (pecan) shell powder, citrus grandis (grapefruit) seed extract, myristica fragrans (nutmeg) fruit powder, eugenia caryophyllus (clove) flower powder, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, tocopherol, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) extract, fragrance.- Kasia S."

1,"I haven't taken Castor Oil internally nor have I used it on my hair.  I have fibromyalgia, which I am eating better nutrition to detox and I do have the pain on the run.  But there are days when I still have back, shoulder, and hip pain.  Rubbing Castor Oil over the area really helps.  I didn't believe it when I first heard about it.  I heard about it from a friend from the Island.  Her mother and family used it as a natural pain reliever like on a sprain.  It worked.  I didn't know it was available until I saw it for sale in an Indian Grocery Store.  Now I have found a better price and larger bottle here.If you have muscle, and or joint pain spread some on and then go on with your business.  Your pain will slowly go away or at least it did for me.  This isn't a cure all for you need to work using this and good food and a healthy outlook to beat this sometimes crippling pain."
1,"End all solution to polish correcting. simple, best design. cheap and easy to refill. Much better than buying a pen that has the nail polish remover inside of it and is non refillable. With this, I just pour a little bit of nail polish remover in a dixie cup, and dip this pen in it, and then rub it on the edges of my nails, and the polish comes off. I don't think I'll need a replacement tip that quickly either."
0,"These moisturize really well. When I get out of the bath, my skin feels silky and smooth. I have two issues with the product, though. One: the smell. I don't know what the scent is, but it's not a good one and it's not relaxing. It actually gave me a sinus headache and I had to throw the rest out. I wish there was a choice between scents because I would use the product if I actually enjoyed the smell. Two: the packaging. I'm not a fan of having bath products contained in boxes. It should be in a plastic container that won't be destroyed if it comes in contact with water."
1,"for its fresh, zesty, orangy smell.generally, i prefer soaps to shower creams and lotions, cause soaps make me feel squeeky clean. but they also dry my skin out like crazy, so i try not to use them often.but when i do, then it's one of my three favorites among lush soaps.the fact that they are all natural and not tested on animals is added value in my world :)"
1,I love it because is natural look not so out there with too much color.So i will recomended to others to use it.
1,At first it was fabulous. I don't know what happened. After a week or so it has a STRONG smell of alcohol. Not when you spray it in the air- but when you spray it on you. Normally you have a strong alcohol scent but this one is out of the world strong.But the scent reveals itself in about fifteen minutes and then it's lovely again and everyone loves you.
1,I ordered this with the face cream (reviewed separately) and found out both are less expensive at WalMart. I won't get the cleanser again as I don't think it is effective for the price.
1,Nothing has helped my weak thin nails grow like this stuff. I finally have semi-long nails and they're strong. if I stop using it they start to break again. Love this stuff.
1,"I like to use a toner after washing my face but don't want to pay the department store prices, and this is a product that works well for me and is priced reasonably. It refreshes your skin before moisturizing.  The fragrance is very faint but pleasant."
1,"Great mask, I can tell a difference in my skin after using it. Peel off masks make it so much easier and mess free so I'm thinking about sticking to them instead of any other masks. My only problem is that it doesn't help with pimples like the Mint Julep mask does under this brand."
0,"Parabens are used as a preservative so that products have less of a chance at growing bacteria. But I own other cosmetics that are the same price that DO NOT contain these harmful chemicals. ZuZu Luxe for example. Or, Lavera Natur Kosmetik neither of these have parabens. They don't have a ton of different colors to choose from but at least they will look natural for everyday use.I would expect lower end brands to contain parabens because they are cheaper to make. Here are some sources:[...][...][...][...]"
1,I dyed my little sisters hair and the color turned out amazing she went from being a dirty blonde to a vibrant strawberry ish blonde like the box. It looks fantastic. It goes amazing with green eyes and pale skin. I'm going to use this dye on her from now on. We both love the results!!!!!
1,"great price, great value, the price on Amazon is for 3 bottles, so it's a bargain. The Aussie product has no alcohol and it leaves my hair nice and soft.  great to used on dry hair in between shampoo days ."
0,"I read all the reviews diligently prior to ordering this product.  I received the Mavala Scientific nail hardner and followed the instructions yet the very first morning after applying the night before I had a split.  Because my nails are super short and the instructions are very clear to only apply to tip, I was super careful not to ""over do"" it, making sure I only get it on the tip that I do have.  So, not giving up, I filed down the split and re-applied this time using a tad bit more as I figured maybe I just was ""too"" careful and didnt get enough on (the instructions say to hold the brush their for about a few seconds/or minute to make sure it absorbs.  So I did this again.  Again, same thing, this time it was another nail I noticed a split.  I only have two fingers that have tips so the other nails I used Trind nail balsam and nail repair (with the intention when they get long enough I will use the Mavala on the tips as I truly belived or hoped the Mavala would be best for the hardner part since it makes sense to me to not use it on the pink part of nail or cuticle area).  My nails are in horrible shape but have been very good about soaking, wrapping and ""feeding"" the cuticles for the past two weeks.  These two nails had finally showed a tip so I was very excited to use this Mavala.  I figured I would only use it when the other nails caught up as my cuticles were always so bad and feel that I had been going about treating my nails the wrong way by over drying them with hardners for my entire nail.  Anyway, I used the Mavala hardner with the Mavala nail ""shield"" products (2 layers of fiber solution they sell to use with the hardner to keep the rest of your nail protected between applications).  What I noticed is 1) the nails treated with the Mavala hardner/shield products were significantly ""yellow"" compared to the the ones I used Trind.2)  The Mavala ""peeled"" off at cuticle area both times I tried it the next day.  As the instructions as well as proper care tells us to continue to use moisterizers for the cuticle area so doing that caused the Mavala shiled to peel.3)  Then nail tips had splits on the Mavala after 3 times applying it each time alittle more to ensure I was doing it right.4)  The Mavala nails looked bumpy, dull and tacky compared to the Trind.  I know this is not a review of the Trind but for now, the Trind is amazing.  Using the Trind nail balsam under the Nail repair (which their nail repair also has Formaldyhed) there were no bumps, my cuticles looked great and so far so good, no splits or shreds at all.  Also they looked ""whiter"" compared to the Mavala.  The Mavala has too many coats and if you read the instructions the shield is just a ""fake"" layer to protect the nail but it peels and really donesnt do anything more than get you by.  the Hardner, what a disappointment?Past reviews suggested your nails would be rock hard on the tips but mine are not that but more importantly I have since had to file those two nails down to where they are not ""no tips"" because the hardner didnt do what it was supposed too.  I tried 3x...so can't believe that it is this amazing product when I had splits two times in less than 3 days.I did exactly what the instructions said if anything, put alittle more (but this was only after the 3rd day still splitting).The Trind is really nice.  Easy too.  You are to remove it every night with non-acetone nail remover, coat your nail with the Nail balsam (which keeps your nail and cuticles from drying out under the fomaldyne) then you use their Nail repair (which is similar to Mavala's hardner only you put on the whole nail.  The amazing thing is it is NOT drying or peeling.  And the nail looks smooth and white (not yellow and tacky).the two nails that had tips are still alittle bit there even after I filed them down after the splits occurred when I tried the Mavala...and so far so good with the Trind nail repair.  I switched those two nails to the Nail Trind (like my others) and the tips are strong and no splits.I do not recommend this Nail hardner if you have really soft nails that are super short.  I watched a couple tutorials on youtube of people applying the Mavala..all the people have super long ""claws"" where the white is very present (it doenst really show anyone that truly has weak, frail SHORT tips).  To me, if your nails are already super long and have white tips its not the Mavala as much as you have good nails.I am a perfect example though of every time I get slightly white tip it splits and my nails are paper thin from artificial nails, bad circulation and abuse for all my life (51 years old).  Now, I am showing great results but not from the Mavala but the Trind.  I recommend the Trind."

1,"I love OPI polish and ""A Rose by Dawn"" is my favorite color.  I wear it year round for both my manicures and pedicures.  It goes with everything I wear and I get lots of compliments on it, especially on the pedis.I brush on two coats, goes on smoothly, and then I top it off withOPI Nail Polish, Top Coat, 0.5-Ounce.  It's a great combination and usually lasts close to two weeks (unless I'm swimming a lot or cleaning a lot, with my hands in water for extended periods without rubber gloves)."
1,This product arrived very fast.  Wasn't expending it until today (Friday) and it was in my mailbox on Wednesday of this week.  I've since used it once so far and that's enough according to the instructions using it once a week up to twice.  I'm looking forward to seeing the results in a few months of use.  Happy so far!
1,"My daughter suffers from terrible acne on her upper back. She'd been using this Neutrogena body scrub for it and, according to her, it worked okay... but not the 'bee's knees' so-to-speak. She was having to shower twice-a-day with it... in the morning before school, and when she got home from school.However, one day we were in CVS to buy another bottle of this Neutrogena Body Clear Scrub, but they were out of it. She HAD to have something, so we substituted CVS's own brand of this body-clear scrub. And, boy-oh-boy, did she find a new treasure! For whatever reason, the CVS-brand cleared her skin all-the-way in no time and she's been using it ever since-- some three years now... and only has to shower once-a-day now as well.If CVS is ever out of their own brand, we have to get something, so have substituted with the Neutrogena again... but it never works for her as well as the CVS-brand. I've learned my lesson, and now stock-up on the CVS-brand, especially when they have it on-sale.(As an aside, she also suffers from facial acne. We were ready to try the ProActive stuff, but a friend of mine suggested we first try the 'Beyond Belief' brand of acne products over at Sally's Beauty Supply. We did and, again, what a treasure! She uses all of the 'Beyond Belief ABH' products: Foaming Cleanser, Clay Mask, Toner, Spot Treatment, Oil-Free Moisturizer, Repair Treatment, Repair Serum, and Exfoliating Scrub. For the first time since she became a teenager, her skin is clear with only very rare break-outs... she's seventeen now and has been using this brand of products for two years)."
1,"I usually have sensitive skin; one of the few scented products I can still use is body wash (probably because you rinse it off right after you apply it).  I don't really have issues with body acne, and never have, but I did have some issues with the appearance of the skin on my upper arms.  I figured a body wash of this type would be less likely to aggravate the skin, and might actually lead to an improvement in my skin's appearance (for example, by killing bacteria on the skin's surface).  First I tried the regular (orange-colored and unscented) Neutrogena Body Clear wash and it didn't really do all that much for me.  The grapefruit wash was a different story.  In combination with some Amlactin body lotion, this stuff has made a huge difference in the appearance of the skin on my upper arms.I happen to like the fragrance, although I understand that's going to differ from person to person.  (If you want to know what your own reaction will be, go sniff some in a drugstore before buying!)  Because this does contain some plant extracts, colors, and fragrances, it may not be ideal for people who have reacted to other products with the same ingredients (listed below for reference):Active Ingredients: Salicylic Acid (2%) (Acne Treatment)Inactive Ingredients: Water, Sodium C14 16 Olefin Sulfonate, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Acrylates Crosspolymer, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Polyquaternium 7, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Roman Chamomile) Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Carrageenan (Chondrus Crispus), Agar, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C), Propylene Glycol, C12 15 Alkyl Lactate, Polysorbate 20, Alumina, Butylene Glycol, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Benzalkonium Chloride Solution, Sodium Benzotriazole Butylphenol Sulfonate, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides, Red 30 (CI 73360), Red 40 Lake (CI 16035), Violet 2, Mica, FragranceSome of the negative reviews have me puzzled.  While I don't dispute that someone might have an allergy to one of the ingredients or a sensitivity to salicylic acid, I'd like to set the record straight about a couple of things.First, this is a body wash and should be treated as such.  This means washing it off in the shower or bath after applying it (and not leaving it on and letting it dry).  It is not a spray or a cream.  It does not contain any ingredients that cause bleaching effects (I have a PhD in biochemistry and write patent applications for a living so I am familiar with the ingredients and what they do).  It is not difficult to get the last portion out of the container; simply store the container upside down when you are getting near the end.At any rate, I am quite happy with this body wash as it is having the intended effect in my case.  I will purchase more when my current bottle is used up."
1,I bought this Brush for myself and I love it. It is really soft. it covers very nicely I would buy it again.
1,"VERY SOFT, AND EASY ON THE SKIN, PLUS MUCH CHEAPER THAN OTHERS I HAVE SEEN; IT DOES A GREAT JOB WITH MINERAL VEIL;"
1,"This is such a pretty color--so nice for summer. But it's one of those colors that doesn't last very long. It goes on thin, first of all, so you need 2 coats at a minimum, 3 for it to look really nice. And it chips faster than 98% of the other Essie colors I own."
1,Good quality tea tree oil. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural but effective way to reduce acne
1,"It's a good file and if you've ever tried the opi crystal file, then this is very similar. I ordered this one instead of re-ordering the opi file only because of the carrying case. What I was NOT pleased with is that they glued the case together and after lots of picking I can't remove all of the residue. So, the glue will be collecting dirt and all that good stuff in my purse. I could try using acetone to remove the glue but i'm pretty sure it will take the paint of the case with it."
1,"I didn't have any purple nail polishes in my collection so I decided to buy this one. I think this is very popular because I was unable to find it in stores. I checked pretty much every drugstore in my area and I never found this anywhere. So I ordered it online. This is not very opaque, its translucent. You would need at least 2-3 coats, depending on the length of your nails to make this an opaque shade. Its got some micro glitters in it, that you wouldn't see under normal light but under sunlight, it gives a very nice sheen to this polish. I am a huge fan of dark colors, so this one was a great addition to my collection. The drying time is average, about 30 mins with a fast drying top coat + freeze dry drops. So I usually apply this in the evening and its usually completely dry by bedtime. Would recommend this to anyone who's looking for a purple shade."
0,"Very oily and creamy. Not at all what I expected... ordered this to try to highlight and contour and it just looked awful!!! Plus, took FOREVER to arrive."
1,"works well, has that smell but doesn't last long, too bad amazon don't carry it any more, would have been nice subscribing every 3 months on it. the consistency is thick, creamy like but i prefer it that way instead of watery-like. easy to blend."
1,"I received this product just a little over a week ago and have used it at least once a day since. I have acne prone skin with scaring and dark spots, my skin is an olive complexion so I tend to scar easily and get spots. Since using this cream I have been able to wake and feel pretty good about walking around without using something to cover my blemishes. I have not had massive breakouts like I normally would and I feel like my skin has a touch of a glow to it now. I do not constantly run to a mirror to make sure my cover up is staying put. Will continue using this and most likely will repurchase when it gets low. Would order more now but it seems to be lasting well and I want to be sure it keeps doing good for my skin and isn't just a fluke! Will update if it stops working for me.Update: Still works great! I do still get a few pimples here and there and still have black heads some but nothing like before. I feel like this cream really helps my skin to not only appear healthy but also to actually be healthier."
1,For thinning hair this conditioning rinse is used in conjunction with DHS Clear Shampoo.  Have used for several years and is really helping this old lady's head of hair.
1,"I've been using a different brand, a liquid applied with a little wand, that, for me, is alot easier to use; the liquid spreads and covers more easily than the crayon - but that's just me"
1,Awesome product.  I have to use it every other day because my skin is sensative.  It still leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.
1,"I have been using the Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Tone Correcting Tinted Moisture, Sheer Tint, SPF 30, which is currently out of stock on AMAZON.  I decided to try the Healthy Defense product instead.I am 57 years old and although I like this product I do prefer the Ageless Intensives because I feel like it hydrates my skin better than the Healthy Defense.  This product goes on a little thicker and doesn't feel as light on my skin.I have found that if I am working outside for several hours, I still need a sunscreen product under this one.  It does not seem to be as effective in blocking the sun as I would expect for an SPF 30.All in all, this is an acceptable sub until the Ageless product becomes available.  If you have younger skin or do not spend hours outside this may be the perfect product for you."
1,"I brought this camping and both guys and gals used this.  It smells fresh, like you've taken a shower with regular shampoo, feels refreshing when going on.  The directions say to soak your hair, massage it in and then towel dry. I have a lot of hair but still have a decent amount left (it was used by 5 adults).  It does make your hair look smooth and it does make if feel like there's product in your hair (like gel) but it's much, much better than going without a shower."
1,"I purchased this product after in was recommend as a disinfectant in the book Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me. I had been becoming extremely frustrated with my oily skin and frequent breakouts, so I was ready to try something new. For the past 1 1/2 months, I have been religiously using this product in the morning and Clear Pore Nighttime Clarifying Gel (a BHA product) prior to bed. While I haven't seen miraculous results, I have had a reduction in breakouts, and my skin texture seems to be slowly improving. In addition, I am no longer getting the dry, flaky patches which I was getting with other products. However, my skin is still oily, and I do still experience the occasional breakout. While this product certainly might provide you with some benefits over time, keep in mind that you will not see immediate results:  despite the claims, there is NO product available which can get rid of existing blemishes."
1,"I just tried this color for the first time today and I really like it. I've been dying my hair auburn for years, but I have so much gray now that auburn is not sustainable, so I've slowly been phasing the auburn out. I've been looking for just the right blonde shade and thought maybe a honey blonde, however many of the colors looks too yellow/goldish. This color is perfect and looks just like on the box - kind of a light rosy blonde. The product was easy to apply and not messy/drippy and the smell wasn't overpowering. I will continue to use this one."
1,"This stuff has changed my skin it is so smooth feeling and doesn't feel like there is a bunch of crap is in it, leaves my skin feeling soft. Just don't get it in your eyes burns like crazy. I still have like a little over a 1/4 of the bottle left so its lasted quite awhile other than that I will be buying more one I've had this I can't go back to the others."
1,"I bought this in combination with the Steam Facial By Kaz (costs $27.75, see my review). I do suspect the mist feature of this Pore Cleanser is not effective, but using it with the great Steam Facial by Kaz, I have had great results! First I steam with the facial steamer for about 20 minutes, then I use the Pore Cleanser.The little vacuum does a terrific job sucking icky, waxy  junk out of my pores. The evidence of what was removed is there to see after use, when cleaning up the device. I never had any results using Biore strips, nothing came out of my pores with those. I suspect that the key is to open pores and soften things up with the facial steamer. I would not expect as good results using either the Steamer or the Pore Cleaner alone. The Pore Cleaner is water resistant and may be used directly over steam without damage.In total, I spent about $70. and I am very happy with the results. My skin is clearer, the texture is much softer and finer, blackheads are disappearing, pores are growing smaller, and breakouts are far less."
1,"I am a redhead, so although I have nice long eyelashes naturally, I always have to curl them and cake them with mascara and they look like crap.  Once I discovered these I was so impressed.  They're surprisingly easy to apply!!!  The first time was a little tough, but now it's like nothing.  I'm done in like 5 minutes, IF that... and they look beautiful!  They certainly don't last 6 weeks like they claim, and they do sometimes fall off at inopportune moments (haha) but overall I would highly recommend them!!!"
1,"I love my brushes, but only the best will do.  This one does exactly what i want it to do and in style.  It's made very well and holds up to my &#34;abuse&#34; :)"
0,"I am throwing this away. I don't like the brush, it is spaced too far apart, the mascara is clumpy, and it doesn't wash off leaving ugly dark circles under your eyes. Ick. I'm surprised to see such good reviews."
0,"I absolutely love this conair instant heat curling iron!  I ordered it on amazon because of the great price. It did not come in the packaging I'm used to seeing in stores but figured it may have just changed since my last curling iron purchase (last year).  The first time I used it it worked great.  The second it kept turning off or shorting out on me.  I changed outlets and still the problem continued.I would recommend this curling iron to a friend but perhaps not through the internet.I re-ordered thinking it was just a defective one and the second time, it wouldn't even heat up enough to hold a curl.  I think Conair has changed it's product and I will not buy again."
1,"Easy to apply, not greasy, gives skin some needed moisture.  Have been using Olay Regenerist products for a couple of years and I find them to be as effective as the Orlane and Lancome products I'd used for years and at a great price.  Highly recommended!"
1,"i always like suave shampoos, they all do the job well and get my dirty ol locks nice and clean."
1,"This is a great, affordable deep conditioning hair treatment.Its super gentle, effective, and feels luscious when applying to your hair.Has a very light scent that is no where near overpowering."
0,I can not believe all the good reviews! UN-pleasantly surprised! I trusted these reviews and got the brush but it is AWFUL! The static it causes my hair is unmanageable and the bristles are SHARP and actually hurt my head. I am sending it back asap! You are better off spending a little more and getting something better quality that is NOT made in CHINA!
0,"I read the other reviews stating that this perfume was too faint, and that you couldn't smell the fragrance.  I should have paid attention to it.  But, having said that, I am also one who likes a strong fragrance.  This one is extremely mild but pleasant.  It's a pleasant fragrance, I just should have saved my money.  I just assumed maybe it was just the difference in chemistry and maybe it would work for me....it didn't."
1,good but not really sure if it work. great for the price those. trying to experiment with different products for healthier hair.
1,"I'm 75 years old, and I've been applying this gel every night for the past five or six years.  There's no way of knowing if the wrinkles would be worse without it, but I think it's helping, and it feels so wonderful when I apply it before getting into bed at night.The jar doesn't hold too much, but you use very little with each application.  And the 2-Pack is more economical than buying one at a time at a retail store.A good product at a fair price."
1,"I have a lot of thick, long, hair which does not like to stay curled. This has been the first inexpensive curling iron to work on my hair.  It gives me neat sprial curls from top to bottom. I've read some of the other comments regarding a dent that the iron can leave...I've never gotten the dent...maybe its the way they position the iron.I also recommend using Salon Grafix's freezing hairspray if you have difficulty getting your hair to hold a curl.  This has been the only hairspray that holds my hair.The iron heats up quick, it also has the turbo heat option which allows it to heat up in a minute.I would recommend this iron for anyone!"
0,"I  have what is called kp on my upper arms after the birth of my third child. I read the reviews and was so excited this could be the answer to my prayers!!!!! Wrong answer, it did not go away and worst of of looks like it got worst... I would not advise anyone who wants to buy this for kp, it didn't work for me........"
1,I have the waterproof and love that for active days but the dark does a lot in blending the eyeliner and hairline. I Sleep with it and in the morning they are still on.
1,"I like this product for a different reason than most. I am able to use this and blend it in with a sponge, prior to applying my mineral make-up foundation. It moisturizes my skin, without affecting the way that my foundation goes on, or looks after being applied.That is the only time that I use this, as I use Oil of Olay's heavier moisturizers or Albolene at night."
1,"Walmart stopped selling this online. Amazon's price is better without tax and handling charges. I've used this for years, and it's helped with cell turnover immensely. It takes time, but stick with it at least once a day, and you will see results."
1,"You can't always believe the reviews you read, but when it comes to this one you must try. I am sorry that I waited so long to try. It is a little pricey but so worth it. I have very think and curly hair. When I put this in my hair wow!!!!!!! I use to get the tangles out, as well as condition. It works so well, I also use on my daughter's hair. I would recommend this to anyone. I hope they never change the formula it's the best."
1,I love this product!!! I have mature skin and this really adds a lot of moisture which helps a lot. It goes on very smoothly.
1,"UL61 is the first at-home coloring product that hasn't left me super duper red tones. I followed the directions exactly... so put it on everything but the roots for 20 minutes, and then the roots for 10.  I debated doing this as I have short hair--but decided I should follow the directions regardless and it turned out perfectly.  I'm super happy.  I just wish they'd make this formula in foam.  Hopefully one of these days.Amazon subscribe-and-save is the best way to buy it.  Cheaper than the store, plus guaranteed that it will arrive when you need it."
1,"We have very hard water.  It is difficult to find a body wash that does not further dry out the skin than what is already happening in the hard water, but the Aveeno Active Naturals Stress Relief Body Wash helps to keep my skin moisturized, soft, and with the lavender, chamomile and ylang ylang, the scent is very pleasant.  I use it in the morning as a preventative to the daily stress in my life!!! (Here's hoping anyway.)"
1,"I bought several bars of different kinds from this company. I love the patchouli and am ordering several more bars today. People stop me in stores and tell me I smell good! I also have the patchouli foaming hand soap, and everyone who comes to my house wants to wash their hands in it. I use the soap for shampoo, since I have very soft water, and it works great! I highly recommend this product!"
1,"I've been using this product for years, and people tell me I look fabulous for my age.  This lotion is cheap and effective and absorbs into the skin immediately.  I've tried other expensive creams and they don't work as well as this one."
1,Steam is not hot enough. Price is reasonable. I've been using it for over 2 years and still working. Will get a better one with hotter steam next time.
1,This really helps itchy scalp.
0,"I have been using the product for 4 months and have been applying it to my face every night before bed.PROS: Has a nice clean smell, moisturizes very well, makes my skin feel smooth, gets rid of dry spots. Also, a little goes a long way. I still have 1/3 of the product left after 4 months.CONS: Did not tighten/firm my skin whatsover. Did not prevent or smooth out any wrinkles as I noticed new wrinkles over time, and the smile wrinkles I have got worse and are more noticeable now. Lastly, this product made my skin look and feel VERY OILY. I don't like wearing the product around other people as the shininess is embarrassing.This cream is basically good as a moisturizer if you have dry skin, but isn't really good for anything else. I can't say I'd recommend it, but looking at how other people have rated this, there is still a good chance that it could work well for you."
0,I returned this. Its a greasy thick white paste totally unusable unless you are a life guard or dont mind this look.
1,"Let me start out by saying that I absolutely LOVE Avalon Organics products!  That's why rating this 3 stars really pains me.  I purchased this because I'm 33 and started seeing some under eye bags.  The reviews were great and because I already love the manufacturer, I just knew that this would do the trick.  Unfortunately, because it's in milk form, it doesn't really cleanse the face too well.  It's okay if I don't have any makeup on, but when I do have makeup on, I need to utilize another cleanser before or after application.  Otherwise, I would still have residual makeup.With regards to the reduction of wrinkles...didn't work in that area either.  Unfortunately, I will not be repurchasing and cannot recommend for others to purchase.  It was just okay and didn't do what it promised to on the bottle for me.  I'm a firm believer that some things work for some and others for others, so this may work for someone else.  I definitely recommend the Avalon Organics Vitamin C line.  I've used almost every product from it and I love it!"
1,"I have to admit that this has been used as a spare dryer for the past year, but it is still used twice a month at least. It saw heavy use with waist length hair the three years prior. Even though it now costs almost half of what I paid for it, I still think it is a decent value. My Rusk 1900 watt ceramic dryer blows this dryer away, but it isn't fair to compare an $80 dryer to something that now costs $15. The amount of heat is pretty good and it gets my hair dry in an acceptable amount of time. The cold air button is really more of a ""less hot air"" than actual cold air, but I really don't have a use for cold air, anyway. After all these years, the cord is starting to bend oddly right at the plug, so I don't think it has a lot of life in it left unless I find a way to replace the cord. But I still think I got my money's worth."
0,"The only negative thing I have to say is that the color is different to what is pictured on the product listing. The color is actually more pink than purple (although you can definitely see the purple in the color). In the picture, the color looks like a deep purple, whereas in person the color is more of a deep pink, as one reviewer already mentioned. It's almost like a dark Barbie pink. I almost took a star off for this, but that is more of an issue with the product listing than the actual product. The actual color is a beautiful color, but I wanted the deep purple color in the picture.EDIT: Since posting this review, I have become unhappy with the quality of this polish. This polish is below average in that arena. It dries very, very quickly (10-15 mins) and leaves a nice, smooth finish, but it chips very easily, which I did not expect from a well-known brand like OPI. This polish starts chipping badly the day after application if no top or base coat is used. I have never experienced this with any of the other polishes I have used, even with cheaper polishes that you can purchase from stores like CVS. Even though I typically apply a top and base coat, which would make the polish last longer, I don't like that a bottle of polish for which I paid nearly $6 chips so badly the day after application that it looks like I've been wearing it for two weeks. I will not be purchasing this brand again simply because I can buy polish for cheaper than $6 of equal or better quality - at least as it relates to the chipping issue. I would advise using a very good top coat if you do decide to purchase this polish."
1,This is agreat night cream; it really makes a difference in terms of smoothness and wrinkle reduction and the price is great too compared to all the expensive creams I have tried.
1,"I unfortunately forgot that I was allergic to neutrogena products and had ordered and used and broke out in a rash, but if not for that I would have loved this product. The smell is nice and it is a nice thick consistency that leaves you feeling nice and clean/refreshed."
1,This supplement is awesome!!!  It completely removes all types of body odor including feminine odor issues.  It is very effective for me.  I didn't have any abnormal body odor issues but I want to be as odor-free as possible.  I recommend this to all my friends for the ultimate body deodorant.  It is amazing how it makes your poo green!
1,"Essie polish! I like this one especially due to the shimmer it has in it, very pretty! Lots of compliments! You can never go wrong with an Essie product! If your new to Essie, they are just about the fastest drying polish you can find with beautiful, no fail results!"
1,"Very good product for generally keeping aging skin looking smooth.  I've found better, but I occasionally buy this when it's a great deal.  The entire Roc line is very good.  Great?  Not compared to a line like Strivectin, for example.  But that's just my experience.  Worth a try without breaking the bank."
1,I bought this oil to use as part of an oil mix to combat dry itchy scalp. The mix works great. I cannot be sure if it contributes to the success but I will continue using it.
1,"On my doctor's advice I started using Cetaphil products. I absolutely love the moisturizing cream as it seems to really sink into the skin and moisturize it. I always apply this cream before going to sleep at night followed up by an application the following day. During particularly dry seasons, I may apply this cream several times a day.This stuff really works. I suffer from very dry skin and Atopic Dermatitis. Applying the Cetaphil cream seems to help alleviate these skin conditions. What is really nice is the skin cream is unscented. Sensitive skin, like mine, can be irritated by perfumed lotions.Highly reommend."
0,"I am just SO DISAPPOINTED! After all of the rave reviews on this product I really thought it was going to be great to use. However, it was awful, it made me break out badly and did not remove eye make up. I am overall really disappointed with all of the Philosophy products that I have tried lately. They are on the pricey side, so I definitely expected much better quality. I had no idea that regular Ponds Cold Cream would beat out such a product as Philosophy. I should have erred on the side of ""if it isn't broken, don't fix it"" and not changed my line of facial products. Lesson learned. Sad that I cannot return these products."
1,Purchased it a few months back but still more than halfway left. That's after using it 2-3 times per day. Excellent product. Leaves my skin so fresh and clean... No squeaky clean so no problem of excess skin tightening. My skin has felt so soft and naturally fresh. Very mild smell so no problems there as well
1,I've got very oily skin.  I use this several times a week.  I love the fact that's it's cheap.  I use this and then use a cleanser.
0,I read on several blogs that this was great for cystic acne. I found that it didn't really work. It is also a really weird color to have on your face.
1,I use it with the circular brush and it makes my skin feel so clean. I use it with the toner and really notice a difference in the way my skin feels using this product vs. other products.
1,"I have slightly sensitive skin and Neutrogena T-Gel is awesome. I no longer get frustrating itching some while later on during the day.It is worth noting that you do need to make sure you thoroughly wash the shampoo out, and this can be tricky especially if the shower is weak, or you live in a hard water area. Make sure you spend a little longer rinsing!"
1,"I use this to remove concealer and waterproof mascara. It works VERY WELL, and only takes a swipe or two with the cotton ball to remove everything. It is a little obnoxious to use on the eyes because it leaves an oily/greasy base behind (I don't want to say it's a residue - it's not as gross as that. You can feel it, but you won't feel dirty). I usually use it right before I get in the shower, so the water washes it right off.I use it every day and it's already lasted me two months. My only complaint is that I can't take it on airplanes with me, but that's my own problem!"
1,"Love the smell, price and results from this product. Last a long while and it is less expensive than most products of its kind."
1,I purchased this thinking it might help fade some slight acne scarring. Nothing. Didn't even lighten at all. Had such high hopes and while it moisturized well it didn't fade anything at all. Even tried on some light age spots on hands - nothing.
1,"Gorgeous, deep color that looks great on all skin tones. Nice consistency and great shine.  Another example of color and quality from essie brand. Great price from company, too."
1,"First off, delivery was as predicted.  This brush not only met my needs but excelled way beyond. I was using a vent brush which was totally feeling like it was pulling my hair out. Lot's of hair loss and then using a comb I had made to be used on wet hair was still collecting a lot of loose hair. I gave this a try not only because it is an Ionic Thermal Brush but because others had said it doesn't pull your hair out and IT DOESN'T. I used it on wet hair and was so impressed at how well it worked. Used it to blow dry my hair and used a Tourmaline Ionic Hair Dryer with this brush and it did make my hair shinier and less frizzy. Not perfect but I could have either at this point tamed the rest of my hair with some argon oil which would have worked fine or I chose to use my brush style iron for styling. I don't wash my hair everyday. So I brush my hair a couple times during the days between washing and it just gets better and better. More shine, hardly any hair comes out (some hair sheds daily of course), and overall this was a very good investment. It is also lightweight and very easy to use.  Love this product."
1,This is super effective in moisturizing dry spots. It might be a tiny bit too much for daily use on my combination/oily skin though. But I was in a desert for a vacation and came back with peeling skin on the sides of my nose and used expensive creams to no avail. 2 days with this and it was gone like magic. Recommended highly for dry skin. I just use the excess now on my body and it smells like baby powder. (Depending on how you like that smell)
1,"Roc treatment products are great, and the Daily Moisturizer for deep wrinkles is wonderful.  I use it faithfully--and I have no deep wrinkles.  It works well with the Nightly Moisturizer for Deep Wrinkles, helping to keep those furrows at bay.  Love the stuff and highly recommend it!"
1,I love this blush and wasn't able to find it at sephora anymore. I was so glad that I was able to get it at amazon. Not sure what I will do when this product is no longer available.
1,"I never taken care of my face as I should so I ordered a jar of this to start the process. Turning 30 is boring and hard. so far this has been a really, really great choice!! I have very sensitive skin and I get little to no breakouts and this lotion has been a perfect balance to keep that consistent. I've tried other lotions that claimed to be amazing (I'm looking at you Lush) and have either broken out of the ingredients have dried my skin out drastically.I will buy this again and continue to use it."
1,My son used some of this hand cream when I had it and is now a daily user and fan. I bought him some as a surprise. He has very dry and chapped hands. This cream or lotion seems to work and does not leave that greasy feel or smell to sweet. Good stuff!
0,"Thick cream which is helpful for my dry skin but the fragance is too strong in cheap way. Jason needs to make this product without any perfume scent. I use this to supplement my primary moisturizer. It's only been about 2 weeks, but I haven't noticed any effect to my skin. Overall, I prefer their Vitamin E cream."
0,"A total waste of money (though it's pretty cheap). I don't know what the rave with this eye gel is all about. The gel is quite thick and hard to spread. It's shiny and does not get absorbed quickly. Two or three days after I used this eye gel once at night, both my eyes look more puffy and tired-looking. An, for an unknown reason, my eyes are rheum-filled each morning when I woke up after using this. Disgusting."
0,"I do not like the consistency. It is like the consistency of yogurt, only with lots of oils.  I did not like it."
1,"I purchased this OPI nail lacquer Touring America Collection ' Uh-Oh Roll Down The Window' for my daughters' B'day, she just loves the drab olive color, she bought herself a nice muted purple called 'Honk If You Love OPI'. I always love OPI nail lacquers, they last 5 to 14 longer, depends on if you are rough with your nails.Can't wait for the newer spring collection for 2012"
1,"I have an oily forehead with dry nose and cheeks. I get blackheads and sometimes acne, especially if I don't follow my skin reggie.I've been using this with some other Neutrogena products for about 8 months now.The texture is white and creamy. It tingles on the skin if you let it sit for a few minutes. I let it sit on my face while brushing my teeth or during the shower, then rinse with cool water. I use every morning.My skin reggie:Neutrogena Cream Cleanser every morningNeutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser OR Neutrogena Blackhead Cleaners as a wash every morning, as a mask once a week.Formula 10.0.5 mud mask once a week.Apricot Scrub once a week.Change pillowcases every few daysUse a separate towel for face only, change every few daysWash face morning and nightFollow with moisturizer always and sunscreen for the day on top of moisturizerTry not to touch my face, don't pick blemishes"
1,"I can't stand the texture of this product. It doesn't feel like cream... it almost feels gritty (even though everything rubs in). The scent is mild and seems alright at first, but it kind of ""grows off"" you. Once I have it on a few minutes, I start to find it irritating. It's okay for a hand cream, I wouldn't recommend it as a face cream at all. It indeed softens your skin well, but for the price, there are better products."
1,GREAT ESPECIALLY IF WHEN YOU HAVE OILY - LONG - COLOR TREATED HAIR. JUST WHAT I NEEDED FOR MY OILY - TANGLED HAIR.
1,"Max factor pan stick is hands down the best foundation I've ever used. If you want total coverage, this is  the one for you."
1,"I purchased this cleanser when I was struggling with moderate acne. I'm a redhead with fair, sensitive skin. My pimples were located on my forehead, chin, and sometimes nose. I know that tea tree oil (a natural antiseptic and antibacterial agent) can be effective at fighting acne, but this cleanser did not clear mine. Also, it was much too drying, even though I diluted it (half water, half cleanser) and used a moisturizer afterwards. I stopped using it on my face after a few weeks and have since found another skin care line that works great for me. Luckily, the Desert Essence cleanser works well for other purposes. It's super effective at cleaning my makeup brushes. I also use it to wash minor cuts, scrapes, and blisters; it stings a little but helps things heal so quickly! One time I even used it for a few days when I ran out of hand soap. I'm happy that even though this didn't work for my face, I can use up the rest of the bottle on other things. And this is a bit weird because others have commented that they dislike the smell, but I love the smell! It's so natural. Give this cleanser a try - it's not very expensive and even if it doesn't work on your face you can use it elsewhere! Also, FYI: Trader Joe's sells the same product with different packaging if you prefer to purchase locally."
1,"I found this while looking for natural cleansers for my face. It's completely natural and vegan, with none of the chemicals and gunk of the more familiar popular face washes.I buy this giant bottle for the price save and then pour it into a smaller squeeze bottle I keep by the sink. The big bottle lasts me about 5-6 months.The soap itself is pretty watery, which is a little different at first if you're used to the usual thick face washes from stores. I just make sure to cup my hand with my fingers closed and squirt a little right in the palm. It suds pretty nicely, considering it doesn't have a lot of chemical agents in it. It has a really light, crisp, refreshing scent - almost like a faint pine woodsy type smell. It makes my skin feel kind of invigorated and a bit tingly, but rinses away incredibly clean - almost squeaky clean!I bought this as I was facing a really bad battle with acne which required dermatologist appointments and blue and red light laser treatments. I had really bad cystic acne, as well as scarring. I did not want to add anything harsh to my skin or put lots of drying chemicals or medicines on my skin. I simply wash with this once in the morning and once at night. Once in a blue moon I use a spot treatment. But my skin has cleared up completely and I get compliments on it all the time, people are shocked at the different a year has made. I usually pull this big bottle out and show them and read the label about it being all natural and vegan. I will never go back to drug store type brands of face cleansers, they really just add to the cycle of the problem and don't help. Natural is the way to go, and this is definitely a great cleanser to have."
1,"I have been using this product for several months.  I am a 46 y o woman who has struggled with adult acne forever.  I used to use a prescription product but when I ran out last year I decided to try over the counter products instead.  None of the acne treatment products every work for me.  I tried just about everything.  I would have a few breakouts around the chin and jaw line off and on throughout the year.  I also had some on the neck area.  Very frustrating.  After reading about retinoid products and seeing other reviews I decided to give this product a go.  Within 2 weeks the breakouts were gone.  My skin is much smoother and I haven't had any breakouts since.  An occasional spot or two that clears up very quickly.  Can't speak highly enough with how great this works.  I don't have many wrinkles (yet) so can't speak to the efficacy of using to treat wrinkles.  But, overall skin tone and clear complexion is much better since using the product.  I only use it at night with the occasional night off.  Well worth it and much cheaper than those designer and prescription products.  It lasts a long time and I think I use a lot compared to what most people would need since I also use it on my neck area."
0,I did not care for the rollers or the fact that the lid is not hinged.  Just not what I was looking for; they were returned.
0,"Kelp face wash has a horrible smell, I could not stand it - I am washing my feet with it. It also dries your skin a lot, and I did not like how my face felt after that. I am not buying this again."
1,My face is difficult. Without any products its just an oily mess. I love these pads because it allows me to quickly clean my face. They're really refreshing and a nice item to have on the go when it gets hot and my face starts gleaming. I purchased the rose toner in the bottle before but opted for the pads this time around and these are just more convenient.
1,"I love Aubrey's product line.  GREAT STUFF and the quality is very good for the price point.  This however, just didn't do it for me.  I have high expectations when it comes to a hair mask.  It takes time and patience but when I rinse it, I LIKE TO FEEL THE DIFFERENCE.  I will say, oddly, I really like the texture of this stuff - slimy IN A GOOD WAY? :)  I have better results with my homemade hair masks,but if you don't have the time to do the &#34;homemade&#34; thing, then you will probably be quite happy with this product."
1,I've used this product about 6 times since it arrived and I love it!  I was already using a toner after washing so I thought my face was clean......until I used this toner.  I never knew there was so much dirt and residue on my face after I washed it.  This is really great stuff; does what it says and the price is excellent.  Now watch them stop making it (as soon as I find something I like they always do :-)
1,This is a very sultry scent. I just dab a bit on my wrists and the back of my neck. Then I spray on Marilyn Miglin's Encryption. I get so many compliments. A seductive woman's scent. Wow!
1,"This works great for dry skin and absorbs well.  There is no fragrance.  It is the perfect companion for the aveeno itchy skin body wash.  Perfect for anyone with dry, itchy skin or eczema.  Love the Aveeno brand in general!"
1,"IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND THIS PRODUCT IN THE STORES/DRUG STORES.  SO I HAVE TO ORDER ON LINE.  I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE UNDERARM SKIN.  IF PRODUCT IS TOO HARSH, I DEVELOP LUMPS.  THIS PRODUCT IS HYPOALLERGENIC AND THE ONLY DEODORANT I USE."
1,This has always been my favorite face cleaner.  Its been harder and harder to find.  The only problem I have is the price.  Too expensive so I may have to change to another product.
0,"Did nothing for me. Stings when I put it on. I used the whole tube and it just did nothing, no Lightening, no Brightening,......NOTHING. Also it tends to dry out my skin and made my face feel weird the next day. I stuck with it hoping it would LIGHTEN,.....but it didn't."
1,"THIS STUFF ALMOST COMPLETELY MESSED UP MY SKIN, I STARTED HAVING PIGMENTATION DISORDERS AFTER A WEEK OF THIS STUFF, NOT GOOD."
1,I recently began wearing hearing aids and had trouble with itchy ears. This product brought lots of relief. I used sparingly per directions.
1,"I compete in Ballroom dancing and have to travel with a lot of items that I can't carry on.  I was looking for something that would hold my hairspray, gels and other items safely and would contain them if they leaked.  So far so good.  Everything fits extremely well in the bag and it packed well in my large suitcase."
1,"I initially purchased this for some razor burns and scars I have from shaving. It works wonderfully! And very soothing on the skin. It does, however, dry my skin out, but I think that is from applying a larger amount. It doesn't bother me though, as long as it does the job of healing my skin! It also worked really well when my bf got a small yet annoying burn on his arm. I immediately applied it to his burn, and in a matter of hours he could barely feel the tingles of the burn. I'd say this is something every household should have!"
0,"I bought this brush based off the amazing reviews on amazon but im failing to understand why. I've had this brush for over a year and it just sits in my drawer. I have long hair with average thickness and this didn't impress me at all.Pros:Good weightComfortable handleCons:Adds staticHard to cleanNot preferred for wet hairAverage detangling abilityLackluster designI think the biggest selling point is that the brush lasts forever...well since then newer brushes have been made that imo outperform this standard design. I now use tangle teezer (also sold on amazon) and it detangles my hair without any pulling, doesn't give my added static, less hairloss, and is great on wet or dry hair!If you're looking for longevity then consider this brush but if you're looking for performance then go with tangle teezer."
1,"As a part of the daily routine, this is a good option if you have an oily or combination skin type."
1,"I have medium to fine past the shoulder length Strait hair , read all instructions , but  my curls fell flat  in half an hour ."
1,Received ordered products in a timely manner.I have fine thinning hair and not sure this product and shampoo works b/c I haven't used it long enough. I would have wanted to know how long it takes to see fuller locks before purchasing both products.One thing's for sure--a little goes a long way and may be justification for the cost.
1,"Leaves your hands feeling very oily. It does otherwise work very well and the smell is acceptable.Despite all it's &#34;green&#34; qualities i'll probably seek an alternative the next time i need lotion, just because of the oily residue."
1,"I love all Camille Beckman products, the glycerine hand therapy is fantastic. However after purchasing this scent (in a HUGE tub) I realized the Tuscan Honey scent is pretty awful! If your hands are extremely dry I recommend this product in any other scent"
1,Alright so I am going to be extremely open in this review. If you or any other female you know are in a wheelchair it makes that time of month even more unpleasant.I was using a large overnight pad and the super+ tampons and well when you bend over in a wheelchair it creates a very uncomfortable.. squish... and it was not working and making me miserable.Now I still use a pad to catch accidental leaks since sitting doesnt allow for natural gravity flow. But with this product I can actually feel like I am able to go out of the house during that week each month. I don't worry about what if I bend over.Pro's: not recommended but i have used over 12hrs and it worked great. use longer at your own risk since there is little research with TSS and these.less smelleasy for those with less dexterity (i couldnt use diva cup cuz i have issues with my hands and folding it while inserting was impossible)sanitary just throw outcons:takes time to get used tocan be messy to remove but better after practicei think its only cuz i sit in a wheelchair but it sometimes sits on my urethra and after 8hrs hurts/makes me really have to pee.great product. i recommend to all!
1,I bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law and it arrived on time and packaged nicely. Sometimes Macy's is out of this perfume so it's nice to buy it online and know that it's always available. It has a nice scent and the 1.7 oz is a perfect size to last about a year.
1,"my granddaughter, tenderest head ever existing, loves this comb.  instead of screeching with every trip through her curly fine beadhead, she only has a few ows.  a vast improvement for all of us."
1,"I started using Neutrogena's Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask in May 2010 when I started to suffer from (surprising) adult acne.  I had deep, painful acne cysts around my jawline and cheeks that didn't seem to go away despite the use of harsh RX cleansers and gels.  With my sensitive skin, the harsh formula of the RXs seemed to just my skin raw, chapped, and aching.  On a whim, I decided to try the Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask because of the Benzoyl Peroxide formula that was similar to the RX but without some of the other additives.  My first impressions using it were that this cleanser did not sting and burn my face as the RX had done.  After about three days of using the product, I began to notice that the size of my acne cysts had decreased considerably and were less painful and red in appearance.  By week two of using the product, I had no new breakouts and the acne I had was nearly gone.  Additionally, my skin seemed to be handling the formula well- I had smooth, normal sky.  No dry patches, redness, or peeling.  Over a year later, I rarely have breakouts and when I do, I apply the cleanser as a mask for 5 minutes twice a day and the blemish is gone within two days.  The only negative point about this cleanser is that it can be hard to wash off your hands and face.  The cleanser is very much the consistency of a mask and, therefore, it takes a little bit extra time to get off your fingers.  I recommend using a washcloth to wipe away the cleanser from your face (and also to provide a bit of exfoliation for your skin).  With the amount of money I save from not having to make a dermatology appointment and buy RX cleansers and medicine along with the beauty benefits make this an outstanding product!"
1,One coat and it's opaque even over other polishes. Super smooth and easy to work with. It has a very micro glitter metallic to it. It's my most favorite gold so far.
1,This is so affordable that I use it as body lotion. It doesn't cause any bad reaction (acne or otherwise) and leaves skin nicely moisturized and protected for sunlight. It's really cheap and definitely a great product.
1,"Let me start off by telling you about my skin: I had great skin, until part way through college when I began suffering horrible cystic acne breakouts. Nothing helped; many products would make my oily skin too dry, and cause further breakouts. This cleanser is great, and leaves me feeling clean. Also very economical- I bought the 32 oz size, and dilute it 1 part soap to 3 parts water in a foaming dispenser. This bottle will last years."
1,I bought this for myself but husband ended up using since it had very strong earthy tones to it. Very manly.
0,"I purchased this dryer to replace my old, old, old hair dryer.  My previous dryer was great but it just stopped working after many year.  So it was time for a new one.  This dryer has two speeds low and high nothing in-between, ok I did not like that feature but I can live with that, what I did not like at all was the fact that the vents were only on the top of the hood so there is no air flow around the sides of your head.  There other featured I was totally displeased about was the fact that you can NOT adjust the hood at all its either up or down.  I don't know about you but when I dry my hair, the dryer goes on the table and I site facing the dryer and it would be nice to adjust the hood so it does not feel like half your hear is not being dried.  I did try to face fwd but it is still to high and I don't feel that I am fully under it comfortably.  I had put something under it so it would tilt forward.  Mind you my table is NOT that high and it your average hight table.  Unfortunately I normally wear my hair curly and did not bother to open the box and inspect it until now (4 months later) so it is to late to returen it which makes me want to kick myself for that.  My old dryer was from Conair and being that I loved it so much I figured I would love this one just as much, NOT the case at all.  I am extremely dissatisfied and disappointed with this crap."
1,"I have been using this for months and I LOVE IT.  I love the texture, the smell, the way it makes my face feel.  All of it.  IT's obviously gentle because I am pretty sensitive and have not been breaking out at all. In fact I wear less make up now than ever in my life."
0,"Applied sparingly this does look nice and photographs well but some component of the powder made me itch and burn and resulted in some very painful contact dermatitis/acne that took a week to clear. In fact some of the fallout from my use of this product left scarring. I do not recommend. Look around on make-up review sites and see for yourself. My story is repeated over and over by other women who wasted money on this product. This stuff is very, very irritating and applied heavily it does not look natural or good. For being photographed maybe. Otherwise little to no make up or a quality tinted moisturizer with SPF is the way to go. BareMinerals claims are too good to be true and they are not worth the potential havoc for your skin."
0,Purchased this product along with the other roc products in this line. as with the others this is a waste of money. Deep wrinkle removal is definitely not what you get. This doesn't even remove or improve small wrinkles or fine lines!!!
1,"We have been using this product on our 3 year old son since December 8, 2012. Once we put it on, just a little bit, he tasted it once and has not sucked his thumb since that day. It took a few nights for him to get adjusted to falling asleep without sucking his thumb, but it really wasn't too bad. It may have also worked because I discussed with him that he needed to stop sucking his thumb and that we were going to buy something to help him. He kept asking me when we were going to buy this product, so he was ready to stop sucking his thumb and just needed some help. We haven't stopped yet, because we fear that if we stop too soon, he might revert. I think we will do this for another month. Overall I am very please so far and this was way less expensive and cumbersome than those thumb guard contraptions. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to help their child to stop sucking their thumb. It's a good first step rather than going straight to the thumb guard contraptions. Good luck!"
1,"This could be a great product in theory; not so much in practice. At least for me. I'm sure others have gotten great results with it, but I think maybe my hair type is too fine (and maybe too long, past mid-back) to allow the rollers to dry properly. As I wanted this because it was supposed to dry within 20 minutes or so and I could wait while I did my makeup, having to sit with the rollers in for an hour and still have damp hair defeated the purpose. All I wound up with were damp, frizzy curls. And this may be user error, but I was annoyed by getting really tight curls at the front of my hair but only loose waves everywhere else, even using the same size rollers all over my head. I'm returning this, not because I think it's a bad product, but because it simply didn't work out with my hair,On the plus side, if it works with your hair and you can use them properly, the device steams up very quickly and it's very easy to use."
0,"I've purchased this particular perfume at department stores for a few years now since the fragrance smells great (fresh, doesn't make you want to sneeze), and decided to get it from Amazon since it was cheaper. It doesn't smell exactly like the one in stores (although it smells similar), which makes me think it could be fake (or watered down??). The perfume fades quickly which is strange since I've only needed a spray or two of this perfume in the past, and it stays on for a long time. I wouldn't buy this from Amazon again, and wouldn't recommend anyone buy this from Amazon."
1,This is a very nice product for sensitive skin.  I do facials and had been trying to find a alcohol free toner/freshener with natural ingredients that was gentle enough for sensitive skin.  This product has worked well for all skin types and I love that it contains aloe vera and Hyaluronic Acid.  My only disappointment is that it contains fragrance.
1,"First of all, I love amazon because they carry avariety of products. This handsoap is very mild andpleasantly scented. The bottle is very pretty foryour bathroom or kitchen. I would recommend this product."
1,"I admit that I am just immature enough to have been attracted to this product because of the name.  I mean it is great.  But the product itself is very nice.  The gloss is just right and I have never gotten my hair caught in it, this is a key item for me.  The color seems to look great on anyone, and I think it really looks nice on me.  I have olive tinted skin so too much pink makes me look like I do not have good sense.  And I cannot have that, especially on an off day.  So this lip gloss looks sleek and put together and I love that.  Especially on an off day."
1,"If you've got dry skin that has problems with shedding, eczema, or icthyosis, this is the best soap you can use. I bought the shea butter one too, but found this one most effective and moisturizing. It's the best soap you can use for icthyosis."
1,My hands are extremely dry during the winter time.  These hand creams do provide plenty of moisture but more like a thin coating on applied areas.  I like these hand creams because they are not so oily and it is absorbed fast.
0,I bought this because I read that Nars made long lasting lip gloss but this product is just like any other lip gloss to me stays on for maybe one hour or so.
0,I washed and conditioned 1 a week but didn't see much difference. No thickening. May work for thinning but I have actual loss of hair.
1,After all the reviews ive read about this blush I finally decided to order it. I'm not impressed with it at all. I have to really work my brush hard on it to get any color on my cheeks.
1,"After hearing so much about this product, I had to purchase some when in the States recently (it's unavailable in Australia of course) and I'm glad I did.  I went to the Bare Escentuals store at South Coast Plaza and the girl there put this on my face and it looked OK.  I must admit, I wasn't totally convinced at first, but I bought it due to the hype and when I first put it on myself, I still didn't quite get it.  Now that I'm doing it at home and taking more time applying it, I have to say that I really like it.  The only reason I dropped a star from the ratings is because no matter how hard you try to not get excess powder on you, it still happens.  It can actually have good coverage if you use it correctly and it looks totally natural.I think this is a product you have to try for yourself.  It's maybe not quite worth all the hype, but still very nice and easy to use.  I love how my skin looks with it on and would really recommend this to everyone."
1,"My husband likes this product and has been using it for years. The reason I gave it four stars is because the online usage instructions refer to this product as foam, which my husband greatly prefers, but this came in liquid, non-foaming form, so he is disappointed. The liquid tends to run, while the foam stays put.  It would have been nice, if the instructions had not been misleading and I'm sure others would appreciate if the seller would correct this . Otherwise, it is a good product."
1,"I just purchased this to try for a more natural alternative for toners. I've used Thayers non-alcoholic formula with success. I have oily skin, clogged pores and occasional disturbances when those pores get aggravated. I'm late-20s and I've been told every seven years your skin type undergoes changes. I bought this after reading reviews and some people were angry it wasn't 100% witch hazel. It can't be 100% witch hazel it would be too strong and cause more skin problems than it's meant to solve. Their formula uses alcohol because it's a good carrier fluid to dilute the power of witch hazel extract. Its smell is smokey, with the mild alcohol notes. It reminds me of a barbecue. The smell will go away once it's dried. The labeling says ""100% Natural"" which does NOT mean it's ""100% Witch Hazel"". If it were the latter we would have to mix it with something to use it safely on skin and I'll bet we'd be using alcohol. If you've got extremely sensitive skin I'd use caution. The Thayers non-alcoholic toners are great for sensitive skin types it is less drying."
1,"This is an ugly soap, made of calamine with flower petals on top. It absolutely will dry up pimples and keep sensitive skin calm. There are a lot of good natural items in here, like rose and calamine and calendula. There is also detergent (sls) so your skin may find this drying. But it does work."
1,Why I like this brush:* Bristles do not snag on my hair* Excellent for use with hair dryers* Great brush for wet or dry hair.* Does not cause static when brushing dry hair.* Has nice weight in the handleI have had this brush for over a year and just ordered 2 more(one for my purse and another for the office).update 11/7/2008Again bought 2 more.  One to give as a gift and one to replace one I have lost.  This is a great product that detangles without snaging my very fine hair.  I bought the gift for my granddaughter who also has very fine hair.
1,"I got this to use with individual lashes because i didnt want them to be glued on for weeks at a time and it works perfectly! It dries quickly and also comes off pretty smoothly when using either makeup wipes or some baby oil. The only thing i didnt like about it, is it doesnt exactly dry clear unless you have a very minimal amount. It was easily covered up though with some mascara."
1,"THIS IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE CONCEALER.  DOES NOT CREASE AT ALL. COVERAGE COULD BE A LITTLE BETTER, BUT STILL A GREAT PRODUCT."
1,This product works quickly and and is mild enough to use once a week on sensitive skin if massaged gently. I love this product!
1,Mild and really nice feel when you wash your face. I have used all the name brands and this one is right up there and really better than many. very mild around the eyes too. I am surprised I am such a fan but truly it is good so the truth is the truth-:)
1,"I bought this color after googling some images of it, it is prefect for summer, or for nail design. It is a fun color and I also placed a matte coat over it n it looks awesome, it looks good on dark skin n light skin color"
1,"I love this product and have been using it for two years. So nice and light and smells good and goes on easily without any adverse reactions. I love it. I use it first after washing and drying my face, and then add my other creams on top."
1,"Have been using for a long time now and love it.  Was tired of liquids on my skin and the lightness of this is like having nothing there.  Easy to adjust coverage, easy to remove.  Beautiful on."
1,I don't know how I lived without this product.
1,This has product has my face looking so dewy and young.  It has my skin so soft.It is worth buying for your skin.
1,I love this Headband. It holds my hair very well with the help of the adjustable thing on the back. I was free to splash any amount of water on my face without the worries of ruining my blow-drying hair.
1,"Good, durable, decent sized. Very good for detangling curly hair without damaging curls since there are only 5 rows. Recommended."
1,"I have very fair skin and blue eyes, so I find it difficult to find a natural looking blush that doesn't make me look overdone.  This is that blush for me.  It is the perfect pink color and when applied it gives just enough pink color to achieve that glowing, natural blush look. It is expensive, but you are paying for the quality and the convenience of not having to touch-up mid-day."
1,"I really liked this soap. I'm a germophobe n wash my hands constantly. It was gentle for my hands yet effective. also, it lasted me a long time which was great. I highly recommend this soap."
0,"Where do i start? I am sorry but i can't believe they designed to hair. Not only that how did it make to amazon best seller list with 300 review? HA wow! I like my hair soft shiny and wavy. Guess what? this product does the opposite. After blow dry my hair i used this rollers the result was hell... It gives me a tight curl but my hair was dry,twinkled. The steam makes your hair raw, dry. It's like putting a water on ur hair. Do not expect compliment or anything. worry about your hair. It was like abusing my hair. The next day or after a few hour try to brush ur hair, it is really difficult. The idea of steam doesn't give the desired result. Even though i get tight curl, It was really wired curl it makes my hair away short and frizzy. You don't want that. Thanks to return policy immediately return it. If you can find a good ceramics rollers are a way better. Are there any one that agrees with me??"
1,"I bought these for Christmas gifts and one for myself.  This is wonderful hand cream and everyone I have it to loved it.  Very dense in the jar but absorbs wonderfully into my skin. My hands feel very ""protected"" when I use. I would rather pay more for a product that works great than to waste money on something I have to reapply constantly.  Highly recommended!"
1,"It's bitterly cold and dry this winter - no news, I know - and I was noticing that after showers I was feeling even more itchy and dry than usual.  I use Cetaphil liquid soap to wash my face, Cetaphil lotion for moisturizing face and body - so I thought I'd give the bar soap a try in the shower before I dried up and vanished from the face of the earth before Spring.  I bought it, I used it, have used it for a week now, and it's made a big difference in how comfortable my skin feels.  I'm very happy I finally tried the bar soap, and I have no plans of switching back to my previous soap (Ivory) in bath, shower, or next to the sink for handwashing.  Great brand, Cetaphil, and I've no qualms at all at recommending it to anyone and everyone.  Also:  this Cetaphil bar soap, fragrance wise, is either fragrance free or if it does have added fragrance, I can't discern anything and I'm super sensitive to fragrances, so if you prefer no fragrance in your soap for whatever reason, you can rest assured that this soap won't bother you in that regard, either."
1,"This is a very nice leave-in that won't weight your hair down or leave it greasy--that said, I think for people with dry hair (myself included), I don't feel it's enough to totally moisturize our hair like it needs to be. But this is a very good, every day leave-in that smells soooo good! I use it on my ends when I'm putting up my hair at night, and it works great!"
1,"I gave this dryer a 5 because I am very satisfied with the speed that it dries and how soft and smooth my hair is right afterwards.  This is probably not the only dryer that will give these kinds of results and it's probably not the best.  But if you have thick long hair like mine(reaches my waist)this is a handy tool.  It is a little heavy but it shouldn't be a problem if you only need to hold it for 5-10 minutes.  The real reason why I chose this ionic dryer is because I love Revlon's button configuration. The top button lets me adjust the temperature from cool, warm to hot.  And the bottom button adjusts the air flow from low, med to high. It lets me control and style my hair how I want to. I get so frustrated when the temperature corresponds to the air flow setting because it won't let me use hot on low or cool on med...catch my drift?  Anyway, nice dryer:)"
1,"Nice texture and lightly fragranced.  Leaves skin soft.  Have only used for about a week;  no miracles so far, :), but I like the product."
1,"I don't expect miracles from any wrinkle cream, used entire tube.  This one is light, has a hint of a slight flowery scent which I could tolerate but did not like --- hate perfumey smells especially when trying to sleep at night.  Seems to help a bit with acne and wrinkles."
1,feels good on skin.  have only started using it so too early to tell if it is firming.  I really like most all Reviva products!
1,I wanted the lotion form and I was looking for a 10% for at least $5 and I couldn't even find anything less which is nuts. Tonight I seen this tor $5  which pissed me off because I bought the 10% oil-free watered down formula and I hate it even though it has really high ratings. Oh well I am sure it will work anyway.
1,"6/8/2013, first review: I thought to review this product as time goes on. I've only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point.  It's good to note that I'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.The bottles are SMALL so I'm not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather.  It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty! After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it's not weighted down after styling. SO, I'll keep on trying this for 3 months. I'll try to remember to update if I see a difference. Feel free to ask me questions.**IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/THE SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER, I'M TAKING, MAXI HAIR SUPPLEMENTS.  My Dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp, cond AND supplements. I use the supplements in place of a multi so I also take OMEGA 3 & Calcium Citrate w/ D3. (As per Dr).**6/27/2013 - Although there is NO new hair growth, I've noticed that I'M LOSING LESS HAIR when I wash & style!  It's enough for me to notice & enough for me to keep going w/ this trial. 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond & Maxi Hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn't have a bad smell, still not weighty & continues to be manageable. I feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out. My hope is that this is the case for my scalp & maybe, just maybe, I'll see some new sprouts. A girl can dream. :)6/30/2013 - Could it be?  New hair?  Will keep you posted.  I see three short hairs poking through!  I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  I suspect this would be from the internal good I'm getting from the Maxi-Hair supplement.7/21/2013 - YES!  Still losing less hair, AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots.  My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &healthy; it looks!  I remain faithful to the products, using them EVERY DAY as recommended.9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair.  I have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner.  It's stripping the oils from my hair.  I will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week.  WIll keep updating.  I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up!  That is the good part!  SO, I will be using the MAXI HAIR daily as bottle recommends, but will limit the use of the shampoo and conditioner."
1,"Yes i am a middle age woman and i never used to use moisterizers and now i find i need to, and i do notice the difference in my skin as i used this daily."
1,"This product is just wonderful! It does not clog my pores, cause blemishes or irritate my oily skin - after using it for almost a year now I have noticed my skin is much softer and more supple than it use to be, and the scent is luxurious but not overpowering - if you're looking for a moisturizer that will refine and even out your skin-tone, this is for you, and the amazon price can't be beat!"
0,"The sauna works fine with distilled water, its open enough to not suffocate you with steam but you can put a towel on if your looking to get deep into the pores. The facial scrubber cleaned out my blackheads. But only after a month it stopped working, its not meant to get wet at all, even the humidity of the bathroom will ruin it."
1,"I have fine, limp hair that is prone to looking greasy, so there was no way I would have even tried this product if it weren't for a recommendation from a friend. I apply this to only the ends of my damp hair and it doesn't leave my hair greasy or heavy at all. I was very pleasantly surprised by this. It has really helped my split ends and makes it easy to pull a brush through my hair. I don't know if I got an odd bottle, or if they all are like this, but the stuff shoots out of the bottle like a rocket and I have more than once squirted myself, the floor, the walls and counters with it. Gotta be careful, but it works great."
1,"I started using this almost 10 years ago.  It's a really no frills product with no weird chemicals in it. It tingles a little when it's on.  I have sensitive skin and it doesn't aggravate my skin at all.  It decreases redness and inflammation in my skin.  After using it, my skin is soft, appears tones and my pores are clean and smaller."
1,I got it before it was suppose to arrive which was great. my hair is still deep red as of january 26th. though a little pricey it was still worth it. though its not as vibrant as it was when i first dyed my hair (due to lack of good color stay shampoo and conditioner) i can still notice the color.
1,"Secret to beautiful, glowing skin.  I have been using these astringent pads nightly for weeks.  It has evened out my skin tone, the pores on my nose are no longer visible, and I swear my wrinkles even look better.I will definitely be buying more.UPDATE:I've ordered another batch of these pads, because I really do love them.  However, after recommending them to several people, several have told me they find the pads a bit scratchy.  I personally like that because I feel like that, but if you want something with a softer texture or have very sensitive skin, you might want to try bottled witch hazel with cotton balls instead."
1,"This is a very effective hot roller set. Extremely easy to use compared to other hot rollers and holds a curl like no other.I am Asian-American with lots and lots of thick, coarse hair. It's slightly wavy, so my hair has a little texture and can hold a curl for slightly longer than other Asian hair. Nonetheless, it still requires lots of heat and potential damage to curl my hair. I've always wanted to use hot rollers to style my hair, but I was put off by the tutorials on Youtube by non-Asian women because they have SO MUCH LESS hair than me. I have to use 2-3x as many rollers as they do and I can't trust that they have a similarly resistant hair type.Anyway, Caruso steam setting works like a charm. It doesn't set with heat so much as steam. Just be sure not to over steam the roller. Also, the cups that hold the curl? Dude, they hold the roller REALLY WELL. I ALWAYS have trouble with the rollers falling out and putting too much hair in any individual roller and having the hair not curl properly. With this set? Wow. No problems whatsoever."
1,"Suave Conditioner works like it should - conditions hair and rinses out cleanly with no residue.  It's also priced reasonably, so it's a winner in our household."
1,"This is my &#34;go to&#34; hand &#34;cream&#34; when traveling, gardening, winter weather or cleaning have pulled all the moisture out of my hands and the cuticles are fraying. It has a pleasant herbal fragrance and the beeswax just melts into your skin. Particularly restoring when used overnight, I haven't had any rashes or sensitive skin issues with this product and have been using it for over 6 years."
1,"I bought this and loved it, and then my mom stole it. There are a lot of brushes that look like the Spornette brush, but all brushes are not created equal. The amount of give on the back cushion really lets the brush contour and smush to your head, making for a very comfortable blow drying experience. After my mom took mine, I just went and got a Conair one and it feels really hard against my head and doesn't have any give or conform to my head shape, so I'm ordering another one of these. Don't waste your money on other brushes like I clearly did. Just buy this one and be set for life!"
1,"I love this mask!! Within a month of using it, I noticed a difference in my skin's texture. I don't think skin confidence has a price.. I would pay anything to have clear skin. For what this does, it's so stinkin cheap!!! Delivery was fast and simple. I will be ordering from this seller again."
0,"I am alergic to this thing!! I used rose body lotions before and never feel this bad. And the smell is completely artificial, very unnatural and too too strong!!! Now I'm even sure if I'm allergic to rose water or just the fragrance thing. I really don't dare try any rose water afterwards.....I think I will stick with prodicts with allergy test."
1,I love it. This is my favorite creme. Going to buy day line with SPF. Read the reviews for far they are good.
1,These applicators are fantastic.  They're good for either applying nail polish and helping with the detail or taking polish off.  I find they're very helpful for cleaning up the little spots of spillover that happen when you're doing your nails.  I always end up needing to do some touch ups.
1,I have tried a lot of eye makeup removers including some really expensive ones. Almay pads are by far the best. They are a bit oily but they are supposed to be in order to protect the skin around your eye. (Don't get the oil free they don't work) There are 80 pads in the container but I use one pad 3 or for times so they last forever.
1,"Love it and feel wonderful! I no longer look my age, I look considerably younger, thank you philosophy! I am a consumer for life!"
1,"I really love this product, and so does my little teenage sister. It's great for someone who has always had problems with their skin. It might feel like it's drying out your skin, but that's going to happen with every face mask. Great product, I recommend this for sensitive skin!"
1,"It's okay and the size of the barrel does make looser, softer waves.  I just don't see much difference between using this and a regular curling iron as far as results go."
1,"I have very sensitive skin and most lotions cause irritation and sometimes a rash.  This lotion does not.  It is wonderfully hydrating, soothing and not greasy.  I am sold on it!  The only other lotion I can use is Vanicream, but Aveeno Skin Relief is my favorite.  I will continue purchasing it from amazon."
1,"Another EXCELLENT product from this company OUIDAD.I have yet to be disappointed by any of the products offered by this company.The quality of the products are second to none. Don't be put off by the price. IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY.The Climate control hair product offered by OUIDAD is THE BEST out there, PERIOD."
1,"I bought this product after seeing it recommended inReal Simple (1-year auto-renewal).  I don't have a huge problem with dry hands, but my cuticles can become so dry that they start to flake and peel, so I try to remember to moisturize my hands for this reason.This product does perform as advertised.  It is an extremely thick cream, and you really only need to use a tiny dab.  The cream is quite emollient, and I believe that most people will see dryness relief from use of this product.  However, several major downsides prevent me from using this product regularly.  First, it is VERY greasy.  I have found that it does NOT absorb into my skin, so after using it, I can't touch anything with my hands!  This is unfortunate, as it generally limits my use of the product to before bed.  The second concern is somewhat related--I absolute HATE the screw cap!  This may sound insubstantial, but when your hands are greasy, it becomes near-impossible to try to screw the cap back on; most other hand creams that I have tried have a flip-top cap.Because of the above concerns, I will not be re-purchasing this product.  Instead, an alternate product that I've tried recently and really like isMary Kay Satin Hands Hand Cream,3 oz. net wt.--this product is moisturizing, absorbs well, AND has a flip-top cap, so I would highly recommend it."
1,"I wish it came with a dropper or something so It wasn't so annoying to measure out. Oh well, smells nice."
1,"Dermatologists everywhere, including my own, recommend this cream for patients with eczema. The main thing it has going for it is that it is very thick and it contains no fragrance. I've used this cream for years and have never developed any allergic reactions to it, even though several of its ingredients have the potential to cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.I decided tonight, for the first time ever, to analyze every one of the ingredients. It's disappointing to see that it has multiple undesirable ingredients thatCetaphil Lotionlacks. Perhaps the most worrisome ingredient in this skin cream is propylene glycol (see below).Ingredients: Water, petrolatum, glyceryl polymethacrylate, dicaprylyl ether, glycerin, dimethicone, glyceryl stearate, cetyl alcohol, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, PEG-30 glyceryl stearate, tocopheryl acetate, benzyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, sodium hydroxide, acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, dimethiconol, disodium EDTA, propylene glycol.Petrolatum: This lab-derived substance has been around since 1859 when chemist Robert Chesebrough developed a method of purifying a black gel that clogged oil rigs called ""rod wax."" On the plus side, petrolatum seems to reduce water loss from the skin better than any other moisturizer currently known. It is also an effective topical barrier for preventing unwanted liquid substances from invading the skin. Premiere examples of the latter use are protecting the skin of babies and incontinent adults from excessive exposure to the ammonia and uric acid (not the same thing as urea) within urine and protecting the skin of serious swimmers from extensive exposure to chlorinated pool water. On the minus side, many consumers prefer not to use a substance derived from petrochemicals on their skin. In addition, as a continual source of moisturizing for the whole body, there is a big downside to petrolatum in that it does not allow the skin to adequately ""breathe."" That is, it prohibits the skin from a normal, necessary function of absorbing moisture from the atmosphere. As a result, petrolatum can actually be less moisturizing over the long run than emollient substances that allow moisture exchange from the air.Glyceryl Polymethacrylate: This substance is used in cosmetics to hydrate the skin by increasing its ability to absorb moisture from the air. It is presumed to help heal and reconstruct the dermis layer of the skin and increase skin firmness because it contains elastin.Dicaprylyl ether: This is an oil derived from a plant, AKA dioctyl ether or Cetiol OE. It functions to condition and smooth the skin. It is a non-greasy emollient that spreads easily and is commonly used in non-irritating or ""sensitive"" skin-care products.Glycerin: Glycerin AKA glycerol and glycerine is commonly found in medical and cosmetic preparations. It is used to provide a smooth sensation and as a humectant. It is safe enough to be consumed internally.Dimethicone: AKA polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS): This is a lab-created polymer derived from silicon, a naturally occurring earth element. It is approved for internal and external use. Allergic reactions usually occur when exposed to this substance in the form of a powder. They include itchy, burning skin, hives, dermatitis, swelling of the mouth and breathing problems. Silicone derivatives act as anti-foaming agents and emollients. They make anything they are in more spreadable. They cause skin and hair to feel silky smooth. They create a protective barrier on the skin that acts as a water repellent, much like petrolatum. They can fill in fine lines on the skin and temporarily smooth out wrinkles.Glyceryl stearate: This ingredient is created in a lab by reacting glycerin with stearic acid (a fatty acid obtained from animal and vegetable fats and oils). It functions as a moisturizer, but it can be a skin irritant for people with sensitive skin.Cetyl alcohol: A fairly natural oil which is produced by hydrogenation of vegetable oils such as palm oil and coconut oil. It is used in cosmetics as an emollient, emulsifier or thickening agent in skin creams and lotions. In rare cases people with eczema find it a skin irritant, but that may be due to impurities in the cetyl alcohol rather than the cetyl alcohol itself.Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil: Very safe, natural oil.PEG-30 glyceryl stearate: Emulsifying agent. It is a polyethylene glycol ether of glyceryl stearate which is generally considered safe.Tocopheryl acetate: This is a form of vitamin E, a safe preservative. It is generally healing to the skin, but some people can develop an allergy to it, resulting in skin rashes, especially around the eyes. In my own case, I am very allergic to pure vitamin E around my eyes, but I have never experienced any allergic reaction to Cetaphil Cream.Benzyl alcohol: This substance is used as a preservative in IV medication solutions and in cosmetics because of its bacteriostatic and antipruritic properties. It is considered very low risk. It is produced naturally by many plants and commonly found in fruits and teas. It is found in many essential oils, such as jasmine, hyacinth, and ylang-ylang.Phenoxyethanol: When information about the dangers of parabens became widely accepted, quite a few cosmetic companies switched to this preservative which initially seemed safe. Unfortunately, research has begun to reveal that it also may be toxic. Many people develop dermatitis from prolonged exposure to it. It can worsen skin conditions like eczema, and there is growing evidence that it may be a xenoestrogen like the parabens.Sodium hydroxide: Like potassium hydroxide, this is another name for lye. It is used in the paper and chemical industries, for the manufacture of sodium salts and detergents, for pH regulation, and in the production of aluminum. It is used to neutralize acids and increase the alkalinity of whatever it is in. I would presume that is the reason for its use in this product but--lye? Really?Acrylates/C10 30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer: This is a lab-derived, white powder appearing in just about every topical cosmetic and medication on the market. It is also used in chewable and sublingual tablets. Though considered safe enough to consume internally, like Vitamin E, some people develop an allergic reaction with long-term use leading to rashes and swelling (dermatitis). So far, I've never personally developed an allergy to Cetaphil so, presumably, I'm not allergic to this ingredient.Dimethiconol: Similar to dimethicone (see above).Disodium EDTA: This compound is widely used in processed foods and beverages, cosmetics, contact solution and eye drops as a preservative and stabilizer in many processed foods and beverages. When combined with vitamin C and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), it forms benzene, a dangerous carcinogen. This chemical reaction is most obvious when this compound is taken internally.Propylene glycol: This lab-derived compound is a form of mineral oil commonly used in brake and hydraulic fluid and in antifreeze. Cosmetic products employ it as a humescent, to prevent the escape of moisture from the skin. Unfortunately, the Material Safety Data Sheet of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) states that it is a strong skin irritant which can dry the skin. In addition, due to being absorbed into the blood stream through the skin, it can potentially cause kidney damage and liver abnormalities."
1,"I've stuck with this for several years, and don't intend to change. It looks amazing, and I dig the subtle sparkle. The color is divine. I also like the Nars ""The Multiple"" in this same color, as well as the lip gloss in the same color.The stuff is fabulous! It also lasts a LOOOOOOONG time."
1,"I LOVE Queen Helene products. They work really well for me.I remember when I was younger trying an apricot peel off masque my older sister use to use i think my saint ives? Anywho I decided to try this grape seed one.I have only used it 2 times, not counting the small initial tester.The masque is quite thick and sticky and the smell is horrible.But i applied it to my clean face and waited about 7 minutes and some areas were dry and other not at all. So I had to peel it off section by section. I think I may be missing something when it comes to putting this on my face.The second time I did the same thing but waited about 11-12 minutes. This time it started burning!!! It wasn't a burning sensation I couldn't handle, so I waited for it to complete drying and then peeled it off. My skin felt like it was oil-moisturized afterward. Since I've only used it 2 times I can't speak for the results but this is my initial reaction."
1,"This lotion is delicious - it has a wonderful smell, its thick and softens your hands like nothing else. It doesn't leave an oily residue - the only drawback is the high price - which is really quite high - but it is worth it!"
1,"I have such dry skin and I bought these to sleep in at night.  I use the hand cream and then cover my hands with these but the material doesn't feel good and the gloves are too small for my medium sized hands.  Oh well, they are OK in a pinch."
1,Majik smells exactly as I remember it from the early 90s.  It is spicy to be sure and reminds me of when I first purchased Auric Blends roll on oils around 1993.  You can layer it with Egyptian Goddess to give EG a little punch.I recommend Majik for someone who is looking for something different.
0,"I've been looking for a natural product to use on my combination skin & the salesperson at my local health foods store highly recommended this product because it is ""good."" I hated it to say the least... not as good as I was made to believe."
1,"I dyed the tips of my bleach blonde hair to get a two-toned look. The color was very bright and vibrant. I loved the dramatic contrast. Unfortunately after about 5 washings it has faded out and is pretty dull looking. If your not looking for a very bright color I would recommend this, but if you want to make a statement find another color."
1,"I've been using 'nailtiques' since before Xmas of 2010. I have always had long, strong, well manicured fingernails - I give myself a manicure at least one a week on an average but within the past two years I've noticed the my middle fingernail, left hand has this slightly noticable crack and all 10 nails without polish look cracked and definitely not smooth like they use to be. I always use oils before I go to bed but nothing has helped  until I discovered nailtiques completely by accident.  I purchased Formula 2 PLUS first, then Formula 2 large size - it works girls.I cut my nails short and started my first application of Formula 2 Plus, using it only 9/10 days and saw a great improvement. I stopped using nail polish for about 2 month, using only the Formula 2 for the next 5 months - my nails are back to the way they use to be.  I still use the Formula 2 PLUS about once a month - I wouldn't be without this stuff.  It has a nice sheen so it looks good on the nails without polish.  I takes approximately 3 months for my nails to be long again and believe me I do a lot of typing which is deadly for the nail tips.  Don't hesitate to purchase this great 'bring back my nails' - product."
1,"When I first received this, the smell really bothered me. Now I love it and I associate it with a clean feeling. I have suffered from acne for many years, and this in combination with a good loofah has really helped keep breakouts at bay. I will warn against how strong this is though due to the tea tree oil. For the life of me I cannot understand why but my husband washes his face with his eyes open and then lets the water run down his face, then shouts when the cleanser gets into his eyes. I think he learned his lesson after this face wash arrived in the house. Make sure you really rinse your face before opening your eyes!"
1,"covers well, so creamy and not drippy at all. pretty color and coverage is excellent. doesn't rub off or oil up like makeup. I use it everyday."
1,"This is one of the better acne products out there. I use it almost everyday to gently exfoliate and clean my skin. Some people, like my brother, prefer the large beads in a facial scrub, but I like the smaller beads in this one. Because the beads are finer, it feels like it's exfoliating more evenly. It can also be used in combination with other products, where as other facial scrubs might be too harsh for combination with anything else in the day. I would recommend trying it out; It's effective, cheap, and the tube lasts for a really long time."
1,"I will flip back and forth between this conditioner and my first love, Giovanni Smooth as Silk Deeper Moisture Conditioner. I wanted to try this conditioner because of the glycogen protein and absolutely love it! I've been natural for five years and my hair has three different lengths and three different textures, so it is hard at times to find the right product for my hair, but this one hopefully will be a keeper for a long time. Three days later after I washed my hair and conditioned it, it still feels very soft, very manageable, and is retaining moisture very well. I don't shampoo, just use vinegar and water, which has also been key to my hair not looking and feeling dry."
1,This product has everything your face needs on a daily basis it cleanses has a toner moisterizer its just amazing
1,Formula feels thin and watery on my hands. Not deeply moisturizing and certainly does not feel moisturized hours later. My search continues but EOS brand seems better. I will not reorder.
1,"This was my first bottle of anything Philosophy, but it won't be my last. I've been using it for months (and I shower a lot); it lasts and lasts in the bottle. You don't need a lot of gel on you loofah or cloth because it foams up luxuriously. At first I thought it was a bit pricey, but considering how long it has lasted, that's not a problem. The smell is sweet and light. I don't want a scent that overpowers because I'm sensitive to odors. When I bought it I was comparing ingredients, and it came out on top or I wouldn't have purchased it. I may try some of Philosophy's other scents, but then I'm pretty happy with this one."
1,Great color goes on well. I bought this for the holidays but it is so fun that you can wear anytime.
1,"I really love this. It worked perfectly on my natural hair. I am black and my hair is natural has to be done and this product is perfect. If you want to see how i use the product watch my youtube video and subscribe, [...]"
0,This is the worst nail polish ever. The color is not even close to what it should be.  It actually looked like two different colors in the bottle even after shaking it.  The consistency was very thick and would not glide on the nail.  In the garbage it went.
1,This really works for dry hands and cuticles. My hands don't crack but they do get pretty dry in the winter and this really helps them heal quickly. My cuticles get so dry they peel and rip which is very painful - this helps keep them moist so they don't continue to peel. The smell is really nice - mostly eucalyptus with a hint of lavender. It's a bit greasy upon first applying but soaks in quickly. I also like to use it on my feet. It's a great multipurpose product.
1,"My daughter is suffering from eczema. Her skin turns red and is scratching tremendously. We have been to different Dermatologist but it doesn't eliminate it for good. I then tried researching ways of how to get rid of it without hurting my pocket and found this. I saw the difference within 3 days of using it. The smell is awful but I dont care since my priority is for eczema to be gone. After 2 weeks of religiously using it, the eczema is totally gone. I will definitely buy this again."
1,"I had to apply this product at least 4 times a day and I always would smell bad when it would wear off. I switched to a product called Natural for Her by Herban Cowboy from my local natural market. It has no parabens, triclosan, alcohol, propylene glycol and especially no aluminum at all. And this stuff lasts all day and I don't smell. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!"
1,I got the lipstick and I really like it because it is a nice dark color and I can use it to match anything.
1,"I have a new obsession with super dark, not quite black colors right now so I had to have this... And it does not disappoint!! I love it so much and I love the name too :) I would definitely recommend."
1,I have used this product for about 6 years now.  I got my girls using these products too.  My skin looks good for being 68 years old.
1,"First time I tried this lotion and I am hooked.  The lavender smell is refreshing and strong, and the lotion leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized. I like that my skin feels revitalized after I put the lotion on. For the prize, this lotion is a great value."
1,"This product works just as well as Lancome's uber pricey version. It does what it says and removes eye makeup gently, without a greasy feel and it doesn't burn the eyeballs like some I've tried.  For waterproof mascara you'll need to put it on a little cotton round and let it sit on the lashes for a few seconds to dissolve the mascara but it works pretty quickly and you won't ever have to scrub at your lashes. I always forget to shake it and it still works for me :)  Affordable, gentle and effective.  Finally a product that actually lives up to its claims!""Removes even waterproof mascara. Effective and gentle No oily residue Dermatologist developed This dual phase 100% oil-free liquid activates when shaken to gently whisk."""
1,NO complaints here! I say buy this one . Its a great hairdryer. and I go thru them. SO good product!!
0,"I was eager to try this after such high recommendations. I was hoping it might help get rid of the post-acne red marks on my very pale sensitive skin. Unfortunately this was waaay too drying (even for my relatively oily skin) and gave me a terrible reaction right away. It made me break out in painful rash like bumps on my face. I think I must just be allergic to AHA...I know it works amazingly for others, but just wanted to share my experience."
0,"Who are these people giving this product 4 and 5 stars?! Are they spokespeople or employees of the company? I bought this product from Walgreens for the expensive price of around $13 (around the same price for two of these here on Amazon). I used it twice on the same day, and unfortunately it gave me the same chalky-white face look that many people complain about in many sunblocks. I did discover people's perception that zinc oxide was the culprit for the distasteful white-face look. I wasn't aware of that before I purchased this. On top of that the moisturizer was non-existent. My face was really dry when I put this sunblock/moisturizer on my face and hours later my face was still dry. I so wanted to like this product, especially because of the potential benefits this product supposedly offers as purported by the company from providing 24-hour moisturizing effects to an oil free and non-comedogenic sunblock that doesn't clog pores and break my face out with pimples to UVA and UVB protection with at least 30 SPF.  I want all of these features in my sunblock, but the white residue this sunblock leaves is so undesirable."
1,"This is a great foundation if you're looking for a lighter coverage. I wear this in the Fair shade, and it blends very well with my skin tone and looks incredibly natural. I do like the matte Bare Escentuals foundation better than the original, because my skin is a bit oily and using the matte foundation helps prevent a bit against shine that can build up during the day. I would never wear this foundation without a primer, though...otherwise it wears off super quick. Still, it's easy to apply, it looks great, and I would recommend it."
1,"I have been searching for an overnight moisturizer other than vaseline or eucerin's aquaphor. I feel these products don't last as long overnight compared to this Jergen's cream. It is an excellent overnight cream, although be warned, it does not absorb quickly so you might find your hair getting stuck to your face. A little annoying but I think this is necessary to provide a lasting barrier to keep your skin moist throughout the night. I use this on top of an acne treatment and it has been working very well.What alarmed me when I received my tub though is that it was not sealed! I was hesitant to use it at first but just crossed my fingers and I'm glad I took the risk. It smells very nice too!"
1,This anti-wrinkle cream takes a long time to work but it is a really good product and it has SPF 15 which is a plus.  It goes on really well and doesn't cause breakouts. I really like it.
1,"It gave me the impression that my scalp was been treated as it should to prevent dandruff. It smells like remedy. However, no so sure if it was really really effected in my case. Perhaps I should use it more."
1,Im so glad I ordered this brush. It works perfectly with BareMinerals or any other powdered makeup. The price was also great!
1,"This has harsh ingredients, but it proves worthwhile to use if diluted. I use this product diluted with water in a smaller portion bottle.I use it focused on my scalp. It cleans well, smells nice, and can be stretched. It's super cheap (walmart $1.50 for 30oz), easy to obtain, and sold in bulk, and doesn't dry out my hair if diluted (never tried it full strength).Water (Aqua), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Ammonium Chloride, Glycol Distearate, Fragrance, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Citric Acid, Ammonium Xylenesulfonate, Propylene Glycol, Tocopheryl Acetate [Vitamin E Acetate], Isopropyl Palmitate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Silk Amino Acids, Honey,, PPG-9, Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract"
1,"There is a reason why this shade (Taj Mahal) is so popular. This is now my holy grail of blushes. You only need a small amount to achieve a beautiful, healthy, golden glow. This color compliments all skin tones and looks amazing on the skin."
1,"I used to use the Aveno tinted moisturizer but it started drying up and getting old and i never got around to replacing it. I did try the Garnier BB creamhttp://www.amazon.com/Garnier-Miracle-Perfector-Light-medium/dp/B006WVCF1I/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1390887635&sr;=8-2&keywords;=garnier+bb+creamand hated it. Looked great but smelled horrible!This Aveeno BB cream has basically no smell, none that i noticed anyway and i usually do. Gives a nice dewy glow. Love it!"
1,Great product - just received it today and it is just as described. Sturdy built and high quality bristles. Would highly recommend to anyone!
0,"This has been a beauty staple of makeup artists and mascara fans for years and I cannot for the life of me figure out why. I guess if you're lookin for a mascara to give your lashes a darker color and nothing more, you'd be satisfied with this. But most women buy mascara to lengthen and/or thicken their lashes and this just doesn't do that. It doesn't clump, but it also doesn't do anything else for your lashes. I really tried to give it a chance but it ended up in the garbage. Such a waste. Good thing it's pretty cheap."
1,this mirror looks really classy in our bathroom - much nicer than an &#34;accordion-style&#34; would probably look. provides a good amount of magnification for tweezing too!
0,"I was unable to take home samples of the Philosophy cleanser, and let the SA talk me into the $30 set of cleanser/retinol/moisturizer. First of all, I use tea tree/lavender oil in my homemade cleaners and that's the smell that hit me when I used the cleanser. Not good.It wasn't even a fresh, pleasant smell like these oils can have. It just reminded me this is what I spray on the toilet.So-so cleaning power, and it made my skin feel a little like I just hadn't gotten it all off. When I used a washcloth to get that coated feeling off my face, then my skin was tight and dry and ITCHY. Red and itchy, not good for acne prone skin.It also left that toilet-reminding-smell behind on my face to taunt my nose the rest of the night.I have used a ton of skincare products during my lifetime and this rates down there for me. If you cannot try a sample first, at least make sure you buy it from a vendor with a return policy in place. JUST IN CASE you are in the minority who don't like it."
1,My skin: dry in the cheeks and oily in the t-zone. Prone to irritation.For me this has been a great toner (2nd bottle). The fact that there is no alcohol keeps it from drying my cheeks and it hasn't promoted oiliness. ( the aloe helps with that). There is also no burn or sting when using.It has more ingredients than I would typically want but surprisingly it hasn't caused any irritations. I use this morning and night. I also use Earth science cleansers.
1,This product has a very fruity scent which is great for the spring.  I love it.  I will be switching to this product this coming spring.
1,"I went on a product-kick to find solutions for my super oily face and this is my favorite product I've found. I also bought de-slick spray from Urban Decay and Basis face wash but haven't noticed a big difference from either of those (Urban Decay's complexion prep spray is much better than the de-slick spray, FYI).This product REALLY cuts down on my oil issues! You can wear it alone for some light coverage and to feel clean when lounging around or wear it over/under makeup to stay looking matte much longer. If you've got super oily skin, you need this. Don't expect all your problems to be solved.. you'll still need oil blotting sheets and your usual methods, but I find this to be a big help. For under $5, you can't go wrong!"
1,"I really haven't noticed much of a difference in pore size from using this product alone, though other products in the Pore Refining line work really well to this effect. What I love about this toner, though is that it doesn't dry out my skin at all, and it leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth. I do get fewer blackheads and blemishes when I use this product. Recommended."
0,This clay mask doesn't do anything for my skin. and also it has a funny smell. I don't recommend it.
1,I really like this lotion.  It has a dreamy scent (but I'm obsessed with lavender).  I only wish it was a little less expensive.
1,I use makeup sponges to put on my base. These sponges are large enough to easily smooth over your face. It is much harder to over-apply your makeup using these sponges.  I obsessively keep a few in my makeup drawer so I don't run out. Clean it with soap and water.
1,"I have sensitive skin but even I felt that this was too gentle. I wasn't sure it was doing anything so I ended up scrubbing pretty hard. On the other hand, it really is &#34;extra gentle&#34; so maybe I just purchased the wrong intensity."
1,"This oil is nourishing to my skin and is a great smelling way to complete my shower after I towel dry. I am saddened that Amazon no longer offers this product on Subscribe and Save. After getting a bottle every month at a great price, now I am looking elsewhere to stock up."
1,"good, nice smell, seems like it works, I use it every few washes and after I get my hair relaxed."
1,My friend recommended this oil for dry cuticles but it is very good for the nails too-makes them grow much stronger!
0,"I absolutely love this product. it doesn't dry my skin like it did to other reviewers. but, after about two weeks of using the product, i noticed the expiration date. It expired in 2005. that was SEVEN years ago. (It is Dec 2012 now)."
1,I've been battling acne for years now and this is the best face wash that i've ever used so far.
1,Yeah this is rad. Feels so nice and silky on my skin and there's no greasy reside. The smell is also quite pleasant. This really helps with SUPER dry skin without being overkill.
1,"I've been using this cleanser for about a week now. I really like it, it leaves my face feeling really clean. I have acne-prone skin and it hasn't really helped clear it up like I had hoped. But perhaps over time."
1,"Good Comb, was actually too big and the comb is really wide, my guess is that this would work well, not as well on really thick natural hair."
1,"This is by far my most favorite gel. Every month it's in my shopping cart at my local Walgreens. It does leave your hair hard like most gels, but it does keep my flyaways down and smooth. I only use it for the edges and sides of my hair to keep it smooth, flat and frizz free. It's some great stuff!"
1,I have bought the little sizes of this oil at the various salons and it is very convenient to have a larger size.
1,I got this for a friend of mine in france I hope she likes it.  Im sure she will.  I love opi and its a real pretty color.
1,"I stumbled on this not long ago after several years of avoiding SLS shampoos and now wanting to avoid bottles and the expensive non SLS products, which are also hard to find. It seems hard to believe that this product works that well and lasts so long-but it does. My hair feels better and softer, I hardly need to use conditioner-and I have extremely thick, coarse hair. I know the bar looks small and I cannot comment on how long it lasts as I have only had it a month, but after a month of using it 2-3 times a week, it doesn't seem to have shrunk. I have a feeling it may last many months. Of course, I don't wash my hair every day anymore, which incidentally, most women with longer hair should not do anyway.I love the product and it's almost like a brand-new lifestyle after using bottled shampoos every day for years-which only damaged my hair. Anyway, it seems so odd at first to use a bar of soap on your hair, but this really works well."
1,"if you buy with eSource Wellness never regret I love their customer service everything they sell is good and cheap, I love the technical support for client were always given me any problems and if ahy they resolve without any inconvenience"
1,"This is a good brush if you have long hair, especially if you tend to leave some hair in the brush.  Because of the spacious rows, it is easy to clean, so your brush is as good as new every time you use it.  It also massages your scalp, which promotes blood flow to the scalp."
1,I like this blush a lot but have found other mineral products in retail stores much cheaper that work just as well.
1,"Every man must have this cologne! it smell, so clean, fresh, I'm in love with this cologne, buy it! you won't regret!"
1,"I rated this a four because although it states it is permanent, it does not last more than 6 weeks. I was surprised I got 6 weeks out of it. It may not have all organic or natural ingredients, but I like that it did not burn my hair or leave it frizzy. I used the entire package to color grays in my bangs & crown of my hair. It colored the grays very well. I would like the manufacturer to have a recommendation about how often this should be used, since it is obviously not permanent & I don't want to use it very often for fear of burning my hair. Most hair color lasts 4 to 6 months before you have to color again; so it would be nice for them to inform customers about how often they can use it."
1,"Macks is one of the all time classiest red polishes available.It is red but not too red, dark but not too dark, seems to go with most anything.Lovely shine and finish!"
0,"This has a really awful, medicine-ish / herbal smell that reminds me of dandruff shampoo or men's deodorant. I only used it once, though, because I disliked the smell so much. So I'm not really sure how well it works in the long run."
1,"holds my stuff, just the right size for my safety razor, brush, stand, shaving soap block, extra razors, pre-shave, and aftershave (yes a bit of a shaving snob). I even have space for a toothbrush and toothpaste, and some hair gel if I would like.Has a nice zipper pocket on the inside of the flap that is lined in plastic so you can place wet items like a toothbrush inside without it leaking."
1,"This conditioner wasn't as great as all the reviews I read . I am Native American and had very damaged hair at the time of ordering . I guess if your hair just needs a little tlc you could use and would probably help but it did not help my hair , I still had to do a ton of different treatments to get my hair to where it is now ."
1,"I miss the Yardley Gimmerick paintbox that my big sister had in the swingin' sixties. By the time I was old enough to have my own, they were gone from drugstore shelves. I've looked for watercolor eye paint ever since, but nothing came close. This is one of the better eye lining paints, however. Easy to blend with a wet brush. If you but a bold line on, use a clean damp shadow brush to soften it for a smoky eye."
1,"I use it every summer and I'm 50 years old. It's maybe one of the best cream to apply under a liquid foundation or a bb cream. Even when I don't wear make-up, I apply it in the morning and don't use sunscreen unless I go outside for many hours. It doesn't give a firmness to your skin, it just prevent new wrinkles to form. I use another cream at night that is for firmness. Creams are just to avoid the worst, not to do miracle.The only thing I would say is that a retinol creams, it includes Roc Retinol Correcxion Deep Wrinkle, aren't made to use on an irritated skin. After a face scrub, a sunburn or if you have redness on your nose or cheeks, you might want to avoid using it. It doesn't help. I recommend it for a day cream, that you wear make up or not. It's a good anti-wrinkles, it will protect you from the sun (which is the most damageable for your skin) and will be a perfect base if you apply make up. Not recommended for reactive or very sensitive skin."
1,"I originally bought this product because I needed a few dollars to push me into free shipping and figured it was something worth trying. I have to say i'm very happy with it, my skin always feel great after using it, I'll likely be buying it again after I run out but with tiny amount needed to use this stuff the jar will probably last me a year."
1,"I have extremely dry skin, especially in the winter.  I have tried a lot of other oils, but this is my favorite so far.  It has a nice, light scent and does a good job of moisturizing.  It does make the tub a bit slippery, but that's the only fault I've found."
1,THIS IS SO EASY FOR ME TO APPLY EVEN WITHOUT GLASSES  and it dries in seconds so you can apply the rest of eyeshadow
0,I have used before and ordered Suntan but this time Suntan is a strange color. I will return and try to order color again hoping it will match.
1,"cool water was/is my number one pick for everyday wear.. but Hugo out did cool water wit this one.. smells sweet but not girly,perfect balance of sweet and fruity."
1,This face scrub feels great while you are using it and my skin feels softer after using. I love it
1,I like the product because it really works on adult skin.  It doesn't over dry and it works super fast
1,"My mom used to crimp my hair when I was a kid and now that I have a daughter, I want to do it for her. This takes a long time to heat up, like 10 minutes, but once it is heated up it works like a charm. Ive had issues with straighteners where if you put it too close to your scalp it will burn you, this isn't like that. The plate is well inside the plastic edging so it won't burn my daughter if I touch her scalp with it. I flew through her whole head in 5 minutes and she loves it."
1,"After years of dyeing my hair black, I find it's nearly impossible to go lighter when the mood strikes me. Normally I go for the box bleach. When that fails, to Sally's for some 8-10 levels of lift bleach with a 40 developer. When THAT fails, I turn to this.By the time I turn to this product, my hair is so damaged it stretches. So the fact I can use it and still have any hair left speaks to how (comparatively) non damaging it is.It is still bleach-like. It did bleach my roots to a bright brassy yellow. It did froth up and smell like bleach, and bleach my towel. But whatever it has in it removes color that regular bleach won't touch, without being TOO damaging. I've tried Color Oops! which is slightly less effective, more gentle, but MUCH more time consuming.I have had the best results with using Color Oops! first, then this bleach-like solution over it. I was able to get my bleach-proof black to a copper penny red with one application"
0,"I have read good things about this brand and finally took the plunge to buy it. I normally use tresemme naturals and it works great but this left my hair feeling dry and had no slip to it. I really wanted to love it but didn't do a thing for my hair. Maybe because of the protein, Im still open to trying other products from this brand but not to this particular conditioner."
1,PCA always has great products. The Acne Cream is great for spot treatments coupled with PCA's Protecting Hydrator and PCA's Facial Washes.
1,i bought this for my daughter! she is only 8 but i am a hairdresser and she is always very excited about hair :)
1,"Lives up to the hype!  The color looks really bright in the compact, but not when you put it on.  There is a little sparkle, but it's not noticeable unless you have a heavy hand.  Very flattering color!"
1,This cream is just too thick for my face and I am using it on my hands.  I tried it around my eyes and on my neck and it just started falling off in gobs when I rubbed my neck.  Gross.  I will not put it on my face again and will just use it up as hand cream.  I might mention that I am a 65-year-old boomer babe with oily skin still and don't have wrinkles yet and didn't want to get them.  I would rather get wrinkles than have this thick stuff or the greasy lotion on my face.  Both are good for the hands though and people can tell your age from your wrinkled hands too.
1,"I love this face wash! It has a great scent and is made up of organic, natural ingredients! Would recommend to anyone!"
1,"It's official. This is the only brand of dye I will allow near my head now. I've dyed my hair at the salon before, henna'd, bleached with the Ion Sensitive line, and they're not as easy, affordable, and painless as Naturtint. Salons are expensive, they don't get the color right at first shot, smells really bad, takes a long time, and their products burn my scalp. Ion Sensitive line sort of hurts still, and smells so bad. Naturtint is painless, smells like mild and nutty (a bit like fresh coconut), and gets the color right at first shot without damaging my hair as regular dyes. I am Asian with naturally black hair, and the Ash Blonde takes me straight from black to light ashy brown without all the hassle. Totally worth its weight in gold (and more!)"
1,"I've used this product for more than 10 years and could not do without it.  It is light and softens the skin in such a pleasant way, never leaves a greasy feeling, and has almost no fragrance.  This bottle lasts years and years since you don't need but a drop to cover your face, neck and chest.  Highly recommend."
1,"I have 30 years old, white female. Had acne all thru my 20s, it's clearing up the older Im getting but this moisturizer has been a LIFE saver. I have tried so many other products out there, Simple, Clinique, Coconut Oil, Oil of Olay, etc... and nothing worked. They were too greasy, too smelly and caused breakouts or over drying and made my skin feel tight. Read many reviews on this, purchased this at my local Walmart and have been IN LOVE with this ever since. I use before my makeup every morning. 1 pump is plenty- apply to face, let dry (5 mins or so) and then apply makeup. I use a Neutrogena Night cream as a night moisturizer, but this would work fine too! So happy with this. No break outs, leaves my skin feeling wonderful and just enough moisture to NOT be oily! Deff reccommend this as a try! : )"
1,"I absolutely love this stuff. It is good for many different minor skin irritations such as cuts, scrapes, boils, blisters, hang nails, irritated cuticles, acne etc. I purchased this to quickly heal up acne and it really did the trick. It won't work to prevent acne or stop it from happening. It will bring the pimple to a head much faster and allow the wound to heal after it has been popped with minimal to no scarring. Sometimes, it even seems to dissolve the acne with no painful pinching, poking or popping! I've also used this on blackheads with great success."
1,"In terms of how well this gets the job done, I would say this product is 3 stars.  It doesn't get as hot as my pricier Conair (both are the same watts), and it is much heavier.However, I guess it is not really that reasonable to expect a hairdryer this cheap to perform as well as a hairdryer that is 10-20 dollars more.  You can definitely use it to style your hair, but it might take longer.  Considering the price, I would say this item is a 4/5.I mainly bought it to use it at the gym/for travel.  It is a good spare dryer but I wouldn't recommend using it as your main dryer."
1,My Estrogen was 644 should be 60.....I finally feel like the Old me! It's be amazing for me!PLUS...I paid 28.00 for my 4 ounce size at whole foods!This is 8.00 bucks LESS  for 8 ounces! Y-E-A-H!
1,"These are good for when I have eaten a fattier meal. I take the 125 mg from the same company if I have eaten a basically low-fat meal. I continue to buy both strengths.The only down-side I have noticed is that my cholesterol levels are higher by using this product. Normally, the body 'recycles' some of the same bile that you currently have, and by doing so it uses up part of the cholesterol that goes into making the bile. By taking bile supplements, your body does not have to 'use up' cholesterol to make bile, and thus your cholesterol levels will go higher. Don't know what to do about it though, as I have no gallbladder, and really need bile (at a meal) to digest fat-soluble vitamins.UPDATE:I have gone to the 500 mg, and use only that strength for my meals containing fat, as I have gone off a vegan diet, and gone to Paleo, so I need the stronger amount for the fat content now in my meals. I am doing very well at this strength. I do occasionally take the 125 mg for meals containing just a tish of fat."
0,"Neutrogena has altered the scent of its ""Refreshing"" aka Classic Rainbath formula, probably in an attempt to make the product more appealing to women.  What was once a clean, soft and slightly musk fragrance has been replaced with a sweet, grapefruit-citrus fragrance with a floral character.  Compared to the product I've used for over 20 years, this Rainbath smells different when you use it and when you rinse it off - now the fragrance left behind after rinsing is flowery and powder-sweet, not clean.  It has some of the character of the old fragrance, but is considerably changed, so much so that I suspect most men who used it previously, as I did, won't be using it anymore.  I have not confused this product with their other, ""Revitalizing"" scent, which has a pronounced grapefruit fragrance.  This is their so-called Classic, but it is no longer classic.  Why couldn't Neutrogena roll out a new variety, rather than ruining an old and popular one?  Wanted to let everybody know so you wouldn't waste your time and money buying something that isn't what you expect.Update 12/09: Called Neutrogena twice (long story) about the formula change.  The CSRs avoided the topic of ""formula change"" as if they'd received training in enduring torture.  In other words, they would not admit that the formula is changed.  What they would say is, ""We're sorry you don't like the fragrance.""  Then they asked me to describe the fragrance, and what I thought of it.  They asked many in-depth questions about it, like, ""Would you describe the fragrance as being 'classic'?""  ""Would you describe it as luxurious?"" ""Describe what you smell,"" etcetera.  I asked them in reply, ""Why didn't you do market research before you launched the product?""  Then, without my even requesting it, they offered me a cash refund for the product I'd bought (I've already received the check).  The best part was when one CSR accidentally started to say ""How would you describe the new--I mean, how would you describe the fragrance of the product?""  It's clear that Neutrogena has made the decision to deliberately deceive its customers by rolling out this product while claiming they haven't altered it.  Along with the check, Neutrogena sent me a $20 coupon for any product, but there's nothing I want."
0,This glue did absolutely nothing to my lashes.  I rather use the lashes on their own without the glue since that sticks wayyy better.
1,"I only bought this for my meditations and to add a little bit of it to my pillow at night so that I could get a good night sleep. i can't say that the scent it self helped with either one, but mind over matter right? All I can really say is that the scent is very good and it did relax me a bit."
1,Good brush. Use it with my Solano hair dryer for curls. But end up having to use curling iron anyway. Probably my hair type. good product.
1,It's a little bit dry after I used this masque. Guess better not use it too often. 1 time per week will be fine.
1,I've been using Sauve's line of shampoos for probably about three or four years now. It's the only shampoo that can really manage my oily hair. Would recommend it for anyone with hair like mine.
0,"I have combination skin and this dries it out to the point of being painful. I didn't notice any difference with the appearance of my pores, which are still big. I suffered for nothing."
1,I love Palmers Cocoa butter anything/ it smells so rich and feels super silky. I wish I could fill a tub with their cocoa butter moisturizer. it will make you smell like chocolate.
0,"I really love Oil of Olay products and have used them for years and years. I was once at the H20 store in downtown Chicago and this young, black guy who worked there had the most beautiful skin. I asked him what he used and he looked around the store to see if the coast was clear before saying, ""Oil of Olay. Although I probably shouldn't tell you that."" I have used Oil of Olay ever since and had great results.My problems comes in with this Serum. I feel like I am putting something terribly bad on my face. Oil of Olay's products tend to fill in the lines with mineral oils or silicone, which once absorbed, do a great job, but similar to Blistex---your skin becomes addicted, and if you stop using the product, you skin goes to rubbish.My great friend swears on coconut oil for a million things, including facial moisturizer. I decided to use the Serum for two weeks and coconut oil for two weeks on different parts of my face. The side with the coconut oil had better texture, tightening and my skin looked a lot more readiant. The serum made my skin look good when on, but out of the shower it was a little 'eh'. Coconut oil is also about $10 cheaper and will last forever.I am not saying that is for everyone, but I find that the best products for rejuvenating my skin and hair have been coconut oil based and that is a really great find when you are paying at least $20 for a couple ounces of Serum."
0,"This is like all the other JUNK that all the companies are allowed to sell for big money that do NOTHING at all but moisturize the skin and if that's all your after then you can buy that a whole lot cheaper anywhere in the world.I find out they don't ever ever ever test real people to make there outrageous claims of miracle reverse aging with lines and wrinkles. They use a test square of some kind of skin and look at it under a microscope and evaluate it from there.They don't want to test real skin or real people, because they'd not get the results they want I guess,  so they find a way to make phony results  that our corrupt government lets them make up to lie, cheat and steal the public blind with.I used it exactly right, and it did next to nothing at all but make my bank account disappear rather than the lines."
1,"This product removes hard skin like magic!  It does not require soaking the feet either, nice and easy.I gave 4 stars in stead of 5, because the skin on my hands were starting to burn as I worked on my heels.  So you might consider putting on disposable gloves if you have wimpy hands."
0,"Retrieving these requires gymnastic ability that i sadly do not possess. They are also very messy to remove. I tried them because i have a dermatological sensitivity to rayon, but no. In the trash and done. Never again."
1,"Love this brush for touch up areas before I put on the entire face , swirl, tap, buff.... LOVE BARE MINERALS!"
1,Can't report on how well it works cause I've only been using it for a week.  Will report back in a couple of weeks. Received it on time.
1,This is the second bottle of Grace that I have gotten and I love it.  I have not used it as a shampoo however ~ only as bath wash.
1,A good product good value.  It works as well as some of the really high priced department store brands.  I would recomend this for night time and day time use.
1,I've recently tried Nars sheer lipsticks and adore them.  The sheer coverage it pretty -- they provide enough color pigment to make a difference but not too much so they are more versatile and can be used almost as a lipgloss.  This color is gorgeous -- a deep berry color but sheer enough that you don't feel like you're wearing much at all.
1,"Seriously, between my eyes, I see a huge difference when I use these.  I can forget for a few days and then, WHOA, I am back on them.  They stick nicely and come off only when I decide to take them off.  They work by immobilizing the muscle...like botox but naturally letting the muscle become lax because it isn't always being used...the anti-workout.  I use them all over my face where I notice expression lines and am a huge proponent.  I am too broke for botox, but honestly, these work just as well for me.  I am 42"
1,i have small eye lashes and not too full. this mascara leaves my lashes looking full and the color makes the see thick..it dosnt separate my lashes to the point where they look like a rake.. and after the mascara dries my lashes feel soft
1,"Excellent hair item! It makes my curly and course hair looking softer and more manageable. I've used Friszz  Easse by John Freida and were happy with result. But Redken anti-snap expected my expectation. Whether you leave this with your damp or dry hair, it works both ways, softer and easy to shape your curls. Will order for more!"
1,I use this moisturizer and I love it. It works wonders for my skin and it smells amazing as well.
1,"I like this cleanser, but didn't realize it contained parabens until purchasing.  I like to be cautious about parabens as it may not be safe and could cause cancer.  I'm going to finish the bottle, but won't purchase again."
1,Really like this shampoo because hair feels extremely clean and stays clean longer than most shampoos I've used. Fragrance free is a must for me and this product couldn't be better.  Highly recommend.
1,"Majik- I know the product says &#34;A deep and earthy scent with a touch of sweet.  Myrrh adds a rich sweetness and amber brings a touch of spice.&#34; But most amber scents are sweeter, this is spicy almost peppery. I'm not in love with it, but I think my Mom would like it. So I'm giving it to her as a stocking stuffer.I do however love how long the scent stays on you, I put some on my wrist a while ago and as I type I can smell it very well! The scent definitely reminds me of the holidays because of the spice, almost like a yummy burning candle or wax diffuser. I would love the scent as one of those, but not as my perfume. But we all have different taste! I think it's a good quality product."
1,Anais Anais smell's really good. My girlfriend and her mother love the smell of this Cacharel product. Highly recomended it.
1,I used it I could see a difference in the coloration in my face. It was much brighter and toned. I don't really care for the smell but at least I don't smell like alcohol
1,I have been using this product for years. It covers under eyes and makes your eyes look a lot bigger.  It also is great for covering up little imperfections on your face. I could not live without it.....
1,"I really cant tell a difference in this product, have been taking it daily, it arrived on time as expected, that is the only reason I gave this a three star, other than that, it deserves a one for product. doesn't work,"
1,I bought this for my husband who has skin allergies.  He uses this as a hand soap in the bathroom and kitchen.  It lathers nice and doesn't dry out his hands.
1,"I have certain perfumes for certain occasions. This I use before working out or when I'm feeling sporty in general. Smells &#34;eh&#34; in the bottle but smells damn delicious on the body. A classic, clean scent."
1,"Softsoap Milk Protein and Honey is my favorite hand soap by Softsoap. I wash my hands at least 20 times a day. I am a germ freak. I don't get sick that often, because i always wash my hands. Softsoap is the best hand soap there is. This is my favorite kind of brand. I won't buy any other brand of hand soap. Softsoap always gets my hands clean."
1,"I have very tempermental skin and most over the counter face creams/products bother my skin or don't do jacksh*t. The first night I used this, I woke up the next morning with a new face. Swear to god. My skin has since built up a tolerance to retinol, so it is not as extreme, but I can still tell the difference of when I don't use it. Would recommend this to anyone with dull or aging skin."
0,"I am usually not sensitive with the smells.  I am talking about I was never bothered by the Selsun Blue Shampoo smell or even the Blue bottle of Head and Shoulders and they are pretty strong (that medicated smell lingering on your scalp).  BUTTTT...this shampoo is over-the-top smelly and after three days, I could not stand that burning rubber stench on my scalp.  I totally understand it's made partly with tar but I am sure even if you aren't phased by the smell yourself, others might go..""Whoa"".  On the first or second day, after a trial/change of shampoo, I would feel my hair or scalp ""feel"" a bit better (not 100%, but FEEL).  I felt like my hair smelled really bad and scalp got a bit more inflamed but that could just be me, individually.  If you are out of options beyond the usual scalp treatment shampoos, give it a try, it might work for you.  The smell was obviously the factor to say NUH UH for me.By the way, I didn't experience extreme dandruff (the type that flakes all over clothes).  I just noticed for the past days, my scalp had patches of red and it was sort of scaly and it had a tad of itchiness.  It could have been some weather changes or something but I am better now after going back to the usual OTC dandruff shampoos."
1,"I purchased this item about a year ago; however, being the product junkie that I am, it was rotated in and out between my other oils and not used consistently or exclusively. I have only recently returned to using this again  because I am currently on a castor oil challenge in which you have to incorporate the use of this product into your hair regiment at least 3 times a week. Initially I went steer crazy with it and I was putting it into my pre-poos, my deep conditioners as well as sealing my hair with it after moisturizing it. All of that proved to be WAY TOO MUCH as I was a greasy mess!!! I have since tapered back, and have decided to go the rest of my castor oil challenge using it to oil my scalp on wash days, use it in my deep conditioners and massaging into any areas of my hair which I feel could be improved upon either growth-wise or keep my hair soften. I like my hair to feel moisturized but not greasy to the touch if you know what I mean, and you can easily go overboard with this product as a little goes a long way! With my first use of this I found it to be VERY, VERY THICK, so I thinned it out by mixing it with olive oil (50/50)and that has worked well for me. Also when I use it to seal my hair on wash days, my hair feels very soft to the touch (can't keep my hands from out of my head) and has a nice shine to it. I'm hoping that with this 90 day castor oil challenge that I am currently on, I will get some additional growth (since this is what this product has been praised for and my hair only grew 5 inches the first year of my transition before I cut off the remainder of my relaxed ends. I am currently using it along my hairline and nape by rubbing it into those areas, 3 times a week, so wish me luck. BTW I am completely natural, with type 4A/B, collar-length hair."
0,This works for everyone but not for me. Made my face worst and I'm still dealing with that. It burned and I followed instructions
1,"it feels good when you use this for at least 2 weeks 1.7 oz its too small, It was on time and well packedNext time I will get the big bottle"
1,"I tried several brands already, all faking in the afternoon. I have used this for a week. It is ""water/oil proof."" Great product in an expensive price. Great."
1,I refuse to spend $20+ for a small amount of high end product. This works just as well. I went swimming with this on and it did not flake or smear. You get a TON of product for the price. I've had this over a year...use it almost everyday and it's still going strong. Some people said it was hard to get off....eye makeup remover or just baby oil seems to do the trick just fine. I would recommend this product to anyone.
1,This does as is advertised.  I use to use Avena lotion but that product was discontinued.  This seems to work just as well as the Avena product.
1,An aesthetically pleasing round brush that retains heat and works well. I'm into it.
1,"I am a fan of Neutrogena products.  So, when I was looking to find a new astringent (I used to useBiore Blemish Treating Astringent, 8 Ounce), I went with this product.I was disappointed with it though.  It was strange because it felt a little oily (which I actually felt was good because it meant it wasn't going to dry my skin), yet it still managed to dry my skin. Within a few days, my skin was drier that it has ever been.  I only used it once a day, yet it was enough to make my skin start flaking.  I stopped using it after 2 weeks, and it took a week after that for my skin to recover - after applying multiple layers of moisturizer throughout the day.  This was so drying that my right hand (the hand that I used to apply the astringent) was also totally dry.  The skin on part of my palm and my fingers was flaking off.Despite my experiences, I am still giving this 3 stars because if you are someone with oily skin and suffer from acne, this would probably be fine.  I can see this working for teens, especially.I think that I am just at a point (translation: getting older, haha) that I don't need anything as strong as this for my skin.  I have ""normal"" skin and don't experience a lot of break outs, so I ended up going with an alcohol free toner, also by Neutrogena, instead (Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner, 8.5 Ounce.  It works much better for my skin type and needs."
1,I got this conditioner to go with the shampoo they make.  I do like the fragrance.  Fresh.  This conditioner does not make my hair smooth enough to get my tangle out.  I use it first and then use a bit of my usual conditioner so that I am not tearing out my highlights after washing.  I did notice a bit of thickening of my hair shafts.  My hair did seem a bit fuller.
0,"Sorry but I have to give this product a low rating for pretending to be something it isn't.  Sorry, but this stuff smells nothing like lavender.  It smells like a chemical cocktail.  The ""parfum"" at the end must be the part that makes it smell like chemicals, but don't expect anything resembling the smell of Lavender.  This is closer to the smell of Tide with bleach.  I'll use Jason toothpaste but their soap isn't ""clean""."
1,"Technically, this hair color is supposed to fade over time/shampoos, but be aware that it really doesn't all that much. I have light ash-brown hair with some grey, and I used to color it black until that began to look too harsh against my older skin. Then I moved to a dark brown and now I'm slowly changing to this light brown. A full changeover in shades takes about a year, so you do want to lighten the shade you use very gradually if you wish to avoid the appearance of horizontal bands of color. These semipermanent dyes are great for making this sort of transition, rather than springing for a full salon changeover in color and damaging your hair in the bargain. But you have to be patient, and make sure you don't get your shades mixed up!Pecan has slight reddish tones, but not as pronounced as the other light browns in this line. One nice feature is that the color does fade a little with shampooing, and so you don't get as a pronounced a light-roots effect in between colorings."
1,"This hand cream is a good healing hand cream.  I have my hands in water much too much, and this is a good choice for daily use."
1,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS NO ALCOHOL THAYER ROSE PETAL WITCH HAZEL FOR SOMETIME, NOW. IT IS VERY GENTLE AND I USE IT TO REMOVE MY MAKE-UP. I CAN USE IT TO REMOVE EYE MAKE-UP, TOO. IT DOES NOT BURN OR STING AND IS VERY GENTLE ON YOUR SKIN. IT'S A GOOD PRODUCT TO HAVE AROUND."
1,"I love this lip balm! No flavour, verymoisturize and SPF15! Perfect! It's a bit expensive though. Never mind! I'll purchase again."
0,"The product information says that it may cause some irritation, and it did.  I'll try using it once or twice a week, but I need a moisturizer I can use every night, so I won't buy this again."
0,"I have purchased this color from the store before and it came out great, a deep, bright red.  But when I ordered it on amazon, NOPE.  My hair came out an ugly brown (my hair was already a medium brown).  The mixture went on red but my hair didn't come out nowhere near that color, and that usually happens when the product has been sitting forever.  Yes, I left it on the recommended amount of time."
1,"This is my 2nd jar and I love it. I work out and eat right, and by adding this it adds that little extra firmness. At first I used it day and night, now I use it almost every morning after a shower and a few nights a week. I sometimes feel like im washing it away if I take a shower at night after applying so Ill stick with mostly once a day."
1,a little strong for my likeing.  really dried up my skin and lines appeared more visable.  I will not re-purchase.
1,I have always been a fan of Mane and Tail products. They make th hair feel healthy and manageable. Hat is off to Mane and Tail!
1,I am fair skinned so I wear brown lashes and the black glue to way to dark for me since I don't wear black liner.  This glue dries clear.  Put it on the lashes and wait about 30 sec until it gets tacky and then apply.
0,"Keeps my skin smooth and hydrated out of the shower and my husband loves the smell- I win this round.UPDATE- After using the product a few more times, I realized that I Do NOT love this item. If you don't really rub this oil around, it kid of gobs up on the skin- my towels needed to be washed right away and I don't know, it kind of trapped my body heat in- I didn't like the way it made me feel."
1,"Essie's Fishnet Stocking is just perfect. It's red. It's not glittery, shimmer, or satiny... it's just RED. A very refreshing and no nonsense bold crayon-like red. It's approach to nail color is what I'm really loving about the Essie line. All Essie colors that I've tried are darker on your nails than in the bottle... consistently too. Like most of the other colors, this shade is heavily pigmented. My last 3 manicures were in this color. That's how much I love it. It's classic, it's basic, and it's not one of those shade you really had to be in a particular mood to wear. Best of all, I can wear it without being constantly reminded of Christmas."
1,"On my oily eyelids (I know I know, they say I am blessed because oily eyelids = less wrinkles), but when one ends up with raccoon eyes over and over after trying gazillion eyeliners, one tends to forget the blessings.Glad to have found it on Amazon, because all the local drug stores (no matter whether  in CA or OR, where I spend most of my time) seem to run out of this particular product first!Women must know and appreciate this wonderful eyeliner and snatch it right when it is delivered to the stores.It does require some practice to put on just right, but once I got it, I never want to go back to other eye liners.Also, as somebody else already mentioned - take care not to put it on too thick, it will then flake (well, any make up when piled up too thickly will flake.The only con that I can think of is that it thickens up before I can use all of it, but this seems to be the case with my mascaras too.  Maybe I do not use it often enough?"
1,I have very dry skin and normal toners sting and dry out my face.  This is light and does not sting at all.  I have been using it for 2 years and wouldn't use anything else
1,"This smells amazing, and it's worth using the rest of the bottle for that reason alone.After using this, once my hair is dry, my hair is very soft.  I'm not sure I've noticed any lasting results, though.I dislike the spray-pump applicator, as it gets tiring trying to get all your hair wet spraying it like that.  If it were a trigger sprayer I'd appreciate it more.Overall, I probably won't be buying this again."
1,I use this when I feel a migraine coming on due to ovulation. I tried to use it for a month straight but it caused a very painful menstruated cycle. I will continue to use prior to ovulation along with Advil to relieve some of my migraines.
1,"I love and live by this tool. I have been using this since I was in junior high and I am now 27. I have a layered hair cut, and this gives me he right amount of curl in towards the face that I have always loved. It smoothes my hair, gives it bounce and body, and gives me the layered around my face look. I love it. It makes my hair look so much better than any old hair dryer and brush combo could. I have always gotten compliments on my hair, and I always attribute it to this hair tool. It is my beauty secret, if you will. It is something I will never be without. I use it daily and my hair is still healthy, so I believe it is less damaging than a normal curler. I can't live without it.I took off a star because these things do not last long at all. Some break within 2 months, some last almost a year. I've been using these for so long and I have gone through a tone. However, I have yet to find a product that compares with my hair, and I can usually pick one up for fifteen to twenty dollars, so I feel it is well worth the bargain.I should also point out that I only always use the stiff bristled brush that comes with it. It combs out all the tangles and locks them that way, so it leaves the hair great looking all day.I also do find that after the initial curling that my hair relaxes a tiny bit through out the day, but that just makes the curl and body look more natural.I have also had my hair all different lengths from hitting just at my shoulder to down the middle of my back and have always used this - no matter then length, it always smoothes and pefects. It's a wonderful tool, even if it doesn't last long. Although, it might not last because I use it almomst daily!Also, I would like to point out, I often switch between different types of shampoo/conditioner, from Pantene, Tresemee, Pureology, Biolage...and no matter which type I use, I always get the same results...from cheap to expensive.Give it a shot for salon perfect hair!"
1,"Like the shampoo, this conditioner is great, my hair is so soft and full after just one use.  I wish I could find it at local stores"
1,This is the only body wash that has cleared up my skin. My breakouts are slowly going away. I have used this for two months now. I plan on to buy more. It smells great too. :D
1,"Frownies work!  I've never written an Amazon review before but after using them, I felt almost obligated to let EVERYONE know.  I have the '11' lines on my forehead.  I also have the nose-to-mouth lines (Marionette lines I think they're called).  At first, I only used them on the 11's.  After the very first night, I awakened, removed them and voila!  The lines were gone! By the end of the day, however, they had reappeared. Well, Rome wasn't built in a day, right?  So, I continued to use them every night. And after about 1 or 2 weeks (sorry, I wish I had recorded exact timeframes), they STAY gone the whole day.  I missed wearing them one or 2 nights (not in a row), and they still stayed away.  I believe they're a 'keeper' which means if you want the lines to stay gone, you'll have to wear them religiously at least every other night.  I'm not married, so I don't have to worry about a husband not liking that.LOL...  Oops!  I almost forgot to mention my Marionette Lines.  I started using them on the nose-to-mouth lines about a week into using them on the forehead.  I hate these lines most of all. They seem to add 10 years to my appearance.  So again, after one night! Yes, ONE NIGHT, the M lines were vanished.  Just as with the 11 lines, I at first saw a reappearnce by day's end after the first few nights, but now, they stay away.  I don't want to be without them.  BTW, don't waste time or money on buying separate Frownies for Marionette and for forehead.  I only purchased the forehead ones and also use them on the nose-to-mouth."
1,This really works well to clarify. It doesn't strip my hair and make it dry at all. I use about twice a week since we have hard water and I use a fair amount of product.
1,"THIS WORKS! Years of Horrible Peeling Fingernails Healed. I had tried just about everything over the years, but this actually worked. Followed the directions with clean nails (swab with alcohol to clean well), added one coat per day for 4-5 days, removed and repeated. After about six weeks nails had grown out most of the weak or damaged nails; then used two coats once a week with color polish. I have a vertical split on my right thumb that is slowly improving, but all the other nails are in good shape. Must moisturize 2-3 times a day to keep nails & cuticles healthy. I just use almond oil with lavender oil added."
1,"I have been using this product for 6 months. This product does work, my skin has lighten by 1 shade and brighten leaving me glowing. After my bath i put this lotion all over my body. You must keep using it over and over again to see results. The problem with lotion and creams is I get tired of rubbing it on. Lol."
0,"L'oreal makes many hair color brands, The Superior preference brand is just TERRIBLE to apply.  It is extra runny and watery.  I could not stop the dripping and I have been coloring my hair for 20 years.  I'm very careful and do it in sections but this is not a cream type like the excellence is.  It was literally dripping off my gloves after I put it in my hair.  I never had a problem with any other hair color product and not even by L'oreal.  This formula is way too watery!!!  I never had so much drip to the floor ever before.Always buy the cream kind, or the mouse.  This stuff is terrible!!  :(I swear the good reviews must be for the L'Oreal Paris Excellence Preference and not this.  The boxes look almost the same.Boo on how runny it is!!!!"
1,"I'm just growing my hair out and I purchased this and two other colors.  I'm thrilled to be going gray...tired of all that dyeing, etc. This product gives a shade of gray that evens out my colors while my hair is growing out.  And, it's a styling mousse.  I alternate between this color and #41 and #52"
1,I highly recommend this product.  I love Olay and love it on my skin.  It's great for under day cream and night cream.
0,The liquid is more like Elmer's Glue all! It doesn't come out of the container in liquid form which would make it easier to apply.
1,"I received the product in a timely manner, however the Polish is very thin and takes a couple coats to become opaque. I'm not sure if it's just polish or if it was thinned out for some reason before being sent to me. Either way, I'm not completely satisfied with the Polish, but it did arrive on time in good condition."
1,"Beautiful! A pinkish coral color. I love love love this polish, I bought two just in case. You may need a few coats and it isn't the fastest drying nail polish but the color is to die for!"
1,I've been using this product for about eight years now and it works great for me. I have very sensitive skin and it doesn't dry my skin out and it does a great job at removing all the dirt and make-up from my skin. It's not for acne and blackheads but it keeps my breakouts under control it's a great morning and night cleanser to use. Or you could use the 'Clean & Clear morning burst facial cleanser' in the morning and this at night.
1,"I used the LIGHT COOL BROWN number 14. I would say it is more of a Dark Brown. I have a fair complexion so this looks really BAD on me.It colored my gray, but my hair has this un-natural look. It looks like I have a cheap halloween wig on my head. I dyed my hair and its turning the color of the brass fixtures in my bathroom, and I wanted to use a cool tone to balance the RED, so it wouldn't look so brassy. EVERYTHING I use turns my hair red. I am not going to fight it any longer and just go to the  salon and have them color my hair Auburn.With this product I would start with the lighter colors  and experiment that way. I would use it again just a lighter color. Don't use the color refresh btw."
1,I've been using this stuff as a moisturizer for months and I love it. Now I can save some money and get it delivered to my door.
1,"Clean. fresh scent, timeless, soothings and sensual.  I have received countless completments on this product.  I cant live without it."
0,"This cream will give you acne if you have sensitive skin.  Instead of buying a cream, I tried a vitamin C serum.  That has worked out perfectly.  I so wish I didn't try this and get the horrible acne breakout from it."
1,This saves money on all those exfoliating creams which seem to run out too quickly. I use these gloves (they are very course/ rough) on my legs with body wash or soap.
0,"I read the reviews where people said they couldn't smell anything. I took a chance and ordered anyways, thinking they must have had bad noses or had actually got used to the smell. I ordered two bottles. The first was okay. It didn't smell musky to me at all, just slightly earthy and very sweet. It was weak, and only lasted minutes on my skin (and my skin tends to hold musky/spicy/earthy smells well). I asked several family members to smell where I had rolled it- nothing.The second bottle...I almost want to say it was just vegetable oil, but it had a slight burnt rubber smell to it. Maybe it was a bad bottle, I dunno, but I wish someone had smelled it before they sent it to me, because it was obviously something wrong with it. Even the texture of the oil felt wrong, if that makes sense.All these reviews really got me hopeful, and I'm so disappointed. I would send them back if I actually had the receipt, time, and energy to do so. I just had my first daughter and the post office is so far away! Argh!"
1,"If applied over wet skin right after the shower, it helps seal in moisture.  It has a lovely almond-like scent.  The scent is not very strong and does not clash with perfume."
1,Bought this cream as I like a lot of the Hydrox skin line but this one really didn't impress me.  I love their toner though.
1,I bought these for my wife.  She seems to be very satisfied with the product.  It makes her happy.This is exactly what I wanted.
1,It is a little harsh but I suppose that is the nature of the acids.  I don't use it every day.  But it compares favorably to other similar products I have used.
0,"Like most of Mrs. Meyer's stuff the scent name and actual scent don't match. This one smells like bug spray and honestly I can't wait to go through it so I can have a different smell in my kitchen. I bought the Parsley hand soap and it smells more like honeysuckle than this does. Too bad I bought 2 bottles of this stuff. Maybe I will find someone with no sense of smell, or someone who likes the smell of bug spray to give it too. Pee Eww!"
1,"This comb is perfect for my curly hair, combing it out when wet is so important to prevent a mess of tangles. Also, once it's dry, it's great for adding a bit of volume by back combing."
0,"Everyone has different skin, but mine tends to dry out and get easily irritated.  I thought Neutrogena On-the-Spot would be a good solution because of the lower concentration of benzoyl peroxide.  Unfortunately the product made my skin red and flaky, so much so that it is taking a few days for my skin to get back to normal.  I usually have pretty good luck with Neutrogena products, but I think I'll be getting my skin care items elsewhere."
0,"I recently replaced all of my personal care items with organic versions, and tried this shampoo for my long hair. I do not recommend. It is very drying, and the essential oils in the shampoo left my scalp terribly itchy. Within a couple of days of ceasing use of the product, my scalp returned to normal. Acure Organics are much more moisturizing."
1,"My first Nars blush and I understand the hype. Great texture, and pigmentation. I'm in love with this color, a terracota kind of peach. Lovely."
0,"I hate this comb. I have 4C hair that is &#34;natural&#34; that is really thick and longer but still this comb is terrible. It snags and feels like it is going to break with each use. If you are very, very, very careful and slow you have nothing to worry about. So maybe if you are detangling after a good wash or deep condition this might be of some use but for me I don't even use this comb anymore as it pulls out my hair and is big and not sturdy. A well built wide tooth comb would be better, I will not be buying this product again. It is useless and just sits under my sink after I have found my old wide tooth hand comb. Doesn't work well with my daughter's hair either though her curls are not as rough as mine and silkier."
1,"I always use a hot air brush after my frizzy hair is 1/2 way dry. My old 1 is on it's last leg so I got this one. I used it  twice and I do like it , it work well, but as long as my old favorite 1 works I will use it.i"
1,"Purchased for my daughter flaky, itchy scalp. This shampoo calmed and cooled her itchy scalp. Would purchase this shampoo again."
1,Men...if you have large pores that get clogged up this is for you.  I started using this two months ago.  It will keep your pores clean and open.  After just one month I found that the pores on my nose were staying open and actually seemed to be slowly diminishing in size.  I have this as one of my many subscribe and save items... so I know it will be a good price and I know it will arrive with all my other sub/saves on the 1st of every month.
0,"I am an avid nail polish collector, most of my collection being Essie, OPI and a few China Glaze.  I bought this one cause it seamed like a very popular pale, light, delicate pink.  But the formula is too streaky for my taste. As much as I love Essie, I don't particularly like this one."
1,"Suave shampoo is one of those products that I've used for most of my life. I've tried more expensive shampoo over the years but keep coming back to Suave simply because it works very well and it costs very little. Usually I'm a huge proponent of the 'you get what you pay for' way of thinking. However, there are exceptions that prove the rule, and this is one of them! I usually switch the variety each time I buy more just to keep things interesting, but aside from that, I've been pretty much using Suave for 15+ years.That said, I have short, uncomplicated hair that's only dislike is conditioner (it makes parts of my hair stand on end for no apparent reason). I don't do much styling aside from a littleFiber Molding Cremeto spike the front a little bit, so my shampoo needs are probably not as complicated as someone with long, curly hair. For a guy (or woman with short hair) this stuff is perfect and does exactly what I need it to: clean my hair. It's worth trying even if you think you might not end up loving it, simply because it's inexpensive, so if it doesn't work out, you've lost nothing.For the price, I can't find a shampoo that is as good. This is straight up the least expensive but highest quality shampoo out there. Recommended to anyone without complicated hair, for use with kids, or as an alternative to more expensive shampoo that does exactly the same thing."
1,A first class product with a first class price because of its high quality for ease of use when utilizing powder foundation!
1,Is this a good base. I recommend them as making a cost analysis and quality is this basis that best goes to my taste.
1,"After reading so many glorious reviews on this product, I finally decided to give this a try..I had been having alot of trouble with adult acne, and couldn't seem to find anything that worked without overdrying my skin~until this! This toner has left my skin so soft and moist, all while controlling my acne.  This used in conjunction with Derma e anti wrinkle face wash has gotten my complexion back to beautiful!"
1,"While spring cleaning, I came across my old Buf-Puf handle.  I had forgotten all about the Buf-Puf and how good it works.  It was wonderful to see it still being sold.  Besides doing a super job of keeping your skin clean, it also is great for using if you have been outside in areas with ticks.  Years ago, I would visit a wooded area, where there were deer, and pick up tiny, tiny ticks, without knowing they were on me.  It was only after scrubbing with this body sponge, that I would see the itty-bitty ticks caught up in the Buf-Puf.  Then, I would just rinse them down the drain.The Buf-Puf sponge I received this week is just like the old one--same shape, same size.  Thus, it fits my old Buf-Puf back scrub handle.  I'm really glad I kept it, since Amazon and every other place online seems to no longer have any ""Buf-Puf Back Scrub Body Sponge with Reusable Handle"".  Besides having a white side to scrub your skin, the body sponge also has a ""tougher"" blue side to scrub your feet.  I had forgotten, too, what a nice job it does on summer feet, when shoes are worn only when absolutely necessary."
1,"I have been using these facial sponges since I was in my 20's, so about 30 years!  Lately they have been harder to find.  In the past I used them every day when I washed my face.  Now I use them twice a week.  They are especially useful on the days I have used sunscreen to help remove the gunk.  They last very well and I usually use one pad for about 6 months or so if I only use them on my face.  Also use them on my arms and legs before the use of artificial tanning products to exfoliate my skin, they are awesome for that!  Be sure to use them gently as they could irritate your skin if you were to enthusiastic ."
1,"Perfect amount of moisturizer, my skin is normal but I just felt like I needed a little bit of moisture so I tried this and it is the perfect amount.  Not greasy, not too moisturizing... just the PERFECT amount.  I use it at night after I wash my face and in the morning after a shower with a sunscreen and it's great.  I will be ordering more when I get low on this and you don't need much.  GREAT BUY!!!!"
1,I have tried SO many shampoos out there and most either don't work at all or the fragrance is SO overpowering and awful it makes you sick! This shampoo . . . over the years my hair has thinned to the point that I was considering a wig. I found two things: Biotin (a vitamin) which I think is helping and this company. I love this shampoo - it loves my hair and makes it look wonderful. I can't say enough good things about it . .
1,"I am in my mid-20's and have had mild inflammatory acne since my early teens. Over the years I have used a number of different topical benzoyl products to keep it at bay, but none of them ever totally eliminated the problem. Then I picked up Clean & Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser at the grocery store, and after a few weeks of daily use I haven't had another breakout and most of my preexisting acne has healed as well (woot!).Obviously I am very happy with the results that this cleanser has produced, but to be perfectly honest I don't really care for the product itself. It's VERY thick, more of a paste than a liquid really, which makes it difficult to lather and rinse off. It also stings my eyes no matter how carefully I avoid getting it near them, and the menthol sometimes makes my face uncomfortably ""tingly"" and raw afterward. Moisturizing is also a definite must when using this wash because it WILL dry you out no matter how accustomed your skin already is to 10% BP products (but honestly, moisturizing is a good idea regardless of what cleanser you use).In the big picture these issues are really a small price to pay for clear skin and I have every intention of continuing to use this product, but they are irksome enough that I had to give this cleanser 4 stars instead of 5. My recommendation is that if you can find a more pleasant face wash that works for you, get that. If you are fed up with persistent acne and are ready to pull out the heavy artillery, buy this stuff."
1,Arrived fast and actually works. It worked wonders on one of my favorite but old and thick polishes!
1,"I was pretty happy with the regular hold of this hairspray but wanted to try the super hold to see if it was better and it is. I have not had the dusty experience others have and I find that it really holds the style throughout the day just as well as the synthetic stuff, even through a workout. I am really happy with it. Go Aubrey!"
1,"I have a problems with sleeping, so I started to use a lavender body oil at night. It helped me with relaxation and I fall asleep much faster! I ordered pure oil this time and it smells good (even though lavender it`s not my favourite smell).I`m gonna use it to balance my mood, for skin (for blemishes or add few drops to a face masks), for skin burns, insect bites, headaches and menstrual pain- 5 drops for a 5ml of a baby oil etc. It is better to use it on the skin diluted with water as it can irritate a sensitive skin.The company is great too-shipping is fast and I got 2 samples of their other products."
1,"What a lovely deep blue.  As usual, the formula is the SHIZ and you gotta love the OPI wide brush!"
1,This is a great fragrance if you're looking for something that wears off nicely. It isn't too over powering and has a nice scent when it wears off.
1,"I was using cotton to separate my big toe from the toe next to it to prevent them overlapping.  These little gel spacers are so much more comfortable.  I did not realize they come 2 in a package, and ordered 2 packages, so I have a couple of extras--and I can probably find some kind of use for them.  I ordered the large size, but they do seem a bit bulky, so I will order the small size to see if they fit a bit less obtrusively."
1,I am a NARS fan and I love this blush! Terrific color! Use it every morning and it stays all day.
1,"I still get headaches when I wear these, but they aren't as bad with these as with the regular ones.  I try to position the ends farther back than they already go and that helps a little more.  The hair doesn't slip on these, so that's nice.  However, they are very brittle and I've broken quite a few of these."
1,SMELLS SWEET AND NICE LIKE A GIRL.... D D D D D D D D  D D D D D
1,"I purchased the Neutrogena Pore Refining Toner and was pleased that it did not sting and was not drying to my skin. My pores do appear to be smaller and my skin looks smoother. In the past, I have used toners that made my skin turn red and irritated, but after four weeks of using this product have not had this problem. This product is reasonably priced so I can afford it. I plan to continue using this product."
1,I love the way this smells and how it clears my poors. this is great for a once a week home treatment. i just wish it was stronger on blackheads.
1,Gave to my grand daughter as a stocking stuffer. She couldn't wait to use it. Didn't even have to reminder her. Neutrogena makes the best products.
1,"It smells like burning fur, but who cares? If you're out in the middle of the woods camping, or on a forever road trip and you haven't had a chance to change your drawers in a day or two, chances are, your unmentionable areas are gonna get itchy.  Some areas are more sensitive than others when it comes to persistent itching and scratching. Vagisil allows you to temporarily relieve the itch so you can concentrate on driving or sleeping instead of scratching your parts off."
1,"I just purchased and used this body wash from Alba today. I bought it from Super Supplements for around $14. I figured the larger size would last me longer then the smaller bottle.The smell is very pleasant, and after showering with this product my skin is soft and not overdried. (Like with most organic products)I am a fan of Albas other products so this one was a must try, of course.My Husband wont mind using this one either, and its much better for him to use then Axe! ;)"
1,"This color is a muted, understated pink. There is a tiny hint of sparkle, just enough to make this polish memorable without being garish. You could wear this color anywhere, day or night, and it goes with just about anything. If you are looking for a super-bright or a super-sparkly, this isn't the polish for you - but, if you are looking for a timeless color that you don't have to change every other day with every other outfit, My Address is Hollywood is a good choice."
1,Doesn't get caught in my fine dry hair and helps detangle. Very gentle and has a good grip. Good buy
1,I use this in my bath and I love how soft it makes my skin and it has helped fade the scar and  marks I do have so I am always pleased with this
1,"I absolutely love this color. It's beautiful.The pigmentation is crazy good. I am light skinned and It looks great on me. This is a great blush for everyone, don't be afraid of the color, you just have to work with a very light hand."
1,"This product is great for strapless tops, nothing slides and it lasts all day even in extreme heat.  It washes off  easily and does not stain or ruin fabric and is gentle on skin."
1,"I used to love clear adhesive until I gave this a try. Hiding the band of my eyelashes is so easy with this dark color. I would recommend their clear version if you are using liners that are not dark. Light browns and bright colored liners may not get along with this liner glue. If you use black or dark brown liner though, this really helps hide that pesky lash  band."
1,I've slowly been replacing all of my skincare and household cleaners with more natural alternatives.  I couldn't believe that I could get 32oz of organic facewash for this price.  I filled my used up (and much more expensive) pump bottles with this since it's a refill bottle.  It cleans well and doesn't leave a residue.
1,It didn't work as well I thought it would after applying it on my oily face several times a day.
1,I started using this on my elbows which were dark and this product has lightened the area well. It also removed the blemish marks on my back.  This is something I heard about through my friend at work so I searched on Amazon for it. The fragrance is pretty. This is something I will continue to buy.
1,"This product is OK.  I purchased this because I use the Thayers Rose Witch Hazel and I love that. The pads are really thin so its hard to just grab one pad to use.  Also, it's not soothing like the Witch hazel from the bottle.  I suggest you do not waste your money and but the bottle."
1,"The first time I used this product (over a year ago), I almost cried. A hypoallergenic moisturizer that was hydrating AND brightening AND from a brand that is organic and eco-friendly?? Heck yes! It worked wonders for my dry, hypersensitive skin.However, this is the second time I've purchased this and something seems&#8230; different. It's less hydrating (I have to apply at least two layer for any moisture benefits) and almost feels itchy (although that may be due to the lack of moisturizing powers it has, not the formula itself). However, it still brightens and smells nice. I just use it in combination with another hypoallergenic moisturizer."
1,it's a light sunscreen which is good for everyday coverage.blends into skin easily.a drugstore bestbuyThe package is good for preserving the active ingredients
1,"This color is very light on my nails (I am very pale and my nails are short).  It would be great for a French Manicure.  I put on two coats, without a base or a top coat and it really lasts and is easier to remove.  Great quality."
1,"I for one, is loyal to the Denman brand as I have used their brushes for years and years. The only problem is, my family kept losing them so I had to keep getting new ones. Other than that, this brand is the best as they last forever and they the only ones able to withstand our thick, natural hair. We also have them different kinds and colors but the 9-row ones are the best."
1,"Of course I expected to get some dryness, it is expected since this product had so much dark pigment to lift.  I highly recommend for someone who is trying to go a shade or two lighter but not completely blonde.  It mostly made my roots yellow but the ends still were darker than I wanted them to be.  Still it did a great lift without breaking my hair and no horrible smells."
1,"I don't usually write reviews on Amazon anymore since it seems many who read them view them as a chance to start an online bash fast if the review given doesn't agree with their own personal opinion of the product...but, I wish I had paid better attention to the not so positive reviews of this perfume before adding it to my wish list.Anyway, I put this on my Amazon wish list because I love Glow by J.Lo and since this got so many great reviews, I stupidly assumed I would love this one too. Like other reviewers have stated, it does smell a bit &#34;grandma-ish,&#34; for lack of a better description. When I first sprayed it, it just smelled cheap.After mixing with my own chemistry, it's just ok, nothing special. At least it fades enough so that I am not one of those women strangling others near me with overpowering perfume. I have learned my lesson to first try a perfume before buying or putting on a wish list!As with any perfume, it's all about how it mixes with your own chemistry, so just be sure to try this one out first to make sure it's a good fit for you."
1,"Granted, it is the industrial ingredient standard, but What Suave has done for the knockoff is what Armani has done for the couture industry. Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo (comes in clear-Blue or clear-White)washes away the daily grime of product use and can also be used to treat swimmer's hair in a pinch. For just under $2.00 it is a real gem, and if I wasn't such a die-hard Aubrey Organics fan, I'd use it every shampoo... Like I said, it's a real keeper (and great for all hair types) !  A+/A-"
1,I have used so many creams that I cant remember all they did. I do remember this one and it felt good...I had to use alot as I have very dry skin. Minus a star for that. Otherwise a good cream
0,"This perfume is so overrated. It smells OK, the scent is not lasting and is too subtle. The male scent is far better. It is barely worn. Sorry I bought it"
1,"These caps are too big even for me and I have waist length hair and a very large head.  I have difficulty finding caps large enough in the stores except for some hot, poufy, double layered, expensive &#34;bouffant&#34; styles.  These simple, plastic, inexpensive caps would fit my needs well except that they are too large.  The caps arrived promptly and safely."
1,I bought these over a year ago and still love them.  This is something I use almost everyday.  Well made and easy to use rollers.  Heats up super fast.  Awesome set.
1,I have tried this product for the first time and not that impressed. I must say it has beautiful soothing smell and doesnt make the skin oily rather it smooths out evenly nicely on face .. but somehow it didnt show me the result that I expected to see.. may be not for my skin type( dry in winters and oily in summers) ..
1,"This is my all time favorite deodorant by Elizabeth Arden ,compared to all the other brands I have used I find this one provides me with 24 hr protection the smell is awesome not over powering .This is a cream so when you first turn it to use it some may squirt out but should only happen when you first twist it open ,This doesn't leave the un wanted stains on my clothing either as long as they keep making this I will buy it"
