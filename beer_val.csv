1," 750 ml bottle poured into trappist glass, big malt carbonated flavors of dried fruit and hop finish, small head with some lacing, reddish amber color, alcohol is well hidden in this very nice ale
"
1," NOV 22, 2004 Dark brown pour with red tinges on the edges.  Creamy, soapy head.  Aroma has a bit of alcohol and mustiness.  Flavor was complex with a definite apricot and malt flavor.  Sharp carbonation as well.  Very nice.
"
1," Bottle. No head. Colorless. Aroma is notes of glue, melon rind, mold, alcohol. Flavor is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic. Light to medium body, creamy/watery texture, flat carbonation. Not much to recommend, pretty straightforward.  Mouthfeel is somewhat silky, probably its best feature. Sweet and mild.  Bought this to cook with, based on the price and small bottle size ( 300 mL ), and got pretty much what I expected...not bilge water but not something Id drink either.
"
1," Wonderful palate. Full of all sorts of fruits & flavours. Well malted - nice and malty like a real ale should be. Excellent head and head retention, but surprisingly, lacked lacing. Cloudy, dark, hazy bottle conditioned appearance and character. Very yeasty. Lots of aroma.
"
1," JUN 26, 2005 One of four IPAs Gary Lohin made, probably about the third one to hit the market but ultimately the one thats been made in the past few years. A shame, since Star of India was the best, and Monsoon was better than this one as well. I never did get to try Dean Carrieres IPA, at least not brewed by Hagars.  Regardless, Bengal is the IPA that Howe Sound makes.  Unlike the Narwhal and ESB, its served cold from the keg.  Bright golden-amber colour.  Moderately hopped.  The other IPAs were hopped to PNW standards, this is more like to BC standards, though at the high end of that scale.  Slight chewiness from crystal malt, overlayed with resiny bitterness.  The aroma is woody hops and fresh biscuity malts.
"
1," @Rudolph Throwdown-got in trade with jtclockwork-12oz bottle-pours a foam over tan head and dark brown with red color.  Aroma is boozy bourbon, dark malt, an infection.  Taste is boozy bourbon, dark malt, an infection that shows less on the taste.
"
1," dark brown, huge head, lots of yest, and dried fruit in the aroma. flavour is all dried fruit, nice and complex, little bitter in the finish. quality stuff.
"
1," Deep red/brown colour with a big dense head, fruity aroma, with a great mouthfeel and fruity flavours. A great beer, not as good as the blue but better than the white IMO.
"
1," Just when i thought Chimay couldnt get any better, i found some vintage Chimay Bleue.  If you think it is good at first, the complex flavors of the beer come out when properly stored.  I would reccommend anyone get this beer, and get a lot of it so you wont mind sitting on some to age it appropriately.
"
1," le malt est lgrement rti, aux accents de pain brun grill, doucement caramlis avec une fine fragrance de cacao.  Les esters fruits sont modrment prsents et prennent la forme de prunes et de raisins en lgre confiture.  Lalcool, qui est peu intense, partage son odeur agrable avec des fleurs fraichement coupes.  Le got est bien peu diffrent des armes avec des grains malts qui laissent sur les papilles des notes subtilement rties, des saveurs imbriques de levure fruite et quelque chose comme des saveurs florales pices.  En bouche, le liquide, qui a une structure passablement toffe, est remu par des bulles dune grande finesse qui sont,  mon sens, un peu paresseuses.  La texture est douce, difficile  saisir, quelque fois trop lgre et souvent crmeuse.  La finale est un habile mlange de saveurs douces et complexifie par un alcool sensiblement chaud.  Thumbs up for Father Theodore!
"
1," Pours deep amber with a distinct fruit smell; hints of apple. Flavor is semi spiced with a medium body. Nice carbonation. Good intro to dubbels.
"
1," Nutty, yeast strong Ale.  As stated by others very easy to find for a trappist.  	Available at Downtown Wine & Spirits in Somerville, MA
"
1," Great appearence for the larger bottle with a great creamy taste. The after taste is just as great and to top it off it has a great large head to it!
"
1," Bottle at Yourdarklords house. Pours brown with a lt brown head. Vanilla and nutty malt aroma. Light to medium bodied with a creamy mountfeel. Flavor is like the aroma- vanilla, nutty malts, and some mild roasted malts. Bourbon finish.
"
1," Draught at the Charlotte, NC Rock Bottom location. Clear, golden with thin white head. Spicy, somewhat skunky hop aroma. Sublte grainy finish.
"
1," Poured a nice orange amber hue with a white head that had nice lace and retention.  Aroma had a strong pine hop profile, some lingering grapefruit notes.   Caramel malts give the aroma a nice balance.  Initial flavor had a hop bite, leaning more towards the grapefruit aspects then pine, but the sweet caramel malts cut right through the bitter hops giving the beer a nice balance.  Finish was dry.  A nice IPA.  Came from the beer of the month club.
"
1," bottle; dark reddish-brown cloudy with tan head; aroma-malty caramel, fruits; taste-very sweet, fruity, moderate fizz and mild bitterness. Very good
"
1," Pours a murky medium brown, nose is mildly roasty, hints of chocolate and belgian syrup, taste is smooth, rich, nice caramel, nuts, and fruits.
"
1," Pours a medium gold with decent white foam that lasts for quite a while. Thin ring persists to the end. Aroma is certainly citrus hops with a slight note of dried leaves. Flavour is full on hops. Citrus followed by a slight pot funk. Some caramel malt in there as well but this is far from balanced. Despite being a full frontal hop assault the beer is not bad. Having said that it would be nice for it to have a little more dimension.
"
1," Clear yellow with a fizzy white head. Bready aroma and a banana bread and clove taste.
"
1," Poured from a 12oz bottle into a shaker.  This beer poured a dark brownish copper color with a foamy beige head that slowly faded.  Some uneven, sticky lace was left around the glass.  The aroma consisted of a big citrus/grapefruit presence followed up by a nice caramel malt backbone.  The flavor was super hoppy, with sweet grapefruit flavors giving way to the roasted caramel, and finishing just slightly bitter.  The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with minimal carbonation.  This is an excellent brew, done in the same vein as Alpha King.  Very tasty, and vastly underappreciated.
"
1," Pours a dark purple ruby with a good head, The aroma is mostly chocolate with some fruitiness that could be cherry. The flavor is light, slight chocolate, a bit of nuttiness, but the cherry is not strong. Theres a light bit of wood in the finish, but this isnt wood aged. Something about the palate and flavor seems cola-like to me, but its not excessively fizzy. Just light-bodied and clean finishing.
"
1," Nice deep mahoghany color.  Decent head with plenty of lace.  Malty aroma.  Excellent tastes.  Im glad I tried the Bleu version.
"
1," Bottle thanks to blutt59. Murky light brown with a large off-white head. Aroma is of banana, clove, and yeast. Taste is of sweetmalt and banana.
"
1," Bottled.  Poured a deep brown color with a big fluffy brown head.  This beer was VERY malty with a very subtle hop tinge in the end of it.  Even my friend who drinks BMC swill enjoyed this one a lot.  Definitely one of my three favorites of all-time.
"
1," Buena cerveza, al principio sabe algo fuerte pero en cuanto vamos bebiendo ms, se captan mejor los sabores acentuados por un aroma fuerte a malta tostada, se bebe demasiado bien para tener 9 en general es una gran cerveza
"
1," Pours amber with nice frothy head.  Nice fruity flavor with a bitter finish.  Refreshing and would enjoy again, although would probably not actively seek one out.
"
1," Best of the red, white, and blue...this beer is slightly high on carbonation, which helps balance the plethora of fllavors that emerge..some cloves..a bit floral,,slight caramel...some alcohol..this beer has alot,,but still is easy drinking to me. Classic.
"
1," 11.2 oz bottle. Pours cloudy, red-brown color. Nice head and pleasant aroma. Taste is strong and very good overall. Very complex, with some alcohol apparent, which is not surprising for an ale of this strength. Very enjoyable and will be a regular for me I think.
"
1," FEB 27, 2005  Great Stuff.  The taste is similar to the Chimay Blue but weaker.  The aftertaste is quite pleasant.  This beer is much better in the bigger bottle in my opinion. Even though it is more money I recommend it that way.
"
1," the queen of the trappist beers ! one of my personal favourites, also. but beware, Chimay bleu has 9% alcohol ! don't drink more than 2 or 3.
"
1," Dark reddish amber with huge tan head. Lightly spiced yeasty nose. A well made beer be the overabundance of yeast combined with the alcohol heat spoils it for me.
"
1," Bottle. Appearance of head was two fingers frothy white that mostly diminished. Nice lacing. Body was light cloudy with partials in flow. Color was murky brown. Aroma was caramel, apricot, yeast, toffee, other notes of fruit, banana, light toasted, nuts. Medium bodied with a soft carbonation. Light dry texture I thought. Flavor was light sweet with good balancing bitterness. Sweet and again slightly dry finish.
"
1," Delicious.....hints of fruit...terrific finish.....light head, dark brown, a bit cloudy in appearance.
"
1," Very light and clear with not much head. No aroma and the flavor is of some malt but not much hops. Really light.
"
1," Mid-sized, slowly vanishing off-white head, deep golden coloured, sweet bisquity nose with traces of alcohol; solid bitter-sweet flavour, medium to full bodied; heavy sweet-malty finish with a good dash of bittering hops in the aftertaste. Quite good, well balanced Doppelbock...........
"
1," JUL 25, 2009 Re-rate. 750mL bottle. Proper temp this time, made a world of difference. Reddish copper colour, medium head which dissipates into a lingering small head. Very rounded mouthfeel. A bit of warming alcohol. Yeasty notes, and a dryness which evolves into sweet fruits in the aftertaste. Could be ""bigger,"" but very very nice.
"
1," If the white and blue caps are better I just might stop drinking anything that isnt Chimay...
"
1," Dark brown, creamy ample head with lots of carb. Smells of caramel, yeast and bananas. Rough and creamy with a pronounced malt aftertaste.
"
1," Actually not too bad.  Malt aroma with slight spicy hops.  Moderate bitterness with slight lingering aftertaste.
"
1," Picked up a bottle of this to fill out a mix-a-six because I ran out of other stuff that I actually wanted to try - after I saw the ratings, I realized my folly - oh well, time to suck it up - maybe its because I was expecting garbage, but this is not all that terrible - hazy amber - faint lace - very malt heavy in the nose - caramel, toffee, buttered toast - some earthiness in the form of damp leaves and soil - flavor is very malt forward as well - caramel and toasted bread - sticky malts and herbal, tea-like character - earthy hop flavor, but very low bitterness - finish is a bit harsh - okay, so maybe it is kind of bad, but not bad enough to keep me from drinking this whole damn bottle.
"
1," I find the smooth hoppy flavors very irresistible...I keep coming back to this bottle several times a month.  What can I say, say no more!
"
1," It was, disappointingly, not blue.  A little cloudy.  I didn't care for the appearance.  I can't imagine a better smell.  It's just right.  It's what I compare all smelly beers to.  It's a strong taste but nice - not overbearing.  It's a weird beer I like.  The taste lingers, but that's pleasant.  Nice and bubbly.
"
1," An excellent beer. Since I love the premier so much I was expecting a bit more. Nevertheless, a great BSA. Very full-bodied, dark fruits, some spice. I get hints of licorice, cloves, and chocolate. Complex and awesome.
"
1," bottle poured to a Trappist glass has a yellow amber in color with steady slow carbonation and a nice thick one finger head with terrific retention. aroma has sweetness, floral yeast, banana, white grape skin, nutmeg, and fruit. really a yummy nose and looking great in the glass. mouth feel is medium light with active carbonation and thick frothiness on the tongue. flavor has some bitterness cutting out the sweet from the nose but plenty of yeasty floral spices. sharp with alcohol coming through and becoming increasingly bitter as it warmed.
"
1," Bottle. Pours black with a quickly dissipating coffee brown head. Aroma has strong notes of bourbon with underlying oats, coffee and a bit of bitter chocolate. Flavor is hot with bourbon as well and the notes listed above again take a back seat.
"
1," A great Belgian strong ale.Alcohol is very evident. The nose will smell many complex flavors going on in this bottle. A nice malty but smooth taste on the finish but by far one of the best belgian ales on the market. A great beer!
"
1," strong taste.  Goes down smooth though and has a rich bitterish aftertaste.  also expensive.  drank two of the 750ml downtown one night and got blasted.
"
1," Aroma de nozes, carbonatao alta, adstringente, creme denso e consistente.
"
1," My least favorite of the 3 Chimays. It is very good but sweeter than I hoped. The pour was a deep dark brown (looks like Dr Pepper) with a puffy off white head that leaves quickly. The aroma was yeasty as a good belgian should be. The taste was yeasty and spicy but the maltiness was  little too overpowering. Saying it is my least favorite Chimay is still saying alot, but I was hoping for less sweetness
"
1," Reddish Brown color, citrus floral lavender aroma with sweet notes, grape fruitiness with maple smooth flavour hints of some spice and nut.	Very nice beer
"
1," Bottle. Clear brown with a nice off white head. caramel, molasses and hop aroma. Thin carbonated palate. Caramel flavor with a hop finish.  Nothing special.
"
1," Tap at the brewpub. Nice amber pour with thick frothy white head that leaves heavy lacing. Great aroma, I got hit by the resinous, piney hops up front, then something a bit more peppery and a solid caramel aroma that comes up from behind. Taste is quite bitter and spicy, lots of peppery hops, some lemon flavors and cookie dough sweetness. Carbonation is quite lively which leaves the palate quite refeshed. Apparently inspired by SN Pale ale, it is definately american tasting.
"
1," t pours nicely and visually resembles iced tea. It has a larger head than the other two Chimays, but fades faster into a nice off-white ring of foam. The aroma from this beer is one of barley and fruit. It has a fascinating, smooth, dry taste. As it hits the mouth it starts off being very carbonated, but quickly fades into a dry, fruity, caramel-ish taste. The aftertaste is amazing and leaves the hit of barley and apricot behind.
"
1," Draught at the brewpub during Noogfest.	Clear gold with a thin white head.	Slightly floral hop aroma with a bit of fruitness.	Clean dry finish.	Servicable brew, perhaps some stylistic flaws, but they dont weigh much here. Not bad for a simple Pils.
"
1," I was slightly disappointed in this.  The head poured nicely, but not much in the way of ""complexity"" in aroma. Slightly fruity aroma with some hoppiness pepper in the nose.  Bubbly and fizzy on the tongue, but taste was somewhat average.  Malty, carmel with some heffe-like spices mixed in, but very faint.  I was expexting to be ""wowed"" with all the hype, but it's just ""very good"".  I drove 22 miles to find it, but I won't go to that trouble again.
"
1," From a 12 oz bottle courtesy of a trade with Erik in Indiana, this poured a rich black with a big foamy tan head with lots of thick lacing.   Nose is very strongly chocolate, some coffee, and just a hint of the bourbon barrel.  Medium and slightly creamy mouthfeel. Flavor is roasted malts.  Finish is dry and very mild.  Nice stout.
"
1," The 25.4 ounce amber bottle poured a beautiful, clear reddish amber beverage with a creamy ample off white head that was entirely lasting and left beautiful lacing on the glass. The aromas were fruity and spicy with green apple, apricot and pepper standing out. It has a nice medium body, not overbearing. The carbonation is smooth and the texture is lightly dry. The flavor starts off lightly sweet and fruity. Within a few moments a nice tart dryness develops and the two balance each other lasting through the long warming finish.
"
1," Red/brown color, nice head that dissipates leaving an attractive film of bubbles on the surface and the side of the glass. Molasses, honey and soy aroma-Chinese BBQ. Moderately sweet malty flavor and lively on the tongue. Dryish finish with some malt sweetness, and light aroma of alcohol from the empty glass. Pretty good, but I'm not really wowed by it.
"
1," When I poured it out into the glass, the subtle brown tint and fine film reminded me of iced tea. It also had a slight golden tint to it. The beer itself is pretty opaque and formed a pretty minimal head in my glass. This beer had a very large bouquet of fruit in the smell. It was overall pretty citrus-y with a mix of orange and lemon smells in it as well as a small hint of the hops in the beer. Once I tasted it, the smell of the fruit obviously right. It produced a slightly woodsy taste to it (almost reminiscent of cedar). It also had an aftertaste of the hops and barley. The beer was also extremely carbonated. Also, of note, the combination of the carbonation, fruits and the sweet flavors almost made this beer seem like a wine. The progression of flavors and textures in the beer made this probably one of the smoothest beers Ive ever had.
"
1," AUG 9, 2009 	Date"
1," 12oz bottle. Pours dark brown with a medium foamy brown head. Aroma is of toasted malt, oak, vanilla, dark fruit, chocolate, and alcohol. Taste is of toasted malt, dark fruit, and vanilla. Has a small presence of bourbon and oak. Has a very faint hop character to it. Mouthfeel is sticky but very watery. What a dissapointment this beer is. I couldnt detect any bourbon and very little oak in the flavor. In fact, its hard to pull much flavor out at all. A very bland experience. The aroma was very promising, but the taste didnt deliver much at all.
"
1," Translucent and cherry lacquered brown in color with a creamy, cohesive tan layer as the head, and brilliant, blanketing lacing.  Nutmeg, prunes and plums begin the wafts up the nose, complimented by cinnamon, brown sugared raisins, cloves, pepper and subtle cocoa powder.  Commanding palate spanning presence at the onset.  Cocoa beans, nutmeg and chocolate donut powder form a sweetly spiced array.  Tobacco, cinnamon and prunes formulate the most pervasive flavoring traits.  Dried, fallen autumn leaves give an earthen dimension while plum pudding interjects one final dark skinned fruity-sugary suggestion.  Sweet and encapsulating mouth feel.  Glowing resonance at the throats tip at the outset, followed by chocolate covered figs in the finish.  Tasty stuff.
"
1," SEP 21, 2010 Copper color with a full head. Aroma is a little fruity, some berries, but mostly bready malt aroma. Flavor is pretty yeasty, slightly hoppy, and ""old"" tasting. Delicious...
"
1," Amber color with a slight beige head. The taste is a malty sweetness with nice balance. Interesting notes of spices.
"
1," Bottle. Dark brown colour with a large off-white head. Spicy aroma with notes of yeast. The flavour is malty and some yeast with hints of fruits and spices. Nice medium-bodied dubbel...it is what it is...
"
1," Dark tawny brown color with a creamy head and light lacing (standard for brewpub samplers here). Lots of sweet caramel malts in the aroma and the flavor is a tad unbalanced, could use more bitterness and maybe some diactyl to add more nuttiness to this. A decent brown, but nothing exciting. Cookie cutter indeed.
"
1," On tap at Big River Grille, Nashville.  I dont know...I feel there was something wrong here.  Taste is off while aroma and appearance are good.  I need to retry this sometime.
"
1," Chimay Bleu is my favorite beer of all those that Ive tasted. The smell, the taste, the look--it is the epitome of a great beer. Absolutely delicious. $8.97 for a 750ml bottle over here, but Id rather have one bottle of this than a thousand of Budweiser.
"
1," had this at Pianos bar on NYCs lower East side.  Wasnt really drinking too critically, but some dark dried fruit is noticible on the palate.  Perfect for sipping though and went down smooth and soft.  Nice ale that I could drink all night, but at $8/glass, I limited myself to one and switched to black and tans.
"
1," Dark brown, creamy head. Caramel, fruit, very balanced dubbel. I like it a lot!
"
1," Poured into a Chimay chalice. Head was not too thick, aromas of raisins and plums were prominent. Initial flavor of malts that ended quite suddenly, maybe it was still cold when I drank it. Still a nice beer.
"
1," From 75 cl bottle. Nice and chewy. Background notes of vinuous qualities, but not sherry-like in any sense. Crisp on tha palate. Caramel malts are strong. Maybe a little too dry in the finish.
"
1," Big bottle at the Electric Factory (another great value).  In your face, overpowering frothy pour.  Once settled, I detect a hint of earthy and mustiness in the aroma.  Dryer and thinner than the Rogue Dead Guy.
"
1," JUL 2, 2009 My first beer to rate. 750ml 2009 Grande Reserve blue label. Tan color long lasting head. Dark amber body with a pleasing light smell. Slight malty taste which I could enjoy anytime of the day. I think I going to enjoy tasting beers better than wines!		Cheers!!
"
1," This was actually a pretty decent brown ale.  nutty like walnuts and almonds (are what i got) and nice perfect brown color but not as much head as i would have liked to see.  amd was there some vanilla going on or was it just me?
"
1," 22 fl zoz bottle, courtesy of fiulijn. Pours clear and golden orange with a small white head. Aroma is fruity and slight spiced to dry malty. Spiced, cinnamon, cardemomme and herbal. Nutmeg?. Dry and malty flavoured. Slight bitter and dry spiced finish.
"
1," Bottle courtesy of bu11zeye. Thick brown pour. Smells of chocolate malts and spicy coffee. Taste has some sharp chocolate and coffee malts. Not bad and leaves the drinker with a solid remembrance.
"
1," OK Xmas beer. Sweet, possibly too sweet. Spicy, but not overspiced. Malts are toasty, with sugary notes of honey, nuts and caramel. Hops are subdued, with very subtle hints of grass and flowers. Cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg are noticeable, but theyre not necessarily excessive, as mentioned. Alcohol level is low, especially for your typical Xmas beer. Overall, its a pleasant and relatively easy-to-drink beer suited for the holidays.
"
1," Muddy brown color. Luxurious head of large and small creamy bubbles. Tenacious webby lace work. Yeasty floral aroma with roasted malt accents. Complex fruit and malt flavors. Alcohol is hidden well. Yum.
"
1," Interesting - you dont see many tiny brewpubs carrying a cream ale.  I was interested to try it, and was pleased to see that they chose a nice spicy hop to balance out the malt profile.  Interesting.
"
1," A dark, dark, really dark beer. Big head, audacious to look at. Aroma is odd and unexpected in a fantastic, wine forward way. First hit on the palate is very much wine, fruity, tart, and somewhat tannic.  After  few seconds, the rich choclate and toffee of the beer comes forward with just a slightly bitter finish. Definite sipper.
"
1," SEP 24, 2007 Had two samplings in the same day. One was a small bottle and cant say that I had the same impression as from a jeraboam from 01. YUM!! The differencewas remarkable. The smaller bolttle (750) had much sharper notes while the big boy was absolute nectar. Wish I was back sipping on it. Even three jeraboams wasnt enough for the crowd I was with - sigh.	(and rating whilst drunk remains a great pleasure)
"
1," Tap, EPCOT, 3/04.  The tail end of service for this special beer, according to the server.  Looks more schwarzy than stout-like on the pour--not much head, pretty black, but thin looking.  Aromas of light roast coffee, light slightly burnt diner coffee, and bakers chocolate.  Light texture is spot on, little carbonation present, thin body on finish.  Roasted malt presence is pleasing with a bit of a surprising hop bitter back end.  Not bad stuff.
"
1," Poured from a bottle into a Chimay chalice that came in the boxed set. Tall foamy head that lasted about thirty seconds; a little shorter than I expected. Tastes of raisins, and old bananas, with a little bit of an alcoholy aftertaste. Nothing too overwhelming. Paid around $5 for the bottle, would gladly pay again.

"
1," Light amber in colour. Old tyres, rotting wood and a touch of ashtray. Not good.
"
1," Picked up a single 11.2 oz bottle from Cellars Wine & Spirits in St Paul, MN. Pours a hazy golden dark brown brew with a thick fizzy off white head that slowly dissolves to a fine film. Very nice lacing. Aroma of dried apricots, banana bread, caramel, and a little bread dough. Taste is highly carbonated, medium body and some acidic taste in the back of the tongue. Finish is sweet, creamy and slightly bitter.
"
1," On tap at 30e PINT bokbierfestival.  Coffee and caramel tastes. Cloying mouthfeel. Syrupy. Hints of chocolate and plum. The lacing is quite good. Enjoyable.
"
1," bottle, thanks to bu11zeye, dark brown with white foam, fruity wheat aroma, flavors of cherry, wheat, pumpernickel, vanilla
"
1," Bottle in Brussels. Unclear brown - offwhite head. 	Raisins. Fruity. Yeasty. Dried fruits. Dark bread. Phenols. Sweetness. Light nutty. Light metallic aroma. Ok.
"
1," DEC 12, 2008 [bottle] Pours a dark cloudy brown with a medium tan head. Very pleasant roasted nose with a hint of malty sweet. Sweet taste with a nice warm finish. Very smooth mouthfeel with a sweet aftertaste.
"
1,"  ripe dark fruits, caramel malt, slight spice through a coriander/orange sweetness.  Taste is again dark pit fruits, bittersweet chocolate notes are apparent, with a spicy or peppery front and a slight bitterness in the after.  Smooth and nicely carbonated.
"
1," 500 ML flip-top bottle in Germany. Dark pure with a fine short last light brown head. Malty, burnt chocolate taste, sweet and sticky. Fine palate of the same. A nice beer to say the least. Bravo
"
1,"  Gravity fresh @ Pig's Ear Festival, East London.  A number of brewers are labelling their fruity soft milds as porters. This is one. Soft yeasty aroma. Fruity with just enough acidity to justify the porter label, but only just. Pleasant enough.
"
1," Aroma is delicious! Fruity apricot aroma with the creamy density of the head similar to champaign bubbles. Very smooth and fruity taste with just a slight bitterness and alcohol kick.
"
1," From the bottle it pours with  huge frothy off white white that quickly diminishes to just a sparse lacing on the surface of the beer. Orange-red colour with some suspended yeast haze. A toasted bread-toffee aroma with some earthy-sweaty notes. Toffeeish taste with some clovey-dried spicesand an alcoholic warmth and a balanced malt sweetness-hop bitterness in the aftertaste.
"
1," JUL 25, 2007 A delicious beer. Very strong and full bodied very nice beer. Not in draft to find in Belgium so wonder where you can drink it on tap. Tasted the 1982, 1983, 1984 edition on 33 cl versions and the 1997 version in 75 cl version. Still splendid beers. Only the 1983 version was tasting old. the 1982 version was much better
"
1," This is the Budweiser of Belgian Beers, ony because it is sold EVERYWHERE.  Bananas, Caramel & roasted malts.  I dont thinks monks make this stuff anymore, just oversee the chimay brewmaster
"
1," very plummy, malty and round flavoured, which makes you expect a fatter and fuller body than you actually get. but i dont mind the lightness. a bit on the bland and sweet side, but there's nothing harsh or wrong with it - one for drinkin not thinkin.
"
1," Draught. A clear gold with a large white rocky head. A sweet malt nose, slightly biscuity. An easy drinking malt palate, a slight hop crispness and a touch of vanilla and cream.
"
1," This is a wonderful ""session beer"" as I call them.  This is the sort of beer that requires preparation before enjoying.  The proper glassware, a food accompaniment, place all must be ready.  It also takes about an hour to work through this 750ml gem properly.
"
1,"  Barley Island Barfly IPA is a ""Tavern Style"" India Pale Ale.  Im not entirely sure what that means, but this was a very drinkable beer that would make a nice session beer...  Barly IPA pours out in a thick looking stream.  It is dark amber and opaque in the glass.  It has a dense, frothy, and lasting beige head that also leaves some lacing.  The aroma is orange, citrus, and sweet pinapple.  The flavor has a smooth, malty backbone balanced by a juicy citrus bitterness.  The bitterness level is fairly substantial, but isnt offensive since it is so well balanced by the hefty, sweet caramel  maltiness.  Not only is the flavor great, but this beer is smooth on the palate and has a nearly creamy texture.  The body is medium to medium-full.  This is a great IPA and really underrated, in my opinion.  	12 oz bottle from The Hop Shop in Indianapolis, Indiana.  Shared with Rob at our weekly/bi-weekly beer tasting.
"
1," 12 oz bottle. Poured a dark brown with a thin tan head. The nose was very malty. The flavor was fairly smooth with hints of chocolate malts, a bit of oat, and a little coffee. Fairly priced around $2 a bottle.
"
1," Bomber from Greenlife Chattanooga. Pours a hazy deep copper with an off white head. The aroma is vegetal with some hints at corn but has a good leafy and wooden quality. Its a typical Oktoberfest in flavor as well and it is pretty clean. Notes of leaves, toffee and some corn are present. Its not too sweet or overly metallic or vegetal. Pretty decent take on the style.
"
1," JAN 17, 2004 At its best, it is very complex with notes of vanilla, chocolate, steamed milk, cherry, apple pie and brandy.  Early editions were reminiscent of the classic 1995 Tall Ship No.1 . Since that beer has left us (well, not me, I stocked up), this is now Canada""s best barley wine.1998 Vintage, aged 6 years - Dark red; slightly toasty, smokey and malty aroma.  Rich brown sugar notes, depth of oily, maltiness.  Fruity, and warm.  This was the definitive vintage for this beer, and I hope Gary Lohin revives the recipe at his new brewery.  A 2000 vintage served 2 years old on cask was a little less complex, yeastier, and more mellow - I never had this one fresh so I won""t change my rating based on this.
"
1," Deep red/brown color. Moderate frothy head. The nose is quite malty, with bitter sweet notes. The taste is suprisingly dry, somewhat bitter. Mouthfeel is pleasant, not too aggressive. OK.
"
1," bottle thanks to mora2000.  poured clear with decent legs.  marzipan, fruits, florals, and light alcohol.  very light on the palate, fruits, vanilla, light florals, and no sign of alcohol.

1,strong rosemary aroma......	Appearance
1," Bottle. Once again, I fail to be blown away by a high rated Trappist. Ive had this several times, and finally succumbed to the pressure of buying a bottle to rate it, even though I knew ahead of time I wouldnt be overwhelmed. Sure its got decent raisin and molasses notes, but theres an excessive amount of clove and an excessive amount of carbonation as well. I think its a great intro for people moving into craft beer, and Im glad its widely available in that sense.
"
1," Bottle. Clear orangish pour with a decent sized white head. Aroma and taste are not very good, actually - vegetables, grain, minimal malt character, hops dont stand out. Bleh.
"
0," Bottle from Sainsburys. Very dark brown colour, reasonable head. Sour vegetable aroma. Very sour malty flavour, sour aftertaste. Undrinkable. This is very bad beer. Not really a porter. more of a mild ale.
"
1," (from the tap at the Brauhaus in Passau-Ries) Hazy and muddy brown colour with a huge and very firm and steady beige foamy head. Strong clovy and yeasty aroma with strawberry and banana notes, sweet (wheat-) malty flavour and taste, dried fruits, mainly raisins, plums, silky textured mouthfeel, medium to full bodied, well-balanced bitter, slightly tart and clovy finish with a well bound warming alcoholic note. Very complex and balanced Weizenbock.
"
1," Cask at the brewery - I must first mention that I am not a fan of the non-raspberry version of this beer.  The aroma is initially roasted dark malts with raspberry notes that quickly fades into oak and bourbon.   Pours black with a brown ring head and good lacing.  Flavor is strong bourbon, roasted dark malts and chocolate with a hint of raspberry.  Cask provides a smooth and creamy finish.  Overall I think the bourbon is still too much and overpowers the subtleties of the raspberry and base brew.  But better than the non-raspberry.
"
1," Bottle 33cl, a clear golden beer. Nose is on papery malt. Very near the other lager of this brewery. Low body, some dusty malt presence, no hops, strange sugar, poor lager.
"
1," Not as great as i hoped. But its still a very good beer with an interesting taste and a great malty flavor.
"
1," Nice strong Belgian beer, just like how they like to do it. This beer has a dark, brownish color, with a light head. Aroma consists of malts and yeast while flavor is sweet and malty. Good beer.
"
1," 0.5L bottle. Cloudy red/brown color - leaves no lacing while the head dissipates quickly. Smells of a heavy fruit (peach, apricot) but not intense. The taste is somehow disappointing for a beer carrying a Trappistes label. Part sour, part bitter, a good mouth feel without any defining flavor outside of the aromatic fruit. The aftertaste continues the trend. I just wish there was more.
"
1," Bottle, Cafe Volo, Toronto.  Cloudy dark brown pour with hints of orange.  Slight fruit, alcohol, yeast in aroma.  Big fizzy head.  Mouthfeel is also fizzy, yet at the same time, rather clean and dry.  Wonderful strong Belgian taste - Ive rarely had a beer this well balanced - malt, floral hops, alcohol, carbonation - this is the genuine whole package.  Well done.
"
1,"  This one pours a good reddish-amber color.  It had a bit of a head to it.  The aroma was decent enough, with some roasted malt and a hint of hop spiciness.  The taste is pretty decent, with a touch of roastiness and maltiness. A fairly good balance between them.  Unexciting, but a good beer for an intro to crafts.
"
1," Drank in a Chimay Trappistes glass. Amber color, lots of sediment,  with a thin white bubbly head that faded quick, but stayed effervescence for a while. It had a bit of a citrus flavor and lively carbonation. This is the first Belgium beer that Ive rated, and its quite unique but taste good. Although, probably not my go-to type of beer type.
"
1," Amber, off white lasting head. Fresh (sourish) aroma. yeast. bread. Good carbonation. Malty sweet aroma. Brown sugar. Minerals? A touch of hops. A bit thin palate. The ABV is warming.
"
1," tap - Pours yellow and a little hazy with a big head.  It has a sweet, yeasty aroma.  The flavor has plenty of sweet maltiness, plus mild yeast and hops flavors.  The body is medium and its bubbly on the palate.  The finish is somewhat dry.
"
1," Darker yellow with a thick, creamy head. Very little aroma for me, but a good thick mouth feel. Strong citrus and complex floral taste. Good beer.
"
1," Pretty good strong tasting beer, but Ive had better. It has good color and aroma, but again Ive seen better.
"
1," A golden beer with a creamy white head. The aroma is sweet malty, but also with notes of straw and hints of metal from the alcohol. The flavor is sweet with straw being most dominant, but also hints of alcohol, which gives it a slight metal touch. The end is dry and bitter.
"
1," Orange/amber colour with a dense off-white head. Small maltiness, a bit of spice in the aroma. Medium-bodied; Malt character in the taste and not much else. Aftertate shows a bit of some spiceyness, but that too is fairly subtle. Not a good Marzen...below average for the style. I had this on draught at Big River (owned by Gordon Biercsh) in Chattanooga, Tennesse on 26-September-2003.
"
1," Bright golden with a creamy white head. Yeasty, flowery nose. Smoothly carbonated. Malts were lightly sweet, yeasty, and cakey. Delicate hops with notes of herbs and flowers. Hardly any bitterness. Fairly clean finish. Mustve had a fresh bottle.
"
1," Dark brown colour, light body, palate is also light, malt-accented, some nuttiness and drying out in the finish.
"
1," Brownish amber color, head didn't last but thousands of tiny bubbles kept forming on the top making it look like it was still fermenting. Some sediment on the bottom of the bottle. Pleasant aroma of molasses with touch of soy. Delicious malty flavor that reminds me of baked apples or apple crisp. Finish is sweet, smooth and faintly hoppy. Different and intriguing, but still I'm sitting here wondering what all the fuss is about. But like I say, it's intriguing.
"
1," unclear brown w nice head. Strong malty aroma of dark fruit, caramel and spices. Alcolhol develops in mouth. Flavour is sweet and the long finish sweet too. Never go wrong with Chimay Bleu
"
1," if you are going to spend $12 on a bomber of Belgian ale, you should go with Bernardus Abt, Malheur 12, or Chimay blanche. This remains one of the finest ales in the world, but its plum flavors succumb to the tiniest hint of sourness in the flavor. The body is also thinner than in some of those other classics, but that is quibbling indeed. A delightful beer that pairs beautifully with beef, the fact that I can readily name other beers that are better than this one is a tribute to other brewers rather than an insult to these noble monks.
"
1," Very pale body with a medium white head.  Sharp fruits for a lager in the aroma, alcohol is noticeable.  Very soft taste for a lager, though its possible Im too accustomed to American swill.  Some light fruits such as apple and maybe even bananna.  Minimal carbonation.  One of the better cheap lagers out there, similar in many respects to Heinekin but Ill rate it higher.
"
1," Draught@brewpub (Portland, OR, ABV 6.2%, 72 IBU)	Darl, almost opaque color, decent creamy beige head, lace. Light toasted notes. Light to medium bodied. Sticky, harsh cold coffeish flavor with caramel. Like in all Coalition beers, very watery palate.
"
1," JUN 12, 2004 I just can't get enough of this beer! hazy brownish colour. Big fluffy white head.  Looks very nice in the glass I got with it in the LCBO gift pack.		Sweet yeasty aroma. Perhaps banana? Super smooth flavour. It's great.
"
1," Bottle 50cl. Pale and cloudy, typical Hefeweizen. Typical fruity aroma, fine yeast, aromatic hops. Cloves and banan. Really not bad, better than many other Weissbier, but not a style-leader.
"
1," Bottle 500ml. w. swing top.Murky medium orange color with a large, frothy to creamy, good lacing, fully lasting, white to off-white head. Aroma is moderate to light heavy yeasty, fruity, rubber, yeast, light banana. Flavor is moderate to light light heavy sweet and light bitter with a average to long duration. Body is medium, texture is watery - creamy, carbonation is soft. [20101016]
"
1, it was like whisky... The taste and aroma were extremely different from the usual 33cl bottle
1," Hazy amber with a medium brown head.  Aroma of pale malt, citrus, resinous, earthy and danky hops.  Taste is earthy with moderately sweet pale malt, citrus, bready malt and mild bitterness.
"
1," Tap at BI, this was a real crowd-pleaser at my table.  Pitch pour with light brown head.  Heavy booze aroma with some fusels floating around on top of the chocolate.  Watery body, a bit boozy, chocolate, a little side rumwhiskey.  I enjoyed this, but in the end, about average for draught impies.
"
1," Surprisingly smooth for a rather strong alcohol by volume (9%).  I really enjoyed this one.  Next time I go to Belgium, I shall personally thank Father Theodore himself.
"
1," 750ml bottle- cork popped to the ceiling(!), big head and a ton of fizziness, almost soda pop-ish. Color is amber-bronze and very clear. Aroma is yeasty and warm. Flavor has lots of chewy notes, but not as complex as I'd hoped. Seem to taste the cask at times as it warms and opens up.  Lots of alcohol on the tongue for a 7%ABV brew... seems higher. Will enjoy this one slowly.
"
1," Color is a deep dark opaquely russet ruby color with a very tall off-white fluffy head, almost laughable and too big, took three separate times to pour it from the 11.2 oz. bottle into my Delirium Tremens goblet glass as the head just kept getting in the way, ridiculous head, let me get at it already. 		Nose is dull and kinda light, not much going on besides some light lemon peel citrus and yeast, a touch smokey and meaty upon bigger wiffs. 		Taste is short lived and a bit boring, complexity is not very forthcoming from this offering. Very dull citrus of melon husk and majorly dulled lemon and peels, lightly sweet malts and subdued spicy yeast with some strange uneven texture that I didn't care for all that much. 		Feel is medium bodied with a weird texture I just couldn't get past. Where's the smooth? Where's the creamy? Blah, boring, yuk. Not impressed. The Chimay Red was much better. I'm not sure if I have a bad bottle or what, but I've been saving this bottle, plus a few others for nearly 4 months hoping a bit of aging would make for an interesting session, but nope. I guess I'll be letting those sit alot longer.
"
1," Dark ambar body and tan head. Caramel, nuts and yeast aroma. Nuts, fruits and malts flavor. Dry finish. A good beer.
"
1," Bottle @ Ulfborg Weekend, Jan 2011. Pours clear golden with a small off white head. Nose is lime and lemon. Syrupy and sweet with a alcoholic touch. Cloying . .
"
1," (Draught)  Pours a dark brown body with a small beige head.  Aroma of vinous, passion fruit, raisins, orange, oak, lemon, and light chocolate.  Flavor of raisins, orange peel, coriander, and vinous with a dry oak finish.
"
1," Aroma is yeasty and vinous with allot of berry fruit, flavour is similar but more intense and deep with a long medium sweet finish that leaves very nice berry fruit flavours in your mouth.
"
1, </b>A golden lager hopped like an citrusy Pale Ale.	<b>How
1," 330mL bottle poured into a Chimay goblet. Cloudy copper color with not much head. There is a nice sweet smell of raisins, molasses, and yeast. Medium mouthfeel and flavor is of fruits, malt, and yeast. There is a bit of bitterness to balance it out. This is quite drinkable at 7% abv. Overall a great dubbel.
"
1," Good Beer if expensive. A little strong for me I prefer the premium but this is great in its own right.
"
1," Shared this bottle with some friends. Large head, good retention. Malty with a strong alcohol flavour at the end and aftertaste.  Warm with a slight sweetness.  Complex and no one flavour out-powers another.
"
1," Even better than the rouge. Strong, sweet and good aroma. Not to be drinked fast, but to enjoy.
"
1," Bottle from Sainsburys. It pours very dark ruby, with a quickly dissipating beige head. The nose is roasted malt, caramel, brown sugar, chocolate and sour tang. The taste is chocolate, roasted malt, cardboard, sour tang, burnt malt and liquorice, with a dry finish. Its very thin and has low carbonation. Not great.
"
1," Pours a golden yellow.  Aromas of grassy hops, with corn.  Flavor is like most pale lagers, kind of bland.  Grainy corn like taste with a touch of hops.
"
1," Sweet fruits, raisins and little spices and alcohol in the aroma. Nice head and color. Packs a nice punch and hides the high alcohol content well. A classic.
"
1," OCT 23, 2005 Bomber"
1," 33cl Bottle. poured into Chimay chalice. Deep brown with ample, frothey tan head that fills the glass. Sweet malt, yeast, pear, and brown sugar aroma. smooth mouthfeel. Sweet chocolate malt with a bit of alcohol and some plum flavor.
"
1," In my opinion this is one of the besr ales i have ever tasted lots of flavor and aroma  has a nice alchoholic warming sensation.  This is a must have in my house
"
1," APR 11, 2008 Reddish brown body, small head in its glass. Aroma is sugar, bananas, and raisins. Flavor is the same. Slightly metallic. I used to like this a lot more.
"
1," The standard against other trappistes are measured, for good or ill. Chimay will always hold a special place for me as the first good beer I ever tried. Fantastic flavor, beautiful color, slightly strong alcohol flavor. Do not make the mistake of drinking this ale in a narrow glass.
"
1," 750ml. bottle. Exits the bottle a muddy dark brown color producing a tight, thick, durable off-white head. Rich, satisfying aromas of ripe fruits, raisin, fig, caramel malts and yeast emminate from the chalice. The mouthfeel and palate is incredibly silky smooth, creamy and full. An insanely rich and complex flavor profile of dark dried fruits, caramel candy, yeast rolls and a bit of spiciness reinforces the classiness of this respected ale. Finishes with a nice little blast of alcoholic warmth to tame any residual sweetness. A classic!
"
1," Bottle at MN Gathering @ Skyview V. Semi hazy orange with a white head. Aroma is spice and yeast - kind of saison like. Palate is a little fizzy. Taste is bright spice, not all that different than Orval. Thanks JK!
"
1," Dark brown pour, with a thin white head that vanished quickly.  Rich aroma of spices and few fruits, with quite a bit of hops.  I could taste the alcohol over anything else, and didnt really care for this beer at all.  I love the Red though.
"
1," Hazy red-brown colour with okay off-white head. Very mild aromas of fruit and caramel. It is a bit vinious, based on caramel and with undertones of sweet red berries. A mild hoppy finish.
"
1," Impressive light, bubbly head tops a very dark reddish-brown body. Smells of fruit... almost sickening to me. Complex taste. Fruity, earthy, malty. Cant figure the other properties out. Almost no bitterness to speak of. Enough carbonation. I couldnt finish my glass, as the sweetness of smell and taste was beginning to trouble my stomach. Alcohol is hidden well. Cant say I liked it, but it was my first Belgian Strong Ale. May have to try again with less alcohol already in the system and a little more experience with beer tasting.
"
1," ambrata buona schiuma persistente note leggeremnte tostate un po di malto leggero spezie luppoli in bocca ritornano le note leggeremnte tostate un po di lieviti un tocco di tostato medio amaro
"
1," bubble gun, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, & dark fruit evident. Full bodied. Flavour is also complex (though perhaps not as complex as the nose would suggest)"
1," I guess this one is brewed for VD day. The appearance is black with a reddish hue and almost no head. The aroma is mainly coffee and chocolate with little cherry detected. The flavor is somewhat bitter and sour with a lot of roasted malt and sour cherries coming through. The palate is a bit thin. This is basically the winter porter with some cherry syrup added. Its not a bad beer but nothing out of this world. Overall Il say its a pretty good porter.
"
1," Bottle from Oddbins.  Very effervescent and this makes it almost impossible to pour clear.  No matter, it still looks great.  Initially large off-white head fades rapidly to a thin veneer.  Yeast and rich raisin fruit in the nose.  Theres a surprisingly complex bitterness and sweetness that eventually reveals an intense spiciness.  Very mellow lasting finish.  Like the Blue, adding the sediment gives an extra dimension.  This beer is an absolute joy.
"
1," Recommended by Shag and Cheri I was anxious to try this one. This is great! It tastes just like an espresso. I can tell there is some chocolate in there as well. What a concept! Too bad this is only for a limited time.
"
1," bottled, dark brown with quickly dissappearing thick head leaving nice lacing behind. Raisin, smoke and fruit in  taste. It give a very complex sense of aroma. Perfect!
"
1," Spiced honey nose.  Pours muddy light brown.  More sweet malt in the flavour covering the alcohol but engendering a cloying quality.  At the end the alcohol shows itself in a bitter astringency.  Overall its drinkable but not exceptional in any way.
"
1," Draught at the brewpub. Muddy brown colour. Stable tan head. The flavour is mostly malty, but also slightly roasted.
"
1," Brown color, white head. Smell caramel, yeast and a little bit spicy. Decent taste, good full carbo and medium to full body.
"
1," 0.5 l bottle, thanks Timo A! Hazy golden orange color with small head. Toffeish, biscuity and slightly musty aroma. Sweetish, toffeish, toasty, slightly caramelly and slightly sulphury aroma. OK everyday beer, except the dull sulphury note.
"
1," unexpected good
"
1," 11.2 oz brown bottle served in a Chimay Chalice. Bottle conditioned. Poured a hazy gold with a big white head. Lots of carbonation. Sweet carmalized sugar aroma and a little spice. Medium bodied lots of sweetness. Light clove flavor. Spicy, slightly funky finish. A little earthy. Alcohol isnt evident. Solid beer.
"
1," (bottle) pours a clear reddish-amber with a short lived off-white head. aroma of heavy caramel and barnyard, with a few herbs and some grain. flavour is the same, with toasted malts in the foreground. medium body and carbonation.
"
1," Dark golden weisser bock with a nice head and a really nice aroma with notes of wheat and banana. The flavour has the same notes and I find notes of spice (coriander). its really nice, even if isnt even close to Aventinus.
"
1," Bottle -> Red in colour, smells of plums and grapes. Wonderful off-white head, and a very nice fruity taste, with a decent hop finish.
"
1," Bottled, November 2006.  Malty, chocolate malt aroma with brown supple head.  Medium-bodied flavor leads with smooth, clean chocolate malt in perfect proportion without that burnt overdone roasty character so typical.  Smooth espresso quality in the clean finish, again perfectly proportioned.  This big flavor beer is very well made, appropriately bitter & bodied and is one of the best beers Ive had in Indiana.

"
1," Served at Piano Blue in Pewaukee.  This was the finest beer available but difficult to extract from  the beer-clueless Bartender.  Show a litttle pride in your work man!  Poured a cloudy reddish brown with a slight viscosity, and a big off-white head.  Full bodied and complex, with a mix of fruit, bread and yeast flavors. This was a lifesaver and pretty much made my evening out.
"
1," ~Pours a dark redish cider coulour with medium sized fluffy head.	~Scent of malts and fruit apricot and plums. A little spice.	~ Spicy, fruity flavor. Some corriander maybe.	~ Feels tingly and sharp. A bit chewy.	~ Eh, this beer is ok. Its a little too fruity and carbonated.	Upsets my stomache a bit. Chimay Bleu is definetly superior.
"
1," Bottle. Pours ruby red color with large creamy head. Looks very nice in glass. Dry fruits and spicy in the aroma and taste. Very soft and pleasant mouth feel and alcohol taste. Dry with a sour finish. Very nice beer.
"
1," Pours a lively head that is very fizzy and bubbles away to nothing in less than 2 mins.  Lots of chocolate in the nose, little mint.  Taste is almost porter like, more chocolate, and finishes with a minty aftertaste.  Quite good.
"
1," Very deep, dark brown color with an average sized beige head. Floral hops and a touch of roasted malts present in the aroma as well as the taste. Very malty taste, quite good. Nice palate, good aftertaste, but it was just a fraction of a point less than the Red I think. A very delicious beer, but I think Il go to the Red over this one.
"
1," Deep, dark color with a thin tan head. Just like jeremy (jgb9348) said, since I had it with him. Aroma of coffee and some roated malt. Strong coffee flavor with somewhat of a bitter aftertaste. Overall not bad though!
"
1," Dark chocolate brown pour with nice lacing. Raisins, milk chocolate and darker fruits. Medium to full bodied.
"
1," Hazy pale orange with a large off white head. Aroma had wheat, yeast and hints of banana. Flavor was somewhat sweet with bananas, wheat and yeasty notes.
"
1," 12 oz. bottle from West Lakeview Liquors.  Pours an opaque dark brown color with a small tan head that leaves a ring on the inner edge and a film atop the beer.  Aroma of bourbon, vanilla, oak, roasted malts, plums, oats, and rye.  Flavor of roasted malts, copper, vanilla, plums, smoked oak, coffee, and a little bourbon.  Medium-bodied, with a roasty mouthfeel and medium carbonation.  Lingering finish of deep, bitter roast and with some ash as well.  This hit the spot tonight, a very nice, simple, solid barrel aged stout.
"
1," Apple, banan, raisin, coriander taste, but not real strong.  Very refreshing and smooth with barely a hint of the alcohol.  Unassuming but clean and smooth with a good but subtle flavor.
"
1," JUL 10, 2006 Pours a red to light brown and hazy beer with sediments and a big creamy head with good retention that leaves a huge lacing. Nice yeasty aroma with caramel and spicey herbal hints. Very strong banana with palm syrup smell. There are also soft notes of raisins, fruits and vanilla. Flavor is moderately bitter with some coffee and nuts, ending slightly alcoholic and with a good finishing duration. Medium body. It feels incredibly smooth in the mouth with its silky texture and soft carbonation. This beer has a warming effect. Great.
"
1," Grande Reserve, pours a rich dark brown color with an off-white head. Flavor of sweet caramel, Belgian yeast, and dark fruits. Very smooth, especially for the alcohol content. A great beer, the best Chimay has to offer in my opinion.
"
1," 12 oz. bottle courtesy boboski.  Strong pine resin aroma with a musky character to it.  Orangish-yellow with a soapy white head.  Palate thin to medium, very drinkable.  Moderate hop start to the taste, not a whole lot of hop character in the finish.  A pretty drinkable, good IPA.
"
1," Love this beer! Bold flavor without overbearing either on the malt or hop side. Good spice balance.
"
1," Had this one at The Old Toad in Rochester, New York.  Poured cloudy read with a creamy white head.  Aroma was bananas, cloves, and spice, not unlike a hefe.  Taste was sweet and spicy with a medium body.  Not as rich as the bleu, but quite refreshing.
"
1," Pours a rich mahogony color from the bomber with a thick off-white head of foam.  Loaded with yeast, raisin, and hops in the nose with notes of caramel in the flavor.  A bit too high in water content for my taste, but a respectable beer all the same.
"
1," Pours a beautiful dark copperish color. Aroma is of fruit and hops. Tastes like fruit and spices. The flavor is fairly complex but nothing like Bleu. This is a very good beer.
"
1," On tap at the Crescent Moon. Pours a dark straw color with a medium bright white head. This might have been Storz reborn, except that it lacks the corn and has an unexpected dry hopping finish. Not a smooth beer, but definitely has a manly grainy flavor. Mild citrus tartness is an undercurrent. A good tailgate beer I suppose.
"
1," Very dark maroon color, probably the darkest IPA Ive seen. The aroma is very fruity, not just citrus fruity, but berries. Flavor is the same, very sharp citrus/grapefruit bitterness with a very refreshing sour cherry and strawberry flavor. Palate is very long lasting ending with a great hop warmth. I miss this and wish i was drinking it right now. On tap at 12 South Taproom in Nashville, TN
"
1," Hazy red/brown pour with generous pillowy head, some lacing on the glass.   Always a fan of the billowing bubbles throuhgout the course of the beer. Bready/yeasty on the nose, with touches of fruits, berry, pear, apricot and sugar.  Smooth and fruity tasty with rounded body and caramel malts.  There is a hoppy-crisp, slightly acidic finish which is a nice touch and provides contrast to the chewy malty body up front.  Overall a nice beer
"
1," (Rerate, small bottle.) This is a great beer! Vinous must be the word here. I started drinking this near to room temperature - interesting aroma (leather, oak) but not very refreshing (even a vinous beer should be!) till I had cooled it down in the fridge for half an hour. I think +12-14 degrees C should be right for this beer. Colour is dark brown, alcohol well hidden. Fizzy carbonation that disappeared rapidly. As the beer is bottle conditioned, I suppose this will vary from one bottle to another. Flavour that calls for sipping, aftertaste lasts forever. Expensive in Norway, but worth the price.
"
1," Bottle I have had for a number of months but afraid to drink seeing Duffmans rating. Almost clear with a green tint. Light medicinal scent with a bit of woody apple note. Flavour is apple with fusal notes  a rough woody dark bark and honey flavour.
"
1," bottle, bought at the brewerys former drinks market in Ergenzingen. Clear orange-golen colour with a large off-white head. Intensive malty nose. Full-bodied, sweet and malty with hints of caramel and spices, shy hints of citrus fruit. Lingering finish, into whoch some shy hoppy flavours blend in.
"
1," Bottle. Cloudy orange, off-white cream. Citric yeasty aroma. Velvetty wellagered mouthfeel, medium body. Orangepeel fruity base well balanced by grassy and light flowery hops. Nice.
"
1," World class. One of the best, in my opinion. Toasty, subtle herbs, hint of alcohol. Tiny bit vanilla.
"
1," 0.5 l bottle. Deep golden color with long lasting head. Sweetish malty aroma with bready melanoidins and flowery honey. The flavor is very much the same, very bready. Low bitterness. Might go well with greasy food,  just for tasting needs more hops.
"
1," Bottle. Pours black with minimal red hues coming out. A small tan head forms and disappears shortly. The aroma is smoky, oaty, and full of very dark mocha and toasted hazelnuts. Nicely roasty in the mouth with thin chocolate and a hint of instant coffee, though some tasty notes of toasted notes hold everything together. This is a pretty good quaff.
"
1," Bottle 500ml. w. swing top.Clear medium yellow orange color with a average to large, frothy and open, fair lacing, fully diminishing, off-white to white head. Aroma is moderate malty, grain, hay, toasted, sweet malt. Flavor is heavy moderate sweet and moderate bitter with a average to long duration, sweet malt. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. [20100610]
"
1," Pourd an opaque murky brown with a hint of copper, head is a creammy soapy tan lasts halfway through the beer. aromas, if that of fruit and lovely yeast more  like wine than beer.  Flavor is INCREDABLE with balanced hop bitterness and a perfect sweetnes, all balanced in a mastered blend of unfiltered bliss,  heavy body,  great mouth feel,  and perfect with my steak,  the ceamy finish lasts and paired well with the rich fatty steak,  I thought I had died and gone to heaven for a minute.  A tru winner if you appreciate REAL beer
"
1," pretty average dubbel, sugary and with lots of caramel, copper color, but not impressive.
"
1," Very dark with a creamy head. Alcohol is well hidden, but warms the throat and stomach quickly! Like drinking a fruit cake, but a good fruit cake. From a 750.
"
1," OCT 23, 2005 This beer stimulates my limbic system with one of my all-time favorite aromas and is nice for special occasions. Has a beautiful ruby-bronze body and fat notes of spice, mustiness, earth, and roasted candy sugar. The flavor is complex and builds with each sip bringing a nice blend of sweet, sour, bitter, earth, and chocolate. Makes a great compliment for bread and Chimay cheese. A classic.
"
1," Bottle shared by smittymack poured a clear dark brown with a small lasting brown head. Aromas of bourbon, burnt carmel, vanilla, dark fruit and molasses. Palate was light to medium bodied and smooth. Flavors of bourbon, burnt carmel, vanilla, dark chocolate and light oak with a smooth lingering chocolate finish.
"
1," FEB 3, 2005 Bottle.  Yeasty peach/banana aroma-very nice.  Tannish yellow color - clear (way too clear for a Hefe) with moderate head.  Slightly tart orange/banana flavor.  On the weak side.  Pleasant enough but would be better with more body.
"
1," Murky brown with a hint of red to it.  The aroma is rich and musty with redcurrants and salty crackers.  In the mouth there is a burst of rich sweetness which then turns to more roasty characters and a sticky caramel yeastiness. 		I drank this alongside the Ham Cooked in Coke and Stout from Appetite for Ale and it was excellent bringing a frutiness to cut through the fatty pork.  I found the sweet glaze gave it a touch too much of a bitterness in the finish though. Maybe there is a better dish to pair with (though they recommended it in the book.)
"
1," Dirty brown, not a long head, but beautiful to taste, malty with burnt coffee flavours.
"
1," Light amber pour off white head and spotty lace.  Orangy aroma.  Resinous hops with hints of tropical fruit and caramel.
"
1," Cloudy, nutbrown body.	Fresh aroma, ozon-ish.	Wellbalanced, but a bit thin with too little flavour.
"
1," Creamy head and a cloudy body. Smells ignitingly sweet and soft. Creamy texture and lasting full, rich taste with hints of brown sugar.
"
1," This is a very mild easy drinking beer with a hint chocolate but it doesnt cover the malt. A very very balanced beer with carmel, chocolate and hops!
"
1," Bottle - the primary aroma is that of the bourbon.  Chocolate in the background.  The appearance is fairly typical for a porter.  Dark brown body with a medium brown head.  Bourbon dominates the flavor initially.  Followed by chocolate with an oakey background.  The bourbon reappears in the finish.  Creamy mouthfeel.  This is a very nice effort!

1," Pour is a rich dark amber with a nice white to off-white head.  The aroma is sweet fruit, light hints of brown sugar, some roasted malt and faint alcohol.  Flavor was more sweet and delicate than the red.  Almost something floral or grassy to the middle of it.  Finished with a nice combination of hops and alcohol.  Lively carbonation, above average mouthfeel.
"
1," Poured a light golden clear color, head was white. Aroma is corn and grain. Taste was clean crisp and refreshingly fresh. I could see this as a nice treat on a hot day.
"
1," Fruit & caramel malt aroma.  The flavor includes both of those, but also an alcohol presence.  Theres more in the taste, but Im not sure how to identify it.  The mouthfeel is champagne-like, all light and bubbly.  Cloudy, dark brown body, with a nice head of foam.  I like this beer quite a bit, but I cant say I love it.
"
1," Bottle.  I found this ale to be very refreshing.  Along with the subtle sweetness, the carbonation is very lively within.  A great ale to be enjoyed at any time!
"
1," White wax dipped 12oz. bottle. Pours a clear, dark, crimson-chestnut color with a quickly diminishing, smooth tan head. Sugary sheeting with micro-spots drips down the glass, but leaves no real lace. The aroma starts with a dark candy sugar base, with loads of fig and dark raisin. Theres a hint of earthy hoppiness and just a touch of dry cocoa that brings a nice balance, taming the sweetness. Flavors expand to show some burnt brown sugar and molasses, with a faint hint of smoke lurking deep within. Again, the cocoa roast and earth flavors keep things in check. The palate is medium-full, with balanced carbonation, though the finish is sugary and a bit acrid, with some alcoholic heat. Overall, its a solid, tasty Belgian strong with a nice nose, but the finish is a little over the top.
"
1," Totally not my thing.  Drank in a chalice - the whole nine yards - still didnt help.  Not impressed.  Reminded me a bit of Gouden Carolus.

1," Malty delicious beer that looks good in the glass.  Fruit, coffee and other flavors are present.  World Class.

1," After drinking this for so long, I finally getting around to rating it"
1," Cloudy reddish brown with a small pale head. Aroma is of caramel, dark fruits. Medium palate, flavours of brown sugar, citrus, a little nuttiness, and a bitter finish.
"
1," Thanks to Hippie4beer.  12 oz bottle.  Pours a hazy light copper and a cool lasting thick fluffy head.  Aroma is traditional citrus cascade-like hops with that cascade like harsh metallic hint.  Flavor is a bit weak, some more citrus, light grassy hops, light caramel malt backbone.  Clean light bitterness in the end.  Pretty standard APA.
"
1," fruit, sugar, malt.  Amazing colour and appearance, large off-white head with a red/brown almost black body.  Chimay Red breaks down a bit in the flavour, though, I find its a bit confused over what it wants to be.  Malt is buried deep inside the mix, while fruit flavours fade in and out.  A good beer, not great.  Certainly nowhere near the best of the Trappists.
"
1," Cloudy brown pour with some orange tint.  Medium frothy head, nice level of carbonation.  Yeast, ripe fruit, spice and alcohol on the nose.  Flavor echoes the nose, lightly bitter.  Dry finish.
"
1," A little less flavor then I expected, but for a 9% ale the alcohol wasnt overpowering. Poured great with a fab head worthy of sticking your nose into... but after several sips I felt compelled to wear a robe, quote a psalm,  and stay slient through the remainder of the meal. Darn those Trappists!!!! A nice treat, but not my personal choice for the day in, day out.

1," On draugh at Seven Bridges Jacksonville- 1L.  Pours dark copper with a nice head that lingers.  Bright clarity.  Aroma is nutty, toast and cracker like.  Taste is nutty as well with Munich malt shining through, low to no hop flavor.  Body is medium light with a medium dry finish.  A very clean beer.  It would be really good if the body was a bit fuller and there was a little more alcohol warmth.  A little out of style.
"
1," sample @ pub, golden in color great head, dont like the hop profile. Due to hop shortage. The bitterness is deceiving the flavor overwhelm everything.
"
1," JAN 25, 2004 Nice brown color. Aroma is a bit spicy and yeasty. The taste does a nice job of complimenting the yeast aroma (just like the description says). It has a light malty taste with a bit of bitterness. It's very smooth for the strength of the beer.  Excellent.

1," Pours dark brown with red ruby tint.  Has a pillowy head that changes from off-white to dark brown.  Aroma has LOTS of bourbon with some vanilla.  The body is medium / thin with lots and lots of fizzy carbonation.  The beginning flavor is roasty malts, but soon the carbonation wipes out the flavors and then there is bourbon, chocolate, vanilla and roasted malts.  More bourbon than I care for - I more of a beer guy, hence rating on this site.  An okay beer, but nothing to get excited about.

1," big aroma f reash sweet ginger, and subtle notes of cinnamon, and cloves. Its like liquid ginger bread. Quite sweet finish, very bready, and malty. Very nice xmas ale!

Nice balance with the hop bitterness. Fairly well dried out with crispy carbonation keeps palate fresh. Nice bready malt in the finish.

"
1," Medium brown in color with a nice foamy off-white head this is a nice looking beer.  Aroma is typically very hoppy and tart.  The hops give a sharp bite to the flavor and leave some bitterness.  Some citrus but not a lot.  It is a pretty good IPA and is consistent throughout.  Too bad this is not a favored style of mine.
"
1," Bottle. Light sour and moderate malty smell, later on light hoppy. Medium sized white foamy head, normal long lasting. A dark red light cloudy body. Light bitter, light taste of caramel and a short to medium duration. Moderate creamy, medium body with a soft carbonation.	A good beer.
"
1," Thanks to Bobby91w for the extra! Pours a murky reddish brown, like a good barley wine. Thin head. Very sweet-smelling, with lots of ripe fruits - some bright enough to be called tropical, and some darker (figs, dates). A bit of apple cider, and some light brown sugar - definitely mostly malts. Hops are barely present. Flavor is equally sweet, but more like caramel or even butterscotch than brown sugar. Watery palate, but what flavor is there is very pleasant. This ones worth more than the score it has, I think - not fantastic, but satisfying enough.

1," Had this from a 2l-Siphon. Very dark in the glass, but not black. Very roasty-malty aroma, also very smoky. Reminds me of bacon. The finish is a bit moldy-malty, then warming and well balanced. Very smoky doppelbock, good!

"
1," NOV 13, 2006 Tap at brewery - Aroma is huge floral hops with carmel undertones.  The summit hops used are very pungent.  The aroma is so appealing I cant wait to taste it.  Pours cloudy orange with a nice big fluffy head and great lacing.  Flavor is chewy, earthy hops with some citrus snap.  Not incredibly bitter due to the well balanced nature of the brew.  Palate is tart and very smooth.  Smells like a IIPA and tastes like a great American IPA.  This is easily the best brew Ive had from Barley Island.
"
1," On tap at Hamilton Place. The body was deep gold with a white head. The aroma was spicy with some bell peppers and bread crust. The taste was rich biscuit with some bell pepper. Spicy finish. Nice and clean.

1," A dark copper color with a light head. Looking at Botos comment it seems they have improved on it over the years. The palate is a little thin but not terribly so. A very malty and vinegar type flavor but somehow it works. Loads of caramel and molasses in the flavor. A slightly bitter aftertaste. Nothing great but not too bad either.
"
1," caramel, yeast, slight floral at first sniff, but couldnt get that one again.	Appearance"
1," It was with great anticipation that I opened my bottle of Chimay Red. The first time I had tasted this ale, it was during a night of drinking. I was pretty much pissed at the time and I didn't expect the brick that slammed into my face when I drank my glass. I called it a slow burn then, but hey, I was drunk, so what did I know?		I was ready to taste it properly this time, and so I did.		The Chmay Red poured a deep amber with lively rising columns of carbonation. The thick, creamy head rose like a cloud above my Chimay chalice. The beer looks wonderful.		A vague fruitiness layered with a more harsh smell that, although not exact, reminded me of nutmeg. The aroma was as powerful as I expected.		This was a different time and a different day so I was ready to be objective. No slow burn this time and no grimace. The flavor is spicy. the carbonatio heightens the bite of this beer and there's no hiding the alcoholic content, it packs a punch but with great flavor.		This is a very good beer although I put it last among the three Chmays. However, that's definitely not a bad thing because all three are great.
"
1," Its dark golden with a creamy head and the aroma has notes of malt, hay, caramel and syrup. The flavour is moderately sweet with notes of hay, malt, syrup, tobacco and caramel.

1," DEC 24, 2011 cream coloured frothy head and cloudy yellow brown colour. Esters and malted roast and cream or yeast notes as well as some dark prune and brown sugar like notes. the flavours are about balance between richness, alcohol and malts as well as a very carbonated and somewhat hoppy note. very nice.
"
1," Poured a copper color with a small off white head.  The color was not was I was used to seeing in a dubbel, and it didn't include any lacing.  Aroma of citrus, with some dark fruits as well.  Taste was filled with grapes, plums, and some citrus and spice as well.  Overall, I was expecting alittle more out of this after the bleu being my first Chimay, and I loved that.

1," Carbonated head - red brown body. Virtually no hops. Nice and complex malt and fruit flavors. Delicious - my fav of the Chimays!

1," FEB 4, 2007 draft - Pours black with a big, lingering head and nice lacing.  It has a decent oatmeal and roast malt aroma.  The flavor includes the roast malt and some coffee notes.  Theres very little hops to be found and a light, roasty finish.

1," Bag in a box at Reading BF 2010.  Odd hazy dirty gold brown colour.  Pear aroma, some plastic.  Very tasty perry, good real fleshy pear flavour, touch of brown sugar.  Really is fleshy fruit.  Ripe pear.  Some acidity on finish.  Touch too sweet but still very tasty.

"
1," 2007 Bottle Date; Sampled January 2009	An average pour into my 25cl tulip glass leaves me with three-fingers of lightly browned, light tan colored head.  The beer is quite a dark brown, almost black color that shows a brilliantly clear, rich ruby hue to it when held up to the light.  The aroma has a fruitiness to it up front, but then has a meaty malt character to it that is a bit surprising to me.  Aromas of toasted, roasted, almost smoky, dark malt a deep toasted nuttiness (almost like peanut butter).  After a bit the nutty note in the finish seems like it has gone a little rancid.  The aroma on this is not bad, but it is really interesting, I have never quite smelled a beer like this before.		Lightly sweet, again with a fruit note that reminds me of prunes and raisins.  The beer picks up a hint of tartness in the middle that continues to accentuated the fruit flavors.  This beer feels a little light as it first hits the tongue, but it picks up a viscousness as it rolls across the tongue and actually finishes with a fair amount of heft.  That interesting, slightly rancid nuttiness of the aroma is much subdued in the flavor; there is a touch of it here that is almost more of an oral-nasal sense than anything.  Dark malt notes tend to temper that dark fruit notes a bit and also provide a touch of burnt grain bitterness as well as a touch of burnt acidity and perhaps some tannic astringency.  This could use some spiciness to it; it is somehow Belgian-style and some fermentation spiciness would provide a lot more balance to this beer.  As the beer warms up the fruitiness begins to take on a cola like edge.		Other than the fact that the aroma is really starting to annoy me, this isnt a bad beer; I keep on thinking I should be able to exactly identify this note in the aroma, but I cant quite place my finger on it.

1," Bought at a little grocery store in Paris....Need to get this one again...as was very unimpressed by the flavor, considering the ratings given this one. Dark Brown Coloring.  White Head.
"
1," Pours a pale yellow color that is brilliant and clear. Super smooth, to the point of being like sugar water. I was amazed by the smoothness. Notice the acidity levels in the description, anyone who does not give this beer a 4 or 5 on palate is a fool. Taste is sweet, dry, a bit fruity and very ricey. I liked this one but was not super impressed in the taste department.
"
1," Small bottle from the Chimay gift pack (I just wanted the glass). This is the last one of the Chimays that I havent tried. This one is nice and fruity overall. Some hop/malt showing through as well. Overall I like the grand reserve better but not bad at all.

1," RB #1000 in 2007 and one of my first belgians finally to be put on as a rating. 33 cL bottle. Pours deep slight muddy brown with a light brown and creamy head. Malty, raisin, caramel and toffee sweet aroma. Malty sweet flavour with dried fruit notes. Warming alcohol feel without any alcohol flavour as such, well hidden. Complex beer yet accessible palate. Malty to slight bitter finish with warming alcohol finish.
"
1," Very cloudy, deep tan-amber colour.  Thick head.  Very rustic aroma is spicy, yeasty, almost bretty.  The body is actually a little overattenuated for the style, with faint phenols and some meaty bread notes and dusty yeast.  A very rustic example, to fit the rural setting.
"
1," reddish brown? No way. This is a pilsener through and through. Poured golden yellow with a thick fluffy white head. Aroma of light hops and malt. Flavor is a bit herbal but not overwhelming. My first beer of the night and this tasted very good. Perhaps a short slightly watery finish. A nice beer.
"
1," Great malt with clean and crisp Belgian yeast flavors on top.  Fruity, wet, and sticky.  Raisins, plums, dried fruit.  Good stuff.

1," Thanks tytoanderso. Pours a nice black brew with no head. The aroma shows coffee, roast, some chocolate, sweet. The flavor is a little roasty, coffee for sure, a tad bit of chocolate. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, roast. Nice coffee finish.
"
1," Pours a cloudy amber colour with an off white head which disappears almost completely. I personally love the sweet smell familiar to ales yet almost fruity presence. More carbonated than most ales Ive tried but the given carbonation enhances its qualities. The taste itself is of an ale with a gentle touch of fruit to it as well as toffee and maybe a little bit of cocoa-like flavor. Excellent beer.

1," Bottle, GBBF 07. Harsh hop, some dusty hop and crisp citrus. Mouth is funky hops, dusty and dull. Finishes cardboardy and mouldy. Alright.
"
1," DEC 23, 2008 500ml bottle.	Beautiful dark brown, thin tight persistent and blotchy head. Sweet and tempting fruity aroma - bold and plummy. Lively in the mouth, not harsh though. Yeasty and winey with a quick wave of alcohol, that subsides to being pleasantly warming. Had as an aperitif - perfect for getting the juices going. When nicely warmed - you, not the beer - the finish is a wonderful mellow but quite well roasted malty backdrop with a little lingering wineyness. Classic Belgian - how do they do this?	Rerate"
1," dark red color with a foamy off white head.  dark fruit aroma.  similar to the other chimay ales but less complexity.  not as much spice on the tongue.  goes down warm.  still very good.

1," Bottle. Poured hazy brown with a fizzy tan head that settles quickly. Aromas of prune, a malty background and light spices. The flavor was much the same with some raisin also coming out. Medium body, dry, lively carbonation.
"
1,"  Pours a murky burgundy colour under a beige head that vanishes.  Smells of plums, raisins, roasted malt and nuts.  Flavours of brown sugar apple sauce and prunes accented by rum and spice.  Dry-alcoholic end.  A solid and complex Trappiste offering.
"
1," Bottle. pours dark ambr with a small head. Smells of fruit. malty taste with the alcohol covered up nicely.
"
1," 750ml bottle- Color is a solid caramel brown with a peachy reddish tone, nice inch high head of tight bubbly off-white creamy foam, faded slowly to a skim always present and large drippy lacing.		Smell is one complex mother of a dubble, quite unique, good smokeyness comes through with bacon and smoked dried oranges, sweet smokey malts, other dark but dullish fruit of plum and raisin, candied toffee notes and what I'm guessing is alot of wild yeast and a bit of cherry as well. Hard to get past the smokey sense, but it tames as it sits longer.		Taste is smooth and creamy delight of complexity, let this sit awhile after pouring, it seemed to ripen on the vine as it warmed a bit. Finally as I begin to reward my taste buds it starts with a touch of mint up front leading right into a punch of sweet malts, dulled oranges and dark fruits, mostly plum, a subtle touch of raisin, cherry, and toffee. The smokey sense from the smell is all but null and void. I was hoping it would maybe show up somewhere as it warmed, but nope. Towards the end it pick up some banana esters and good amounts of milding spice, clove, and yeast keeping this very smooth and quite full, a bit of a tingly-fluffy carbonation shows up late towards the finish.		Complexfully wonderful and a great sipper. Excellent yeasty surprise; smooth, creamy, tingly, spicey, fruity, nearly everything a good Belgian needs this has.
"
1," On tap at Big River  WDW.  Poured clear coppery-amber with a short cap of beige head.. left sticky lacing as it descended.  The aroma picked up sweet candied, toasted caramel with lesser notes of dark fruit.. some citrus overtones, but they were mostly suppressed by the sweetness.  Sweet caramel and dark fruits on the flavors core with a decent dose of hops showing up (scratchy, rough pine and citrus primarily).. rough and bitter again on the finish.  Light-medium bodied with a good moderate level of carbonation.. bitterness was too rough for this to be enjoyable.
"
1," 330 ml flip-top bottle in Germany at home thanks to shrubber85. Is a dark orange color with a foamy beige head. Aroma is spiced malt. Taste is nuts, burnt rasins, and is roasty. Palate is smooth and goes down nicely. There are some neat flavors in the ending.

1," As it states a copper beer with a nice creamy head but quite small. Some caramel and toffee flavours detected in what is a great tasting beer.
"
1," Sample @ RBNAG 11 (live rating). Hazy nougat brown body, medium white head. Wort, cherries, wood and hints of caramel malts. Taste is mellow malty tones with some orange peel and red berries. Hints of saison-like yeast. Quite nice, original, and very different from the other Trappist brews yet not quite awesome.
"
1," Pours a rich clear brown colour, with a small off-white head. Aroma is of grain malts, slight caramel and lots nut scents. Taste is a little dry with a slight sweetness throughout, fairly malty. Medium body, softer carbonation, smooth on the palate. Overall a serviceable brown ale.
"
1," Poors golden brown with a pebbly head.  Drinks easily despite its high ABV.  I found the red and white versions indistiguishable.
"
1," Red, brown colored brew. Sweet, yeasty, malty aroma. Fruits, sweetness and malty flavor. Nice.

1," Another great beer from Chimay.  Pours amber with a huge head.  Aroma of yeast and flavor of same.  Great beer.
"
1," Pours a cloudy brown, nice white head. Dont know why this is rated so high, rather land. Dominant flavors are alcohol and slight sweet dark fruits, really watered down and just not that impressive.
"
1," Draft at Seven Bridges Jacksonville.  Pours a clear yellow with a white head.  Nose is light malt, grain, a hint of esters, and a hint of yeast.  Flavor is similar- grainy for a pale lager, light malt, sweet, and a hint of yeast.  This is one of the first pale lagers I actually ordered, and did not just come with a paddle.  Nice light lager- enjoyable for what it is.
"
1," Shared bottle at the RBNAG-11 grand tasting. Hazy orange with an off-white head. Spicy, Belgo yeast, sweet malts and band aid on the nose. Sweet, bitter and spicy flavors. Medium to full body. Light syrupy texture.
"
1," This highly praised strong ale deserves every bit of it. As one of the most widely available of its kind, it has helped open the world of belgian beer to many, including myself. Years later, it is clear that what seemed unique years ago is off course, not, but this is still a remarkable and impressive powerful brew. It is a perfect beer for a cold winter evening.
"
1," Poured a reddish brown with an off white head. The aroma is nutty and malt. Taste is a sweet malt and nut.
"
1," FEB 12, 2003  The head was thick and stayed on top, and on my lip, and the head that spilled stayed foamy on the sink for almost 30 minutes. The malty start quickly turns to warm fruit and spices. The last drop was more doughy and dry, probably due to the yeast at the bottom of the bottle . A wonderful bottle of beer.
"
1," Bottle... Mostly clear, dark, burgundy lager with a large, frothy, khaki head. Terrific, tight retention. Oxidized, ester-riddled nose permeates must, cobwebs, dates, dust and very, very light molasses. Tastes much better than expected. Hints at malt sweetness with an undertone of caramel, but mainly delivers moderate acidity and mild bitterness. Medium to full-bodied and lightly creamy with soft carbonation. Crisp, tangy finish.
"
1," Sample at 3rd Annual Great Austin Belgian Beer Festival on May 16, 2009.  No doubt about it - this gals a knockout.  Fruity sweetness with a little sour punch.  Great recipe, not over the top, and very enjoyable.
"
1," AUG 16, 2007 Bottle 75cl.  Wow, aroma is complex and of caramel, chocolate, nuts, alcohol, and fruit.  Pours very dark red, with a modest head.  Flavor is extremely complex, especially as it warms, with hints of everything in the aroma plus coffee, and perhaps spice?  Finish is slightly bitter, but not overwhelming.  A world class beer that is readily available.
"
1," 11.2 ounce bottle in generic goblet.  Amber/red with lasting ring head.  Brown sugar cherry aroma with faint alcohol.  Brown sugar caramel sweetness with mild raisin fruitiness and lingering sugary sweetness combined with very mild bitterness.  Medium body and carbo.  Not as interesting as I remember, but a very nice mellow flavor.
"
1," First (and only Big River) beer I had at the 6/2005 Nooga gathering.  Had a pleasant hazy straw color with a bubbly rough head.  I noted some Belgian style aromas including banana and spice (clove), though they were light.  The flavor had some citrus fruit at first sip (lemon) but it moves quickly to a fuller spicier fruit/banana cake flavor.  Certainly not light and quenching as I had imagined but good in its own way.  The body had a sticky feel that makes the flavors stick to your tongue.  Half way through I added a lemon wedge.  It lightened the body and magnified the citrus flavors (duh!).
"
1," yeasty/wheaty nose, dark brwon cloudy hue with a large off-white head, malty and yeasty, there are orange and toffee notes, luxuriuosly thick palate, nice malt aftertaste.
"
1," Very Good Chimay.  Deep Gold Color.  Strong, but well balanced.  Yeast Flavor as well.
"
1," Sorta smells like a spiced baking ham. Kinda an amalgamation of sweet brown sugar and cloves. Looks beautiful. If this beer was a woman Donald Trump would want to have a 4 million dollar wedding with it. Dark brown with a huge frothy mocha head that fades too soon. Tastes like bread pudding soaked in spiced rum with a little brown sugar and dried fruits thrown in. Very lip smacking malt base. Improves vastly as it warms. I really need to get a fridge that stays at 55 F.
"
1," reddish brown and slightly hazy	primary nose is green bell peppers w/ some sweet malt (toffee) and yeast background	med/full body and very fizzy. it erupts in your mouth. its weird how it fizzes up so much in your mouth.	im not liking this. some bubble gum, some green veg, some yeast, but they dont all come together well.
"
1," Poured from a 750ml bottle.  Deep amber somewhat hazy from the bottle conditioning.  Off white head that discipates somewhat quickly.  Signature belgian yeast aromas mixed with dark fruits, raisins, plumbs, currants.  Very complex and rich taste, maybe a little oxidation.  Residual sweetness and alcohol warmth lingers.  Body is medium full to full.  A very enjoyable drinking experience. The beer is much better when it warms and the flavors really open up.  This is truely and exceptional beer.
"
1," Handbottled. A dark amber beer with a white head. The aroma ahs notes of malt, caramel, over ripe fruits, and hops. The flavor is sweet with notes of over ripe fruit, malt, and light notes of wood, leading to a dry finish. Thanks KimJohansen for sharing.
"
1," chimay is great!!!!!!!  smooth, complex, high alcohol content -- perfect.  I cant wait to try everything they have to offer!
"
1," Bottle.  Pours a hazy, bright copper with a monstrous off-white head that dissipates slowly leaving beautiful lacing.  Aromas of wheat, muscat, yeast, and a little hops.  Very balanced flavor profile.  Toasty malts balanced with sharp hops.  Fantastic, creamy mouthfeel - the carbonation is perfect for the intensity and the ABV of this beer.  I love it!
"
1," A sweet malt backbone with what I was told had four different hops, giving the beer its complex hop profile.
"
1," Deep ruby with hints of orange. Big frothy lively tan head. Apple tart aroma. Some earthy malt aromas with definite alcohol notes. Shockingly smooth flavors. Tart and fruity with very balanced flavors. Body is medium. Alcohol is noticeable and the finish is very dry.
"
1," Chimay ""Blue"" has a thick, creamy, beige head with numerous streams of tiny bubbles streaming up, but not much lacing. It overflowed after I poured it. The appearance is a hazy brown. Aroma was nominal, I found. I just couldnt pick up much, aside from some sweetness. The flavor, however, was quite pronounced and strong- this beer is very wine like. There was a good balance between the barley and hops, so I wasnt really able to pick up one or the other ingredient. Lots of over-ripe fruits (prune?) show up here. And, alcohol really makes its presence known. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy, and Chimay ""Blue"" finishes dense. This is a sipper for sure. Overall, I thought this was very good, yet not excellent. Yet, Im sure that with all the character this beer has, I do need to try this more than once. 		RJT
"
1," Quite interesting beer. Poured a dark amber with fluffy white head into a trappist glass. Produces very interesting aromas. Cherry comes through the strongest though. The carbintation is strong but not overbearing. Flavor is light on hops, with a little roasted malt coming through. Overall not a spectacular beer for $10. Wouldnt buy again.
"
1," bottle, bought at the brewerys Getrnkemarkt in Ergenzingen. Clear brown colour, mid-sized beige head. Malty with hints of caramel and raisins, shy hoppy touch.

1," 12oz bottle-A medium to dark brown with a head that dissipates rapidly.  An aroma of malt and caramel. A taste of dark malt and sweetness with a bitterness on the end. Not bad but light for a brown.
"
1," Pours a foggy reddish brown with ample foamy head.  Aroma is of raisins, cinnamon, and touch of something floral. Theres more foam than I expected and I think thats hiding some of the smell.  Also, my sniffers been on the fritz for over a week now, stupid allergies.  Strong, full flavor of anice, dark fruit, raisins, malt, well-masked alcohol, and something like a restaurant peppermint right before the finish .  I see why its a standard bearer, if overpriced.  Mouthfeel is viscous and pleasing.  Tingly feel lasts for a solid half-minute after each taste.  This is a good one.

1," Beer poured  a dark ruby with a large white head. Initially there was an aroma of fruits. First tasting had hints of  fruit and a slight coffee flavor.  Little bitter on the end of the taste. This is a beer that I will come back to.
"
1," Green bottle. Aroma of grassy hop backed by a bit of sweet malt. Brassy gold color with a pretty good size white head. Thin to medium body with coarsely creamy carbonation. Good feel. Flavor is grass and floral hop over biscuit. Not exactly crisp, but it seems clean. Finish is more bitter than sweet. Goes down well after 4 hours mucking about in the yard.
"
1," Striking reddish brown pour supporting a wonderful pillowy and massive head with long retention and lines of velcro lacing.  Slightly sour aroma of yeast, malt, cobwebs and sweet berries.  Well balanced but strongly malty flavor surrounded by whirls of fruit, spice and vanilla all backed up with a modest hoppy bite.  Creamy mouthfeel with some nice effervescence and a snappy but sweet finish.  This is a world classic for a reason but it is still surprisingly accessable to many palates.
"
1," JUN 13, 2004 Light colored head. The bottle is simple and understated.  Excellent honey and apple aroma and flavor.  This goes down very smooth and leaves a smile on your face.. "
1," Cloudy copper body with an off-white head, a bit fruity on the nose.  Slight bitterness provides the balance to the sweetness and fizz.  A fine dubbel.
"
1," Very characteristic of a dubbel.  Golden/red color.  Slight caramel and light fruit flavor.  Subtle hoppy finish and bubbly on the tongue.  Rather heavy for a dubbel, but still great.
"
1," On tap.   Very flavorful porter.  Definitely better than average.  It has the roasty malts flavor that is preferable for a dark variety.
"
1," Bottle (small - 330ml?). Reddish brown, very slightly cloudy. Loose off-white head. Subtle aroma, mainly yeasty. Forestaste is quite sharp, perhaps pears, quickly giving way to a richer sweeter raisin / malty taste with plenty of complexity. This in turn gives way to a bitter but rich aftertaste. Its full bodied with plenty of carbonation. Its high in alcohol and whilst that is apparent it certainly doesnt dominate. A great beer.
"
1,  Pours a deep dark maroon with a tight cap of off white bubbles.		Aroma
1," Pours light brune and cloudy, with the well developed lace expected. Spicy, nutty, earthy. Full flavored brew, nutty, yeasty, Belgian spicing. A beer to be enjoyed.
"
1," Okay, opening this was akin to open a champagne bottle. Lovely amber color with nice white/light tan head. Nice taste to it and a mouthfeel that most macrobrews brag about and dont even come close or actually denegrate. I love it, but I wish it wasnt so expensive.
"
1," Poured coffee brown with diminishing off white head.  Doughy aroma.  Bittersweet flavor.  I really want to like this beer because of its reputation, but the flavor doesnt do anything for me.  There are so many other beers Id rather have before this one.
"
1," When poured, this beer had an abundant light tan head that lasted throughout the entire tasting session.  It had a pleasant aroma of bread/bisucits, and a smooth palate and drinkability that well hid any taste of alcohol.  One could drink a lot of these too easily.
"
1," Deep brownish black with red glow. Medium creamy tanned head.	Aroma of fruits, yeast, faint raisin and liquorice.	Flavour is sweet liquorice, raisin, fruit some yeast, followed by some bitterness. One off the lesser trappisten beers if you ask me, but that doesnt mean this isnt a very good beer.
"
1," This beer has a much more malty aroma then taste. It has a dark amber appearance. Very nice yellowish dead. A nice crisp citric flavor. A really nice beer
"
1," MAY 24, 2008 Bottled and draft.  My favorite Chimay of the 4 varieties available at the abbey.  Very dark beer, very smooth and easy to drink with zero aftertaste.  Above average Trappist beer well worth purchasing.  Probably the easiest Trappist bier to buy.  Good beer to have with dinner.
"
1," Poured a deep, cloudy, amber brown with a tall white head which lasted to coat the glass. The nose had a dark fruit and yeasty spiciness. The flavor was full of raisins and plum with a complex molasses flavor. There was a spiciness from the belgian yeast that balanced a slight carmel/biscuit flavor. A definite alcohol warming was present. The finish was dry and vinious with alcohol lingering in the aftertaste. A nicely done, complex and interesting beer.
"
1," Nice red color with cream colored head.  Musty and fruity aroma.  Bitter and fruity flavor with hint of alcohol.  Smooth and creamy finish.
"
1," Draught (atlanta) nitro.  Black body with tan head.  Aroma is mocha, and very roasty.  Oatmeal, and sweetness in flavor.  Finishes with a weird tasting sugar flavor.
"
1," Aroma of yeast.  Flavors of yeast, spice, malt and some cherries.  Very drinkable.
"
1," NOV 5, 2007 Bottle conditioned and courtesy of the LCBO. Shared with the wife. Drank before the Chimay White so I could compare these two styles from the monastery. Poured a dark bronze colour, with a very foamy off-white head. Gives off a rich fruity aroma, full of mulling spices. Initial taste was a little metallic, and I think this is beecause I served it a little too cold. As the beer warmed the aroma intensified, and started to exhibit its characeterisics very pleasantly in the flavour. The carbonation was nice on the tongue, and helped tone down some of the sweetness from the malt. A classic beer.
"
1," Pours a cloudy coppery brown with a slight tan head.  Fades to moderately thick lacing.  The nose is too subtle for me to effectively describe, what little I get is reminscent of dark fruits.		Full mouthfeel, nice and crisp, the initial sweetness fades to a slightly metallic aftertaste.		Overall its not bad, but despite its authenticity and background its not even close to becoming my favorite in this style.
"
1," Had this beer on 9/19/2006.  Over carbonated, overflowed when I opened the bottle and could only get about an inch before it over foamed in the glass.  Aroma is mild with a scent of roasted malt.  Color is a deep black.  Taste is dry and toasted.  Starting with a medium body it goes down with a crisp roasted taste coming on and smooth feel.  Finish come is with a bright roasted flavor that turns to a bitter burnt taste and ends with a dry bitterness.  Even looking past the carbonation problem it still just isnt a good Oatmeal Stout.
"
1," 12 oz bottle.  Pours a nice rich deep chocolate black with a velvety tight frothy head and nice lace.  Carbonation is very high though.  Aroma is strogn with dark rich robust dark roast coffee- and reminds me a lot of the Bells Java- it has that fresh coffe ground smell and is sharp and earthy with a licorice character which I like.   High carbonation detracts from the flavors a bit- ligther on the coffee, with some chocolate malts, chocolate mints,  leather, tar and anisette.  Finsih is a bit tart and licorice like and the mouthfeel again is hurt by the over carbonation.
"
1," Beautiful Copper color with thick white head.  Extensive lacing and wonderful aroma (strong enough to taste).  Smooth palate belies higher alcohol content.  All in all a great beer.
"
1," Bottled sample via mnurda. Orange in colour with a bit of haze and some floaties. Average carbonation. Aromas of citrusy hops and roasted malt. A bit of vanilla sweet malt in the mouth, with the grapefruit-orange hop elements showing up mid-sip. Theres a nice black pepper bitterness on the back finish, which sharpens up the mouthfeel nicely. Could use a bit more hop presence on the nose, but a pretty good IPA otherwise.
"
1," Thick, chewy caramel, butterscotch and toffee with floral hop notes in the aroma.  Clear, deep, copper coloured body is topped by a thin, dense, cream coloured head that coats the glass.  Caramel malt sweetness is balanced nicely by assertive bitterness.  Earthy, floral hop notes offer counterpoint.  Medium body with low carbonation that feels right for the style.  Sampled on tap with Oakes and CapFlu at Sailor Hagars in North Van in May 2007.
"
1," (Draught) Sampled at the Great Canadian Beer Festival 2007 in Victoria on September 8th, 2007. Green tea flavour. Wow. Tea-bagging goodness.
"
1," Bottle@Home. Dusty malts and toffee aroma. Very dark brown, small beige diminishing head, no lace. Lots of dark malts in the flavor, light sweet, bitter, toffee and butterscotch. Typical German style bock.
"
1," Growler courtesy of hopscotch. The pour is brown with copper edges and tan head. The aroma is modestly sweet and earthy creating a pleasing aromatic sensation. The taste has a nice malty goodness to start with a wedge of tin plated earthiness. It becomes somewhat caramel like midway while a note of malt roastiness joins in and takes this toward the finish. It ends with lingering malty sweetness and smooth earthiness.
"
1," 	Bottle at GBBF. Translucent dark brown with a slight film. Roasty caramel with a lager-like finish. A little on the thin side.
"
1," i had chimay for the first time the other day. i was very impressed. it has a high alcohol content but no bad taste. very smooth.
"
1," nice dark brown appearance with a tan head.  flavor is full and of raisons and malts.  a solid double.  a good beer
"
1," bottle. pours cloudy red with a small tan coloured head. plum and biscuits in the nose and pleasant bitterness in the mouth. full body, light carbonation, long aftertaste and very balanced. great beer.
"
1," Good beer.  Beautiful huge head. Can taste the alcohol on the palate.  Very good beer.  Wish someone had warned me about opening it though, as I got it everywhere.
"
1," Draught sample at Stogies and Stouts 2008. Will update rating asap when my head stops pounding.
"
1," Light golden color.  Slight hoppy, fruity aroma -citrus.  Hoppy, slight citrus palate.  I dont know, i didnt get much from this beer, Oakes attested that it had been better, maybe an old sample.
"
1," This is just the right Belgian taste, but safe.  Id love to go to Chimay, though, and have it in the place where it began.	Very aromatic with longlasting thick head
"
1," Nectar of the gods. Hands down, the greatest beer I have ever drank.
"
1," Bottle.  Sour malt aroma - sort of similiar to a barnyard but indicatvie of the style.  Medium tan clear color.  Complex flavor - sour malt with hints of grass, hay and a mild hops finish.  Pretty much the best example of a Kellerbier you can get from a bottle.
"
1," Light golden in color with a light sweet honey aroma. Mostly hop flavour with a bit of honey, poor aftertaste.
"
1," From the handpump this has a great citric hop aroma.  Quite fresh smelling.  That is where the goodness ends.  The two words that best describe this beer are thin and bland.  Very little in the way of malt and not much in the way of hops either.  Tasted like a weak hop tea.  Golden in color with some haziness and a medium and fully dissipating head.
"
1," Hailsa !	 This is why the Vikings raided monastaries !	Rich brown colour smooth cream head. It sifts in over the tounge like silk. A woody malt flavor is beautiful. Top it off with an alcohol content that will knock the horns of your helmet.	from a 750
"
1," Pours a deep, dark reddish caramel brown with about a finger of creamy, tan head that reduces to a thin skin; creamy lace and nice legs. On the nose are dry red wine, sweet roasted malt and faint alcohol. Medium-bodied, effervescent and vinous with a dry lingering finish. Sweet roasted malt, raisins, plums, spice and dry red wine. Quite tasty and definitely worth revisiting.
"
1," Bottle.   Sweet syrupy malt aroma.  Reddish brown color.  Sweet malt flavor with only a slight hops finish.  On the watery side.  Nothing special.
"
1," Draft. A black beer with a tan head. Roasted malts in the nose. Roasted coffe taste. Best beer at 7 Bridges imo.
"
1," Not a bad cider, I prefer apple ciders and am anxious to try Seven Sisters apple, but the pear goes down smooth with a nice clean crisp pear flavor.
"
1," Dark pour.  Nice foamy head. Notes of grapes, raison, apricots, cherries and a noticible trail of alcohol.  I would likely choose this over the Chimay blue any day. Very enjoyable and delicious.
"
1," Cask Handpump at the Hillsborough Hotel, Sheffield 16/12/2006	Fruit aroma. Amber golden coloured hoppy and fruity with a crisp and slightly bitter malt finish.
"
1,"	Lightly toasted bread flavors dominate this quenching and straightforward Vienna-cum-Dunkel, developing a round and discreetly fruity session lager.		Further Personal Perceptions"
1," When opening a bottle of this proceed with caution. There is so much carbonation that I literally thought that I wasnt going to get to have any of it since it was pouring on the bar. This was a very hard beer for me to find, but once found, was worth the effort. I enjoyed the rich taste with hops that were not overpowering. Worth every penny. On to finding the rest of these beers.
"
1," black, white foam, average carbonation, medium sweetness, lightly bitter, earthy, cloudy, one of the best dark brown Belgians youl find
"
1," Bottle purchased at Corral Liquors in Granite City, IL. Pours a hazy burgundy with a finger of somewhat creamy, beige head that diminishes to a thin cap. The nose is of a somewhat astringent burnt caramel that transitions to an ""off"" phenolic/plastic note; not terribly enticing. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium-bodied and almost creamy-slick, finishing mildly dry and astringent. The flavor follows the nose with an additional roasted nut note. This is a decent brown, but the astringency and plastic note detract from the overall effect. Its not bad, but its not particularly good either.
"
1," Pours a deep orange, almost a red color with a big head and lots of lace. The aroma is plenty of grassy hops with a touch of citrus and pine with a bit of fruity malt in the back ground. The flavor is dry and grassy, very bitter, actually a bit brash and has an overwhelming character of that strong orange rind bitterness. The palate is a bit thin.  A little more balance on the hops and I would like this beer a lot.
"
1," bottle, thanks to pivnizub! Golden yellow, medium-sized head. Wonderful aroma of hops and malt. Wel-balanced beer, malty and hoppy, hints of grain. I especially liked the hops here.
"
1," Aventinus?  High quality brew but not quite my style.  Tastes like Aventinus but a tiny less sweet.  Spicy.  Needs just a bit more fruitiness.  Nice head retention
"
1," Sampled @ the Springfield, PA location.   Candi Sugar dominates this Belgian Ale.  Beer was on the flat side but had a nice crimson color.   Enjoyable Belgian Ale, I did not expect John Harvards to have it in its line-up.
"
1," Draft. Amber in the glass with a creamy off-white head that had thick lace and some lasting. Aroma and flavor had plenty of pine support with light malt. Medium body and a medium bitterness.
"
1," slightly cloudy, dark copper/brown, thin white head, very fruity and yeasty, maybe a hint of alcohol, lightly hopped, grass, very distinct fruitiness  some cherries, prunes, citrus; flavor is sweet and fruity, some bitterness and alcohol, definite yeast presence, earthy and lightly sugary  malty as well, not overly complex but well done
"
1," Bottle. Golden, off-white foam. Spicy bisquit malt, aromatic hop aroma. Medium chewy body, slick mouthfeel, grainy base, green apples and a hint vegetables, aromahops. Orangepeel retronasal. Overall pleasant enough I though.
"
1," DEC 14, 2004 flowery malty goodness.  yeasty flavours, brown murky appearance.  fairly enjoyable.
"
1," Great Canadian Beer Festival  2009  Victoria BC 	A tasty lager this was a fun brewery with a great staff of people.
"
1," 25 oz bottle at Zenos.  Pretty dark brown pour with a creamy lacing.  Deep aroma of chestnuts, figs, toffee, and caramel.  Rich and smooth.  Nice, rich flavor, exploding with the figs.  Soft, carbonation, a little boozy.  An awesome brew and a great bottle...I think this one had at least a year on it.
"
1," Pours black with a small, rapidly dissipating head.  Pretty much straight coffee aroma with a bit of sweetness.  Standard but nice coffee flavor.  Not bad but not as creamy as I prefer my oatmeal stouts to be on the palate.
"
1," A thick, foamy head results in a dense layer of bubbles on the surface of the beer.  The aroma was predominantly wheat, malt, and a general fruitiness (raisins, dates, apricots, citrus).  Flavors were a complex blend of malt, yeast, caramel, dried fruits (dates, raisins), citrus (orange, lemon), some general spiciness, and some slight hint of hops in the finish.  Really great, one of the greatest dubbels without question...
"
1," Thin head which lasts the length of the drink.  Nice hotspot of carbonation that keeps a thin film of bubbles circulating on the surface.  Murky dark brown in color.  Aroma is typical of a lot of belgian strong ales with copious amount of malt, dark fruits and a littles bit of spices.  Flavor is the same.  Hides its alcohol well.  Finish is slightly sweet but smooth and a little warming.  A good quality belgian strong ale but nothing that really sets it apart from others in its group.
"
1," bottle.  Poured black with a slight head.  Tasted barely like any coffee stout Ive ever had.  Slight coffee flavor but big stale olive flavor.  What the $#@%?  This cant be how it is supposed to taste.
"
1," 12 oz bottle.  Pours a rusty brown color with an average beige head.  Smells of sweet malt, tea, and brown sugar.  Tastes of bread crust, grains, sugar, and tea.  Aftertaste is slightly sweet, and dry.  Very little hop presence.  Not too bad.
"
1," Refrigerated big bottle poured into a tulip.  The taste is heavy.  It pours a medium hazy brown with some head.  The mouthfeel is good and has nice lacing.  The taste is sweet malt (mostly caramalized sugar), dried fruit, with a hint of yeasty spice.  This is good beer, but not the best I have had of the style.
"
1," Served slightly warm.  Flavors of slightly sour grapes and plastic.  Sweet throughout as well.  Not that great.  Smooth, but slightly watery.  Alcohol is not too noticeable.
"
1," Clear golden with a medium white head. Aroma was malty with breadish notes. Flavour was sweet with caramel, malty and mild hoppy notes. Finished dry.
"
1," Aroma is sweet bourbon vanilla. Taste is sweet, hoppy, dank, and vanilla.  	Flavor was sweet, and earthy, as Ughsmash mentions.  	Scant notes as I was not impressed.
"
1," yuck. adjuncty, fruity, there's nothing right about this. by bjcp I suppose all this fits under the crappy definition but this is bad. fizzy and bland. a beer only a coors light lover could love
"
1," Bottle 50 cl. Courtesy of fiulijn. Pours a clear deep amber with an off-white head. Sweet caramel nose - and surprise, surprise.....Belgian yeast WTF? Solid body, very sweet caramel and again these yeasty notes. Warming alcohol in the finish, but hardly any hops. What a strange creation. 010411
"
1," FEB 14, 2004 Murky brown color with a medium head. Fruit filled aroma. A malty flavor with some dark fruit, caramel, and chocolate. I would almost call this one Chimay Blue light. A nice Dubbel and this is quickly becoming one of my favorite styles.
"
1," JAN 9, 2011 	Date"
1," DEC 9, 2008 11.2 oz bottle Pours a darker brownish red with a medium sudsy creamy beige head that settles into something silky.  Aroma is faint, some nutty spice, dark fruit, sweet toffee malt.  Sweet dark fruit, slightly burnt malts, yeasty, a good amount of alcohol, light nuttiness, some bitterness as well.   Much richer fuller flavor than the rouge but still not unbelievable like I remember it.   The palate is also much better than the rouge, while still a little light, its airy, silky, but still has a nice consistency. 	7 4 8 4 15 		Grand Reserva Magnum 	wow... so much better and as complex as I remember it being years ago...	8 4 8 4 16
"
1," Bottle. Pours a dark, murky amber with a medium, beige head. Aroma is fruity and spicy, dried dark fruits mostly, some clove, caramel. Taste is fairly sweet maltiness, dried dark fruits, some spiciness. Some herbal hoppiness in the finish. Palate is pretty full.
"
1," On draught at the brewpub.  Pours a slightly cloudy amber into the glass, with a diminished head that leaves sparse lace. The nose is of light citrus and florals. Flavors are bitter, citrusy, with more than a hint of clove added. The lingering bitter finish is accompanied by a medium body and lively palate. Although the mouthfeel is cleansing, it is a tad like a hop tea, with the balance not quite up to par in the malt arena to equal out the active bitters.
"
1," Good thing I wasnt looking for a favorite new dunkel at the time.  In fairness, the freshness, unmarked on the bottle, is suspect.  It poured a hazy reddish brown with a film of large bubbles in lieu of a head.  Theres a strong caramel and butterscoth aroma, and the flavor coming from a watery mouthful is mainly weak caramel.  Id try this again if I knew the bottle to be fresh.
"
1," JAN 8, 2005 Dark chestnut colour.  Very toast flavour.  Sweetish palate.  Hint of roast; nutty notes.  Enjoyable example.
"
1," Bottled at Monks Caf Wallingatan, Stockholm.  Clear copper colour, small head. Concentrated perfumy nose with pine needles and mango. Fairly sweet with clean, rounded mouthfeel and medium body. Lightly roasty with salty, lightly resiny finish providing good bitterness. Pleasant unheralded IPA.
"
1," JUN 25, 2008 My favorite of the Chimay offerrings.  Very good triple.  I need to get another bottle of this because I dont remember the exact flavors and aroma, just that it was a huge hit with my tasting friend and I.   UPDATE tasted again on draft"
1," On tap at the Disney World location.  Pours a cloudy golden yellow with an average lacing white head.  Aroma of wheat, cloves, citrus, mettalic, flowers and banana.  Flavors of the same.
"
1," Large headed beer with a slight aromatic fruity aroma.  The beer is very palatable for something so strong.  Its only niggle is the slight liquorice aftertaste.
"
1," Pours ruby/amber with thick off white head.  Aroma of caramel and malt.  Taste is dominated by malt.  Medium mouthfeel.  Not bad.
"
1," Pours a dark redish brown with an off-white thick head. Smells like bread and flowers. Very carbonated in the mouth. Tastes sweet, spicy and fruity. Feels light in the mouth and finishes clean. My first B.S.A. Yummy in my tummy!!!
"
1," One of the best tasting beers I have ever had, but sadly, it was WAY too over carbonated.  Felt like I was drinking beer flavored champagne.  Probably would be better after sitting a while, but it rtasted so good I just couldnt let it sit.
"
1," 33cl bottle. Pours a nice reddish brown colour with a beige head that dies away early. I am enjoying the yeasty, fruity alcholic esthers on the nose. Some plums, raisins and caramel coming through also. Flavours similar with Belgian candi sugar, caramel, yeast, toffee and treacle. A lingering berry flavour rounds this off nicely. Ths must be my favourite Chimay.
"
1," From MI2CA, thanks for going through all the effort to find this for me, a trade that was months in the making.  Pours a dark brown, almost black color.   Aroma is what I was hoping for, new and different.  There is an orange/licorice spice coming out, not sure what it is but its but its not overbearing, just there.   Taste is light dark biscuit with light sweet earthiness to it.  Very easy drinking and has none of the typical Belgian yeast dominance. I think its very quaffable with its low bitterness.  Its a nice obscure style and I wish I could try more like this.22oz bomber, Rodenbach smaller tulip glass.
"
1," Tap at the Railway Club.  Deep amber with a thick, sticky and persistent off-white head.  Vienna and munich malts, light nuttiness and brown sugar.  Flavour is very sweet and nutty.  Nice toasted malt, brown sugar and caramel.  A bit of earthy hops and some lingering nuttiness round out the finish.  It is a bit sweet, but not cloying.  The malts here are very fresh tasting.  Quite a nice brew.
"
1," Tap at the brewpub. Nice black pour with moccha head. Light aroma of roasted grain with hints of coffee and chocolate. Light, dry, roasted bitter taste. A beautiful palate, just perfectly creamy and still refreshingly dry in the finale. Well done pub stout.
"
1," on tap @ chattanooga.  Light watery appearance, with a little bit of head.  Musty damp cardboard aroma, with a flavor that I think if I may quote myself, just sucks.  Bitter beer face alert.
"
1," This beer was a little too malty for my taste. It is not a bad beer, just not one of my favorites. I will trying this one from the tap to see if it is better.
"
1," courtesy of ft polk liquor store Pours dark brown with medium-sized beige head; aroma of dark fruit, spices, hints of licorice and floral notes; medium to full-bodied, smooth carbonation; flavor of caramel malt, fruits and hot spiciness; a kind of empty finish leaves you waiting for the climax to come (vainly); the aftertaste, then, coming sort of delayed, is really the best part of the beer including rich notes of caramel, ripe fruits, licorice and spices
"
1,"	This English-style Pale Ale develops caramelized cereals atop earty and leafy hops, creating a sweetish quencher.		Further Personal Perceptions"
1," Had this with some Chimay cheese. The superb synergy of the pairing drove me to bump my rating a bit for this marvelous beer.
"
1," (750ml bottle, best by 07/11, thanks to blutt59) clear and littered with white bubbles. Nose of skunk, sugar, and earth. Where are the hops? Taste is VERY earthy, oranges, herbal. Not very good.
"
1," SEP 24, 2007 Re-Rate...Pours ruby brown with a thick disappearing foamy head. Yeast and fruity sweet malty aroma, with a hint of toffee, spice, and just a bit of alcohol. Slightly fruity and spicy yeast flavors are the most notable, with notes of cherries and slight floral hops. Palate is medium, warming, full of lively carbonation, and bitter-sweet. Enjoyable and fairly complex strong ale.
"
1," Pours jet black with a full tan creamy head.  The smell  is wonderful.  Full of smoke, molasses, and a deep woodsiness.  The flavor is full and complex.  Definitely some of that smoke coming through coming through, some charred wood, an earthiness, and some sweet malts.
"
1," 33 cl bottle, hazy golden pour with large head that quickly dissipates to a fine ring, hopyy upfront with good fruity flavor, finish tailed off a little too much and became more bitter than I would like.
"
1," 0.33 l bottle, 2006. Mahagony color with creamy head. Malt, banana, nuts, raisins, almonds, rum and alcohol in the aroma. Very pleasant aroma. The flavor is sweetish with raisins, alcohol, clove and pepper. Clove, pepper and caramel in the finish. A great beer with cheese.
"
1," [Bottle, 75cl, fresh, chilled]	Everything has been said on this. Lets just say that its another great trappist. Fruity nose.. plum/berry. Malt hits first then a bitter hint get noticed. Fine beer overall. To my opinion, the palate is the only deceiving part of the beer..  I guess i had high expectation for that beer but i find the body a little light,  the texture thin and the finish abrupt..
"
1," 4 May 2011, bottle. mahogany colour, clear, some steady bubbles and slight frothy head. yeast is soft and unagressive, malt is prominent but not really big or too sweet. there is a slight soapy aroma. cant find much alcohol on the nose. not what i expected to smell from a trappist/belgian strong ale. full body and fairly fizzy. nice flavour. alcohol comes out more but not aggressively, yeast is there but soft. some coca cola, some tart yeastiness, roasted malt. definitely my favourite chimay but not the best belgian strong ale, though it is more balanced than normal.
"
1," 12 oz bottle..  appears a light straw yellow, white fizzy head.  nose is light, sweet lagery.  taste is bittersweet light malt, pinch of hop bitter, crisp.  tastes about as i expected.
"
1," its all a bit ho hum really... not a tough guy beer (that is, not for me...)
"
1," 750 from Fresh Market, Raleigh. Another one of those beers thats so ubiquitous that we beer geeks overlook them in the quest for the new. Dark brown pour with a very vibrant body, lots of carb and an abundant head. Slightly fruity in the aroma, and its there in the flavor too. But this is a sweet malty beer through and through, with a smooth velvety mouthfeel. Just a hint of bitterness comes on late to make things interesting, but this is basically a lush, warming malty beer.
"
1," 650ml brown bottle. Pours out a lemon yellow color, typical wit haze. Small white head is creamy and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Nose has citrus notes of lemon and lime, light sweetness, light spice and coriander note. Flavor has notes of puffed wheat cereal, lemon citrus notes, faint spice and trace of nuttiness and some sweetness that may be from the coconuts. Dryish finish, a little wheaty aftertaste. Light in body, average carbonation. Coconut isnt adding a lot to this brew, I like the concept though. Overall, its drinkable, but pretty light example of witbier.
"
1," In my opinion, Abbey Doubles do not get any better than this. Hint of sweet fruits, cherry and banana. Silky smooth with no alcohol coming through whatsoever. The best from Chimay.
"
1," This is a Strong beer.  Got a glass at from a 2008 jeroboam of the Grande Reserve.  Alcohol and yeast flavors dominate with a golden ale taste in the background.  The score is low because it is not my favorite style. Also the bar was dark so I couldnt really rate the appearance.
"
1," 750 mL bottle. Poured dark brown with a solid off tan head. A nice drink, with small hints of sweetness that I could not really place. I may have to try this one again because it seemed to be hiding more flavor that I could not seem to taste.

1," caramel and brown sugar with red berries, red fruits and yeast; mouthfeel is very smooth with pleasant, smooth carbonation, medium bodied; flavor of sweet caramel and strawberry-like fruitness and yeast, and it is at the same time refreshing and warming, maybe a bit of like ""berryjuice"", but not in the bad sense. One could call this an ""easy"" trappist, which is pretty much is, but excellent whatsover.
"
1," Light orange colour with off white head.  Decent malts with a hoppy taste.  Found the finish to be a bit bitter.  Not overly impressed.
"
1," Totally clear, very pale scintillating golden. Tight white cover leaving convincing lacing. A rather surprising appearance for a beer that claims its inspiration from the like of Westmalle Tripel, but the aroma feels more authentic than the clearness. The two most obvious aromas got to be honey and alcohol. They are backed by a firm cerealic pils malt base though, so the ensemble avoids the meady path that some less refined tripels take. Nicely warming. Fairly phenolic. Floral, very soft noble hops. A touch of peppery spiciness, maybe even a subtle coriander spicing - could also be grains of paradise is noticed. Id tend to think it was more of a yeast side-effect. The spicy feel enhances the otherwise overly smooth bitterness. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation for the style. A fine tripel, possibly my favourite from a Quebec brewpub.
"
1," Not as good as the other two for sure. Very creamy, fluffy head. Seems lighter than the other 2 and not as flavorful. I'd drink this baby every day though...
"
1," Bottle.  Poured an attractive brown color with a nice head.  Flavor of roasted malt and fruit. Really excellent beer and a style I need to explore further.
"
1," Bottle Pours a hazy brownish red witha nice modest faomy off white head.    Aroma is mainly the musty belgian slant with some light pitted fruit.   Soft woody flavor with that dusty musty flavor.  Not much of the belgian spice but sublte and easy.   Nice.
"
1," Pours golden with white head, aroma is lemon and biscuit.  Taste is lemony up front with a bit of other citrus, taste is biscuit and bread with a dry and slightly bitter finish.  Pretty good lager!
"
1," 25 oz. bottle.  Dark amber pour with small head (when poured correctly). Sweet malts, alcohol and sugar in the aroma. Raisin, caramel, yeast and slightly noticeable but not overpowering alcohol. A great beer for any season.
"
1," ""FOr me, this beer was better in the aroma and appearance than flavor. Great smell-floral and sweet. Carbonation is present. Sweet caramel flavor. Only drawback, atleast for me, was the alcohol took too much of a starring role, instead of blending in with the rest of the characteristics. I felt and tasted the alcohol more than the malt or hops.""
"
1," Bottle - thanks sigma23.  Pours a dark brown with a large, creamy brown head.  Nose is rich with heavy roast, light cocoa, vanilla, and a light bourbon note.  Tastes deep in roast, mocha, espresso, vanilla, and very faint bourbon.  Creamy and rich, but the heavy roast and espresso really dominate the entire experience.
"
1," DEC 24, 2006 One of my favorites, which probably doesnt mean anything to you. When I have another I will promise to leave good notes. This beer is expensive where I am from, but its more than worth it. UPDATE 7/15/04"
1," SEP 3, 2006 Complex taste.  Fruity tasting , mostly apricot and maybe a hint of plum, some spices that are unknown to me.  Yeast setiment at bottom of bottle.  Beautiful hazy, dark copper color.  My first Chimay and boy have Ive been missing out.  One bottle will warm you up nicely on a cold winter night. Cant wait to try the Blue next week.
"
1," JUL 19, 2011 Couleur orange cuivre avec beaucoup deffervescence. Plus lgre que la Chimay bleue avec ses notes dabricots et de prunes.
"
1," An orange beer with a thin beige head. The aroma is sweet hoppy with hints of caramel. The flavor is nicely hoppy, and the alcohol burns slightly on the tongue.
"
1," Pours a cloudy gold with a lot of yeast floating in the beer and a big, foamy head. The aroma is of mild hops, not bitter, just lightly fruity and fresh, and some sweetness from the malt as well. Flavor follows the nose, mainly tasting fresh and fairly light. It is somewhat sweet, with a dry, hoppier finish. This beer is very subtle, with nothing ever being aggressive. Very nice.
"
1," hazy amber coloration with nice frothy head and great lacing. Im very excited for this beer, as i have enjoyed what ive had from chimay and ive never had an abbey tripel before. aroma reminds me of a belgian white, but strong and very yeasty. very smooth flavor of yeast and slight hints of lemon and alcohol. nice dry finish, really delicious beer very different from my usual beer parousals. really really nice, especially as summer starts up.
"
1," Not a fan of this one.  Everything about the beer screamed wheat.  The color was that of wheat, as was the aroma.  The taste was, as a friend put it, like sucking on a piece of wheat.  If I wanted to do that, I would move to Iowa.
"
1," dark brown with little head, an aroma with a trace of nuttiness and oats to it, but could have been stronger. Decent nutty bite on the taste.
"
1," Dark red/brown color and a medium head size.  The aroma is mighty complex, bready malt smell (a la St. Bernardus,) and a smoked salmon and chesse smell.  Flavor is a good blend of the smooth complex malts and some noticable hops.  There is a definate sweetness to this, but it still comes through with the  tint of flavor of good packaged smoked salmon.
"
1," What a fine looking beer. Pours reddish/honey colored with a beautiful head. Lovely little bubbles that just stay there. Smells clean and crisp. Aromas of flowery malt and just a hint of hops too. The taste lives up the that clean crisp smell. Almost a bit champagne in body with the bubbles whisking by your tongue. The bitterness is mild but present. Just a touch metallic.
"
1," Deep rich chocolate brown with a nice airy head with outstanding lacing.  Light brown sugary aroma.  Incredibly smooth and easy to drink for a 9% elixir.  This is easily malty, with just a teaser of fruit.  Classic.
"
1," Initial taste is of old nickels. After the first few sips, the fruit essence comes through and a creamy body balances everything out. This is a good beer indeed, though a little overrated in my opinion. Still, very enjoyable and recommended.
"
1," On tap at the Disney World Boark Walk location. Poured a darker brown color with a small sized off white head. Aromas and tastes of chocolate (stronger in the aroma), nuts (stronger in the tastes), and caramel. Lively body.
"
1," Malty aroma with toffee and caramel. Malty taste. I found coffee, caramel and hints of roasted malt and tropical fruit.	A clean, fresh and not too sweet beer.
"
1," I prefer Chimay Red over Chimay blue. It is mellow and full of flavor. A t really good Belgian ale. The flavor does seem to dissipate quickly at the finish so it loses some pts for that.
"
1," One of the greatest beers ever. The aroma and palate bring to mind a musty, ancient underground brewery in a trappist monastery, with damp stone walls that are two feet thick.
"
1," I really enjoy this beer. Pours a hazy reddish color. Has very different complex flavors , has hints of yeast and apricot. Overall very good dubbel
"
1,"	This super clean and very timid Blueberry Ale focuses on its sweet fruitiness, producing a round body and linear flavors not necessarily conducive to refreshment.		Further Personal Perceptions"
1," Still prefer the blue one, but this one ranks with the top.
"
1," Light bond, silky head. Chardonnay nose, crisp. Actually, this one is solid for a light lager. Crisp hoppiness accompanied by an easy, fresh-milled grain undercurrent.
"
1," Draught @ Duvel Cafe, Stockholm 080425. Typical Cimay aromas of roses, coriander, marzipan and some yeastiness. Flavor and palate is very surprising. I never thought a beer could taste like fresh shellfish. Gravelly, salt, citrus and dill. The finish is slightly sour and bitter. But what happened with the flavor?
"
1," MAR 20, 2003 Now this is some great Ale,these Trappist Monks know what fits my taste. Once you poor this nice . beverage, you immedialtely know that you have an exceptional Ale. Dark and rich, complex flavors fill your palate and let know know that you have arrived at Qualities door. Best I have had so far, but my Westvleteren Abt 12 & 8 are on the way as is my Rochefort Trappistes 10. Then we will see, just as I know the best pancakes are in Gatlinburg, Tennessee at the Pancake Pantry, maybe I will see then who has the worlds best beer. Taste is always a matter of opinion, and my opinion is that this is a classic Ale.Let it warm some and the flaovrs explode. Wake up America this is what we ought to be drinking, especially on special occasions.
"
1," on cask at blackfriars, glasgow. deep amber, thin creamy head, slight peat in the aroma, light caramel, average strong ale

1," Clear brown body topped off with a small tan head. There is a very apply aroma mixed with malt. The flavor is a nice balanced malt flavor with floral notes and a bit of citrus and sweetness.
"
1," DEC 28, 2006 Oh my god, this was delicious!!! ""Sex in a Glass"". Pours a deep ruby color with a ""1 finger"" slightly off white head. Malty, yeasty nose. Smooth, incredibly drinkable beer! Very full and complex. Divine (sinful???)!!
"
1," DEC 2, 2004 A somewhat fruity aroma. A dark brown beer that is easy to drink, and it does not taste of alcohol. A good beer, but not a personal favourite. Probably not the best beer in the world...
"
1," Atlanta.  On tap at Rock Bottom Restaurant and Brewery in Buckhead.  Hmm...how to describe this?  Corn.  Corn, corn, and more corn.  I can see an appeal to this beer, as it seems a bit tastier than most light beers.  But then, it tastes like corn.  Strongly of corn.  A nice brew, it looks quite pale with not mcuh head and is better as it warms.  If you like light brews, check this out.  Its not bad....just corny.
"
1," This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a small sized head of finely sized clear colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind a transparent very softly carbonated light orange colored body. The mild aroma was malty and corn. The semi-thick mouth feel was tingly at the start with a mellow finish. The flavor contained notes of hops dough and wheat. An OK brew just nothing special.
"
1," Draught at the brewpub. Weak banana and phenol aroma. Cloudy dark orange colour. Stable creamy white head. The flavour is more or less the same as aroma, slightly sweet with low bitterness.
"
1," This beer was sampled during the fabled Lynnwood International Swill Fest. It pours a clear golden yellow color with a soapy white head and small amounts of lacing...the stereotypical fizzy yellow beer. Without a doubt we were horrified from the start by the green bottle. The aroma is malty, somewhat hoppy, with corn, wheat, grass and perhaps banana....strange. The flavor is light bodied and cloyingly sweet in the finish with a malty but heavily corny mixture taking over. Definitely not a very appealing beer, but I imagine itd be much worse. It does have its fair share of skunked qualities, but again, not as bad as expected. Low carbonation levels.
"
1," All I can say is this is a great beer that I could drink all the time.
"
1," Well balanced beer. Strong sweet nose with aromas of caramel, chocolate, nuts.  Also light citrus flavours, herbal tones. In the flavor there were tones of raisins aswell. There is a long balanced aftertaste which evolves along flavour given before. Close to perfection in my opinion.	The beer combined very well with dried peppersausages, dutch hausmacher, and beef stew with sirop beerjus and mashed potatoe.
"
1," Served in a Chimay chalice.  Pours out dark with a lush head.  Initial impression is a playful, rich taste, but one that lingers pleasantly in the mouth.  A fine complement to the Chimay cheese - if you can find it.
"
1," Small bottle.  This is a really good beer.  Dark brown/orange color.  Nutty sweet smell and similar taste.  Finishes malty and crisp.  I enjoyed it, but probably best in the smaller quantity.
"
1," Pours beautiful red with a nice ruby head that lasts the whole glass, very nice.  Nose is malt, yeast, and alcohol notes, along with spice that is less sweet (cinnamon/allspice/clove) than spicy (oregano/basil/sage).  When it hits the tongue I think alcohol, bubbles, cherry and red plums, then caramel apples, and overall a strong yeasty, bready note.  To me the alcohol is not well masked in this (as opposed to Tripel Karmeliet or Westmalle, or even Grimbergen).
"
1," This is an excellent example of a trappist ale thats available almost uniformly throughout the united states.  Definitely a strong beer, the flavor is excellent though.
"
1," Pours darkish brown in coloration. Huge fruity nose definitely some heavy apple aroma, raisin and dark fruit, slightly boozy as well. Very sweet, but delicios regardless. Flavors consist of apple some dark fruits, raisin, caramel, and a little toffee. If I had to change anything maybe a bit less sweet. Otherwise an amazing beer.
"
1," Cloudy dark raisin like color.  Roasted malt, dark rock candy, plums and raisins.  A huge abundence of malty sweetness.  Not much in the way of bitterness.  Honestly was a little let down, but it is very good.
"
1," 33 mL / 75 cL bottle. Creamy brown head.	Really a nice and strong flavor and the alcohol isnt appearent.	A well famous beer but it deserved it
"
1," Poured into a Chimay goblet. Rusty in color with a tan head that leaves excellent Belgian lacing. Aroma is mainly dark esters, with some spiciness. Flavor consists of fig and raisin, with a candied malty undercurrent. Some yeast and phenolic flavors emerge with time. Medium bodied, good carbonation, minimal booziness.
"
1," Bottle 65 cl. Courtesy of fiulijn. Pours a clear deep golden with a rich and lacing off-white head. Amazingly fresh and citrusy hop aroma. Medium body, a little sweet fruit but the dry and pretty astringent Citra hops dominate. Very astringent finish. 080411
"
1," Bottle split with Muenster, Tronraner. A nice dark chocolate-colored pour into our glasses reveals a very heady brew. The aroma obviously has bourbon and a chocolate nut bar. The oats are very much noticed. In the mouth bourbon is easily noticed, but it doesnt overwhelm or interrupt the other flavors of the stout. Rather, it melds well with the chocolate/coffee flavors not to mention the dense toasted oats. The finish reminds me of a Girl Scout Samoa cookie, just imagine it not being sweet. This makes a great sipper with a medium-heavy palate and very assertive flavors.
"
1," This used to be my favorite beer.  Dark, rich, very strong, one bottle and I was good to go.  But you know, these days belgian strong ales are more accessible than ever.  I have to say that this trappist strong is now one of my least favorties of the majority.  Lots of malts, dark fruit, spices in the nose and taste.  But too much of an alchohol burn for my preference.
"
1," Beautiful beer. Pours with a NICE thick head (barring almost stripping all the skin off my fingers trying to take the cork out) and a dark ""cola"" red brown liquid. Odd scent, fruits of aged cider and grape. The scent also contains some smell of old musty wood.Some reasonable lacing on the glass. Not as fizzy as other Chimays on the tongue. Some definite sweet malts as well as it works around the tongue. Just ever so slight bitterness, but well-balanced. I dont quite pick up the direct raisin (not as a doppelbock) but there is some grape origin hints. Generally quite plesant (having this with a HUGE cheese plate)  and pairs well with food. (Bottle Pour 12/9/2006 - aged from my March birthday party)
"
1," ***old review from 2007***	Poured out a big foamy off white head, left some random messy lacing on top of a slightly hazy solid gold / slight amber brew. The aroma was nice and seemed warm. Slightly spicy (different) yeast, interesting malts and a bit fruity. The taste is pretty fine with good malts and some slightly spicy yeast. Comes across quite smooth and light with a good after taste with a light but lengthy bitter lingering. Is this stuff still even sold here anymore?
"
1," This isnt a bad little beer. Pours a clear red brown with a good creamy head. Good maltiness in the flavor with a little caramel. A touch of graininess like in whole wheat bread. Lightly sweet. Really good true session beer.
"
1," Once again the monks seem to exceed in all capabilities of brewery.
"
1," Sampled at Cellars Wine & Spirits in St Paul, MN. Pours an opaque dark brown brew with a thick brown head that quickly dissolves to a fine film and ring. Aroma of mostly dark roasted coffee, some toasted black malt, vanilla, and dark chocolate. taste is full bodied, very light carbonation, with dark coffee and chocolate flavors. Finish is slightly bitter with a long lasting coffee aftertaste.
"
1," Bottled. A hazy golden beer with an off-white head. The aroma has notes of wheat and malt. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt and wheat as well as lighter notes of banana, leading to a dry and wheaty finish. A bit boring. Thanks yespr for sharing.

1," Bomber courtesy of StFun.  Pours a clear dark reddish brown with minimal head.  Nose is light coffee, mild cocoa, roasted barley and smoke.  Taste is pretty much like the aroma, except theres a dark fruitiness right as you take a sip.  Lighter, prickly mouth feel.  Not bad  thanks Josh!
"
1," I find that the Chimay ales have a distinctive, spicy aroma that I find quite agreeable. Colour is cloudy amber with a nice, billowing white head that settles down to a 1 finger height and eventually all but disappears. Moderately carbonated, but with a very bitter finish, which is the one thing that for me prevents it from getting a higher score. (Next part written after 15-20 minutes) - OK, as emarkd below says, let this one warm up a bit and the bitterness begins to settle. Very true! Il bump my score up from 16 to 17.
"
1," 330 ml bottle. Best before the end of 2010. Gusher, but only a little. Dark copper colour with a bright red hue. Small, almost non-existing, off-white head. Soapy, dry mnchenermalt aroma. Crisp from high carbonation level. Quite dry with some malts. A bit disappointing as it is quite neutral flavourwise. Bland. Its balanced, but does not stand out in any way. Very disappointing. Will have to retry.

1," Ate at this place at Disney world recently.  This was the worst offering I tried there.  Golden lager, no hop presence.  Very light pale malt taste.

I havent really been able to dig the blue, so this might be interesting.	red/amber/brownish with a big smooth thick offwhite head.	aroma is a subdued dark fruits, caramel, faint toffee.	flavor is extremely balanced and complex, comes off as chocolate cake with cinnamon, with cocoa on top, in other words, spicces, chocolate, cocoa, sweet malts, very faint dark fruits.	i dont like chocolate cake with coacoa on top, and am not a fan of cinnamon, so this one gets a low rate.	even though it tastes rater bad, it is easy to register that it is a very well crafted beer.
"
1," AUG 18, 2009 Dark muddy brown with tan head.  Aroma of sugar, malt and bread.  Dark fruit in the initial taste, then caramel and cinnamon.  Mildly bitter finish.	Also tasted as Grand Reserve, methusela 25 of 25, on 17 August 2009, Birreria Paradiso.  No discernable difference.
"
1," Pours a nice cola colored brown.  Aromas of dark malts, fruit, and a touch of spice.  Has flavors of chocolate, caramel, and a touch of wood.
"
1," Small frothy head. Hoppy aroma with a hint of orange fruit. Malty, very fruity beer, especially orange and lemon are clearly noticed. No hopbitterness, good lacing. Refreshing, because the emphasis is on the fruit. Clean palate.
"
1," This was a medium bodied stout that was kind of thin for my taste.  When the stout arrived at the table there was absolutely no head on the beer.  This made for an overall weak tasting of the beer.  Dark brown in color, chocolate and coffee accent this stout well.
"
1," 330 ml bottle, 2006 vintage. Dark brown colour. Throws a tall off-white, perhaps even somewhat brownish, head that clings to the glass. High carbonation level. Soapy aromas with a clean hop finish. This is by aroma a clear indication of the beer has fermented very low. Little aroma to be found other than those mentioned. Crisp flavours with a sweetish mouthfeel. Finishes dry in the mouth from hop bitterness. This is not a bitter beer, but the finish is still surprisingly dry. Obvious Chimay yeast character that I recognize from my own homebrewed beers using the same yeast. I find the beer to be disappointing, and not very interesting. I find that the Chimay beers have lost much of their character over the last few years, something that is very unfortunate indeed as I remember then as very characterful beers.
"
1," FEB 12, 2008 From a 33cl botle in Lund.   A beautiful dark opaque chestnut color with a big and wild off-white head that leaves a delecate layer of foam after a few minutes.   The Aroma is of brown sugar and spiced apple, with a hint of bitter orange peel topping it off.   The flavor is sweet with lots of maltiness and some citrus, but the finish imparts some bitterness with the high ABV showing up  to close it off.   The mouthfeel is syrupy and thick, with good carbonation.   This is a good beer, maybe great, but I might like Chimay Red better because of its great balance of flavors.   Blue is definitely a complex and intense beer.   Im looking forward to trying another (8 4 8 4 16) - - - rerate"
1," Ahh, Chimay Red, its been a while.  I decided to retry it and found that I liked it a lot more this time around.  The prominent yeastiness was quite appealing and it had a lot more in common with Chimay Bleu than I remembered.  Used to be a 3.9, Im kicking it up some.		ORIGINAL RATING"
1," FEB 24, 2007 Very smooth, although I prefer the triple. Nice head, but a rather subtle smell and the taste is largely enjoyable
"
1," Pours a deep red with a small white head to it. Aroma is of spices, dark fruit possibly plums, yeast and a twinge of alcohol. I will say the aroma is really nice and this is a great beer to smell. The taste is nice with some spice and yeast. Alcohol is also noticed but the fruit I smelled in the aroma is not represented well in the taste which was dissapointing. Ends with a pleasing bitterness and astringency but carbonation is a bit high in my opinion. Also not nearly as silky a mouthfeel as expected.
"
1," Very opaque color, like roasted walnut.  A great taste, first starts with a sweet, full flavor, and ends with a little spice.  Understated and a good blend.  The alcohol only enhanced the overall taste.  Simply a great beer.

"
1," Bottle.  Pours a deep, dark brown.  Medium sized, khaki head.  Aroma of maple syrup, some warming alcohol.  Flavor is quite sweet with some bready notes.  Carbonation isnt quite as active as the White was.  This one is definitely the best out of the gift pack.
"
1," Bottle into trappist glass. Pours a rich amber color with a creamy tan head. The taste is of bread, ripe fruit, and a distinct spiciness from the yeast that sticks to the palate. Its a fairly pleasant beer to drink, but I wish the flavors were a little stronger.  Complex but understated.
"
1,"//www.ratebeer.com/Place/massachusetts/w target=blank>Julios Liquors) Stands out in appearance and palate but not ultra-remarkable flavor-wise...Pours murky brownish crimson with a perfectly level 1/2"" of biege head that recedes to a thin, lasting layer. Aroma is yeasty, bready with lighter hints of dark fruits and red wine. Mouthfeel is quite soft with fine, light carbonation. Lightly dryish. Flavor is quite yeasty with the lighter hints of dark fruit and red wine and lightly sour breadiness. Flavor was kind of on one plane though. Alcohol well-hidden.
"
1," At $11 a bottle this is not an everyday beer but as a special occasion beer I had none better. This beer always gives me a good feeling and its not just because its 750 ml of 9% alcohol. I have consumed far more alcohol than that without the general warm happy feeling that comes from Chimay Grand Reserve. Cannot be improved.
"
1," Bottle. Pours beautiful dark chestnut, a bit lighter where the glass thins out, with an initially tall, foamy, beige head that settles pretty quickly. Aroma is spicy Belgian yeast, some slightly sweet malts, dark fruit, tobacco, and alcohol. Flavor is somewhat sweet, quite malty, with a good dose of dark and ripe fruit,  a bit of mustiness, and even a twinge of hops. The mouthfeel is perfectly balanced between a soft carbonation, and an oily thickness. Very nice.
"
1," This beer is a disaster. It looked fine ,cloudy pale amber with lasting beige head.	The taste was a flat strong dirty line type taste, nothing more
"
1," This is a big malt beer.  Nothing else shows through.  Dark in color and cloudy, sweet and carmely, full of various rich malt flavors.  No hops to speak of.  Higher alcohol, but decadent to the last drop.  Truely a king among the Belgians.
"
1," 11.2 oz bottle from Whole Foods Market in Durham, NC. Reddish tinged brown color, hazy, with a thin layer of head on the surface of the beer. Bready and slightly fruity aroma with brown sugar notes. Taste is an earthy maltiness with brown sugar notes. Thin to medium bodied.
"
1," Seems that my Chimay reviews have dissappeared for the second time!  I dont know whats going on in the database.  Regardless, I like the blue second best of all of the Chimay Ales.  Good body and great tangy sour wheat flavor.  Hides the alcohol well.
"
1," Wish I could try one that had been stored for 5-10 years as someone wrote... As it stands, and based on a fresh batch, this is still a bloody good beer. Pours medium brown with a big tan head. Aroma is sweet caramel and wheat malts, belgian yeast, brown sugar, dark dried fruits (raisins, figs etc). Definitely some spices in there as well, of course. Taste is similarly sweet yet balanced, with lots of malts and yeast dominating but the hops balancing the whole thing up. Body is medium - actually kind of light but definitely not in a bad way - with a perfect amount of carbonation.
"
1," Bottle from Papago.  Pours with dissipating ring.  Nose introduces a strange Quebecois yeast quality.  Flavor is dark fruit, brown sugar, tannin, and more of the yeastiness.  Even finish - trails off in the effervescent Trappist way.
"
1," Mild burnt/roast malt, chocolate, coffee....all fairly subdued. The body is black with a mocha colored, thin head. Fairly strong coffee, mild chocolate. Sustained roastiness through the whole flavor range. Not a wower, but not at all a bad beer.

1," quite malty, some raisin and dried fruits like sweetness, some bready and yeasty notes, weak bitterness, a bit thin body, pretty dry finish, overall  pretty good but i had better.
"
1," Sampler at the Nashville location - Poured a reddish amber in color with no head or carbonation.  Aroma was of slightly sour malts and very little hops.  Flavor was medium malty with some hop bitterness, but not enough to provide balance for the malt.  Some bitterness on the finish.  The sour aftertaste is a major distraction.

1," VEyr bitte,r but still being an ale. The foam is nice and the taste a little sweet.
"
1," An 11.20oz. brown bottle poured into Chimay goblet. It pours a hazy, deep golden yellow with lots of carbonation producing a thick head.  The lacing remains throughout the session.  Aromas of bread dough yeasts up front with a hint of apple; alcohol and bread pudding sweetness finish it off.  The alcohol dominates the palate all the way to the back of the throat, not in an obnoxious way. Again the yeast is reminiscent of unbaked bread and the taste provides more sweetness than the nose, presumably from the malt. A quick bitterness in the middle shows off its hops. It has a heavy carbonation with medium body. As with all of the Chimays, a sipper, and a good one at that.

1," I tasted this beer before I got my account with ratebeer, so I cant really remember all the flavors.
"
1," Draft at brewpub. Poured a brown color with an average frothy off-white head that diminished slowly. with fair lacing. Good roasted malt and sweet aroma. Medium body. Good well balanced flavor of malt and a bitter sweet finish. Good brew.
"
1," Found this one bottled at a liquor store in St. John, Indiana, as part of a mix 12 pack of various beers from Indiana brewers. Cloudy, medium brown pour with a lacy head, a mild, malty nose, flavor is a bit on the soft side for a pale ale, but still the hoppiness is omnipresent, with plenty of muted citrusy and flowery hoppiness.  A decent brew -- and I wonder why the ""tavern style?""
"
1," Skunky nose (green bottle), Yellow and fizzy. Not much going on here, some dryness at the finish. Bland.
"
1," As I poured the beer my first thought is oh my! The beer pours a dark brown, with a light tan color for the head. The smell is of figs,prune, and raisins. At 9% abv you can faintly smell the alcohol but it is not overpowering. The taste is delicious, if you hold the beer on your palate...the sweet carmel flavors, and spices are really present. This is a very well crafted beer one you can sip all night.
"
1," New Years brew. Grand Reserve 2000. Poured dark red almost brown with a fluffy off white head. Aroma of plums, raisins, and a hint of alcohol. Very smooth velvet fruit texture with some a hint of alcohol in the finish. Very drinkable.
"
1," Witbiers are not a favorite.  This didnt stink, however.  Poured a clear, pale yellow with a small white head.  Citrus, spice, grain in the nose.  Thin, gentle carbonation.  Crisp flavor with the blend of fruit and spice.
"
1," Pours a deep brown color, with a thick fluffy browinish cappucino head. Cloudy to the point I cant see clearly through my shaker glass (yeah yeah wrong glassware, but when in college you dont spend any extra money, you borrow from drinking establishments around town). The aroma is cofee, figs, chocolate, molassas, caramel, grapes, brown sugar, to name a few. Lots of aromas, none too overpowering, all nice and mild, yet complex. Quite wonderful. The flavor isnt as strong and complex as the flavor, but very good. Milder than I thought it would be, but nice. The only negatve point is the calories and the very sweet body.
"
1," xxx Cant say anything against Chimay.  Great brewery, great beers, always good stuff.

"
1," NOV 3, 2011 Bottled a year and a half ago. Wonderful hazy, woody color. Aroma is almost nothing, almost smells like a lager; no sediment at the bottom. Well balanced flavor, not overly sweet, no detectable bitterness; light, but sharp carbonation. Very smooth. Dried bottle smells like beautiful tasty yeast. Very enjoyable mellow character. Best beer Ive had. On retry this beer varies greatly from bottle to bottle
"
1," OCT 15, 2010 Re-rate 10/8/2010.  Murky brown color with a thin frothy head settling on top.  Plums, brown sugar, Belgian yeasty notes, molasses.  Not quite as rich as I remember but pretty good stuff regardless.  Original rating"
1," on tap at brewpub. deep golden, red tint, med-dark beige head, some retention and lacing. toasted malts, some nuts, disturbing acidity, malt-lacking, torrefied malt-lacking. average carbonation, light body.
"
1," 650ml bottle pours a clear pale golden color with a finger and a half of white head that settles down to leave some nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma is mild citrus hops and a touch of cereal grains.  Taste is light malty sweetness with a moderate lingering grapefruit finish.  Light bodied with some decent carbonation.  This is quite a nice IPA, I am really starting to enjoy this Dead Frog Brewmasters Series of beers.
"
1," Note was not called 80 Schilling Export Ale at the festival like the 2008 Replicale was.  This draft brew from the Mad Anthony Oktobeer Fest poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized white colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind a transparent softly carbonated copper colored body. The mild aroma was malty and musty. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish. The flavor contained notes of maltsharp hops and sweet. A decent one that I would consider buying again.
"
1," Am imbibing as I write this...Hm, very sweet tasting kind of licorice flavor to it and rather fizzy.  I thought itd be thicker.  Maybe colder it might be (Im enjoying it at the reccommended 50 degrees).  Its attractive to look at and its taste is very complex, hoppy and a tad porty possibly due to the high alcohol content although, frankly, Im not really overwhelmed by it.  A saporous, sipping beer.  I dont know if Im gonna fork over the $7.95 again in the near future (due in part to a rather uptight and frugal girlfriend) but I might let a friend by me one.  Oh well...I also bought a bottle of Fischers Bitter.  I may try it next.  Cheers.
"
1," Realized I never rated this beer, so it was just an excuse to have it again. Pours out a deep mahogany color with a small white head. Aroma is sweet with a note of spice. Flavor is complex, yeasty earthy flavors fade to some roasted malt spice and a slight hop finish. Great beer
"
1," 12oz btl. Pours dark medium body with a tan head. Smells of vanilla, raison, and a bit of that burbon. Tastes the same with some fruit to start and then fades to the burbon. Not bad.
"
1," small, foamy white head.  straw body.  light cornflakey nose.  sweet, dry and earthy.  impossible to ignore the ""green bottle effect""
"
1," 
"
1," Hazy ruby brown pour into a THICK foamy off white head that dissipates into sticky lacing which quickly melts down the glass. Aroma of roasted malt,  flowery hops and yeasty biscuits. Initial flavor of dark fruit with a spicy hoppy finish.
"
1," 750 bottle of 02/2005 vintage, 15 months old. Pours thick and cloudy. I may have agitated the bottle getting it out of the fridge. 		Thick, long lasting head of large bubbles bring the yeasty, apricot tinged vapors to the nose. The first hints of sourness are here, like fruit ripening on the tree. 		The palate is even, not overly strong in any one characteristic. The malty characteristics are balanced by the sourness and both conspire to hide the heavy alcohol content. No hint of the 9+% alcohol until you realize that it is rocking your face off. 		The sourness of the after-palate is a bit offsetting at first, but blends quickly until it is the taste you anticipate with your next sip.
"
1," Bottle from Morrisons. Golden colour, white head. Aroma is soft malted, a bit grassy. Flavour is malty, a bit stale, some sourness. Slightly bitter finish. Mediocre.
"
1," Nice reddish-brown color.  Nice head which diminishes but doesn't disappear.  The high alcohol is well hidden.  One of my favorite Strongs so far.
"
1," bottle....33 cl..It pours clear red brown with a big fluffy tan head.... the aroma is sweet, malty, nice good fruitiness..... the flavor is roasted malts, sweet, dark fruits, caramel and some alcohol not as much at Chimay Blue....... some belgian yeast finish....
"
1," Smells of coffee.  Tastes of coffee.  Beautiful color, very dark.  Could use two sugars and a shot of half and half.
"
1," Its light-golden with a creamy, white head. The aroma has notes of hop-pellets, grass and light malt. The flavour has a light sweetness and notes of malt, caramel, grass and hop-pellets, and it has a nice bitterness, but I think the brewer used more bitter hops than aroma hops.
"
1," Pours a very dark cloudy brown with a frothy off white head. Aroma is yeasty with some dark fruits. Taste is a complex mixture of yeast, fruit and some ever so distant roastiness. Next to no bitterness but a very long and satisfying finish. I guess my only beef is Id like to see a bit less fizziness on the palate. But this is a trivial concern and doesnt detract too much. Overall, just downright glorious!
"
1," HEAL ICY BUM !	The beer is beautiful. It pours a dark brown that shimmers when held up to the light, with a yeasty froth of head. It smells mysterious. The drink is smoky, bordering on dry but with a distinctive flavour of malt. This bottle was in its second year and I loved every minute of it
"
1,"  deep reddish-brown, foamy light mocha head. 	 	Aroma"
1," MAR 14, 2004 Better than the red.   Dark brown almost black. Thick head but dissipates faster than the Red. Aroma that is wine-like and carries a light yeast scent. Cleaner taste than the Red. Very smooth on the tongue and a little bubbly. A light fruity edge to the taste and malt. Yummy. A testament to re-trying complex beers. My original rating was a 3.2 and now I could drink this forever.
"
1," Its Chimay Red.  What else can you say?  Strong, full, yeasty, delicious, glorious.
"
1," Orange aroma with a touch of hay. Full bodied and malty. Orange in the flavor. Hardly any hint of hops, maybe a bit in the aftertaste. More hops would do this pilsener no harm.
"
1," Sampler at the Nashville location - Poured a very attractive ruby red in color with a medium whitish head.  Aroma was medium of grassy hops.  Flavor was nicely hoppy and medium bitter.  Finish was short, clean and medium bitter.  I like it... the best beer at the brewpub.
"
1," MAR 26, 2011 One of my top 10 favorite beers. Shared a year old bottle of this with my wife last night and thought Id add a rating.
"
1," Small bottle, pours a dark reddish colour wth very creamy foam.  Aroma is caramel and yeast.  Tastes of caramel, dried fruits and something port wine like.  Pleasant carbonation and high alcohol content is only noticable as beerwarms.
"
1," The dark malty colour and taste of this beer is off set with the fruity aroma and flavour.  There is a lot going on here and I really like it.  The alcohol is hidden well, and there is a lot to smell and taste.  I would place it between the blue and white as it doesnt hold the depth of the blue, or the hoppy fruityness of the white.  It is a great beer overall.
"
1," This is indeed a very good beer, but I prefer many other Trappist beers to this one. It is very light with a hint of citrus although it maintains its copper brown color. I would enjoy it a little heavier I think.
"
1," I still prefer the red label to the blue label.
"
1," Beer of the month club, pours orange to yellow with a nice head, aroma of apricots, oranges, strong citrusy crisp with a touch of malt and vanilla, flavor is bitter and dry with malt, bread, honey, grapefruit peel and a bitter pleasant finish, medium to full bodied, best beer of the month so far.
"
1," This would probably be a very drinkable beer with a slice of lemon but why should that be needed?  Without the slice this is disappointing and even a little boring.  The aroma is not enticing, the flavor is weak, and it feels thin in the mouth.  A wheat beer should be so much better than this offering.
"
1," 50 cL bottle. Pours hazy yellow with a huge white head. Aroma dry estery and mild acidic. Mild plastic note, orange fruity, banana and sweet wheaty. Ends sweet and slight citric.
"
1," decent, but need a touch more body and flavor.
"
1," Pours a very dark opaque with brown edges and a frothy well-lacing tan head.  Aroma is subtle, dry and roasty without much sweetness.  Smooth, malty, robubst, dry-tasting body has good viscosity and roasty finish.  A nicely balanced brew and an enjoyable dry stout.
"
1," Large bottle, cork stamped 10/07. Pours ruddy amber with fluffy, high off-white head that snaps, crackles, pops. Aroma is fleeting metallic, ketchup and  sour molasses. Bread dominates the flavor with brown sugar accompanied by notes of apricot, mineral  and roses. Balanced body, slightly slick (1% milk). Effervescent bump of faint cherry and mineral with slightly dry finish.
"
1," Poured from 330ml bottle into snifter glass. Cloudy brown-red colour, large off-white head that falls away relatively quickly and leaves little to no lacing. A big aroma of sweetly sharp malts, caramel, multiple fruits like orange and spices. Taste dominated by malt, caramel and dark fruits, as well as a toasty edge. Mouthfeel is a little rough and in some parts watery, which detracts from the drinkability. Medium body with medium-to-high carbonation. Overall a mostly enjoyable beer, but far from a ""wow!"" beer. Seems a somewhat straight forward abbey dubbel.
"
1," Bottle (750 mL). Pours cloudy dark brown with a small off-white head. The aroma is slightly sweet, with dark fruits, yeast, maybe chocolate, and hint of alcohol. The flavor is dark and vinous fruits, slightly but not too sweet, with a bit of bitterness, yeast and breadiness, and finishing with a linger soft sweet finish. Very good!
"
1," Pours a dark amber with a thick off-white head. Sweet aroma of dark fruits, floral, and some caramel. Flavor is sweet  to start off then finishes with the caramel and a small hint of floral. A slight alcohol warming is the perfect ending to this brew, All the flavors and aromas blend well to make this trappist a true treat.
"
1," Hard to not compare this to the blue... so I wont try.  A very great beer.  Really the main thing I think this lacks from the Blue is the great mouth feel the blue has, the alcohol tingle, without the alcohol taste.
"
1," a good strong beer 	one of the best in belgium
"
1," An unclear brown beer with no head. The aroma is very smoked and with notes of rope and oranges. The flavor is sweet and is very smoked before ending on a dry note. Too simple a flavor.
"
1," TheDM and Hotstuff vacation brew 7.  This draft brew was enjoyed at the Big River Brewery in Chattanooga Tennessee which was hosted by a pleasant accomodating staff.  This brew poured a medium sized head of finely sized off-white colored bubbles that left behind a transparent uncarbonated red body and a fair lace.  The mouthfeel was smooth and tingly at the start and smooth and chewy at the finish.  It had a mild malt aroma and a red malt flavor.  I noted that it was an OK beer.
"
1," Another great belgian. Ranks slightly behind St Bernardus and Rochy 10 in my book, but still quite good.
"
1," Very dark brown w/ light brown foam. Robust, roasty flavour of chocolate, coffee, oak, whiskey, vanilla & cherry(?). Medium-full, creamy feel. Nice roasty, malty flavour of chocolate, coffee, oak, vanilla & whiskey w/ burnt undertones.
"
1," Yeah, bacially a weaker version of the blue....lets call it Chimay Blue Light.  All in all a very good trappist. Medium bodied, very well balanced with fruits and pleasant hops.
"
1," Pours a dark chocolate with thick beige head that lasts a long while.  Aroma and taste leave much to be desired.  mouthfeel is much too watery.
"
1," Clear body with a strong sweet fruity nose.  Sweet fruity body with hints of pear.  From a flight at the UMI Sake house.
"
1," Pours opaque brown with a tan head. Classic BSA aroma of yeast, malt, and dark fruit. Great flavor of more malt and fruit. Amazing mouthfeel, smooth as butter on the palate. Great beer.
"
1," One of my all time favourites. Colour of this beer is dark earthy brown with a thick head. Aromas of alcohol, bread, caramel.  The taste is little bit alcohol taste, sweet Mild bitterness on the finish.
"
1," 500ml bottle-pours a rich rocky white head and slightlyhazy gold color.  Aroma is grain/bready, lime, herbal/tea hops.  Taste is grain/bready/light-medium malt, herbal/spice hop with some bite, some citrus-lime.  Towards medium body.  Dryish.  Thanks jwc215 for sharing this one.
"
1," Orangey-golden coloured , small & stable creamy head, vegetables (onions, cabbege - cased by ""bad yeast ?) and minerals in the caramelly-wheaty nose ; moderate sweet-sourish flavour, light bodied, soft; vegetables returning in the sweetish-caramelly and sourish-wheaty finish. Not really good....
"
1," Sample glass at the brewpub.   Not bad for a light beer.  I normally dont like light beers in general, but this one didnt taste like seltzer water.  Decent malt on the front end and a reasonable body given what it is.  It would have rated even better except for a slight off flavor of starchy grain at the end.  Low alcohol is always a negative for me, but not for some.  This was easily my least favorite of the brewpubs lineup, but not undrinkable.
"
1," Great freakin beer, almost as good as the Blue, no need to call out all flavor points, leave that to the wine putzes! Drink up!!
"
1," Bottle.  The second best batch of chimay in my opinion.  Pours a dark brown body with  a big fluffy head.  Aroma is malty the whole way through.  A lot of caramel comes through in the flavor.  A solid choice.
"
1," Bouteille330 ml. 9%. Couleur brune ambre, brouille. Mousse beige-blanche abondante et grande effeverscence. Arme complexe de malt caramel, un peu dcorce dorange, un peu de fruits rouge mrs. En bouche, notes de prunes noires, malt, un peu de levure et un peu de fruits mrs. Trs bonne.
"
1," Hometown brewpub, I'd like to see them succeed because Indiana needs lots of help converting the masses away from the commercial swill they are so used to drinking.  Nice deep brown color with a creamy dark tan head.  There was a good smoky aroma that overpowered anything else that may have been present.  The flavor was dominated by a combination of smoky and coffee roasted malts.  It's a decent beer but I've had much better stouts.
"
1," big head, rich dark appearance, fresh aroma. clean taste that isnt too hot with well balanced oaky flavour with hint of chocolate.
"
1," Let me qualify this by saying the verdict is still out for cask brews. This was my first cask sampling and to say the least, I was not impressed. Flavor was watery and nothing outstanding to say about it. It did smell and look excellent.
"
1," Not being a fan of lemons, I really tried hard to enjoy this but just could not. This is a pale lager with a little malt character that is just ruined by a heavy dose of lemons that bring to mind Lysol rather than sunshine. I staying far away.
"
1," This was only the second bottle of chimay I have had - the first time I rated it my description was inadequate. However, I found that the first time there seemed to be much more aroma - I think this time the aroma seemd trapped under the generous lasting head I poured. Anyway... What a drop - such a multitude of flavours throughout the whole sipping and swallowing process. Starts off with a rich fruity, malty and typical ale fruitiness intensity - so many different flavours come out. Followed by a wallowing progression of the hops transgression. The hops blend (I assume more than one type is used) is blended excellently, and so smoothly mixed with the malts used. Then lastly, the aftertaste, which comprises of sweet maltiness, and not overly bitter hoppiness, presented in a package which itself gives off some metallicness, astringence and bitterenss. This beer is so complex in flavour, yet so well balanced.  Incredible. Give me the recipe! Or, more importantly, give me another! The best beer I have ever tasted.
"
1," Faint hop and malt aroma from a clear pale yellow light bodied brew. Gentle lace on glass. Hint of fruitiness in light easy drinking beer. Not memorable.
"
1," Cloudy mahogany with good, creamy tan head / Big bread and malt  nose / Full body, sweet and malty with good finish / Cooked flavors of banana, chocolate, and grape / Stale flavors detract.
"
1," I am a fool for having waited so long to try this. I did not expect this to be so damn good. My takeaway from this is that this beer is special enough to truly turn a miserable day into a sublime evening. 		Large Bottle bought at Trader Joes. I had a bit of trouble removing the cork. I only had a pilsner glass on hand. I began to pour and noticed a medium rich pour which constructed a fabulous head. Thick chewy foam that held up in time. Did not expect such a nice head. This was medium brown, slightly nutty lemon aroma. Fantastic, rich taste. First to last sip was balanced and memorable. 		I paid $7.99 for this. Well worth it. I wish I could find it for $5 because Id keep about 5 of these in my fridge at all times. I just cant afford to drink this one other then for special times.
"
1," On tap at Alt Platz. Golden in color with an off-white head. Aroma was bready with a touch of hops lurking around. Flavor was a combination of yeast and sweet malt.
"
1," Monster head that vanished quickly. Didnt do a whole lot for me at all. There was a long lasting semi bitter finish. But that was about it. Very bland.
"
1," Very nice.  Pours a rich golden-copper, with a nice head to it.  Aroma is a little fruity, some berries, but mostly bready malt aroma.  Flavor is pretty yeasty, slightly hoppy, and ""old"" tasting.  Wish I'd tried this one sooner.
"
1," This is probably the finest Belgian beer in the world out of many beautiful examples. Phenolic/malty/alcohol aroma, simultaneously formidable, delicious, and frighteningly drinkable. Truly amazing ale even compared to other Trappist offerings. For Nel(69) to prefer a flabby, overdone ""Arrogant Bastard"" is sad and should be grounds for revocation of his undeserved login privileges.
"
1," Subtly more wine-like than the Rouge; only negative is that it is far more difficult to pair with a meal. I have enjoyed this rich beer with Stilton Farmhouse. Give it a shot.
"
1," Pours a barely transparent dark mahogany brown with a thin light-tan head.  Fresh piney hoppy aroma has good chocolate and roasty presence with a touch of coffee.  Starts with a thinner, lightly sweet palate with a watery mildly roasted finish.  Could use a little more body, but otherwise a nice sweet stout.
"
1," Bottle from my friend John, who swears he bought this at Phoenicia in Houston. Pours a nice yellow with a great head; my porn star girlfriend smiled.  Flavor is thick corn with a  brusque aftertaste of husk.  Thick mouthfeel.  Worth a try, nonetheless.
"
1," Cask. Decent hop and fruit aroma. Flavor is watery and hoppy. Not very pleasantno malt character at all Tastes like there might be seaweed in there, or at least sea salt. Rather nasty. Not to my taste.
"
1," Half pint gravity fed at the Battersea Beer Fest, slightly cloudy but golden amber with a frothy white head. A very rich malty aroma with hints of cherry and honey. Doesnt taste as strong as its 7.5%, biscuity malt first hits your mouth followed by sweet cherries - like having an entree, main and dessert in one course.
"
1," Bottle. drank this while slightly congested. most noticeable feature was the great mouth feel. Drank it when it was rather warm, resulting in noticeable darker fruit flavors. Goes down warm and very easy. Great beer.
"
1," Dark amber pour with with a nice dirty white head.  Clove and dark fruit aroma.  The flavor is a jumble of sweet dark fruits and malt with a nice bitterness to it.
"
1," Bottle 50 cl. Courtesy of Timo. Cloudy dark amber with an off-white head. Strong aroma of fruit, yeast and phenols. Medium body, spicy fruitiness, yeast and an almost medicinal and phenollic character. Dry finish. 300809
"
1," Deep brown with hints of red. Yeast aroma. Very yeasty flavor with some malt/spice undertones. A bit sweet.
"
1," Pours with a thick head.  Dark brown in color.  Yeasty, malty nose.  Very complex flavor.  Lightly malty, somewhat creamy, with a warm alcoholic finish.  Maybe a little too alcoholic.
"
1," (Bottle) Pours a hazy gray/brownish amber colour with a creamy off white head. The aroma is light to medium malty, light to medium hoppy and light yeasty with tones of grass, fresh herbs, bread, grain and some light apple/pear hints alongside vegetables like cabbage and mild corn. The aroma is light to medium hoppy and near medium malty with a touch of yeast. Tones of bread, grass, herbs, light vegetables, light caramel and some raw fruitiness. Light to medium sweet and light to bitter. The mouthfeel is soft and creamy with a mild carbonation to back it up. Medium bodied.
"
1," yellow amber color kinda chunky yeast floating around, big HUGE frothy head mainly sweet caremel malt nose, taste is bitter hops pine notes definate reminds me of Churchkeys west coast. Intresting and refreshing beer.
"
1," On tap at the brewpub. Copper colored pour with thin white head heavy lacing. Aroma is piney with pink grapefruit, a bit of earth too. Taste is very bitter, lots of piney hops, very hop forward, deliciously unbalanced. Palate is very dry, some alcohol presence. Good IPA.
"
1," Bottle. Reddish colour. Nice fruity aroma. Sweet and smooth taste. Very good.
"
1," Great pear aroma. Perfect color and thick head that lingers and lingers.  Great lacing and carbonation. Awesome fruity boldness. Huge mouthfeel. Finish is dry with a strong warmth that starts spreading quickly. Very slight bitterness mouthfeel later. Awesome. My first Belgian Strong Ale but it wont be my last.
"
1," Poured from the small bottle into a pint glass. I had it with a nice grilled ribeye steak and the two compimented each other perfectly.		The beer poured a dark reddish/brown with a thick head. The aroma was very pleasant and the taste was perfect. You can taste the alcohol in the beer, but it is not overwelming. For a beer with 9 percent ABV, this is a very drinkable beer.
"
1," Appearance is a cloudy brown with cream color head. Aroma is of yeast and bread notes. Flavor is quite simple, just a few malty notes along with a bit of Belgian yeast. Slightly over carbonated.
"
1," Great beer, not as powerful as the Bleue, but nevertheless, worth a try! Aah, I love the typical Chimay smell!!
"
1," Got this in the small bottle.  Its one of the first ""high alcohol"" beers to trickle into my supermarket since NC has passed its ""pop the cap"" legislation.  I tried Chimay blanche once when I smuggled a bottle from Tennesse.  But Chimay Rouge is superior in flavor.  There is less of the characteristic Belgian spiciness.  And excellent hop/malt balance with a little bit of alcohol at the end.  Very nice.  Should be tasting a lot more higher alcohol beers now that NCs cap has been popped.  *grin*
"
1," Pours clear copper with a thin head. Very strong hop aroma. Very citrus, like grapefruit rind. And cotton candy. Very slight malty flavour is crushed by strong floral hops. the grapefruit rind is very strong on the palate and the finish is very bitter. Great IPA.
"
1," Call me strange but I did not found this beer matching the expectations I had. I especially disliked the aftertaste. Perhaps I tried this a bit too early in my beer tasting career.
"
1," On tap at the brewpub. Deep clear brown with a small tan head. Nutty chocolate nose, herbal hops. Mild chocolate and nut flavors, hops come to the fore in the finish, a herbal bitterness. Very nice!
"
1," Bottle 500ml. w. swing top @ yespr - Tjekke-smagning.Clear medium to dark amber color with a average, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, toasted - caramel, light to moderate hoppy, moderate yeasty.

"
1," (bottle, thanks to pivnizub) Clear, dark amber colour with a short off-white foamy head. Moderately sweet dark malty, toasted aroma with caramel and shy notes of hops. Slightly sweet and nutty toast-malty taste on a dense herbal background, medium to light bodied with a crispy carbonation; dry, toast-malty and herbal hoppy finish.
"
1," FEB 5, 2003 A year after trying this for the first time I've gone from ""not too crazy about this beer"" to can't get enough of this beer!!! My beer senses weren't as well tuned as they are now.  Absolutely one of the best beers in the world.
"
1," I enjoy how this beer feels on the palate....very light a bit oily.  I feel the flavor is complete and nothing extra, nothing missing.  Its balanced well.  The apricot flavor is most predominate and not overwhelming.
"
1, Trs forte odeur de fruits tropicaux. Apparence
1," Looks excellent, although slightly disappointing as its not as good as I thought it would be, nice red/brown colour with a malty taste. Quite a strong alcohol content so best drunk in moderation
"
1," Copper colour with a beautiful creamy head.  Nose of apricot and other subtle hints of fruit.  Taste is fruity and enjoyable.  Finish is smooth and quite enjoyable.  Subtle but beautiful.  I thought this was superior to Achel.
"
1," Bottle from a sample pack. Sweet and fruity with a light tartness. grows more complex as it warms up. A touch of bitterness at the end.
"
1," [Tasted at Riks, lArtisan, birthday in 2004.]  		Spicy and yeasty and a beer you can enjoy for more than a couple of minutes. I spend about an hour swallowing this nice beer.
"
1," Wow...nice beer.  Aromatic hops, off white head and heavy lacing.  The mouthfeel is soft and bitter and a little sticky.  I enjoy.
"
1," Bottle.  Dark malt, banana, orange, and clove aroma.  Dark orange-brown color - cloudy with large head.  Sweet orange and banana flavor - nice strong flavor - dark malt flavor comes out later.  Nice body.  A very nice dunkelweizen - would be just about perfect if it had more of the dark chocolate malt flavor.
"
1," SEP 6, 2006 (Bottled, 0.33l, Nov.20, 2005, BBE 2010 and Sept.6, 2006, BBE 2011) Some anise, especially in the flavor. Raisins, too. Something similar to the Gouden Caroluses, but more balanced and less anise-pronounced. Reasonably full body, sweetish, rye-puddingy. Vinous, even slightly alcoholic when young. Quite strongly hoppy finish. Smooth and sticky, but not too sugary. Very well-balanced, although somewhat foamy-carbonated. A very nice trappist, still worth every point. A true classic, but still accessible enough for a beginner.	(Re-rate Oct. 2nd, 2004, Bottled, 0.33l, BBE 2008) Muddy, dark reddish brown color with smallish, but lasting, off-white head. Quite strong, very malty, slightly caramely-sweet, spicy aroma with very slight alcohol feel. Very strong, sweetish-malty, spicy, chimay-yeasty, rye-pudding flavor. Full-bodied, syrupy, medium-carbonated palate with a sugary finish. A delicious, sweetish,full-bodied trappist.	(1992 vintage, sampled 2006@Kulminator) 8-4-9-4-17=4.2 Fruity, vinous, sweet aroma, very nice. Surprisingly sweet with figs and syrup. Still balanced with very nice sweet toffee!	(1981 vintage, sampled 2006@Kulminator, 25 years!) 9-4-9-5-18=4.5 Not vinous, but more like liquour/brandy/barley wine. Excellently preserved and very nice! Very foamy for its age (head fades quickly, though). Wonderful, smooth rye pudding with yeast!
"
1," assertive bitter finish, pleasant aroma, clean, well balanced, a solid pils.
"
1," Cask Conditioned at Reading BF 2006. Golden. Harsh aroma of paint fumes. Sweet malt and marzipan aroma with some cherry stones. I liked this one more than the others seemed to.
"
1," Bottle. Sweet dark heavy malt, roasted, chocolate. Large creamy off-white head, mostly lasting. Dark brown colour of the body. Light bitter start, sweet finish, average duration. Light to medium body, creamy texture and a lively carbonation. Very good taste, not to heavy.
"
1," On cask.  Copper colored pour lightly visable carbonation w/ a whispy head.  Sweet caramle aroma lots of cereal and a piece of fruit that almost thinks mango, but is hard to place.  Full well coated palate, lightly creamy.  Nice flavor lots of fruitty hops, passion fruit and orange rind, cereal, good sweetness.  I like it.
"
1," Pours a dark brown with a foamy beige head.	Flowers, hay, and roasted notes in the aroma.  	Sweet while lightly tart.  	Full bodied, tangy,  sweet and tart, chewy, fizzy.
"
1," FEB 2, 2004 cloudy reddish-brown colour with a big creamy head, malt and haye aroma with notes of banana, creamy mouthfeel, medium-bodied, oily with a touch of acidity, slightly overcarbonated, dry and moderately malty finish - unremarkable; this is just the shadow of this was before"
1," A absolutely great trappist that I drink quite often. A very complex beer, I enjoy it more than the blue.
"
1," Bottle.  Caramel malt with a light pepper/pine hops aroma.  Hazy amber with a ton of white particulate matter that remains suspended in the beer like grapes in Jello.  Moderate head.  Slightly sweet caramel/butter malt flavor initially followed by a strong bitter pine hops finish - from the aroma wasnt sure if this was going to have much hops to it but it didnt disappoint.  Strong diacetyl notes for an IPA - very different.
"
1," Opaque beer with a small tan head.  A little thicker than what I remember of other oat stouts.  A very sharp bitterness/roastedness in taste that leads to a bitter finish.  Faint grassy hops in aroma and taste.
"
1," SEP 28, 2003 Bottled 750ml"
1," Pours an amber red with a nice head. Leaves some lacing on the glass. There is sediment that is floating in the glass. Smells like friut and vanilla. Tastes of fig, vanilla, and spice.
"
1," MAY 13, 2003 (1998 version, 1.5 liters)  Dark brown, creamy head which left nice laces on the glass.  There was so much in this port-like beer,  I couldn't name it all. Toffe, alcohol, flambed bing cherries, macerated fruits (berries, plums), a bit piny.  The ageing really did it some good! (Tasted on august 2nd 2002)
"
1," Draught. Pours a light red hue. The aroma is certainly akin to a Scottish ale, though rather generic. Notes of peat, caramel, pipe smoke are detected though mostly a sweet malty aroma dominates. The body is almost sticky with a fairly smoky, nutty finish like toasted almonds perhaps. Mild notes of rose and peat turn up in the sweet flavor. Pretty average, sweet, malty beer. Drinkable.
"
1," Bottle.  Poured a dark brown with a 1 cm light tan head that persisted.  Aroma and taste of dark fruits (raisin, prune, fig) and Belgian yeast.  Some bitterness.  A well-balanced beer.  Excellent!
"
1," Milder heller Malzantrunk, wenig wrzig, s-wssrig. Geringe herbe im Mittelteil, dazu ebenfalls gering holzig. Fr einen Bock ist das Bier eher laff, die Wrzigkeit beschrnkt sich auf den hellmalzigen Hintergrund. Im Abgang eher wie ein ses Export  trinkbar aber nichts Besonderes. 6/7/8/7/7/7
"
1," A nice soft beer. No bitter.
"
1," No better way to obliterate the stagnant memories of an otherwise unfulfilling day than by putting back a bottle of strong Belgian beer. This stuff looks good, really dark brown with your typical cottony Belgian foam. Alcohol and roasty spice & a little ripe fruit in the aroma. Taste is nice, a little bit of booze fumes tickle your sinuses as you get some roasty, rich malt flavor polished off by a little zing that I can only compare to grapeskins, if that makes any sense. Its got just a little dash of sweet but not in a bad way, it leaves the palate pretty clean and doesnt build up in an unpleasant syrupiness at all.  Great beer to have with a steak.  This is a world-class brew that everyone should try.
"
1," Pretty good, full of flavour, wonderful smell. Good beer to sip and savour
"
1," Bottle
"
1," Great beer, I love it!  What else can I say this is a beer you either love, or can get used too.  Definitely worth a try.
"
1," Bottle, 33 cl. Aroma of Belgian yeast, accompanying fruitiness, spices, licorice, honey, apple. Flavor largely the same, with a nice hop finish I not accustomed to in similar brews (although I think this may just be my palate developing). Typical fine carbonation for a Belgian, solid brew.
"
1," Poured a light brown color. Sweet with only a touch of bitterness. Full flavored with a mildly dry finish. All in all a really good beer.
"
1," Draft, opaque brown pour, beige head.  Coffee and chocolate aroma, hints of roastiness.  Sweet chocolate roasted malt flavor, and maybe some kinda fruit like a plum  Fairly thin unfortunately.
"
1," Bottle. Pours a clear brown color with an off-white head. Sweet roasted malty bready aroma with hints of caramel. Sweet roasted malty bready caramel flavor. Roasted malty finish.
"
1," tap at the brewpub - Pours black with a thin, tan, lasting head.  The flavor is of dark roast malt, some coffee and an alcohol taste thats too forward.  It needs more going on with bigger flavors to keep up with the abv.  Its alright, but for the style, my favorite style in fact, it was really lacking.
"
1," Bottle 06 batch (330ml). Poured a extremely dark muddy brown with a good size creamy off-white head which lasted well. Aroma was mainly of caramelized dark fruits, such as; prunes, sweet plums, dates and cranberries. Taste was complex with plenty of sweet currents, dates, faint port-like notes, woody/earthy notes, mild (very) licorice and a touch of alcohol. Full bodied with soft carbonation, syrupy texture and a long, slightly warming finish.
"
1," Bottle. Very dark pour with a foamy cream colored head. Awesome aroma of roast, smoke, some sweetness, and a little bit of dark fruit (probably from the wine barrel aging). Palate is a little thin. Taste is wine-like, almost vinegar. I really like the aroma but I not crazy about the palate or taste.
"
1,"  bitter, like unsweetened cocoa and very difficult to enjoy.  Sour finish and my mouth is left feeling dry.  No complexities or unique flavors.  It tastes very much like finished wood.
"
1," I had the white, red, and blue together tonight (I feel so patriotic!)  and I liked the red slightly more than the white.  Pours coppery, with aroma of fruit (peaches, apricots), hops, and malt.  Tastes fruity, with a fruit, perfumy, floral, velvety and hop finish.
"
1," Thanks to Ben for bringing the bottle!  Poured medium-deep brown with an easily-resuscitated khaki head.  The aroma picked up a heavy dose of fairly generic black malts with some raisins and molasses sticking around.. very assertive, and seemingly very sweet.. seemed a lot heavier than it needed to be.  The flavor found the kick I expected, but didnt really need.. lots of sweet molasses and vanilla, with juicy raisins too.. more raisins and molasses in the end.  Medium-plus bodied and quite sweet on the palate.. a bit too hot and too raisin-y, but still tasty.. kinda brash overall.
"
1," Copper colour with a bubbly/foamy head and bubbles from the bottom.  Aroma of fresh apricots, random fruitiness. Flavors of apricots (at end of tongue) with a pleasant bite and a sharp palate.
"
1," Tap @ Mad Anthonys.  Deep opaque.  Little to no head.  Bourbon notes in aroma.  Thin body.  Roasted malt taste, with bourbon flavors at first taste.
"
1," Pours a medium brown with a lasting head. Aroma is unpleasant and reminds me of  baby spit-up. Flavor is yeasty and sweet. Has a thick mouthfeel.
"
1," Pours a cloudy brown / copper with a thin head. Aroma of fermented fruits, malt, yeasts and spice. Flavor is light sweet fruits, tartish malts and touches of spice. Body was sort of thin but overall it was enjoyable but nothing special.
"
1," Poured a light, unfiltered copper.  This brew was a mix between traditional Belgian and champagne (a bit dry).  We wanted to drink it for New Years, but there was too much other liquor to fill the cup.  Very good.
"
1," OK, I know Chimay has a reputation, kind of like being the best car made in the 50s, but it really is out-of-date isnt it?		It cant compare really to the beers made by Omnibroue, unless you are making a special category for vintage-era beers. Sure, it might have been the best there was 20 years ago, but we have made progress and these old style beers taste, well, out-of-date.		It is fine and agreeable, but has none of the complexity of a Trois Pistoles or Three Philosophers.		It tastes like a really good sparkling champagne-style beer, bubbly and effervescent, but not very substantial.		This is an excellent beer, but shows little signs of progress from what it was in its inception. If you get off on black and white movies, then you may love this brew.
"
1," 12 fl oz bottle. Pours hazy dark brown with a distinct redish glare with a small off-white head. Aroma is fruity, overripe fruity. Roasted malt flavoured, overripe fruity. Mild bitterness and lingering malty and overripe fruity flavoured finish.
"
1," Bottle. Not good. Sweet malty aroma. Raw unbrewed malt. Palate is sweet and chemicaly, with some rubbery notes. Unbrewed malt again in the flavour. Not good.
"
1," Cask at the Blackfriars, Glasgow, rather late in the evening. Fantastic dark ruby, lots of fruitiness, a fine sweet and sour flavour.
"
1," not a bad beer in the scheme of things, however, it is probably the weakest of the red/white/blue chimay's. Yeasty malty flavour and mild bitterness. It lacks the full depth and complexity of the others.
"
1," Its dark-golden amber with a huge, creamy head. The aroma has notes of malt, biscuits and hops. The flavour has a light sweetness and notes of malt, the Danish Marie-biscuits, light caramel and the finish is slightly dry and hoppy.
"
1," An amber beer with an orange head. The aroma is like youghurt, while the flavor has a sweet malty background on which are strong notes of youghurt. It was 7 days over the best before date - but I dont believe that can account for the youghurt impression. I dont like it.
"
1," Opaque black color with a brown head at the pour that is quickly dissipated.  Sweet malt nose as befits the style.  Mouthfeel is full and smooth.  The initial taste is dry, but gives way to a proper sweet aftertaste.  Surprisingly complex, but not deeply so.  Decent effort.
"
1," Bire de couleur rouge cuivre, avec un de ces cols quil faut laisser le temps quil se dissipe un peu avant de finir de la verser. Elle contient des odeurs videntes de levure et dalcool accompagnes de prunes sches. La palette de got ressemble normment aux odeurs, en plus du pain grill avec une belle amertume, le tout bien quilibr.
"
1," Draught.  Pours a crystal clear, reddish brown amber with an off-white head that settles in to a thin film that clutters at the edge of the glass.  Aroma is faint, mildly spicy, bready.  Flavor is a bit dry, bitter and spicy with rye notes.
"
1," JUL 4, 2005 Nice red color. A great beer overall but my least favourite (less complex i would say) out of the three chimays that I have tried (blue,red, white).
"
1," APR 29, 2008 on draught. Pours an opaque black with a picturesque, frothy tan head. Theres a fair amount of roasted aroma over the musty barley and a bit of sweet cream. The palate is silky but thick, and the flavor has ample truck-stop coffee and a thinner cream sweetness. The semi-dry dark chocolate finish pulls this stout together. Its slightly thinner than Id like for a stout to be and has a borderline English porter feel. 			[April 27, 2008]		From a growler"
1," (12oz. bottle)  Pours a hazy amber-brown body with a small creamy beige head.  Aroma of mustiness, raisins, banana, clove, caramel, and chocolate.  Flavor of raisins, pepper, yeast, candi sugar, and plum.
"
1," bottle... light golden color with a small lingering white head and spotty lacing. aromas of lots of yeast, spiciness, dried apricots and fresh flowers. sweetness hits the palate first but is soon followed by dry yeast and a lightly bitter finish. the flavor is pretty much the same as the aroma... a little sweet for my liking. medium body with airy carbonation which gives it a creamy soft mouth feel...
"
1," Pours clear dark brown with  a lacy off-white head. Light body and medium carbonation. Light taste of toast and coffee, I think this beer was overwhelmed by what I was drinking before it.
"
1," Bottle from 5-99. floral doughy aroma. appearance is a purplish tinted brown. tan head. flavor is complex.malt and yeast are the first taste to hit my tiongue has an alcohol bite that is not overdone. an earthy quality to this. i have been trying to place one of the other flavors and it just came to me, molasses and brown sugar without being overly sweet. and interesting beer. thanks for the bottle, Lumpy.
"
1," Although typically the least expensive of the red, white and blue Chimays, this is my favourite, perhaps since it was the first one I tried and the one I have the most experience with. Sweet, spicy, fruity and woody scent. The colour is my favourite type among beers - a very cloudy copper with a nice fluffy off-white head that settles to a nice thin layer with some lacing, but not that much. Taste is malty, a bit spicey-fruity with a bit of a bitter edge, but no noticeable alcohol. Ends with a bit of a long, but smooth bitterness. Manages to come off as light but not watery. Extremely drinkable.
"
1," The best of the three.  Huge aroma of plums.  Long lasting palate of grapes, plum, some sweetness.  Very complex.
"
1," [Bottle - Old Chicago - Beaverton, Oregon]	Dark Amber color with a great aroma a very clean crisp spicy brew.  The fruity aromas where wonderful this is a very good brew and would love to visit the acutal brewery one day.
"
1," Grassy hop notes, light grainy aroma. Pale yellow color. Flavor is light grainy malty, grassy and herbal hop notes, spicy hop bitterness in the end. Dry, bitter finish. A bit watery, but pleasant hopped.
"
1," Smells like something from a bowl of Halloween candy.  Bready, yeasty and very smooth.  A rather lean body.  More sweetness than others Ive tasted.  The blue is better in my opinion.
"
1," OCT 18, 2009 Poured from a bottle at The Abbey Brewing Co. (Miami Beach, FL)"
1," Atpayn is the rater that sent me this set of Barrel Aged Brews!  		 Ink black body with the most ridiculously oversized tan head (like Freds brother) that my have ever been seen by man or beast! I think. Well I know I let this beer cellar for too long by the secondary fermentation that took place in the bottle, hence the massive head (Freds brother) I have this problem with Shipyards Bluefin Stout. Its unfiltered, and once the beer warms to about 70F it starts a secondary and becomes over carbonated. 	 Nevertheless, the aging must have toned down the bourbon presence; although it is still dominate. The flavor has rounded very nicely. Massive notes of toasted oak, vanilla, hazelnut, chocolate, coffee, and bourbon duhhhh! Downside the palate is feeble; thin and lacking punch.  If it were more full bodied this beer would rock the block, no doubt.  A great effort overall!
"
1," Bottle. A cloudy orange/brown colour. Nice offwhite head. Smell of clove and orange peels. Has a spicy yeasty taste. Also a plessant taste of clove and citrus. Has absolutly no bitterness in the aftertaste. Not a bad weisse from the western part of Bavaria.
"
1," bottle from Quinns.Clean, rich dark gold with a good off white head and some tiny yeasty floaters. Decent German malt aroma with lots of sweet bready notes and a little marzipan. Similar flavour with a big hit of caramel and a hint of alcohol. Delicate bitter hop finish. So so.
"

"
1," MAY 24, 2009 Probably the best drinking beer Ive had.  Nice deep copper hue with a nice toasted head.  Fantastic aroma full of malt, fruit, and a tiny hint of hops.  Flavor profile is as stated in the Brand Description, fruited notes with little of the alcohol coming through at all, and as any good Belgian, the yeast plays a big part in the flavor profile.  The palate is fine, nice mouth feel.  Overall this isnt as complex as its big brother the Blue label/Grande Reserve, but I enjoyed it a bit more.  This would also make a very flexible beer when pairing with food.
"
1," On Tap in Chattaboogie, TN at their restaurant - Drank 2 pints with a shrimp scampi appetizer and filet medallions main course. It was a good combo. This is an above average Beer, but a below average IPA.
"
1," Bottled.  Poured black with a short-lived cap of beige head.  The aroma picked up cold, dry-roasted coffee with just a touch of sour dark fruit that really worked for it.  The flavor was also coffee-focused with a more pronounced sour fruit and woody impression.. finished dry with coffee, toasted oats, and some residual sourness.. most likely a bit past its prime, but still enjoyable.  Medium-bodied, spicy, and drier on the palate with plenty of coffee roast.. the sourness was actually refreshing on the finish.  Solid.
"
1," Poured from a bottle conditioned since 2004.  Pours a dark, cloudy, opaque copper with a soapy off-white head.  Not much on the nose.  I was expecting a lot more.  Some fruityness and hints of raisin.  The taste is very balanced and very drinkable.  Hint of blueberry? and banana, some malt and yeast.  The alcohol is masked beautifully.  Mouth feel is very carbonated and light.  Perhaps it was the conditioning, but this is not the Chimay Red I remember.  That is not a negative comment.  Its just different than the other Chimay Reds ive drank.    If I didnt know it was 7%, i could easily mistake this for a great tasting session beer.
"
1, Crimson amber color. Cant say much about the head as it didnt come with one.		3.5 S
1," Top marks for appearance & palate.  Dry, earthy, tawny Belgian ale.  Somewhat tart in the finish.  I like Ommegang somewhat better, but well-done.  One could certainly drink a lot of this with no problems.
"
1," Pours nice reddish hue.  Rich aroma.  Taste is very smokey, almost over-whelmingly so.  great chipotle taste.  Full body.
"
1," 750ml Bottle. Pours a cloudy brown with a fluffy off-white head. Nuts, oxidized apples, figs and spice in the nose. Full creamy body with fine carbonation. The taste is sweet with yeasty spice, fruit with an overall impression of oxidized apples. Just a bit of bitterness and spice in the finish. Good, but not bowl-me-over good.
"
1," Thankfully this is readily available in town. It's my trappist refuge since I can seem to get my hands on much westy12.
"
1," (bottle) Clear golden colour with a small frothy white head. Sweet doughy malty nose with a touch of hops and honey. Sweetbitter flavour, medium body, moderate carbonation. Sweet malty and strawy taste with a light hopbitter finish.
"
1," Thanks to mar for sharing this bottle. Milky white with an aroma of rice and coconut. The flavor is very fruity. I get some melon and coconut along with a good dose of alcohol.
"
1," AUG 18, 2007 la migliore delle Chimay,  anche la pi corposa e la pi godibile, probabilmente lunica veramente in grado di competere con le illustri rivali delluniverso trappista belga.	comprata da Squillari, pagata 2.50, ma lavevo gi assaggiata (dal bicchiere altrui) al pub. Mi sono accorto solo dopo che si trova spesso (ce lhanno pure a Gavi). Meglio berla dinverno comunque
"
1," Red chestnut color, small head with lace.  Smells caramelly, nutty, sweet.  Taste is burnt caramel, candy sugars, yeast, hops, dried dark fruits.  Feels great in the mouth -- bubbles burst on the roof of the mouth & tongue when held in the mouth.  Coating.  Good but I expected better.
"
1," My favorite of the three
"
1," Sampled at the East Nashville Beer Festival, 11		Very sweet dark malty flavor, bitter cherries, caramel, oatmeal, and lots of bitter citrusy hops. Im a fan of this one. Dont think its a Quad, though.
"
1," Pours a deep brown with hints of ruby red, with a nice thick long lasting off white head.  Aroma is pretty much all citrusy hops and some spices, with a bit of a malty backbone.  Flavor starts out reasonably sweet and smooth with hints of orange, dark berries and caramel malts.  Finish is spices, but not spicy, I cant quite nail it down, but its dry and nice.  Carbonation is nice, and its really smooth in the mouth, not so much creamy, but very nice.
"
1," Ive been waiting quite a while to try this one, and Im not disappointed...much better than Red Cap.  Pouring a rich brown, this one is rather cloudy.  No worries, I DO like sediment in my beers.  Now thats a head!  Probably the biggest Ive ever seen from a bottle of this size, it was like a light brown milkshaked, and departed with some nice lacing as a parting gift.  The aroma was both spiced and fruity, but it is beyond me to determine which ones.  Taste was extremely good, as was the mouthfeel.  A pleasure to drink a beer this good.
"
1," I was all exited about trying this trapist ale however I bought it in a local market FAKTA in Denmark, which destroyed a bit the magic but here it goes. Very nice head, almost creamy, steady and strong, aroma is caramel, alcohol, mature malts and herbs, taste is very good, no tanginess, however it is a littlebit sharp thanks to big amout ot alc. very nice strong evening brew, I expecteed it to be more smooth but It is great anyway, caramel, this belgian ammy sort of taste and fruit background,
"
1," JAN 11, 2009 Re-Rate"
1," Perfectly black with a thin light khaki head. Malty milk chocolate with some nice sweet oranges. There is also some nice fruity cherry. Chocolate covered cherries dominate the initial taste with some cola following up. There is a hint of wood and roast, but it plays in the background. Overall, it is easy to drink and very malty as I got very little hops. Fun to drink and a pleasant surprise. This is in no way a quad, it is a Strong Ale.
"
1," (on bottle)Hazy, ruby red with a patch white head. Surprice came over me with the hoppy aroma, big for a dubbel..Fresh and pearly mouthfeel and a taste dominated by caramel and old, sweet grapes.. Slightly bitter finish. lacks a bit warmth from the alcohol.
"
1," On tap at Rock Bottom Charlotte.  Pretty good stuff here.  This was introduced as the ""award winning"" beer, although it didnt really knock my socks off.
"
1," A+
"
1," Deep golden, unclear, small stable off-white foamy layer, bubblegum, berries, caramel and yeast in the nose; medium bodied, moderate sweet-sourish flavour; moderate to solid wheaty-caramelly finish, balanced by a delicate sourish fruitiness and followed by a slight tartness in the aftertaste. First class Weizen.....
"
1," This beer looks and smells awesome.  Dry with a hind of citrus in the aftertaste. A very enjoyable sumer brew.
"
1," Pours dark dark black to brown with little getting through and a dark tan thin head.  The nose is like old coffee grounds.  Theres some chocolatey acidity, but little else.  The mouthfeel is full enough, but the beer is chalky.  Its just like I remember the Brass-knuckles being.  The flavor is a bit better, but brash.  The roasty coffee hits you right away.  theres some lactic acid like acidity and a general abrasiveness.  It leaves my mouth sandpapered.  The finish is bitter with charcoal and the aftertaste is just like licking a dirty grill.  this isnt as bad a beer as I make it out to be, but it isnt too balanced (or good in my opinion)
"
1," Youll have to excuse me as this is the first Belgian biere ive had. Its not bad, but just not my particular brand of vodka. The taste is nice, but shifts in the mouth. This is not a bad thing, just something Im not used to. Hopefully it will pass in time with the sampling of more Belgians.
"
1," Fruit and grain in a very well balanced combo.  The high ABV is not obtrusive at all.  Excellent.
"
1," Hazy straw color with a small white frothy head.  Aroma of sweet oranges, wheat, coriander, spices and a small amount of vanilla.  Really awkward flavor.  Like wet wheat flower and orange juice.  Pancakey.  This is just plain awkward and kinda gross.
"
1," Decent brew from Germany for an new Dutch Brewery-renter with retro-style beerlabel. Golden coloured with an grassy taste.
"
1," Used as a palate cleanser at Noogfest, and it served its purpose well. Clean and crisp, no off or otherwise wrong flavors. Mildly hoppier than I was expecting, I guess.
"
1," Bottle poured into a weizen glass. Rich, viscous sensual pour. The head is creamy with abundant lacing, mocha colour. The aroma is sweet, like brown sugar. The body opaque, dark brown, with some particulate matter. potent robust flavour that is chocolaty..  Long finish that is rich and bitter. This Belgian libation has a kick, didnt have to have any dinner after one of these. There is almost something medieval about this beer. There were suggestions of Liquorice or anise, in addition to lusty undertones of iron, earth and bark Im sure satyrs and centaurs drank this stuff
"
1," 650ml brown bottle. Pours out golden, clear. Small rocky white cap on top with some ok lacing in the glass. Nose has orange peels and light grapefruit notes. In the mouth the beer has a caramel malt backbone, fruity middle, light tropical notes. Finishes with a hit of grassy and citrusy hops, mid length bitterness. Medium body, decent carbonation. Overall, a decent IPA, pretty light and easy drinking with some nice tropical notes from the hops.
"
1," Copper in colour with sweet fruit and yeasty aromas. Flavor wise, it begins quite sweet, but dries quickly and becomes bitter with some earthy/oaky qualities. The alcohol is also very upfront. An interesting contrast to Chimay blue, which (in my mind) is a far more subtle and delicate product. Thanks presario.
"
1," On tap at Pizzamans in Milwaukee.  Appearance is a golden amber, with a frothy, foamy head.  Smell is grainy and a little floral.  Tastes sweet, with a hint of green apples--refined and complex, yet simple.  Slightly dry and impeccably smooth.  Completely intoxicating, and leaves one feeling as if floating on a cloud.  Miraculously heavenly.
"
1," After having such an incredible beer its difficult to go back and enjoy the mere mortal brewery offerings, but very well understood why so many other brewers like Ommegang, Allagash and the assorted other dubbel makers would try and duplicate. The heady aroma, magnificant maroon color, and distinctive malt, clove and spice flavor are well documented here but needs to be experienced for the special subtleties that make this such a refined and distinctive beer. This is Belgium brewing at its best.
"
1," bottle. Clear deep golden colour, large white head. Malty nose. Intensively malty with some hoppy flavours that add a touch of alpine herbs.
"
1," Pours a cloudy amber, with a slight head. Fruity, and not very hoppy. Can be aged, and has small amount of yeast in bottom of bottle, so pour very slow.
"
1," Champagne like. Fizzy, with lots of carbonation. Dry flavor, thats perfumy and sweaty leather at the same time. Nice sipping brew. Ill drink it again sometime.
"
1," This beer poured a nice head with a golden dark brown appearance.  A full bodied carmel taste.  A smooth finish to a well balanced beer.
"
1," dark, mahogony, red-brown...wonderful thick, beige head, incredibly thick and tight.  Roasted vanilla bean aroma, with some pine and whiskey.  Slight grain at the beginning of a fairly smooth and creamy palate.  Toasty flavours with more hints of whiskey wrapped with some caramel and some chocolate.  Roasted lactic bitterness in the finish.  Enjoyable, but off just a tad.
"
1," 330 ml flip-top bottle in Germany at home thanks to shrubber85. This was an interesting Southern Pils. Not sure what is looked like since it was from the bottle. Taste was sweet and had some herbs in it. The palate was a let down as it settled into a dry flowery aftertaste. Mid range beer.
"
1," Grainy nose with a touch of a herbal ""wooden"" hoppiness; pale golden coloured, slightly hazy, small foamy, sticking to the glass; delicate sweetish-bitter flavour, light to medium bodied; mild but rather spicy short bitter-sweet finish. Quite well drinkable, but nothing special........
"
1," Bottle - a fairly strong bourbon aroma what gives way gradually to some chocolate as it warms.  Black body with a huge near medium-brown head.  It really is overcarbonated.  It took 4 series of pouring and waiting for the head to subside to get 3/4s of a glass.  The flavor is kind of odd.  Some swallows the bourbon is up front and others it is in the finish.  I dont know that Ive experienced that before.  There is some chocolate in there, as well.  Fairly thin for the style and lacking the creaminess that is typical for an Oatmeal Stout.  Interesting as most bourbon-aged beers are.  Another rater said that it is too small for the bourbon and that may be true.  Hopefully theyll stick with it and tweak it.  Shows promise.
"
1," Draft at BRG.		Poured clear copper color with an average frothy white head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Medium Euro hop aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium sweet flavor with a medium tingly sweet finish of moderate duration.		I would recommend this to a freind.
"
1," Bottled (BB 11/2009)	Thanks Bjrn!	Golden color, small white head. Grassy, green wood aroma. Sweet malty, butterscotch, low bitterness - not much a pils.

1," Dark amber with a nice head. The aroma has notes of roasted malt, caramel and hops. The flavour has the same notes plus a hint of licorice and a nice bitter finish.
"
1," it just smells nice. Flavor is again fruity, with a slight hint of alcohol (I must make it clear that the sense of alcohol is very different from that of most low-quality, mass-produced, high-alcohol beers Ive tasted; this one is just a pleasant hint). Overall a very good flavor. Though, I expected a stronger and longer finish. I must admit this is the weakest side of this brew, though the rest is well worth it.
"
1," Bottle 330ml. Pours dark brown with a high foam. Aroma hay, earthy. Taste with a hint of licoricel A very classic belgian trappist procut. Not Bad.
"
1," Expected more from this.  Poured nearly opaque black with an ample frothy brown head.  Slight note of vanilla, wisp of bourbon, touch of oak.  Nothing intense.  Very subtle.  Stouts should not be subtle.  Especially bourbon barrel-aged ones.  Also, too much carbonation and too light in the body.  The flavor was weak notes of bourbon, coffee, chocolate.  Disappointing.
"
1," Outstanding. Ive had the red on several occasions and always enjoyed it, but the blue is far superior.  Complex with nutty, roasted malt up front followed by hints of raisin, currant and spices.  Everry sip from this ale brings you a little something new as it warms in your galss.
"
1," Bottle. Poured a nice reddish amber with a fairly decent head that dissapated quickly. This is similar in style to the Bleu however this one has more of a fruity and nutty character to it. The alcohol content doesnt become noticeable at first take. A good beer but I like the Bleu a lot more.
"
1," Cloudy gold with weak, creamy white head / Odd, cooked, sour citrus and spice nose / Medium body, fat with low carbonation, some sweetness with big, sour malts, and fair finish / Big, somewhat cloying and sour flavors of banana, orange, lemon, cloves, and coriander / Not awful, but clumsy.
"
1," MAR 19, 2008 Dark brown color with a dissipating beige head. Pleasant (although definitely a bit weaker than I expected) aroma of malt, dark fruits (and maybe some not-so-dark ones as well), some yeast, and hints of alcohol. Sweet flavor with malt, caramel, lots of plums, some spices and a dry and quite alcoholic finish. Full body and a nice mouthfeel. This beer isnt astonishing, but very good nonetheless. Maybe the bottles in my cellar will be even better with some years on them (this bottle is quite fresh).
"
1," Pours beautiful clear brown with reddish tinge, like chocolate or an antique copper color, like an old, old penny. The medium head is tan and lingering. Fruity aromas, almost like wine, with assorted fresh bread aromas.	And the taste! Oh, the taste. Marvelous! Wonderous! Sweet, yet not cloying, with a mild astringency and hoppy bitterness, all balancing out in a glorious dance of flavors and textures, no one flavor dominating, all in harmony. Even my mother liked  it, and my mother doesnt like most beer. Rich and full, and finishes nice and clean. 	Nothing negative to say about it, cept I wish I had another one handy!
"
1," Pours a little bit darker than cola brown with just a scant bit of tan head. Nice fruity aroma of dried cherries and cranberries. I also pick up some Christmas candy and a pepper note. The flavor seems to be a more complex blend of fruit with some chocolate and caramel syrup, but its not sweet. There is a very pleasing alcoholic finish. Full body with a slick mouthfeel. Enough carbonation to keep the beer from being still. This beer is a really nice surprise. Recommended.
"
1," I think this one is getting a bad rap. I have tried bottles repeatedly, and been to the pub. This is no SNPA, Red Seal, or Stone, but it is pretty good. Nice citrusy/floral hop aroma, good malt foundation, especially for the ABV. Nice hop flavor. Sort of a session APA - thats a first. Maybe theyve had QC issues judging by the other reviews, but Ive had consistently good APA from this place.
"
1," Bottle. Brown with voluminous frothy head. Smells sweet and grainy.  Mild sweetness with heavy carbonation.
"
1," Shared bottle at RBNAG 2011. Golden-brown colour. Spicy and ""typically Belgian"" aroma. Pleasant and moderately spicy flavour, not too sweet, again ""typically Belgian"". A decent trappist, but not of the trailblazing kind.
"
1," on tap 7/18/10.		gold pour with a white clingy head. 		peachy grainy aroma. 		it tastes like grain husks, peaches and florals. its a bit sweeter than id like but tasty nonetheless.... maybe it is accentuated by the medium body and slick mouth feel. 6/3/6/3/13/3.1
"
1," Bottle from Crown#6. Pours pitch black with negligible head. Nose has some decent bourbon, not very strong, accompanied by roasted malts. Taste is pretty bitter with lots of roasted malt and a touch of bourbon flavor. Flavors seem a little off, but it might be the lingering taste of the G.I. BCS I had two days ago (tough act to follow).
"
1," 0.33L bottle.Small dense head, brown colour, a bit murky, light yeasty nose with some scent of almonds. Taste of dark chocolate and some dried friuts that is quickly overpowered by a strong presence of alcohol, aftertaste is  sweet and buttery. Overall, a big dissapointment.
"
1," A copper color with a moderate head. Aroma is faint malt. Flavor is very malty with a hint of caramel and nuts. Some citrus fruit is present. The aftertaste is slightly bitter. Not a bad beer.
"
1," Bottle courtesty of Jasons dad.  Clear black body under a small dark tan head.  Cherries, whiskey, and black roast in the aroma.  Nothing too sweet but its intriguing.  The flavor just sucks - its a thin, dry oatmeal stout overridden by cheap-tasting whiskey.  A big letdown.
"
1," Malted taste, a little persistent alcoholic. Nice persistant foam. Cloudy aspect.
"
1," between caramel an cereal, amber and with low sparkling, heavy but pleasant and creamy
"
1," DEC 18, 2007 Does anyone else find the ubiquity of this ""Trappist"" ale a bit disconcerting?	How many barrels can they make of this stuff and retain quality?  Huge explosion in the kitchen when my wife opened this, attacking one of our guests with the cork during a dinner party.  Huge carbonation, prune scent, a bit sweeter than I had expected.  Wonderful yeasty funkiness, as expected. Dessert.
"
1," Shared with a friend.  Pours a nice amber color with no head.  Taste of soap and dried fruit.  Taste is very sweet.  Great beer
"
1," Tap at Rock Bottom (Atlanta) - Deep coppery orange, light tan head.  Nose was nice with floral, earthy, fruity hop tones, and an underlying caramel toffee malt note throughout.  Very well balanced for an IPA (maybe too balanced).  Good floral earthy, sweet malt combo.  Medium bodied and smooth, light carbonation, wet, hoppysweet finish.  A nice session IPA at 5.9%
"
1," Pours a cloudy golden color with a medium white head. Decent aroma of spicy hops and toasted malt. Interesting flavor of spicy hops and toasted malt with mild bitterness in the end. The body is light to medium with a creamy texture and moderate carbonation. Interesting, but somewhat forgettable.
"
1," Bottled. Very flowery aroma like many Bavarian beers, hint of citrus. Dark golden color, white head, good lace. Sweet malts, flowery, light bitter, very soft. Pretty straigforward but still very nice.
"
1," this crap tasted like the lager.  skunky and adjuncts.  part of the first 2 of the night.  disappointing so far.
"
1," APR 26, 2010 Bottle 2010 edition.Dark brown colour with beige head. Aroma and taste of banana, wheat, dried fruit and yeast. Way too much banana aroma. A bit like dunkel weissbiers from Mnich. Big dissapointment.	Bottle 2008 edition. Dark brown colour with a thin beige head. Aroma and taste dark sugars, flower, yeast and dried fruit. Bitter finish. Tasted along with St.Bernadus Abt12 on the side. Abt12 being so much more of everything and longer finish. Chimay being a dissapointment.
"
1," First Belgian Strong I ever tried. God bless the Flying Saucer in Ft. Worth for opening my eyes to Chimay. I like comparing Chimay to champagne because of the crispness of a freshly poured glass.
"
1," Beautiful to look at. Especially as it sits in the Chimay trappist glassware. Dark brown in colour with a large white bubbley head. Floral and fruity in aroma. Dark fruit and malt taste. Not going to re-invent the wheel here, what has been said about this beer with forever be said...in is just fantastic.
"
1," Color is medium to dark brown. Overall smooth with a bite of hops and alochol especially at the end.
"
1," Dark red/brown with a slightly off-white head. Tasted malty, nutty with a slight bitterness. Malty and alcoholic finish. Nice, but nothing spectacular.
"
1," bittersweet, my least favorite of the red white and blue but still awesome
"
1," Dark brown, tan, frothy head. Fruity aroma, slight alcohol taste. A bit nutty (perhaps almonds and hazelnut), and fruity. Very mellow and easy to drink. One of my favorite stand by beers
"
1," In the 330 mL bottle from Beertopia. I surprised that I had not rated this one before. Lucky for me that Beertopia breaks up the holiday pack and sells these individually. Pours deep gold with an enormous concrete-like off white head. This head stays rock hard throughout the drink. It is almost a solid. The aroma is mildly fruity, but also has a bread dough scent like the baking of rolls. The flavor has a mid point sweetness that gives rise to a big orange peel bitterness on the back of the tongue that just sits there and gouges you. Plenty of black pepper on this one as well.
"
1," 1pt 9.4oz Bottled 03/09. Pours a deep dark cloudy amber with a foamy light tan head. Aromas of rich dark fruits, mellowed caramel, oak, and spices. Flavor is somewhat rich. Its yeasty, mellowed dark fruit, slightly floral, and has a slight roasted malt backing with a touch of oak. Sweet but not to sweet. Somewhat dry finish. The flavors kinda rise up then sort of dissolve after the finished sip. The flavors were kinda mellowed in this bottle.....Very good stuff.
"
1," Not my favourite style. This is an average Weizen Bock. Slightly bitter. Somewhat sweet and a load of alcohol.
"
1," On tap at 11 Meibockfestival (Amsterdam, May 2008). Straw, golden body with medium head. Nose of malts and flowers. Taste of malt and fruits. Smooth texture. Dry finish.
"
1," Bottle. Pours hazy orange with a fluffy white head. Ripe fruit in the aroma, orange, peach, apricot and maybe even raspberry, as well as yeast. Medium body, very smooth. Flavor is tart and sweet, with orange, apricot, and floral hops, followed by a pleasantly bitter finish. Very well balanced and easy to drink. This is something I could drink every day.
"
1," A 11.20 oz bottle with not made or freshness date on it. The beer pours a creamy dark brown with a tan head that goes away fast and leaves no lacing. The smell is a bittersweet hops and malts. The taste was a crisp and malty. A good carbonation and the taste is wonderful.
"
1," Dry, bitter, somewhat thin...  forgettable pale ale for me.  Pretty color I guess...
"
1," 11.2 oz bottle. Pour nicely into my glass. Wonderful appearance. Chuncky murk that smells of spice and subtle fruit. Nice carbonation. An earthy flavor. Wonderful! 	1 of my top 3 ales!
"
1," Pours murky brown with a large lasting head.	Nose shows golden syrup and brown sugar along with spicy phenolic yeast and some light fruity esters.	Flavours are very doughy (overwhelmingly) with more spicy yeast and alcohol.	Carbonation is low, especially for the style. Probably the first time Ive said a Belgian doesnt have enough carbonation actually.
"
1," NOV 3, 2003 This is a nice example of a Weizen.  Has a nice bit of the characteristic banana and clove character to it.  A great late spring to summer beer.  Served on draught, has a nice hazy gold color to it.  Tastes a bit tart, with a  pleasing amount of carbonation.  The yeast flavor is good, not assertive and all the proper components for a Bavarian Weizen are present"
1," Bottle
"
1," Pours dark brownish black with off white head, thanks to BenC for the bottle.  Aroma has notes of big rum soaked raisin, brown sugar, molasses, and some slight wine and grape notes.  Taste is sweet and dry with notes of brown sugar, slight grape and raisin, some slight candied dark fruit notes, finishing dry.  Good stuff, a bit sweet but very complex.
"
1," OCT 24, 2005 75 CL bottle. Pours cola brown with a thin tan head. Mild aroma of raisin / plum. Flavor is similar. Palate has a nice creamy bubbly feel. One wants to swish it around the toungue for the taste buds to have a full swim. A nice drink. (Updating my rating) Dropping this down to sub-4. Thinking about it, Ive enjoyed beers more than this one. Especially considering the price (most expensive beer next to Deus at my local store).
"
1," Deep, dark, smooth. Looks great in a Chimay chalice. Tastes great, no notice of alcohol whatsoever. My only complaint is that it could be more complex, but its highly drinkable, and eminently enjoyable.
"
1," Pours rich dark brown with a thick tan head. Aromas of fresh bread, sweet aroma, somewhat like caramel. Sweet flavor at first, with a hint of pleasant tartness, followed by a little bit of hops bitterness at the tail end. A little bit of the high alcohol shows through as well. Smooth mouthfeel. Great stuff, not as great as the red, only because of that high alcohol seeping through.
"
1," Very cream with some light burnt notes.
"
1," OCT 27, 2010 Trs bonne bire et surprenante. Petit format de bouteil. Ptillante et mousseuse...un peu crmeuse!

1," Fruity, spices, and pleasant hops aroma.  Clear copper.  Grapefruit bitterness, which is mildly off-set by sweet malts, but bitternss lingers.

1," Nose of wheat lemon coriander orange and coconut. Natural interesting. Hazy yellow orange pour nice white head. Flavor initially wheat quenching clean orange coriander lemon and a fresh coconut note oin the finish. Refreshing and unique.
"
1," Enjoyed at NoogFest III.  Clear golden lager with a lice looking slow carbonation.  Almost no aroma to speak ofmaybe some grain?? Light grain flavor with a bit of spicy hops.  Nothing really off in this on but pretty plain.
"
1," Slightly cloudy and dark golden pour with a huge white head that eventually recedes.  Spicey and fruity aroma, slightly sweet.  Flavor is yeasty with a slightly mustiness on the front end.  Middle reveals some banana, clove, apple and dried fruit.  Finishes dry with lingering yeast.  Pretty solid!
"
1," (Bottle 50 cl) Pale golden with a very small, white head. Lovely hoppy, floral nose. Incredibly light-bodied, lightly sweet malt and a lightly bitter finish. 170705
"
1," Nice beer poured from a bottle that was champagne like when opened, look out kid you could poke an eye out.  Ablue angel watching the Blue Devils (Duke).  Body was brownish, maroonish color, with a cream head that had zero bubbles.  I finally think  Iknow what a flowery nose means this was really neat.  Fruity, taste and very champagne like taste with much more substance, big fan.
"
1," on tap at brewpub. very dark brown, almost black, tall dark beige head, excellent retention and lacing. torrefied malts lots of dark caramel, coffee, very woody, hint of sweetness. soft carbonation, very creamy. good stout.
"
1," I would suggest that the brewer give Helen a bath and bottle the bath water.  Nose is flowery, the taste is stale, grainy, and not well-balanced.
"
1," A traditional English bitter, the malt profile displays bready and toasty notes
"
1," big head on the poor, not enough lacing to speak of. beer is colored dark walnut. aroma is of a less potent belgian strong- spice, nuttiness, intiguing overall. reserved but delicious flavor of caramel, spice, hints of red wine and nutmeg as well. good mouthfeel, very very nice beer.
"
1," The aroma is on the light side, everything else is right on the mark. Never can say I had bad Chimay, especially the blue.
"
1," Thanks for the bottle Yaniv!  Pours a darker slightly hazed reddish brown with a thin warm tan head.  The nose is creamy with rich malt and a subtle belgian fruitiness.  Dark fruit and chocolate.  I cannot smell any alcohol.  Really remarkable clean, especially considering my past experience with Barley Island.  Creamy full mouthfeel, heavy, but not inappropriate.  The flavor is in line with the nose.  Perhaps better.  Big ass malt, very creamy.  Bubblegum.  Dark fruit, some chocolate.  Ridiculously sweet, but the malt is so round it works.  A bit of fruity Belgian yeastiness.  Lingering roast might be out of place given the Belgian yeastiness, but I just really like this beer a lot.  I may have overrated this... but it is drinking really great and I think this brewery need some encouragement to make more brews like this!
"
1," Slightly sweet, nothing over the top.  Good session beer and one of the better offerings from Big River.  Normally a winter for them, but they had it on tap in May.  Reminds me of a sweeter Bass.
"
1," ""Poured out a copper color with a huge head with a ton of staying power. Has a fruity smell. Has an unbelievable smooth flavor. This is one i will try again and will now have to try other chimay""
"
1," (bottle) pours a clear yellow colour with a frothy white head. aroma of honeyed pale malts and herbal hops. taste is the same, with dominant herbal hoppy overtones and a sweet honey finish. medium body and carbonation.
"
1," Copper color with a full light tan head. Almonds coated with toffee, brown sugar and caramel. Sound sweet? Smells sweet! Rich toffee and caramel flavors that keep on going, but a hint of vanilla comes in towards the end. This and flan might be an interesting combination. Did I tell you this is sweet.
"
1," Bottled. A nut-brown beer with a lazing beige head. The aroma is sweet malty with notes of caramel and rye bread. The flavor is sweet malty  with strong notes of caramel and rye bread, but also lighter notes of burnt malt. The body is a bit thin.
"
1, BA Count Hopula	Date
1," 33cl bottle. Pours a chestnut brown colour with a purple-ish hue and a good head. The nose has slightly stewed apples with some raisins. The taste is of more apples, some grapes and a touch of alcohol sweetness on the end. The palate has huge depth, a thick texture but still quite a clean ending. Overall, a big complex tastey beer!
"
1," Huh. Cant believe Ive never rated this one. I used to buy Chimay all the time - before I realized how good Belgian beer can be. Still, you cant go wrong with Chimay.
"
1," Bottle ( 375ml clear, corked ).  Purchased at 2009 Mondiale from the Cidery booth.  Slightly amber-tinged gold, clear, slightly thick and oily-looking, minimal white head.  Aroma of moderate alcohol, tangy, slightly overripe golden apple (with some skin);  simple, a bit delicate, very good.  Taste follows - vaguely of baked alaska and slightly green off-dry chablis, doesnt seem very sweet up front, but you get sweet tangy ripe apple in the finish - quite tasty, I would love this with the pate-maison at Le Select Bistro.  Slick, somewhat acidic mouthfeel, a delicate mineral tanginess in the finish, moderately alcohol -TASTING (but seems to pack more of a punch than the 10.5% ABV listed) - I would definitely get this again, well above middle of the pack, IMO.
"
1," Roasty, chocolate taste.  Extremely dark.  Very smooth and creamy.  Excellent!
"
1," High alcohol is noticeable in the flavor, but is just a pleasant warming, and is not overbearing.  Best in a snifter and allowed to warm slowly.  Coffee black in color.
"
1," Pours to a rust colored body with a thin white head and nice lacing.  The aroma is really floral.  The flavor is floral and toasty.  Too floral for my tastes.  The palate is bitter and carbonated.
"
1," Only had this one from the bottle. Leave lots of room for the ample head. Youll find this one in lots of places that the other Chimay colors wont show their faces. It is a good beer but better can be head for the dollar. Spring for th Blue Chimay (Grande Reserve) for a far superior brew and easier sging.
"
1," 33cl bottle, Sampled December 2004	Pours a lightly hazy amber copper color that is topped by a pale amber head that is large and frothy.  The beer is well carbonated with a steady cascade of bubbles rising form the bottom of my glass.  The aroma is typical of the chime yeast with notes of bubblegum, alcohol, fruity notes of plum and raisin, some spicy notes of ginger, all-spice, and clove.  The fruity notes are definitely the dominant ones in the nose.		The taste is lightly sweet, with soft fruity notes of plum, raisin, fig and clove  up front.  The beer then moves to a sharp note that is a mix of carbonation, and yeast derived esters, as well as a bit of alcohol in the finish.  The beer is quite light on the palate, almost a bit too thin.  There is a certain level of astringency in the finish, which I have always found a bit distracting in beer brewed with the Chimay yeast strain.		Overall this is not a bad brew, certainly nothing to get really excited about, but it is a solid beer.  It really could use a boost in the malt intensity / body department though, it just seems a bit thin.
"
1," Very fruity and malty palate. Full pack of flavour on the palate with a rich mouth feel. When the beer warms up the aroma increases. A great beer to cook with and to use in food.
"
1, Pours a nice dark black hue. Nice tall tan head solid retention with nice chunks of lace.		S
1," Draught(Atlanta).  Golden color, small head.  Nonexistent aroma.  Soft finish, grainy flavor.  Off flavors in finish.  Slight bitterness.
"
1," Pours a hazy amber with an off white head.  Aroma is yeasty, floral, rich malt, and dark fruit. Flavor is rich malt, fruity notes, caramel, yeasty, with some Belgian spices.
"
1," (swing top bottle) Hazy, deep golden colour with a thick and slightly off-white frothy head. Sourish citrus-fruity nose with light wheaty notes, combined with a perfumed touch of bubblegum and cloves. Sweet and sour flavour, light to medium bodied with a slightly fizzy carbonation. Light wheat-character, yeasty and fruity, slightly perfumed taste; moderately dry, slim and slightly fruity finish. Not overly aromatic (30.06.08).
"
1," (bottle) Clear, pale golden colour with a blond foamy head of medium size. Lemon-fruity, slightly artificial nose with a light-sweet malty blend and metallic hops. Sweet flavour, light bodied with a moderate carbonation. Initially tangy fruity with light malt-character showing up from the middle part and gaining just a tiny bit more weight towards the fruity and minimal grassy hoppy finish. 18.VI.10
"
1," Draft. Pours near black with a beige head. Roasted malty aroma with light coffee and light chocolate. The flavor has lightly roasted malts, and some light sweet malty notes. Pretty good.
"
1," Clear golden amber with a frothy off-white head. Aroma of berry, honey. Taste is bitter earthiness, honey, berry, roasted malt, grapes. Thin body, medium carbonation.
"
1," 750ml bottle shared with a friend - Pours dark brown with a short tan head that faded fairly quick but left some lacing.  Aromas of caramel, raisin, some candi sugar, corriander, yeast.  Quite complex.  Flavor is every bit as complex with caramel, raisin, hints of chocolate, candi sugar, corriander and a good dose of yeast. Smooth on the palate with a very soft mouthfeel  Slight carbonation makes this ever so easy to drink.  Somewhat dry at the finish.  Nice beer.
"
1," JAN 18, 2009 	Name"
1," Large, but quickly disappaiting tan head and reddish copper body flow from the 330 ml bottle.  Excellent lacing.  I miss the uncorking ceremony accompanying most good Belgians.  A light fruity aroma and subtle sweetness in the initial palate were a bit unexpected and differ a bit from other dubbels.  This variety is a tad less bold and complex.  Still, the advertised apricot flavor was present, as were plum and black cherry in the mid-palate.  A pleasant sourness and smooth dry finish put strong postmemo  to this beer.
"
1," Great Aroma coming alongside with this dark brown colour! Rich body with a bittersweet ending.
"
1," On tap in Nashville.  It has a beaitiful dark brown color.  Very sweet taste, but with an annoying lingering metallic aftertaste that I found with every sampler I had here.  When the bartender found out I was on Ratebeer, he brought out an additional sampler from ""the engine"" instead of the tap, and it was much smoother and creamier, and without the metallic aftertaste.
"
1," This is some good beer.  It smells fairly yeasty, with some hints of fruit (maybe citrus).  It looks great.  It tastes malty with just the slightest hint of fruit and flowers.  Slightly tart, slightly spicy.  I picked a smokey flavor on my first couple of sips.  	It has an outstanding mouthfeel.
"
1," (bottle, 50cl, as Hrte 10 der strkstern Biere) Cloudy, orange to amber colour with an almost blond medium-sized foamy head. Very Belgian-yeasty cara-malty and slightly wheaty aroma with notes of liquorice, fruity accents of apricot, faint banana and phenolic spices, accompanied by a touch of plastic and alcohol. Sweet flavour, full bodied with a very soft carbonation. Robust cara-malty body with a slightly nutty and wheaty touch, accompanied by a delicate fruit-character of dried apricots and ripe bananas; sweet malty and delicately fruity finish with well-covered alcoholic notes. Finally pleasant stuff, extra point for the effort. 15.X.10
"
1," Draught at Siborie. I had Lingnieuse 4.0. Fine off white foam. It has a amber whiskey color with oak aroma and a litle vanilla. Small malt and bitterness but balanced.
"
1," on tap. Wow, I was not excited to order this one, given my disdain for American wheat beers. The bartender wasnt sure which style this was. Upon receiving my weizen glass and taking a whiff, I was relieved. Very strong esters are evident in the nose with assertive Euro hops. Clove, banana, wood, bread are all evident here. This is thirst quenching and juicy, yet not too light by any means. I was actually surprised at how evident the hop character was. Wooden tones are apparent throughout the flavor, giving a pleasant acidic edge to the juicy banana and clove thing. This was surprisingly well executed. This beer is most obviously a German styled hefeweizen. . .kind of reminds me of Victory Sunrise.
"
1," This bottled brew poured a dark brown head of fine to medium sized mostly lasting white colored bubbles that left behind a fair lacing.  The bubbles from the carbonation and the head formed a beautiful cascading flow of bubbles and carbonation as it formed a body with an opaque black color and no visible carbonation inside of it.  The aroma was of roasted barley and dark malts with a vinous alcohol content noted.  The mouth feel was fairly smooth with a very noticeable biting coffee flavor from the start to the finish.  The flavor contained notes of coffee, molasses, dark malts and roasted barley.
"
1," Bottle. Brown beer with a nice froth. Smells like an ""After 8"" chocolate mint as advertised. First sip is wierd. A bit metallic, a bit of smoke, chocolate and mint. I think to do this experiment properly you need to add mint to a thick chocolately porter or brown ale. This one is too tame to carry the flavours. Overall described as metallic mint with a chocolate aftertaste.
"
1," I had heard so many great things about this beer I was really excited to try it.  To tell you the honest truth I was disappointed.  There was definately a fruity taste to it, but it loses the smoothness that is apparent in the red label.  Doesnt have the sweetness and great flavor of most quality beers this dark.  Dont get me wrong this beer is still fantastic, but not as good of a drink as the red label which I love.
"
1," Clear pale yellow with weak hop aroma. Pretty light with some grainy notes and a slight hop finish. I guess you could call it refreshing, but it doesnt really have anything else going for it.
"
1," Chimay Bleue. Simply amazing. Appearance wise it isnt the most beautiful beer. It pours our a reddish brown color that is relatively hazy. You can see particulates floating within the brew. It has a beige head of good size but retention is low. It dissipates very fast and has very little to no lacing. The aroma is nothing short of amazing. It has caramel notes as well as brown sugar, spices, and dark fruits. Its quite floral. The flavor accompanies the aroma very well. It has a floral flavor with a yeasty component accented by the caramel and dark fruits. It has a medium to heavy body that carries the flavor well and it goes down very smooth. This a definitely must try as its simple delightful.
"
1," Dark color, incredibly soft mouthfeel, powerful initial balanced malt blast of fruit and caramel flavors. I didnt find it as smooth as the Red, but its powerful flavor compensates for this. Another world classic from Chimay.
"
1," Amber coloured. Murky. Off white head. A spiced, wheaty, sweet and light alcohol dense brew. Is light fruity and acidic. Refreshing and very good when sitting in the sun with your s.o.
"
1," Pours a light gold with a thin white head. No lacing. Aroma  is hoppy.  Typical of a light beer.  This is good for a light, but still not good for a beer.
"
1," Bottle via trade with mmm///beer.  This brew pours a thick, hazy orange with a continual slow bubbling and a modest light head. The aroma is dominated by the hops, grapefruit and a sharp floral scent, with some sweet malt seeping through. The mouth feel is thick and fizzy, tickling the tongue. No definitive malt flavor shines through, but its sweetness adds some balance to the citric, earthy hop bitterness that takes over the taste. Nice bitter finish. Pretty good stuff.

1," Its been awhile since I had this.  Drank a full bottle to the head during the superbowl.  Finished right before the infamous ""wardrobe malfunction"" that no one in the room cared about within 10 seconds.  Especiallly not me.  I was too enamored with the Bleu.

1," Dark brown pour, thick moussey beige head.  Aroma is fairly light, brown sugar, spice, figs.  Brown sugar sweetness and toasted bread flavors, spice, pepper, dried cherry, fig and a lingering warming finish.  Fairly heavy body, slightly viscous.  Its a shame that Ive walked by this so often in grocery stores without trying it.
"
1," FEB 10, 2009 VERY solid java stout! Looks like ink when it pours, and creates a very thick and frothy tan head. Aroma is awesome, all malt/chocolate/coffee. Taste is much the same, just a tad watery. I usually complain about brews being too strong, but this one should have been slightly stronger. This is just me nitpicking though, this is really delicious and another good offering by Barley Island, a really underrated local brewery.

1," Last beer I had at NoogFest - luckily the numbers I wrote down were readable. Otherwise I could tell you that the beer was apparently ""clully"", ""Whittle"", as well as ""hoopy"". It also had a ""decent Illecc"", as best as I can tell from my notes.
"
1," One more great example of good trapist ales.
"
1," Thanks to JCB for sharing one!  Pours a clear dark reddish brown with minimal head. Nose is light coffee, roasted barley, and chocolate.  This share many similarities to a belgian dubbel
"
1," Bottle... oh nice effect. iIn the bottle, it looks like a lava lamp - the unfiltered rice falls to the bottom and the clear liquid floats easily on top. Has an aroma and favor of pineapple and a light glue. Strong flavor. Very creamy... smooth.
"
1," Bottle. Large white light creamy head that mostly lasted. Good lacing. Light hazy body with a light amber colour. Banana, caramel, wheat, clove, coriander, yeast, citrus. Light to medium bodied with a fizzy carbonation. Flavour was light sweet malt with some citrus acidic. Sweet and somewhat fresh finish. Nice one!
"
1," Dark amber pour with a good fizzy head.  I not usually a fan of fruity beers but this has a darker fruit feel with plenty of alcohol taste.
"
1," A decent Chimay beer but not as good as the blue. Red in color. Very fruity with a smooth finish.
"
1," From a 33cl bottle from Picks Liquors poured into a Trappist glass. Pours a dark brown with ruby notes when held up to the light. An off-white/tan head that lasts forever. The aroma is sweet and fruity. The taste is medium sweet and medium sour. Full bodied and thick, this beer has fizzy carbonation and a long, sour aftertaste. Maybe Im crazy, but I remember having this beer out a corked 750ml bottle and it tasting much sweeter. Overall, I give it a B rating. Will I drink it again? Probably. If it didnt have such wide distribution though I wouldnt actively seek it out.
"
1," Bottle 330ml. w. swing top @ home.[ Trade by Koelschtrinker ]. BBF201007. Clear medium orange color with a average, frothy, good lacing, mostly diminishing, off-white to white head. Aroma is moderate malty, bread, caramel, oxidide, sugar, alcohol. Flavor is moderate sweet to heavy with a long duration, sweet malt, sweet sugar, oxidie. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. [20110317]
"
1," Light amber colour with a thin white head. Hoppy aroma fairly nice. Medium-bodied; Silky mouthful. Bright citrusey hop taste. Avertaste clean and hoppy. Overall, better than the average APA. I had this on draught at Big River (owned by Gordon Biercsh) in Chattanooga, Tennesse on 26-September-2003.
"
1," Not as full as the blue, but a fully refined Ale. Very distinctive Chimay fruitiness. Excellent stuff.
"
1," Very hazy gold color. Lots of white head at the top, but I later found out that I stored it improperly (store upright, not on its side). Strong taste, cant tell the flavor, but its strong. I prefer Chimay Red more than White.
"
1," Poured a dark brown with a creamy thin off-white head. Smelled of yeast and fruit. The body was very powerfull and complex. There were aspects of yeast flavors, fruitiness, and a sweet caramel backbone. Also, I detected a more than subtle hint of raisin in the aftertaste. Truly an experience to remember. My hats off to the monks that make this extraordinary beer.
"
1," (bottle) Hazy, light-orange colour with a massive and persistent foamy white head. Sweet and slightly sour-fruity (citrus) and yeasty nose with a moderate wheat-character and soft spicy peppery phenols, reminding me a bit of ethereal peppermint. Medium-sweet and slightly sourish tart flavour, light to medium bodied with a lively carbonation. Wheaty, moderately citrus-fruity and slightly yeasty taste with restrained spicy phenols; finishes quite dry, slightly bitter and tart, but also a bit empty. Otherwise pretty balanced and likeable (26.02.08).
"
1," Im trying to get into stouts. Only problem is, I hate coffee. I tried this. Someone told me to break into stouts via an oatmeal, not a dry stout. So far, so good. I like it! Pours perfect black, with 2 finger creamy head. Smells of toffee, chocolate, and wonderful roasted malt. Nice. Tastes of toffee, chocolate, deep roasted malt & to my surprise, not much a coffee note. Its there, but blocked by the sweetness. I found my favorite oatmeal stout as of now, downed 2 bottles of it, and really enjoyed every drop. Nicely done guys!
"
1," GCBF. Nice pour to a thinned head which disappeared quickly. Red amber colour with a bit of orange to it. Nice looking beer. Not much hop aroma, but what there is has a citrus pine tang to it. Smells ok. A good tasting beer, but bland and unspectacular. Nothing offensive or surprising. Happy to drink this, but I wouldnt go out of my way for it.
"
1," Bottled. An uncelear golden beer with a white head. The aroma is sweet matly with notes of bananas and wheat, and so is the flavor combined with a note of oranges, leading to a dry wheaty finish. Quite refreshing.
"
1," Kind of like walking the Johny Walker trail of colorified increasing better tasting beverages, the Chimay Rouge falls between the white and blue in my book.
"
1," Some dark foggy yeast and faint raspberry.  The bottle gushed a bit upon opening, though did not have an overactive amount of head in the glass.  The head was weak in body and fell quickly.  The body is a picturesque amber, nicely dense with sedimentary goodness.  soft gentle ripe plum and blackberry notes, rounded out nicely.  Light on the palate.  more dark fruits, i getting the apricot now, finish is pretty abrupt after all that sweetness.  Some leather too.
"
1," pours medium dark reddish, slight haze, with an ok-head, but disappearing quickly leaving a rind, good lacing. caramel, roasted malts, some wheat, dark bitter fruits, a lot of fruitiness, whole leafed hops, very dry, herbal and grassy. light to medium body, average carbonation for the type. hint of sweetness with fresh yeast, a lot of spicyness, peppery, classic chimay yeast. just like the red, with a little more roastiness and more alcohol.
"
1," Bottled. Hazy golden colour, small beige head. Aroma is wheat, some mild acidic notes, fruits as well as some yeastyness. Flavour is slightly acidic wheat with some mild banana and herbal notes. Also some yeastyness. Quite pleasant.
"
1," This one caught me off guard as I had heard mostly bad things about Dead Frog. The pour is a bright amber orange with a two finger thick white head. The aroma is tons of citrus hops with a light herbal pine note. A predominantly bitter grapefruit taste with a mild caramel maltiness and light alcohol finish. What sets this apart is a nice tropical fruit flavour. Pineapple, peach, and mango are all subtly present in the middle. A big hop bomb finish, but overall this is a nice citra IPA!
