"
1," Pours copper with a large fizzy off-white head that is mostly lasting but leaving some not so good lacing.  The flavor is yeasty with some apple and grape.  The body is light to medium with a dry and oily texture and fizzy carbonation.
"
1," Not as good as the Blue, but really wonderful.  All Chimays are great beers.  Malty, dried fruits and spice.  Cheers!
"
1," JUN 12, 2010 Cloudy brown pour, medium soapy-creamyish head, slightly tanned.	Aroma of old beer, fruits, caramel, oak.	Dare I say somewhat thin flavour and mouthfeel, some spices.	Ok beer, but I not a fan.
"
1," Tulip at brewery - Hoppy aroma is earthy and a little funky, turns to play-doh after it warms.  Pours copper with a small head and great lacing.  Flavor is a nice blend of caramel and citrus hops.  Palate is smooth and not too tart and alcohol is well hidden.  I think they are using a different hop than your regular IIPA but I cant put my finger on it.  A nice one.
"
1," Again with the yeast. Chimay Red was a good looker but poor performer. Its overcarbonated and equally flat if that makes sense. Blue has grown on me into some sort of chewy metamorphosis, but red I dont think has a chance. At best I got a faint amount of malt and some caramelly tones. maybe some dark fruits but I was so frustrated that I didnt bother. bleh

1,"  Une odeur complexe dpice et de caramel qui sessoufle un oeu vite.	Piquant sur la langue (Co2, pas tabasco!), got complexe dpice (disons coriandre et clou de girofle. ;) ), amertume costaude (sans tre dans le territoire dune IPA), caramel discret et peut-tre un peu de vanille (je cite les experts ;) ).  Bref, il sen passe des choses en bouche!
"
1," pint at BI - Aroma is yeasty with sharp spice and citrus as it warms.  Pours cloudy brown-yellow with no head and decent lacing.  Flavor matches aroma with a little banana.  Palate is creamy and smooth with some  tartness in the finish.  Not bad and easy drinking.
"
1," Bright reddish brown beer that quickly loses its head. The smell is sweet caramel malty and subtle roasty. The flavors range from roasted malt, bitter hops and a slight hints of caramel. The finish is slightly caramelly, with strong malt body.
"
1," A beautiful beer in many ways. Deep malt flavors and aromas make this beer a great place to call home. Although, one should taste all of the Chimay beers before passing judgement on this overall lovely beer.
"
1," Quite a beer.  It pours a beautiful color.  Has a great big head tht you have to wait for it to dissapate so you can pour some more and wait again to finally drink.  Aroma is of nice fruity (apricot) aroma with hints of cream and banannas.  The taste isnt as full as I expected.  Very creamy and smooth, but the tastes werent as complex as I had hoped.
"
1," this is some wicked shit very strong to the taste this looks almost ruby red and is very tart in my mind but at the same time is very smooth
"
1," Light yellow colored with little white head. Buttery aroma with cardboard and thin lemon. Thin to medium bodied. Flavor is more lemony with cardboard and butter still, aftertaste dries with thin hops. Nothing special.
"
1," A light brown beer with a light taste.It is ok but nothing really special.
"
1," Draft. Poured hazy brown color with an average fizzy off-white head that was mostly lasting with fair lacing. Moderate to heavy toasted malt, yeast and alcohol aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy complex sweet flavor with a medium to heavy bittersweet finish of moderate to long duration. My expectations where exceeded.
"
1," Another masterpiece at the Beer Fest this last Saturday at Split Rock in the Poconos.  This is a hopped, fruity smell.  Appearance is hazy amber.  Flavor is complex with malt, fruit, maybe raisin.  The feel is smooth with adequate bitter.  Masterful.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours a dark brown body with a tan head 4 fingers high. Aroma is sweet malt, some belgian spices, and abv in the nose.  Flavor is that.  Not my favorite of the trappist ales  but a solid choice and my favorite from chimay.  You cant go wrong with this brew.
"
1," Well balanced, crisp tight flavors, and a decent medium body.  This is good, but I nothing experimental or daring.  It hits all the nails on the head, but this is just a better-executed version of a typical belgian strong.
"
1," Chimay es muy buena me gusta me llena y me complace. No solo es buena si no q tambien comlace al paladar
"
1," Cloudy orange colour with a small off white head. Malty aroma with a clear hoppy and grassy note. Malty, light grainy sweet flavor with a grassy and dry finish.
"
1," NOV 23, 2007 Smooth, with a touch of caramel but extraordinarily thin. I tasted this peculiar beer after a Leffe Brune. I much prefer the Leffe. Pleasant enough but bland. All the Chimays seem overrated.
"
1," I do really like this beer. However, compared to other similar and comparable beers, I dont think it holds up as well. Not really a knock on it, it is just in great company. That said, the availability of this beer is certainly a plus, and if I saw it for a good price, I would be all over it.
"
1," Glass at Den Tatoverede Enke, Copenhagen. Hazy orange with a two fingers thick, creamy, light brown head. Wooden, spicy Belgian yeast aroma. Sweet, spicy, acidic and light earthy flavor. Medium body. Dryish mouth.
"
1," Bomber bottle, poured a cloudy amber/orange color with a nice thick creamy head. There was a clean hoppy citrus fruit aroma. There was a creamy texture to the beer and a crisp smooth taste. Everything about this beer was mild and subtle. Nothing was overpowering, but there was a lot of different scents and flavors well blended. There was a light hoppiness and citrus flavor. The finish again was a mild bitterness with a subtle  sweetness underneath. I split this bottle over dinner of grilled scallops & asparagus and this beer paired really well with the scallops mild sweet flavor. Excellent mild, clean, complex beer.
"
1," on tap at brewpub. dark golden, orange tint, decent creamy head, decent retention, strong lacing. complex grassy fuggles medium hopping, also citrusy. average carbonation, light to medium body.
"
1," Poured a ruby brown with a big head and wonderful lacing. A truly full bodied beer enjoyed best sipped after a fine meal.  Everything comes together in this well balanced, flavorful brew.
"
1," Great belgian.  I am absolutely in love with Chimay, RED WHITE AND BLUE baby.  Enjoy this one with some sharp chedda.
"
1," Very dark brown. Slight brown head. Roasted malts, fruity (dark ripe fruit as plums and pears), yeasty (meat gravy), sugar malts. Taste is bitter as from roasted malts. Heavy malty upbuild. Fine aromas from nose are more coarse here; yeast still there, fruit reduced to some pear & sweet banana. More bitter retronasal, liquorice, woody flavour. Full bodied, chewy. Alcohol remains hidden. Still a great beer. And yet, I'm missing something. I wonder how this ages, and find the magnificence I associate it with.
"
1," Enjoyed at Great Taste of the Midwest festival. Poured a deep brown, with reddish notes. Huge tan head Chocolatey aroma. Nice and malty like a good English brown, but with a really solid hop backbone.
"
1," Bottled 33cl. Courtesy of Quack-Duck. Pale golden with a white head. Malty aroma with chestnut, herbs, faint boiled vegetables and some aroma hops showing up. Decent bitterness in the taste. Biscuity. Long dry finish. I like the flavor more than the nose. Thanks a lot Quack-Duck!
"
1," FEB 23, 2008 Dark brown beer with big white head. Aroma is sweet and there are plenty of dried fruits. There are not so much typical trappists spyciness than you could be expect. Palate is surprisingly light and medium carbonation makes this very easy to drink. There is enough to complexity to makes this interesting but it is not too complicated to enjoy.
"
1," Tasted in Tatoverede Enke, Copenhagen. Pours hazy golden with a big creamy off-white head. Lively carbonated.Aroma of dark sweet fruits, good malty sweetness. Taste is light sweet, malty with some alcohol presence, port wine and some nice spices, good choice. Complex and simple.
"
1," OCT 31, 2007 As I near 100 ratings, Im finally starting to explore the legenday Belgian and Trappist Ales. Im finding its a style I like, but this Chimay will never cross my lips again. Delightful earthy aroma"

Flavour is chewy, rich, moderate sweetness and bitterness, citrus hops, caramel malts.	Bitter mouthfeel, medium body, high carbonation.	Finishes dry, bitter, citrus. 	Getting old as the hops are muted and slightly cardboardish. Still a bit chewy. 	355ml bottle obtained in a trade with piscator34, thanks Kris.	Opened on February 27, 2009.	No date.
"
1," 500ml bottle from bierzwerg!	The beer in the glass has a very cloudy, light yellow color, the head is high, fine-creamy and very durable. Smells really very yeasty, fruity and slightly acidic minimal. Startis good recent, tangy, yeasty, and above all very sweet and fruity. Something Ive been treated, never. But I must say, it tastes really phenomenally good! Very tasty, incredibly aromatic and simply pleasant. One of the best german Weizen that Ive ever drunk so far!!!
"
1," Brown in color with ruby highlights. Aroma is of sugar, sweet malts, plums and figs. Taste is of sweet malt, light hops, fruit, and yeast.
"
1," Caramel colored body with off-white head.  Aroma of a delicately spiced banana bread. Quite appealing.  Good texture.  Creamy and full bodied.  Flavor was moderately sweet, malty, and a touch of spice.
"
1," Had this on tap last night at new Barley Island, broad ripple location. Pours medium brown with light tan head that fades. Nose is sweet brown malt and slightly sour brett. Taste is smooth, clean brown style malt with a perfectly balanced sour profile bringing in the brett flavor. I was skeptical of the at first, but it came out quite nicely IMHO. On the lighter side in terms of sour intensity, but the overall taste is very pleasant.
"
1," Great beer.  The cream of the crop.  Still waiting out on a better one.  Its waht all beers are comapred against for me right now.  The price is the one thing that gets me on it.  I end up usually buing the red instead.
"
1," Bottle.  dark brown pour with a tan head.  Hops and roasted malt aromas.  I get the orange peel.  In conjunction with big bland hops and cabernet notes.
"
1," 750mL bottle.  Great nutty malty almost chocolaty flavor.  Mild after taste.  Dark hazy amber color with light head.  Let sit out of refrigeration for a little while for best taste.  Tastes better at 55 degrees than 40.  Still an amazing beer either way.
"
1," Pints from BI at release party - This is going to be BIs entry for the ProAm category at GABF - Aroma is yeasty bubblegum and dark malts with a floral hint.  Pours very dark brown with a medium head and good lacing.  Flavor is roasted dark malts, bubblegum yeast, candi sugar and a touch of hops.  Palate is clean and a little sticky.  Hides alcohol well and is overall an easy drinking tasty brew.  Soon to be released in 22oz bottles.
"
1," Bottle. 11.2 FL. OZ.  A hazy dark orange to brown color with large, off-white head that quickly dissapates. Aromas of fruit, bread, and malt.  Nice amount of carbonation that seems to sizzle on my tongue.  Moderate sweet flavor followed by a dry finish.  A fine ale.
"
1," On tap. Slight malt aroma. A copper colored pour with a slight off white head. A decent malt on the front with an excelleent bitter finish. Slightly over carbonateed and a tad thin almost a 4 but not hardly. a pleasant surprise in that I expected the standard lager with no hops and the wet paper tates none of which was there. A good beer.
"
1," Right place, right time. Scammed some of Immys pre-release treat. After all of the seasonal & pumpkin ales I have tasted and frowned upon I wasnt expecting to flip over one anytime soon, but this one was an eye opener, an awakening of slumbering senses. I think the brewer has his mother chained in the back making homemade pumpkin pie to mix in this brew. The golden-pumpkin-orange colored brew looked like pumpkin pie topped with a creamy off-white head like it was cool-whip. Aroma is every fresh spice you would expect in grandmas pie on Turkey day and then some. Flavor was same, spice combination perfectly complimented the pumpkin flavor in this soul warming spiced brew. Watch out for the alcohol because the high level is very well hidden making it easy to drink and yearning for more. Too bad for the rest of the world but due to the limited quantities only us few lucky locals will be priviledged enough to enjoy this outstanding brew. I know what I am doing for Halloween!
"
1," To me one of the better Nigoris. Quite different with an almost woodsy creamy taste. Taste this one after you have tried the others.
"
1," Pours a light straw yellow color with a white head.  Aroma is light pilsner malts with a hint of spice.  Flavor is malty, grainy, with a light spicy finish.
"
1," Nice brown color, the best Chimay i have tasted. Smooth, but a nice amount of strength. Ends with a warmth fit for a solid winter brew. Love it!
"
1," Reddish brown color with thick creamy head. Fairly dry and malty aroma with  tart fruitiness and hints of dates. Fruity and tart flavor with dates, raisins and clove. Raisins, pepper and clove in the finish. Higly carbonated. Well made and balanced but a bit dull.

"
1," Tap, EPCOT, March '04.  Root beer colored beer, small but creamy head that faded quickly but lingered at edges and left a bit of lace.  Med-dark dried fruits on nose, golden raisins, sweet, not roasty or chocolatey.  Flavor of sweet, slightly roasted malts, coating palate but not cloying and sticky like some brown ales.  An average example of an uninteresting style, but not bad.
"
1," 11.2 oz. bottle- FIRST DRINK- How do these monks do it, these trappist brews are the envy of the world. This is the best of the bunch, one of the best brews in the world. Looks like mud, smells decent and tastes awesome, and awesome doesnt describe how much i love this beer. LAST DRINK- Mellows great, the only problem is that I dont have more.
"
1," (bottle) Cloudy, deep golden colour with a tall and slightly off-white foamy head. Yeasty, distinctively banana-fruity aroma with a present wheaty touch with delicately phenolic spices. Moderately sweet and slightly sour flavour, light bodied but not watery with a spritzy carbonation. Wheaty and yeasty taste with notes of banana and a tinge of citric sourness, especially towards the mildly sweet and slightly tart finish. Clean and refreshing Hefeweizen. 15.VIII.11
"
1," Bottle. Yeasty aroma. Almost clear, strangely pale yellow/brown colour. Unstable head. Thin flavour. I find it quite boring.
"
1," Poured dark brown with a large tan head.  Aroma of bourbon dominating the roasted malt.  The flavor too was dominated  by the bourbon with more roast underneath.  Medium body with a lively mouthfeel.
"
1," From my notes, August 05. My first beer over 6%. Nice brown color, ridiculously big head. Fruity aroma with hints of yeast. Nice smooth taste, alcohol slightly palpable. Malt flavors as well as florals and esters. Too complex for words, an amazing beer. Should be even better with cellaring.
"
1," Full of flavour and a bit sweet.
"
1," 22 ounce bottle.  Pours mostly black with some ruby highlights when held to light.  Slim off white head.  I smell floral hops, berries, bubble gum,  and some banana.  Pretty much taste the same thing.  A little bit of clove flavor as well.  Medium body.  High carbonation.  Dry finish.  Just an okay beer.
"
1," Bottle. Pours hazy gold/yellow. Thin white head. Notes of dry yeast on the nose. Very nondescript. Same for the flavor profile. Minimal hops, malt and yeast. Just a slight step above your average BMC product. Sessionable but virtually flavorless.
"
1," Poured dark brown with a large frothy head that dissipated rather quickly but left good lacing.  Good fruity, yeasty, and flowery aroma with hints of plum and slight caramel malts.  Flavor is also good and oaky, but the taste of alcohol is very strong in this one.  Also, the finish is quite sour, bitter, and leaves the mouth dry.  The level of carbonation seems off too.  The feel is closer to a red wine than a beer.  Overall, I not very impressed.
"
1," Ruby-amber coloured, visible carbonation, quite quickly collapsing small off-white head; dryish - light to moderate - caramelly nose with a very faint roasty touch; moderate bitter-sweet flavour, light bodied; moderate caramelly and roasty finish. O.K., nothing to complain.....
"
1," 2007 Vintage. Bottle. Tasted with hobbersr blind, against dieu du Ciel! Rigor Mortis, Westy 12, and Rochefort 10. Unfair competition, but still unarguably the worst beer in the lineup. Pours a sherry-brown with a thin, quickly dissipated head, spot lacing. Aroma is belgain in character, tight, butter toffee, bitter raisin/date, seaweedy/fishy, yeast, dark fruit. Palate is big, acidic, and tight despite seeming over the hill and tired at the same time. Surprisngly clean, spicy, with plums and raisins, cany a bit of sourness, and cherries. Very balanced but missing big pieces both in the nose and palate. Figs, caramel corn and nuts in finish. Okay.
"
1," The beer pours a slightly hazy brown color with a white head. The aroma is dark fruit, brown sugar and caramel malt. The flavor is grapes, dark fruit, caramel malt, alcohol, yeast and brown sugar. Very complex and very nice. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A world classic that didnt disappoint.
"
1," Draught at the brewpub. Quite malty aroma, sweet and syrupy with a hint of cream. Clear very dark brown colour, red shine. Big stable light brown head. The flavour is syrupy and caramelly with some spicy hops. Creamy aftertaste.
"
1," Pours a deep amber.  Creamy head with lacing.  Great combination of aromas.  Great complexity, great balance, and a great beer.
"
1," Pours a hazy orange with a bit of a white film on top.  The nose with bit with citrus and a bit of oak.  Basically the same with the flavor.  Medium body and easy to drink.  Tasty.
"
1," On tap Rock Bottom Charlotte.  Dark brown almost black and thin cream head.  Chocolate aroma.  Light cream body.  Dark malt flavor lacked for a stout.  Poor attempt for a stout, and I a stout guy so this bothered me.
"
1," Cask (handpump) @ GBBF 2011, Great British Beer Festival, Earls Court Exhibition Centre, London, England.Clear medium yellow orange colour with a average, frothy, good lacing, mostly to fully lasting, off-white to white head. Aroma is moderate malty, toasted, pale malt, light hoppy, citrus, fruity. Flavor is moderate sweet and bitter with a average to long duration. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft to flat. [20110802]
"
1," Draught. Pours red with a small head. The aroma is fruity with hints of apples, caramel, and a nice hop complexity. The description on the menu describes this as being an American style IPA, but I strongly disagree with that. Though it is mildly robust, the flavor, hop profile in particular, are quite British IMHO. There is a very nice level of citric-type acidity present with slightly meaty notes. The caramel is adequate to balance. This is a drinkable session type brew.
"
1," This is absolutely delightful monk beer. An excellent BSA. The best from chimay.  You wont notice its close to big-beer status and you will enjoy the malt taste.  The aroma is strong and... flowery.  Enjoy with care.
"
1," The head was of medium size, off-white in hue with fine-small sized bubbles.The body was cloudy and the hue was orange.The lacing was good on the sides of my glass.The nose was very hoppy and the flavor was very hoppy as well.
"
1," My very first beer from Belgium when Liquor Barn was in Dublin, CA. This was 1983!! I have been a devotee of Trappist ales and Belgian beers ever since.
"
1," One of the finest bottle processed ales available.  Tremendous character and is fit with any food.
"
1, Slightly hazy with a small creamy head. Nice lacing.		Aroma 
1," This was my favourite beer until my recent trip to Belgium touring the trappist monasteries (Trappist ales are notoriously difficult to find in Australia).  Although it has now been supplanted by Westvleteren and Rochefort in my book, still a fantastic beer.  Never bad, always interesting.  Funky little bottle.
"
1," Pours a deep black color with a brown head.  Aroma is coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts.  Flavor is malty, some chocolate, coffee with a bitter roasted malt finish.
"
1," Pours red with a white head.  Smells of rose hips, candy canes, and caramel.  Tastes of grapes, raisins, dates, figs and spring flowers with morning dew.  Mouthfeel leaves a lingering carbonation that tickles the tongue for several minutes after the finish.  Lacing lingers throughout the enjoyment of the beer.
"
1," Bottle, 5%. Clear pale yellow colour. Small semi-stable white head. The flavour has a little malt, hint of butter, but in the nice way.
"
1," This is the best of the Chimay ales. It is so malty and yeasty. I can't get enough of this stuff and luckily it is not too expensive. If you haven't tried it...you should.
"
1," Pale golden, thin white head.  Light bready and grassy aroma.  Taste is more bready malt, clean grassiness.
"
1," Nashville. Hazy orange brown in the glass with an off white head that mostly lasted and left behind some lacing. Faint hoppy aroma. The flavor reminded me of a weak IPA. Nice citrus, some pine, and a light bitterness. Light to medium body that was enjoyably smooth and left a slight bitter aftertaste.
"
1, 9/9/2005 Total Score
1," Very obvious alcohol taste that sometimes overpowers the flavor.  Very fizzy.  Lots of floating crud in the bottom.  Very yeasty.  Ive had better Belgian Strong Ales, but this is OK.  I will take the advice of some, and let the bottle age longer next time.
"
1," Bottle. Dark brown with a huge white head. Aroma is raisins, yeast, alcohol, roasted malts and candy. Tasteis is sweet and roasted malts, raisins, yeast and wood. A very good beer.
"
1," Mild.  Expected a little more ""oomph"" with this one.  Poured from the small bottle, large light brown head, brown body.  Not a bad brew, but being 99 percentile expected more.
"
1," Mondial de la Bire de Montral; Flower nose, dark and dense beer, grapefruit and flower power taste. Nice in mouth. An other great one from Belgium.
"
1," I THOUGHT IT WAS ALRIGHT BUT NOT ONE I WOULD BUY EVERY WEEKEND
"
1," Pale golden pour with a thin soapy white head.  Light aroma of wheat, citrus, and spices.  Relatively thin palate, but very smooth.  The flavor is quite mild but very enjoyable.  Citrus sweet with a touch of corainder and clove.  I like this beer.
"
1," Bottle Im assuming this is the btl version. A very decent aroma of corn and malt not bad at all. A clean golden pour with lite white head and lace. A flavor that really is nowhere near the aroma. It is very almost sulfur but not it has a flat sort of bland flavor that really isnt very good. Carbonation is a bit over the top. I will try it on tap the next time I get a chance to see if it is a bottling thing.
"
1," Bottle, bought @ the brewery. Maltaroma with hay. Almost full bodied. Hay flavors. Shortish aftertaste with some bready notes. Very well balanced and a good example of a landbier.
"
1," This is a great beer.  I was going to save some of the 750ml bottle I bought, but I finished it in one sitting.  It got better as it warmed up (or was it the 9% alcohol that warmed up my belly).  Complex malt characters with a good balance of bitterness.  No noticable hoppy aroma and flavor.  A little too much carbonation in my opinion, but I did drink all 750ml.
"
1," SEP 7, 2007 Very dark brown with an inch of tan head and chunky whitish sediment on the bottom.  The aroma is sweet, spicy and hoppy at once.  Mouthfeel is thinner and more astringent that I was expecting, and the finish is bready.  The taste in between is unremarkable, so I am not sure what everyones raving about.  $3.50/11.2 ozs
"
1," 33cL. Cool raisins and sugar plums, with spiced fig jam and warm applesauce. Tepid Indian malt candy climbs into bed. Yeasty. Pours a deep murky charred mahogany, with opalescent fire fringes. Rim in off-white. Flavor is self-explanatory. A mild, warm Belgian yeast sugar party collides with nips of coffee and toffee, hanging around for the Champagne to be opened. A lot of rising pale fruits meddling in the affairs of the darker kind. A certain burnt sugar quality, amongst a grainy tooth. Carbonation prickles with hops and lends at least some refrain to the syrup. Probably better aged.
"
1," Often times this is someones first ""true"" Belgian and its a great way to start.  Not much to say that hasnt already been detailed in here.  Gorgeous deep-brown pour with minimal head.  Aroma is not overpowering - slight sweet malt aroma.  It dances across the palate a bit, with some of the same malty sweetness and minimal bitterness.  Always a good reliable Belgian.
"
1," Dark brown pour with a small creamy tan head.  Aroma is mostly roasted grain and coffee, with a hint of chocolate and bourbon.  Flavor is roasty with a bit of bourbon on the finish.  Enjoyable, but not too much going on here.
"
1," the first trappist i ever had, deep brown color, light wispy head, great lacing.  i drank it too cold which muted too many of the flavors, spice and dried fruits, cherries.  really opened my eyes to the world of belgian beers.

1," Pours deep carmel with a nice medium head. Aroma is light and fruity. Nicely carbonated.  Malty, sweet, fruity, NICE.	A well craft brew.
"
1," JAN 22, 2006 [11.2 oz bottle] Pours a beautiful cloudy, dark brown color. Head is a rocky white that seems to evolve as it travels down the glass. Aroma is excellent- yeast, and a little bit of fruit sweetness. Flavors are huge- nice roasted malts and a bit of alcohol warmth. This beer is excellent.
"
1," Dgust avec french tickler le 10 octobre 20006.	750ml Bottled in May 2003. This was aged over 3 years in my beer cellar. Fantastic looking beer... small yeast deposits at the bottom of bottle. Caramel, Nutty, Wildberries, cassis, Dates completes the aroma. Light red wine taste to it... i almost feel like if this beer would of aged maybe 5 years it taste closed to a porto. Fantastic finish, this beer ages amazingly well!
"
1," Sehr ser Hefeantrunk, geradezu zuckrig kommt das Bier daher. Leider wird die penetrante Se nicht geringer und strt weiter, nur wenige Hopfennoten dringen durch. Die helle Malzigkeit wirkt ebenfalls aufgedrngt. Zum Ende kaum besser, weiterhin aufdringlich, penetrant, zu s. Das Bier mit einem belgischen Tripel zu vergleichen wre lachhaft. 8/5/4/4/9/4
"
1," Gold with huge lasting off white head. Crisp hop nose. Fatty taste with light lingering hop finish
"
1," 750ml bottle. Poured a deep, cloudy mahogany into a goblet with a huge, frothy tan head. Very pleasant nose, though subtler than expected. Molasses/dark fruit sweetness with a little roastiness, some vanilla, and some yeasty hints way in the back. The flavor is unexpectedly enormous considering the understated aroma. Glorious. Roasty and alcoholic (though not offensively so) and very vinous at first, full of prunes and dates with a hint of tartness and some oak. The finish is almost songworthy, reminiscent of good scotch--short but with an impressive progression of flavors and sensations from sweet/vinous/sumptuous with a whisp of vanilla in the middle to dry/tingly/woody. Unfortunately there is a bit of a nasty vodka flash at the end of the finish toward the bottom of the glass. The palate is huge and creamy, though the beer remains extremely drinkable--I killed a whole 750 in short order!
"
1," Damn good stuff, here here!! The small bottle is not enough ... must have the 750ml
"
1," Purchased 12-May-08 for $1.79 at Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, CA)  Medium sweet, very bready and mildly corny malts are nicely balanced by a spicy, almost peppery hop flavor and light-to-moderate bitterness, finishing with light notes of earth, toast and smoke.  Similarly bready and honey-sweet in the nose, grainy, casually smoky, but just a hint of hops.  Medium-bodied and nicely balanced on the palate with medium carbonation.  Golden-yellow in color with slight haziness.  The off-white head rises to an inch on the pour, then settles to a broken film and wide ring.  Some spotty lace is left on the glass.  A very flavorful and pleasing bohemian pilsener that stands up to a good many of the authentic releases from the Czech Republic.
"
1," Poured a redish color, has a fruity aroma and a creamy head. Flavor is kinda fruity, but bitter. Very smooth beer, and a good one.
"
1," Poured a amber color with a thick white head.  The aroma is dark fruits, caramel, and malts.  The taste was almost the same is the blue, just a little watered down in comparison.  I enjoyed it.

1," Sweet-grainy nose with a touch of mushrooms and apples; deep golden coloured with a small foamy layer; light sweetish-bitter flavour, very light-bodied; rather faint sweet-bitter finish. Quite bland Helles....

1," Pours a transparent amber ruby with a thin, wispy-lacing off-white head.  Aroma of sweet doughy dark caramel malt with some light fruity esters.  Body starts with good caramely malty sweetness with some light fruity complexity and a touch of biscuity yeasty flavor.  Finishes slightly drier with some dark candi sugar sweetness and light fruity flavor.  A decent Belgian strong ale.
"
1," Cloudy dark brown/ruby with a large off white head. Aroma of dark fruit, bananas, malt and anise.  Medium palate with lots of carbonation.  A nice, slightly vinous, champagne texture.  Flavor has notes of plums, raisins, and grass with a dry warming finish. Excellent.
"
1," Sampled with omhper, tiggmtl, MartinT, muzzlehatch, and Rastacouere in Montreal.  Thanks to Per for this amazing sample.  This I believe is from Burs (not sure if that is the some farmer, or a part of gotland).  Aroma is very smoked.  Smells like campfires/burning tires.  Vinous and very interesting aroma.  Hazy amber/honey color with a very small white head.  Smoked to start.  Fruity, campfirey, and leathey.  Thin bodied.  Quite strange and I am sure it requires a specific palate to enjoy this sub-style.
"
1," 33cl bottle from 1985 - The most beautiful deep amber body, crystal clear, scaling from deep red brown to light amber, initially a big head staying at the edge all the way through; Big deep incredible balanced elegant nose, lots of different caramelized aromas, caramelized Danish brown bread, overripe caramelized tomatoes, caramelized sage, caramelized dry sherry, great with oxidization at all; The texture of the body is soft and smooth but a little thin, it has a quite big and perfect carbonation, it is slightly salty, a little sweet ans bitter and with a superb elegance and balance; The a bit thin texture continues into a long finish, at first it seems to finish very fast but it is because of the thin texture, the alcohol shows itself but only briefly, the aromas shows again caramelized, here more as plain soft English light brown caramels. This is a very special beer, of cause because of its age, but also because of its immense qualities. I am wondering if a Chimay of today will age as elegant.
"
1," 12oz bottle from shawnm213, thanks Shawn. Pitch black pour with a small tan head. Slight roasty aroma, some light chocolate too. Very light flavor, smooth,some wood, not a whole lot else really. Kind of underwhelming.
"
1," Bottle 500ml.Clear medium amber orange color with a average, frothy to creamy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, grain, toasted, caramel, old malt. Initial flavor is moderate sweet and light light bitter, finish flavor is moderate sweet and moderate peppery - alcoholic bitter with a average duration. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. [20090914]
"
1," Well the beers at this point seems utterly boring. Golden coloured.. Has an off white quickly diministhing head. This is af very malty beer. Has some sweet and fruity notes. Thin bodied and ends light bitter before a quick kill on the palate.
"
1," Pours a dark brown with a white head, Has a sweet malty aroma with an alcohol presence.  Flavor is sweet and hides the alcohol well.  Very Good overalll.
"
1," FEB 22, 2004 Gravity cask, Catford Beer Festival. light amber. watery texture with an earthy bitterness. Refreshing without being in any way remarkable. The dry bitterness lingers in a long dull manner like a thick thug in a dark alleyway. [1.9]  Bottle.  Attractive whiskey malt aroma from this bottled version. Same the rest of the beer is such a let down. Watery texture with very thin malt awareness, and a rather dull hop bitterness. I mean, the hops are there, but it's just a bitterness without interest.
"
1," JUL 28, 2011 75cl bottle from a beer retailer. It pours a very dark brown (almost black) liquid with reddish tones and a high and consistent high head that leaves a nice lacing. Delicious look. The aroma is yeasty and fruity, with some spices. I can smell dark fruits, ripe pears, fresh bread, a little herbal hops and a roasted malts base; impressive. It is nice the way the 9% of alcohol are completely blent with the brew. It tastes likewise, with a good deal of yeast and a complete malt base, with dark fruits, ripe pears, a little light caramel, general mild roastiness and even a little wood. The palate is perfect"
1," A beutiful dark brown color. It has a light aroma of fruit and a good head. It has a slight aroma of hop bitternes. It is very drinkable but somewhat boring. If I could choose between this and Chimay Bleu I would never drink Chimay Rouge (and I very seldom do)
"
1," Tasted on tap at brewpub. Pours an orange gold color. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma is citrusy and malty, a touch floral. A medium bodied pale ale. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are citrusy. Nice balance. A milder Pale Ale, more in English style I guess. Kind of like a  slightly hoppy amber. Lively carbonation. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
"
1," 33 cl bottle - Pours a hazy light brown color with a big two finger thick off white head.  Since my nose is stuffed up do to allergies, I can only detect the esters.  Flavor is also fruity.  Palate is smooth.  Medium body.  A nice beer.
"
1," Draft in Chattanooga w/ Shag/Clash. Pours pale yellow with about zero head and lacing. Aroma was corona-off in a way, some lemony citrus. The flavor was drinkable, but only as a beverage, not as a beer. Sweetened lemon juice blended with a cheap pale lager recipe? I not sure how they made it, but it was thin, water, and too lemony. Not a good finale, Matt, but it was fun.
"
1," Bottle - 500ml at Gostilna Sokol (Ljubljana, Slovenia). Hazy blond body with low carbonation and a fair white creamy/foamy head. Fresh malty/hoppy aroma with flowery, citrusy, and yeasty hints. Taste is well balanced and carries piney notes. Ends with a decent bittersweet finish. Enjoyable.
"
1," i like the tannishe color it has long with the cocoa taste
"
1," Bottle. Pours black. Nose of licorice, pecan, barrel, smoke and roasted malts. Taste of roasted chocolate malt, vanilla, smoke and light wood.
"
1," Pours a hazy orange with an off white head. Aroma is sweet malt, yeast, and caramel. Flavor is fruity malt, yeast, ripe fruit. Fairly thin mouthfeel with a mostly dry finish.
"
1," poured deep ruby red when held up to the light. Medium sized beige head. Again, had a slight stale refrigerator aroma with some walnuts. Lightly sweet flavor with hints of chocolate. Nice body. Decent beer.
"
1," Trade bottle from StFun. Poured a dark black color with tan head. Aroma was very roasty, and mesquite like smoke. Taste was creamy, coffee, roasted malts. Pallet was smooth medium and silky. Overall I thought this was a good beer.
"
1," caramel, brown sugar, some fruit, yeast, & alcohol. Had this along side the Bleu. No doubt it's a decent beer but it pales in comparison.
"
1," Poured from a bottle to a trappist glass this beer appears a dark brown in the middle, golden on the edges with plenty of fizz and a nice creamy head. Slight medicinal qualities in the aroma with yeasty, sweet fruit tones. Spicy on the toungue with plenty of fizzy goodnes surrounding floral accents, candy sugar, fig or plum and a well blended alcohol presence. The bubbly character of this beer makes for a pleasant mouthfeel. Lingering dry finish that balances the ingredients. The flavors and aromas improve as this beer warms a bit. Mmmmmm good.
"
1," Great beer, great price, great taste! Probably one of the best beers Ive had. Long week at work, so I very much enjoyed this one for my 10th rating. You need to try this one.
"
1," Bottle.Small tan head that mostly diminished, spotty lacing, transparent, carbonation observed, and a brown hue with a red tint. The nose was malty, roasty, licorice, lightly spicy, dark fruits, and some roastiness. The flavor was malty, lightyly roasty, lightly spicy,some dark fruits, and some smokiness towards the end.Tingly mouthfeel and medium in body.Quaffable, easy to drink and an interesting beer to rate.Worthy of a try.
"
1, It was poured from a stubby brown 11.2oz bottle into a signature Chimay chalice that came with the gift set.		Appearance
1," September 24, 2011 Mode"
1," pours dark brown with a huge light tan head. aroma is of belgan yeast. flavor is also yeasty with malt and hop flavorings in the background. this is my first Trappist beer, and I really don't know what else to say about it other than it deffinatly won't be my last trappist beer.
"
1," Pours a transparent bright copper orange with a spotty-lacing off-white head.  Aroma of sweet toasty caramel malts with a touch of resiny, piny hops.  Starts with good fullness and sweet crystal maltiness with a decent balance of piny bittering and flavor hops.  Finishes with nice residual sweetness and a crisp bitterness.  Certainly more on the maltier side of IPAs, but I like it.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours dark red, with a tan head, can see sediments floating throughout.  Great balance throught.  A world of flavors. Complex and tastey.
"
1," I HAD MERCY !	Looks rich and complex, but actually an easy to drink popular dark supermarket beer but is eminently pleasant. The sort of beer you can drink and hardly notice which isnt everything I want, although it looks the part with its chestnut hues. Certainly not Chimays finest
"
1," I was surprised by this one. A really nice local sour beer. Pours a great looking brown with a slight red hue. Not much head, but a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nutty, with cherries and a tartness to it. Very earthy. Flavor is nice and sour, lots of red fruits and nuts, with just a hint of yeast. The wood really comes into play here, and works nicely with the other elements. This one is tasty for sure.
"
1," This is the good stuff, drink it from a glass, even a wine glass if you have to.
"
1," 750ml first pour in Westmalle glass.  (Chimay glass is dirty.)  Hazy dark brown with lasting flat head.  Caramel cherry wood and fresh damp forest growth aroma.  Toasty caramel woodsy yeasty mild fruit with surprisingly clean finish.  Medium-full creamy body and rather bubbly internal carbo despite fairly rousing pour.  Just plain delicious.  Everything balanced to please the palate.  Only a little too cold.  Gotta let it sit...but I...cant...stop...drinking...it!
"
1," Chimay Premiere. As my first introduction into Abbey Dubbel was quite pleasing.  I since that first meeting I usally have it as a speacial treat and rare occassions. It is definitly a treat, I think Il treat myself to one soon.
"
1," hazy straw yellow with a few chunks floating around lotsa head, lasts nicely. nose is citrus mainly lemon, some clove. flavor is different wheat, citrus i agree with another rating that says it almost has a coconut milk taste but different flavors then i have had in a wheat before.  nice dry finish
"
1," GABF 09.  Pours a light copper orange with a white head. Aroma is spicy phenolic, sweet honey and bready biscuit malts, aromatic malt as well- toast, fruity esters, pear and apple- slight dusty malts.  Flavor is dusty cracker malts, doughy yeast, phenolic ans spicy sweet honey and a sweetish finish- could be more dry.  Ok.
"
1," Murky, reddish brown color with a full frothy head. Lacing all over the glass. Apples, apricot, raisins, yeast with a hint of nuttiness. Slightly floral. Medium body with a crisp, clean finish. As good as the Blue and quite frankly, I really cant tell much in difference.
"
1," Not a big fan of Chimay, although they are solid quality beers. Great forward taste, balanced carbonation. I do enjoy this one - just wish it wasnt so darn expen$ive.
"
1," Vinuous aroma & deep clear ruby body. Sour, bitter red wine flavour. More like a sparkling wine than anything, but in this case its not a critisism. Will often suffer in comarison to its similarly priced big blue brother.
"
1," Draught at the brewpub.  Cloudy golden, rich rocky head. Estery pear/banana raoma. Mid-dry and medium bodied, spritzy and fresh. Mildly malty with interesting pear flavour. No bitterness.
"
1," DEC 31, 2004 You know, this is a fine ale, but the hype raised my expectations too high.		A dark brown brew with a nice floral scent.  Maltiness and some fruitiness and a nice buzz from drinking it... but certainly not a 20/20.
"
1," Third out of three Chimays available in the Tolkiens House pub in Zagreb. 0.33l bottle / tiny Chimay tulip.  It poured a small firm ""spongy"" white head, and it was of a nice deep red colour (I think, it was dark outside). The nose was fruity, strawberry maybe, and coriander with some yeasty hints. Slightly sourish anyway. Pleasant taste, malty, fruity, spicy, herbal in a way, but far too prickly for my liking. Pleasant bitterish aftertaste though. Well, its the best dubbel Ive had, better actually (Ive had only two), and Im starting to like the style. This however, while nice, didnt make me love it.
"
1," APR 17, 2009 2008 version. best before 2013Bottle 75cl shared with girlfriend. Potent corkRocketLauncher but it didnt spill over after sending the cork in orbit.	pours a dark redBrown with a yellow light brown head.	aroma of spices, very nice spices, raisins, faint banana, dark fruits. very balanced and well mixed. almost as if it had been on wood or something.	flavor is a little less sophisticated than the aroma. alc easily detectable, mouthfeel a bit bubbly, beneath the alc. is a well balanced belgian style brew. i sense some cellar or cork.	re-rate.75cl bottle vintage 2007. alc. not as dominating this time. bumps up overall from 13 to 15, flavor from 6 to 7. also palate is okay. 2 to 3
"
1," New Years. Poured into goblet. Dark ruby red, fizzy carbonation keeps thin layer of foam present on top.  Aroma is spicy yeast, caramel, dried dark fruit.  Sweet caramel start, with plum, then gingerbread spice in the middle, and hint of coffee bitterness in the finish.  Lighter body than expected. Deceptively sessionable.
"
1," Handbottle 35,5 cl. Courtesy of KimJohansen. Pours a cloudy amber with a dense and lacing off-white head. Lovely aroma of Brett and wood. Medium body, very dry and fruity with an astringent driness rather than sour - lets call it slightly tart. Again ends very dry with quite some bitterness. 230410
"
1," Hazy, bronze color with a good head. Aroma is some licorice. Flavor is yeasty but the bitterness takes over quite quickly. Too bitter and sour.
"
1," Light brown coloured and hazy. Has an off-white head, fully lasting. Aroma is heavy malty, sweet sugars. Flavor starts moderate sweet and finish moderate bitter. Creamy texture and soft carbonation.
"
1," Hazy orange with a medium beige head. Sour aroma with lacto, brett, sour berries and toasted malt. Sour flavour with brett, toasted malt, sourish berries and breadish notes. Finished sourish and dry.
"
1," 09.08.05 on ""The Seaforth"" in Ullapool, Scotland. Bottle, cold. Re-tasted at home on August 28. Its a golden, slightly hazy brew with a modest head. The aroma is crisp with notes of aroma hops and malt. The carbonation is low. The flavour is sweetish with notes of aroma hops. caramel, fruit and the finish is dry with a nice bitterness. But the overall impression is too watery.
"
1," Sampler at CBF 2011-06-28. From 75 cl bottle. Murky, deep orange-amber with a big bubbled, beige film. Dark caramel, Spicy Belgian yeast, cloves and berries on the nose. Sweet and acidic flavors, alcohol, spices and dried fruits present. Watery, bubbly mouth. Full body.
"
1," 12oz bottle. Pours a black body with a finger-width, creamy, brown head that dissipates quickly and leaves a moderate lacing. Aroma is very sweet. Thick, rich, and creamy bourbon and chocolate. A light burnt coffee, vanilla-oak, and some molasses. Mainly malty with lots of chocolate and the sweet bourbon isnt overly oaky and not boozey at all. Flavor is thinner than I anticipated, but thats only because the aroma smelled so thick. Lots of wood, chocolate, and vanilla up front with some sweet bourbon. The bourbon blends nicely with the rest of the flavors and doesnt stand out as much as the aroma. Some charred coffee grows slightly into the finish along with more bourbon and sweet malts. Finishes with a dry, woody, coffee, malty, bourbon sweetness and a hint of acidity. Fairly lengthy aftertaste following a medium body and moderate, fizzy carbonation. Overall, a pretty nice barrel-aged stout. Fairly sweet with a nice charred flavor. Enjoyable.
"
1,"	Delicate citrus fruit, banana esters and firm wheat intertwine in this super refreshing and well polished American-style Wheat Ale. 		Further Personal Perceptions"
1," bomber thanks to immy.....pours deep dark brown with frothy yet thin off-white head.....aroma mostly made up of dark fruits, some banana, and other sweet malts.  dont notice too much chocolate or roast....flavors of sweet malt, a little caramel with some dark fruit and pepper accents. carbonation is lively and mouthfeel was a little thin.
"
1," pours a deep, murky brown with a fluffy white head. smells of dried fruits, roasted nuts and various spices. right when it hits the tongue, various fruits are tasted such as grapes, figs, pears and possibly grapefruits to give a little bitterness. also malty and nutty at the same time on the palate, so very well balanced. easily one of the best beers out there in my opinion but i personally prefer the white to the blue.
"
1," This is, like most Trappists another level in the beerdrinking. Once you tried a couple of Trappists you know what Im talking about. The big bottle has been kept in my winecellar for 2, 3 and even 4 years and it still tastes very good, but not the same as a young one.
"
1," 1.5L Magnum.  Vintage 1993.  Ruby haze.  Lemony and sour and tart.  Malty sweet, with notes of sugar and plums and caramel.  Rather heady.
"
1," JUN 18, 2005 Bottle - Malt and hops aroma.  Clear yellow color.  NIce balanced hops bitterness and sweet malt.  A nice beer although its nothing unique.
"
1," Pours a dark amber in color.  There is no head on the pour, only a small ring around the perimeter of the glass.  Smell is light hops with mostly malts.  Taste is mostly cascade hops.  There is a certain bitter, almost soapy taste to it.  An alright beer.
"
1," Aroma is yeast and a spicy freshness.  Taste = sex in a bottle.  Fruit, sugars, yeast, some vanilla and spice.  Aftertaste is longlasting and refreshing. A+
"
1," DEC 21, 2008 Dark fruits, malts, sugar, alcohol and yeast in aroma. Flavor is sweet malts, dark fruits, candi sugar and toffee, some alcohol and hops. Alcohol warms nicely. Very smooth palate and easy to drink.
"
1," Big offwhite head does not last. Deep dark red body with floaties. Deep dusty fruity wild berry aroma with bready cinnamon notes and traces of pepper. Sweet fruity cinnamon taste with yoghurty bready notes and wild berries. Mid- to thin-bodied. Slightly watery. Some astringency. Lots of carbonation in the mouth. Dry, long aftertaste of same. Very nice. (0.33l bottle, Systembolaget, Gteborg.)
"
1," (12oz bottle, courtesy of Cavie)  Pours a hazy amber body with a medium beige head.  Aroma of caramel, citrus, cocoa, and toasted bread.  Aroma of citrus, roasted malt, light cocoa, and nuts.
"
1," 4 oz serving from draft at breewpub. Pours a reddish brown with lovely ruby accents in the glass. Aroma is breads, nuts, and carmel malts. Nice aroma. Taste is on the lighter side for a brown with the typical dark malts and some earthy nuttiness. Mouthfeel is on the watery side which is offputting in this flavor profile. Overall a highly drinkable brown ale.
"
1," bottle, bought at the brewerys Grammers in Ergenzingen. Clear golden colour with a mid-sized white head. Malty nose. Full-bodied, intensively malty with hints of honey and vanilla, combined with some spicy aromatic hops.
"
1," This beer has a plesant aroma, Has a wine taste, This beer is highly carbonated but it smooth to your palate. I like the blue more then  i like the red and white.
"
1," Bottle. Hazy red brown.  Palate is big and bubbly. Its peppry and malty fresh. Aroma has burnt sugar. Flavor is malty, yesty, sweet and warming.

1," i had one of these as part of a world beer tour at an old chicago restraunt and i can honestly say i not ready for this one. the flavor was terrible almost like a cough medicine.best left to the real conniseurs of this style
"
1," NOV 19, 2005 Brown beer with small tan head.  Strong presence of alcohol.  Complex aroma, some malts and fruits, notably plums.  Lively  and pretty well carbonated.  Roasty, dry finish that lingers on the palate.
"
1," Hamilton Place. The body was lighter brown with a khaki head. The aroma was iced tea and toffee with a little bit of roast. The taste has some toffee and light tea. A toasted finish. Decent.
"
1," SEP 27, 2003 750ml bottle		Underneath a massive, fluffy, light tan head is a burgundy body with hints of amber, red, and peach. The head fills half of my goblet on the pour, and takes quite a while to shrink. Leaves decent lacing on my glass.  Aroma of sweet fruit intermingled with a strong spice note. This one has a very distinctive yeasty aroma.  Flavorful with lots of fruit and spice in an acceptable balance. A bit heavy on the yeast flavor... The finish has a really slight smokiness that I haven't ever noticed before. While it starts off nice and somewhat rich, it's aftertaste leaves something to be desired, as it's a bit thin and lacking in complexity.  Fairly thin body with a crisp, dry mouthfeel. Finishes with a tart dryness that, unfortunately, seems to highlight the subpar aftertaste. A bit watery, and not quite worthy of the reputation that having the term Trappist on the label denotes.
"
1," Had this beer at the All Colorado Beer Fest on 11/10/2007.  Aroma is malty with light hop tones.  Color is brown with good carbonation and a loose head.  Its got a bold malty body with light hop flavor and mild bitterness.  Its a good Amber, much hoppier then most.
"
1," copper red. There is a taste of fruity plums, raisins, blackcurrant and citrus. The flavor is more light compared to Chimay Bleu. The aftertaste is slightly bitter. Overall a very well composed trappist.
"
1," SEP 18, 2006 Very good.  Pours a dark brown with floaties.  Fruity, alcohol aroma.  Flavors of many variety of fruit, some bready flavors, kind of sweet.  Warming alcohol bite.  This was very enjoyable, I sure I will have this again.
"
1," 22 oz bomber - poured very thick and dark - nice head that lasted pretty well-  flavor is not to overpowering but tasty.  Got better as it got warmer-  I enjoyed this beer and will certainly try other brews by the local (to me) Barley Island brewery!
"
1," JAN 19, 2008 Very good nose. Pours dark with a HUGE head. Tasty, incredibly smooth, Completely up to par with the quality I have come to expect from the Belgian monks. Would definitely buy again. My younger brother who doesnt ever drink beer ever loves this. He said its the first beer he have ever tasted that he ""would drink out by choice.""
"
1," Bottled (BB 11/2009, alc. 5.2%). 	Hazy orange-yellow color, medium-sized white creamy head. Grainy wheaty, some elderflower, a bit sweetish fruity aroma. Fizzy carbonation. Dry wheaty, some banana, a bit citrusy sour. Fruity aftertaste.
"
1," Has some over carbonation issues with the pour, but settles down to a nice opaque black with a rich dark tan head.  Has a pleasant subtle dry roasty malt aroma with plenty of bourbon character to back it up.  Starts with a light sweetness and caramel maltiness with some hints of dark chocolate, vanilla and coffee toward the finish.  Could use some more body, but has nice bourbon complexity and flavor throughout.  Pretty dry for a sweet stout though.  Many thanks to atpayne for this brew!
"
1," Beige head, long lasting. Deep, orangish-brown colour, not particularly translucent. Aroma is flowery, with a bit of bready-yeasty touch in there. Flavour is sweet, reminiscent of dried fruits, prunes perhaps, along with a bit of nutiness. Very enjoyable brew, the high alochol is well balanced by the flavours.
"
1," really good IPA, probably their best beer, seems theyve put a lot of effort into this one. great little brewer in SE Portland
"
1," Very average and uninteresting for the colour, this thin, acidic brew has hints of treacle and caramel.  (Cask @ Reading BF)
"
1," Bronze amber body, ok head. Sharp bitter hop nose, somewhat metallic. Off-bitter hoppy flavor with the re-emergence of the metallic quality.
"
1," Dark brown, with very little head. Pleasant fruit aroma with a bitter/chocolate taste and malt. Definitely a stocker in my fridge!
"
1," Pours an opaque coppery brown with medium sized, foamy head.  Aroma of tart fruit.  A little bite on the back of the tongue.  Flavors of bread, yeast, spice and just a hint of fruit sweetness.  For some reason, the alcohol doesnt seem to blend well with the flavor and seems to leave a taste all its own.  A good ""intro"" to Belgians, but not the finest example.
"
1," Pours brown with a tan head.  Great aroma of chocolate and whiskey.  Seems a little thin, but was still a fine brew.
"
1," Pours a golden yellow color with a white head.  Aroma is light malts, and peppery hops.  Flavor is light malts, grainy, and a peppery hop finish.
"
1," This brew poured a large head of fine to medium sized off-white bubbles and a transparent yet hazy light brown colored body.  It had a medium hoppy aroma and a medium hop flavor.  Its mouthfeel stared bitter and lingered well into the finish.
"
1," 12oz bottle.  Pours a reddish amber with a small off white head that quickly goes to a thin film.		The aroma is sweet vegetal crystal malts with a little fruit and grassy hops.		The flavor is sweet crystal malts with a little green resin from the hops.  It has decent grassy bitterness in the finish.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and watery.		Overall, not a great IPA.  Its too sweet and doesnt show good hop characteristics with some off notes.
"
1," SEP 22, 2006 [bottle] Very cloudy, reddish color with a huge, cottonish head. Flavors are very complex.. funky yeast, sweet frutiness, and very subtle alcohol content. Strong carbonation. This is a very fine beer.
"
1," Nice strong ale. Alcohol is masked nicely with all sorts of spiciness. Pours dark mahogany red. Drinks easily for a strong ale. I love the smell of yeast in the morning, or night, or whenever you drink this great ale.
"
1," Bottle thanks to thirdeye11. Hazy orange body, soapy white head. Aroma is dirt, soap, earth. Flavor was astringent, soap, hops.
"
1," Limited number of very nice rooms;  excellent food;  warm, hospitable service.  Very local;  hub for the village.
"
1," For me its power is first-apparent and colors its impression in a way that both supports its uniqueness and quality and classifies it outside of my personal area of best beers.  Soft bitters and sweetness appreciated but without the yeast and spice of Premier.
"
1," Dark chestnut/garnet body topped by a small tan head.  Pleasant aroma of coffee, vanilla, chocolate, sweet malts.  Medium body with minimal carbonation, but a little on the watery texture.  The flavor was an appealing coffee/vanilla/chocolate blend.  This was quite a surprise and my thanks to beer buddy Brian for providing this treat.
"
1," What can I say that hasnt been said 1273 times before me?  Oh well.  Pours a dark brown with a thick white head.  The line separating the liquid from the head is indistinct due to the continual release of carbonation.  First time Ive seen that in a beer.  Kind of cool.  Aroma is of slightly sour bread.  In the mouth it starts off sweet with hints of fruit and malt.  Finishes with a touch of bitterness and a punch of alcohol.  Better than I was expecting given that Im usually not a fan of Belgian Ales.
"
1," Ho hum.  I was a bit surprised.  I liked the label and I had just had a Goose Island beer brewed for Trader Joes (the Black Toad Dark Ale)--perhaps the ""Island"" in the name made me think it would be as good, and the upgrade from a brown ale to an oatmeal stout would be an improvement.  But it wasnt much of one.  Rich, thick, for sure, but the flavors were thinner than expected...so malts, not so much roast, moderate coffee.  A little bitterness, a little flavor on the front end....but ho hum among the kingdom of stouts.
"
1," Nice creamy head with malty aroma with the pour.  Used the chimay chalice glass which gave off a great dark sweet aroma.  Some hoppy flavours finished off this dark sweet spicy brew.  Very enjoyable and a nice hidden 9%.  Probably best to serve it a little on the warmer side as the beer really explodes after a little warmth.  It reminds me of a beer that I cant put my finger on.  Darker than I expected, but a great beer overall.
"
1," pours reddish brown with tan head.  aroma is mostly malt with roasted malt and some bad coffee and chocolate.  mostly hersheys and folders as far as chocolate and coffee go, respectively.  theres a little roated malt and nuts but not much.  blah very thin and plain.
"
1," On tap at the Disney World Boark Walk location. Poured a medium and cloudy golden color. Aromas and tastes of wheat, cloves, citrus and bananas. Props to the bar tender to ask if I wanted a slice of lemon or not. It was in the upper 80s and this went down nicely...
"
1," Aroma is excellent, tastes greats. I had to actually get used to it, it had a flavor I wasnt used to but I did like. Very complex & wonderful taste. Definetly one id try again.
"
1," malt, raisins, caramel. Aromas of dried fruits and caramel. Smooth. Nice bitterness. Alcohol hardly noticable. Lasting aftertaste.
"
1," Pours a deep brown. Dark fruit, raisin, candy sugar nose. Bready, sugary, fig, raisin, some chocolate flavor. Excellent beer.

"
1," Dark, opaque, mahagony brown color with a creamy beige head.  Fresh yeasty fragrance of banana, pear, caramel, raisin, and lightly roasted malts.  Very powerful flavors initially grab the tongue with an almost sticky texture.  First, an oaky raisin and plumb grab the tongue.  After the carbonation splashes over the tongue and disperses, some sweet coffee flavors are noticed, almost like a Saturday morning mocha cappucino.  Finally, a bit of spiciness and black currant images come to mind as the finish is remniscent of a nice Cote Chailonnaise wine.  Overall, a very tasty and best yet,  wonderfully available beer.

1," Bottle 33 cl. Apperance; Dark orange, hazy with a big orange head. Aroma; Fruity, sweet malt, citrus and a sence of strawberries. Flavor; sweet malt and some hops, a nice light bitter ending. Chimay bleue is offcourse the favourite
"
1," Reddish brown with a quickly dissipating thin off-white head.  Aroma of fruits, grains, nuts, Belgian yeast, sugar and toasted malt.  Taste of fruit, sugar, sweet malts and banana with a semi dry finish.  Decent Dubbel.
"
1," candied nuts, raisins and malt on the nose.  long clean palate with a nice bitter hoppiness to the end.  A lot more here than the red, but the alcohol is well concealed.  Very nice, especially as its pretty easy to come by.
"
1," Bottled. Clear brown colour with a reddish tinge. Small, but stable head. Cookie malt aroma. Quite sweet, molasses taste with hints of roastmaltiness. Average and pretty sweet dunkel.
"
1," dark brown, aromas of yeast and spice.  similiar to the red, but all its own.  got much tastier as it warmed, fruits and sweet toasty malts.  very very good.
"
1," Red orange cloudy with a low creamy head. Low carbonation. Aroma is caramel, spices, sugar, raisin. Full body. Flavors is  sweetness, caramel, raisin. Nice belgian.
"
1," Bottle. Nice deep color with good head. Highly carbonated at first, but lessened as beer sat (and warmed). Very smooth for such a strong brew. Tastes of malt, clove, and a hint of bananas on the finish.
"
1," BPW #7	12 oz bottle at Shallos in Indy. Appearance is a mildly lighter brown with no real head. Flavors and nose are vanilla, bourbon and roasted malts and some slight smoke. At first the bourbon is really nice but as the beer goes the bourbon begins to taste of a lower quality spirits. Mouth is slightly carbonated but a bit hot.
"
1," Bottle pours hazy brown with a khaki head.  Aroma shows dark fruit (raisin, plum), yeast, toffee, and oak.  Flavor shows the same.  Overall body is moderate to full, moderately sweet, and almost no bitterness whatsoever. Classic trappist without too much complication.
"
1," Bottle from Sainsburys. Light golden colour, off-white head. Aroma is biscuit malts, caramel. Flavour is biscuit malts and some hops. Sweet, and slightly dry finish. Average.
"
1," Rating 100 -  Thought Id save the Alesmith beers for awhile.  When opening the bottle, I damn near punched a hole in the wall with the cork.  Beer pours a hazy brown color with a big ass fluffy off white head.  Way over carbonated.  The aroma smells like a Bud after just poppin a can open.  Flavor isnt much better.  Light malt sweetness with some background esters.  The bitterness seems to linger.  Medium body.  Slight alcohol warming.  Very disappointed with this beer.  Hope the wife will drink the rest.
"
1," Pours a rich ruby colour with a faint beige head. Nose of fruits, berries, cherries and raisins. A sense of alcohol is evident. A formiddable drink with a soft  mouthfeel, malt and hops balanced superbly. The 9% does come through but rewardingly in a rioja-like manner.
"
1," Had on tap at the brewpub. Has a nice copper colored appearance, off-white head with a little bit of lacing. The aroma has a twinge of caramel to it. Solid malty flavor with a bit of candy-like sweetness to it. Turns a tad bit artificial on the back end though. Decent brewpub fare.
"
1," Bottle.  A very dark pour with a foamy white head.  A very strong aroma typical of dubbles.  Very nice blanaced flavor.  Nice hint of spice and slight woody flavor.
"
1," This draft brew from the brewery poured a very large sized head of foamy finely sized white colored bubbles that were long lasting and left behind a and a very good lacing. The complex funky aroma was malty. The mouth feel was smooth at the start and mediumly tingly at the finish. The funky flavor contained notes of malt and was  sweet. A decent one but not one that I would consider buying again.
"
1," its a beautiful dark red-brown.  Best paired with cold weather and limited expectations.
"
1," There are beers that are made to take when you are thirsty or to cool your throat in a hot day. This is much more than this. It is an experience. It has a strong and a little bit fruity taste that fills completely your senses. Is a beer that you have to drink slowly and enjoy.
"
1," Poured from big bottle.  Aroma of malt, fruit.  Quite carbonated at opening.  Dark walnut, opaque, with persistent thin tan head.  I taste brown sugar, spice, coriander, banana, vanilla, pear.  Mellow, warm finish.  It is everything I expected it to be.
"
1,"  Bottle.  Very noticable whiskey malt aroma. A little bit peaty. Quite a hoppy bitter, though the hops are not fresh or fragrant, merely a stodgy bitter. Neutral sweetness - slightly nutty and a bit tannic. Dark walnut colour.
"
1," Lovely color once poured. Very nice 1 inch head, lacey when finished. Tasted yeasty and was very smooth. I enjoyed this beer although was my first, will drink again for sure.
"
1," Probably a good wheat ale, but since Im not much for that particular genre, I dont particularly care for it.
"
1," Bottle from Getrnke Fritze, Bergtheim; bb08/11, probably 6 months oldHazy amber color; medium sized head. Mild malt aroma. Good caramel, toffee and hop flavor; the hopping aromatics are delicate, not too present. Very good beer, balanced more than extreme, but its already an interesting result for Germany. English IPA?
"
1," a - cloudy chestnut, surger	a - malty banana, 	f - soft fruit with a late hop bite, clean, good balance, 	p - very lively, sparkle, nice	oa - a nice delicate Belgian, super clean, but overpriced
"
1," Really dark, nearing blackness, not much for head.  Has a very apparent dark fruit smell to it.  Apricots, raisins, plums.  Really bites the tongue, follows with a casual smoothness and then fades with nice wandering fruit.  Kind of has a dried fruit trail mix thing happening. Very nice.
"
1," Dark mahogany with abit of a vicious head. Took me a few pours to NOT fill up my whole glass with head.  The head was white with a faint tan undertones. Somewhat woody smell. Of course allergies keep me from properly smelling it, but it still smells good. Very robust taste with a bit of a bitter streak. Makes me think I should find a bottle to age. I love it seriously. It feels like good beer and you can feel it hit your stomach too. Odd that the head is so thick but it doesnt seem so carbonated. Wonderfull beer. It feels more like its a shame to let it go without food.
"
1," Isnt a huge amount of malt and tastes a bit musty and peat-ish.  Has a strange transition from the initial flavor to the finish, from an earthiness to a sudden bitter kick.
"
1," Bottle 2007 from Keg Liqour. Poured a hazy brown color with an average off-white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Good aroma of roasted dark chocolate malt. Medium body with smooth dry texture. Good roasted bittersweet flavor with a complex bittersweet finish of medium duration. Interesting complex brew.
"
1," 33cl bottle. This pours a beautiful deep and hazy burgundy colour with a very full, thick and rocky off-white head that holds its weight rather well. Appealing dry fruity aromas are on the nose from the get-go, coming across nicely even through its colossal head. Once the dust has cleared (or head in this case) the apricot becomes decidedly more apparent with the hint of banana too. This is exceedingly smooth on the palate from beginning to end. The carbonation is apparent, but not excessive allowing its soft textures to be appreciated. The flavours are fruity -but not as dry as the aroma - with notes of toffee and the alcohol makes itself known but not in a bad way. It certainly went down a treat with me.
"
1," Pours a clear amber color with a huge fluffy off-white head. Aroma of citrus and floral hops with a bit of caramel malts as well. Flavor of very strong citrus hops, some caramel malts, and a slight warming. Nice an bitter, quite a good IPA.
"
1," 12 oz bottle pours dark brown with a 2 finger quick disappearing head.  The raisins raise up in the aroma, along with cookie dough, oak, and toasted bread. Flavor is dark roasts and malt, along with oak from the cabernet. Full bodied.
"
1," 33cl bottle.  Red colour like the label.  I prefer the Chimay Blue.  Still a nice beer though
"
1," Light brown ale. Smell isnt appealing but very smooth and good overall flavor. Give it to your girlfriend. Shell love it.
"
1," Draught (atlanta).  The server said this was a ""girl beer.""  Brown-red color, with a small off-white head.  Aroma is malty, with some chocolate.  Flavor lets me down, weak and watery at the end.  Maltiness is there but weak finish disappointing.
"
1," Sampled at a blind abbey dubbel tasting hosted by tennisjoel on 4-14-07, along with eight other beers. This was the ninth and final beer that we tasted. It finished in fifth place in my rankings, but it was eighth place in the group rankings. Originally poured from a 750 mL bottle. The overwhelming winner of the night was t Smisje Dubbel, with Corsendonk Pater finishing a strong if distant second.		<P>Aroma features chocolate, vanilla, and soft candy. It is nice, but its too weak to score highly. Pours a very cloudy light brown with a lot of suspended particulate and short-lasting head. It definitely stood out visually from the rest of the beers that we tried that night. The taste is quite intriguing. It is somehow subtle and sharp simultaneously. The alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming in the taste. Subtle, good flavors overall. Medium in body. High carbonation Smooth, frothy, and lively in the palate. Chimay Rouge does not slap the drinker in the face with its aroma or flavors, but it is a good, quality beer that would stand up well to multiple tastings.
"
1," OCT 18, 2008 Room temperature, 0,33l bottle. Big foamy white head, brown and cherry tones in the colour. Aroma of lemon, raisins, prunes. Body soft, wonderfully long finish.
"
1," Pours black with a fine white head. Aroma is rather sweet and yeasty. Moderate mouth feel with spicy, chocolate and caramel notes. Decent beer.
"
1," Beautiful stable head. Flowers, spices, raisins?, and honey in aroma.  Roasted flavor with a lingering bitterness and warm stomach feel. A beer to be drank slowly on a cold day
"
1," Pours slightly hazy bright burnt orange with a tall beige head that has great retention (there till the glass was gone), likely due to the high effervesence, leaves some lacing as well. Aroma is grassy, caramel, blossoming fruit trees, fruity yeast, a hint of toast, and apricot preserves. Flavor is grass, apple, toast, caramel, fruity yeast, dark fruits and sweet grain. Finish is slightly acidic fruitiness, burnt sugar and some grassy, spicy notes. Bitterness is present and about average for a dubbel.
"
1," Pours a ruby-brown color with a large cream head.  Unfortunately, the bottle I had had been shaken or hit so when I popped the top the head foamed all over.  Anyway, the aroma is of dark fruit, yeast, spices and malts.  Nice, but a little subdued.  Flavor was a bit veiled behind the intense fizzy palate.  I tasted raisins, chocolate malt, some wine-like grape, and light alcoholic flavor.  Good blend, but maybe not forward enough.  For the price, get yourself a couple bombers of Ommegangs Abbey Ale.
"
1," Bottle - Deep brown color with nice head.  Rich aroma, fruity and floral.  Sweet but complex flavors, roasted malt. alcohol isnt overpowering, but present.  Strong bite.  I like this beer, and I just found it at my favorite beer store.
"
1," Bottle 50cl.Clear light to medium yellow color with a average to large, frothy to creamy, good lacing, fully lasting, white head. Aroma is moderate malty, grain, hay, butter, light hoppy. Flavor is moderate sweet and acrid butter bitter with a average duration. Body is medium, texture is watery to oily, carbonation is soft. [20090626]
"
1," Very common beer, served out of a bottle, very sweet, they do a great job of hiding the alcohol content, but overall a very basic belgian ale.
"
1," Cask gravity at Battersea Beer Festival 2006.  Chestnut/amber colour with no head.  Sweetish, varnish aroma with some sticky fruit.  Sweetish in mouth/some strawberry fruit.  Finish has sweet/hop on it.  Mind you it didnt taste like a 7.5% beer.  Bit to sticky though
"
1," This is really more of a coffee porter than a coffee stout. It's not quite opaque but dark brown enough to look black at a casual glance. It has a nice light tan head. The flavor is nicely roasty with little to no chocolate or sweetness. There is a nice lingering coffee bitterness in finish. The coffee actually improves what is normally a fairly thin stout (it's based on the Big River Iron Horse Stout), but the coffee flavor is mild and seems to have used a more common morning coffee bean instead of a more flavor espresso bean.
"
1," NOV 11, 2007 1pt., 9.4 fl bottle. Pours a cloudy unfiltered dark brown with a tan head that vanished surprisingly quick. Aroma was caramel and plums with a hint of spice. Taste was complex with chocolate in the forefront, other flavors--oak, pine, caramel, and walnuts. Mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with a slight fizz. There is an undertone of distinguished non-bitter hops. Finish was long and smooth with a caramel aftertaste. Nice pour for cleaning out the garage.
"
1," 750 ml bottle.  Aroma is roasted malt, spices, caramel, fruit and a fine balance of alcohol. Great thick body with the expected high carbonation levels. the flavor is wonderfully rich, lots of floral an spce flavors well grounded in the rich malt. finishes very clean. A great beer.
"
1," Pours deep copper with red-ish hue, massive off tan head.		Aroma is yeast, hints of banana.		Medium moutfeel, alcohol warmth, taste of candy sugar.
"
1," Bottled. Clear golden, brief head. Neutral aroma. Medium sweet with some papery malt but near no bitterness.  Not very interesting.
"
1," Bottle.  Off-white/tan thick head, diminishes to a ring.  Color is dark brown.  Pretty malty right away which gives way to dark fruit and sugar.  Finishes very smooth, lingers on the palate.  Good stuff.
"
1," Bottle pours a hazy copper color with a nice off white head and lace sheeting.  The aroma is of yeast and apricot.  The flavor is much like the aroma and has yeast and apricot.  The palate is quite carbonated.  Overall, this is OK, but not my beer.
"
1," This beer has a complex combination of flavors.   One of the best I have tasted>
"
1," 33cl bottle pours hazy ruby brown with a fair offwhite head that fades back to a ring but laces the trappist glass from there down.  Aromas of caramel, roasted malt, and some hay.  Flavor is smooth caramel, raisin, some honey, a little clove as well.  Nice and sweet throughout with slight bitterness before the dry finish.  Medium body and soft carbonation.  This is really nice beer.  I cant believe Ive waited this long to try something so readily available to me.  Ill be trying the blue and the white soon..
"
1," TheDM and Hotstuff vacation brew 6.  This draft brew was enjoyed at the Big River Brewery in Chattanooga Tennessee which was hosted by a pleasant accomodating staff.  The manager paid for our samples and even bought us appetizers to help clear our palates.  This brew poured a large head of finely sized white colored mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a transparent uncarbonated weak yellow colored body and a fair lace.  The aroma was very mild and mildly hopped.  The mouthfeel was smooth, slightly tingly and had a mild hop finish to it.  It was suprisingly nice for a 2.9% ABV light.  The flavor was nice with notes of malt and hops.  Very smooth.
"
1," GCBF. Poured to a light straw colour. Tight creamy head with minimal lacing. Aroma is crisp with a spicy note. Taste is very clean, but a bit bland. Not very sweet...squeaky dry. Not bad on this hot day. Not myfavourite lager, but a great alternative to the commercial dreck.
"
1," Bottle 375ml. clear glass.Clear medium yellow orange color with virtually none head. Aroma is moderate to light heavy apple, notes of concentrated peach and pineapple. Flavor is heavy sweet and light acidic with a long duration, light alcoholic. Body is medium, texture is syrupy, carbonation is flat. [20100110]
"
1," JAN 18, 2004 3/01 bottle"
1," A beautiful looking beer. Cloudy, mahogony with a thick, bone-colored head.  Im afraid the alcohol overpowers both taste and smell, however.  I caught fleeting tastes of plum and grape, but the alcohol taste was most prevalent.  Reminded me of wine more than any other beer Ive had.  I had higher hopes for this beer.  Too bubbly.  Dont drink on an empty stomach...WHEW! I never thought it possible to get drunk off one beer...until now.
"
1," A 1 pint 9.4 oz bottle for $15. Pours murky brown with a tan head that fades quickly. Has a yeasty floral smell. Tastes include a hint of orange with a smokey molasas, brown sugar, figs, roasted malt and raisin. Very bubbly on the tongue which I dont too much care for because it kind of robs the taste. Not worth the money I spent on it.
"
1," Pours black with medium brown head.  Nose of bourbon and chocolate.  Mouthfeel is too thin for my liking.  Flavor is similar to nose but if there is more complexity, it does not linger enough to determine (see mouthfeel comment).  OK.
"
1," ever noticed that Belgian brown ale pretty much sucks(except for Rodenbach). This thick, sweet ale taste turns into a mucky taste after 4 or 5. GIVE ME LAGER!!!
"
1," Very, very good. Near perfect, although Rochefort 10 is still the king of Belgian trappist brews to me.
"
1," Bottle. Pours clear brown, thin off-white head, spotty lacing. Nose is cocoa nibs, HUGE mint, coffee, little else. Smells like choco-mint ice cream. Flavours are more coffee and mint, subdued chocolate; medium to light bodied. Noticeable yeast notes. Short minty finish. Different but alright.
"
1," Pours dark amber, big frothy head diminishes quickly to small off-white, Cloudy. Aroma of orange, chocolate, clove and cookie dough. Full oily body. Long sweet fortified finished.
"
1," This is the second cimay Ive tried. (Tried the white first.) A little disappointed with the somewhat lack of aroma. What little there is though is quite fruity. A very attractive dusty copper colour. Tastes spicy and apricot/apple with a nice malt overtone. Thin in the mouth and fizzy (only way I can describe it). Finishes well with a bitter, creamy aftertaste. Good beer.
"
1," ...very dark, raisin characteristics, and dark malty flavor.  Aftertaste is a little roasty, but not overwhelming, alcohol notes not highly present, and its still 9%.  Not too heavy like you would think, overall a great beer.
"
1," Bottle picked up in South Bend; poured a rich, dark brown with a small to medium off white head.  Aroma of dark fruit, banana, yeast, roasted malt and chocolate.  Was pretty thin and a bit watery.  Flavor reminded me of a black lager, with some spice, nuts and a general earthiness.  Easily drinkable, but it just didnt come together that well.
"
1," mostly yeast in the aroma; dark and cloudy with a large tan head; taste of caramel/malt with a dry, somewhat bitter finish and a definite taste of alcohol; good, but not the best of its type
"
1," cellared for 1 1/2 years. nose is raisins, almost smells a bit grainy. flavor is more raisins and sizzling hops, dark yet ultra refreshing. touch of near sweetness amongst the madness.  so similar to many ABTs yet a unique diamond in the end.
"
1," Bottle cellared for a few years.  Pours deep chestnut brown, with a medium beige head, some lacing.  Aromas of cherry, banana, toast, leather, toffee and grass.  Medium body, tart, medium dry, creamy.  Moderately sweet with bread, toffee, and dark, ripe cherry notes, becoming fairly sour and citrusy mid-palate, with a dry and lightly bitter finish.
"
1," pours a cloudy reddish brown with a thin white head, sweet dark fruit aroma, taste is sweet and malty.  Always a good one - cant believe it took me so long to rate it.
"
1," Dark orange appearance with a moderate head. The aroma was faint malt and candy. Flavor was malty and a little on the light side. This favored a lager more than an ale. The aftertaste was slightly bitter. Although I have to admit I had a hard time concentrating on the flavor with all the people looking down at me from the elevated walkway directly above my head. Overall a refreshing beer for the summer months but nothing outstanding. Perhaps we will see this one at the upcoming Georgia Beer Festival??
"
1," Clear golden colour. Nothing spectacular. Medium to high hop profile. Malty sweet palate. Drinkable.
"
1," A pale golden ale with a thin white head. In aroma, a light hop with caramel malt. In mouth, a rather harsh bitterness with faint malt, watery and unbalanced. On tap at the brewpub, July 30 2011.
"
1, Dark redish brown. Little head.	Aroma
1," Huge, froty, off-white head. Good lacing. Mostly lasting longevity. Cloudy brown body.Moderate sweet caramelic flavor. Medium palate.
"
1," A brown bottle (no date) into chimay goble.  Pours a deep cloudy mahogany with almost no light passing through. A thick, off-white head simmers to a nice lacey top. Mild sweet malts are most noticeable, with caramel, pear, and hints of cola coming out later.  The taste is smooth malty spiciness and a kick of alcohol, with no bitterness to speak of.  It has medium carbonation, medium body, and silky smooth texture.  A true sipper. And one of Belgiums finest.
"
1," The strongest of the three this beer offers a strong floral aroma. Dry and more carbonated than the others this one is my least favorite of the three.
"
1," bottle - Italia Beer Festival (Milan) - This beer had all the typical banana, biscuit, and caramel notes of a Dunkleweizen with a slighlty citrusy finish. Could have used a little more body.
"
1," A nice brown colour with a hint of red.  Aroma fruity with a heavy yeast.  Tastes a little yeasty as well with a good maltiness.  Heavy carbonation as well.  I did enjoy this beer, but it is not one of the best Trappist Ales I have tried.
"
1," 17.04.2009	Bottle brown, 330 ml	Appearance"
1," JUL 13, 2007 Cork Date"
1," I find that the larger, corked bottle has a more appealing aroma than the capped version.  A fantastic brew for a cold night, one bottle gives a great varied experience through the temperature range.  Different aromas and flavors are present at each stage.
"
1," (Draught)  Pours a clear golden body with a medium white head.  Aroma of herbs, horseblanket, and grass.  Flavor of brett, light citrus, pedio, and earthiness with a dry finish.
"
1, Pours a reddish/brown with a creamy beige two finger head that dissipates into a very thin head.		Smell
1," 330 ml.  Finally I have gotten around to Chimay.  All that is needed to say, is that after countless very good Belgian beers, this beer is still striking.  Pours dark brown with porous white head.  Nose is a like a bowl of fruit with syrup poured over it that subdues the aroma but intensifies it in some aspects.  Body is lively with the same bowl of fruit.  This is like a refreshing dessert in summertime.  Contains nothing that people sometimes dislike about beer.  Possibly underrated.  A great beer.
"
1," FEB 13, 2011 Had both draft and bottle, liked em both. Coppery orange, big rocky white head. Smells nice - hoppy, of course, a nice mix of citrus and pine, plus a subtle peppery note. Flavor is earthy and rough around the edges. Long aftertaste. Some peppery notes, too. Nice session IPA, even at 6.3%.
"
1," (bottle) A murky, dark brownish-red body and a small off-white head. The aroma is fruity and sweet, with noticeable alcohol. Medium bodied and moderately bubbly. Slightly sweet up front before becoming more bitter; banana, and floral notes as well. Has a warm, tingly alcohol sensation on the tip of the tongue.
"
1," A lemon and vinegar aroma. The appearance is a pale yellow with a small soapy head. The flavor is light on the lemons with some corn notes. I not sure what the point of doing this beer is. Overall not that good.
"
1,"  Pours a dark ruby-tinted amber with no head.  Roasted malt, sweet bread dough and some subtle chocolate notes in the nose.  Dry, bread dough flavor which ended up being much sweeter than expected.  Has a nice belgian yeast taste to it.  Not much in the way of body on this but still drinkable.
"
1," Another fine brew just like belgium know how to make them. Little head, sweet and fruity aroma, excellent mixture of sweetness  and spiciness witch make it a really enjoyable and easy to drink brew. You can't really taster the alcohol. Bitter finish.
"
1," SEP 27, 2011 Bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a dark brown color with a 1-1/2"" head. Very good beer, quite a bit of carbonation, slightly ""dry"" aftertaste, a hint of apple/pear flavor. Great beer!
"
1," Bottle. Dark brown colour with a large off-white head. Spicy aroma with notes of yeast. The flavour is malty and some yeast with hints of fruits and spices. Nice medium-bodied dubbel.
"
1," 12oz - Aroma is appealing.  Yeasty bubblegum, banana, lemon, and spice.  Pours transparent gold with a quickly dissapating medium head and great lacing.  Flavor is mostly ginger and other spices with the yeasty banana and bubblegum follow up.  Palate is smooth and a little tart.  Overall, it was better than I expected since the lable says blonde.
"
1," Bottled. Nice head which disappeared quickly. Extremely well-balanced with nice fruity/bready malts. The wonderful, fine carbonation contibutes to what I believe is the best palate of any beer Ive come across yet. Many of the American imitatitions have been over-done; Chimay gets it right; these monks know their stuff.
"
1," La mia preferita tra le Chimay.Ha un colore scuro e una schiuma fitta e cremosa.I profumi sono delicati e persistenti con le note fresche e fruttate in armonia con quelle dolci di malto.Ne deriva un equilibrio gustativo dove morbido e secco si fondono insieme contribuendo a rendere la birra di grande bevibilit.Ottima
"
1," 75CL bottle.  Murky dark orange brown.  Large tan head, falls quickly.  Spicy clove estery aroma with currants and brown sugar.  Floral flavors, rich Belgian malt, some dark sugary flavors and estery yeast contribution.  Finish has dark fruit flavors and residual spiciness.  Mouthfeel is medium large, wet but smooth.
"
1, Hazy brown dark reddish. Lasting white / beige head. heavy carbonation. A 
1," JAN 27, 2011 Enjoyed via 12oz bottle.  Appearance and nose are the prototype for the style, dark, fluffy off-white head, and dark fruits and burnt or candied sugar.  Palate is nicely malty, showing a pleasant dark fruit esters; full without being cloying.  Carbonation is nicely calibrated.  The finish shows lingering notes of continental character malt residual sweetness, along with the aforesaid ester notes.  Overall, a somewhat ubiquitous but inarguable benchmark of the style.  Excellent.

1," JUL 27, 2009 12/06/2007 and 8/13/2008"
1," Bottle. Poured a dark brown with a thin tan head. Aroma of sweet berries with a hint of alcohol. Taste of roasted malt with a hint of alcohol and bananas. A nice smooth finish. Out of the red and white labeled Chimay, this is the best one.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours a deep amber/copper color with a thin beige head.  Aroma is abundantly yeasty with some malt and some fruitiness.  Flavor is somewhat sweet, with a good malt tone, some dark fruits and a dash of hops.  Medium bodied.  Obviously a well-crafted beverage, but I prefer the Bleu & Blanche better.
"
1," 750 mL bottle from Trader Joes (Hillcrest).  Trader Joes seems to have the best local prices on Chimay -- $7.99 for red, $9.99 for blue.  Pours a dark rusty red with a thin layer of off-white head.  Aroma of malt, yeast, and dark fruit.  Sweet taste of malts along with yeast.  A slight fruitiness and some spice in the finish.  There is something distinctly earthy here as well.  Not terribly complex.  Good carbonation.  Probably my least favorite of the three Chimays.

1," Browinsh orange with a finely carbonated sturdy head. Has the familiar musty smell, and note of fruit, smoke, dirt (in a good way)and a drier finish. If you dump the yeast in you get a peppery flavor as well.
"
1,"	A brown beer with a huge, quite fluffy head. Aroma is alcohol, prunes, spices and spec. B.	The flavour is dominated by malt and alcohol but still with a solid presence of spices - mostly coriander and orange peel kind of spices.	Quite dry end and despite all the fuzz still   a great beer!

Some people have 100 ratings in a month its taken me almost 4 months. I am just hoping Fed-Ex delivers my package (beer trade) tomorrow for a fantastic #100, Ok on with the beer ratings. Deep rusty colored, malty sweet, as dry a finish as a James Bond Martini,I prefer the Bleu, can you say YEAST ?This aftertaste ought to last until Monday. I am glad we are expected to get 4 inches of rain tomorrow or otherwise I would be high & dry from this Ale, still Highly Recommended !
"
1," 750 mL bottle, cellar aged 2 years.  At this age, the beer is coming into its own. Aroma of slightly sweet malt, with cinnamon and other spices evident.  There is a flicker of carbonation on the tongue, although it is far less than when you drink it young. Figs, cocoa, and coriander predominate. There is also a little cinnamon and clove present.  The aftertaste is of lingering cocoa and alcohol, leaving a warmth to hang around in the back of your throat. Pour in the yeast slurry, and it brings out some of the lighter aspects - like citrus notes and red berries.  Actually very good, for such an overrated beer.

1," Translucent yellow, and tranquil.  A pleasing mix of sweetness and spicyness, licorice predominantly in the nose.  No carbonation, warm alcohol, spicy anise, and a dry finish.  Im not a fan of pastis, sambuca, absinthe or anything else that tastes likes black licorice, but this one Ive surprisingly enjoyed.  Makes a good digestif.
"
1," Bottle 2006. Pours a dark hazy amber colour with an off-white head. Sweet malty spicy, yeasty aroma. Some hints of drak fruits. Smooth malty yeasty spicy flavor. With dark fruits. Long fruity and spicy finish.
"
1," Very malty flavour with a strong finish.  Hangs around on the palate with a hint of fruitiness and a huge amount of dark ale flavour.  Besy to have just one or two though as the nine percent makes it interesting.
"
1," Pours a reddish brown in color with only a slight head.  Smell is somewhat laced with spices.  Maybe some clove and a real faint cinnamon.  Taste is highly carbonated and bubbly.  There is some spice as well as some dark fruit in the taste.  Perhaps just a bit too much carbonation.  Not bad, an easy drinker.
"
1," Bottle at Paps.	Clear orange coloured with a medium sized white head.	Fruity aroma of hops, pine needles and citrus peel.	Fruity flavour of hops, grass and grape fruits with notes of pine needles.	Dry hoppy finish.
"
1," Bottled. Aroma of veggies and light herbal hops. Light amber color, white head, fair lace. Sweet malts, cookie dough, light herbal hops, hint of caramel, hint of figues?, light body. So, not a nice aroma but very nice drinking.
"
1," GCBF sample. Rich creamy head. Orange with a brown tint. Light malt aroma. Creamy body with a nice peanut taste.
"
1," A golden pils with a thin creamy white head. An aroma of berries and malty dough. In mouth, a crisp yet sweetish malt with lots of solvents and fruity notes. Medium to heavy bodied. A bit cloying. On tap at brewpub Dec. 30 2008.
"
1," SEP 20, 2004 This beer has become almost generic with the wide availability of other Belgians (at least in the Dallas area)...how wonderful...pours deep amberwith a nice tan active head...smells earthy, prunes, raisins, dark fruit...dry palate, but still quite complex...subtle alcohol in the finish...so delightful...
"
1," MAR 1, 2008 Brownish red colored beer with nice bubbly/creamy head. Very nice balanced sweet aroma of hops, malts and yeast. One doesnt overwhelm the others. I can tell the carbonation is high which is a signature of Chimay. Head dissipates rather quickly. Very smooth, medium bodied beer with floral hints and light touch of bitterness. Very good overall...better than I thought it would be.
"
1," Bottled@Bjrntasting. Yellowish golden colour, small white head. Aroma is hay, grass, some mild notes of fruits. Flavour is malts, grass, hay and mildly herbal notes as well. Refreshing and quite biting Pils.
"
1," Brownish color. Thin body. Good fruit aroma and taste. Alcohol is well hidden. Less intense than many Belgian Strong Ales.
"
1," This beer is my first Belgian Ale and I must say I love this style of beer.  Beautiful color, aroma, and taste.  I definitely recommend!
"
1," Nice yeasty nose.  Pours to a deep brown color. Very clean finish and good mouth feel, but not a terribly large amount of taste. Slightly spicy taste, but overall quite clean.
"
1," This was my first contact witht he Trappist beers.  I took a big swig after complaining about the super massive foamy head I got no matter how I poured it.  I felt like I got ran overthere was so much going on.  It was then I realized the ""Burgundies of Belgium"" were something different.
"
1," light brown smooth head and a woodsy, malty, bourbon, slight cherry/rose taste, with all the earthiness of a strong beer but very easy to the palate. Exceptional.
"
1," Bottle. Darkish amber color with a good, off-white head. Good lacing on glass.	Malty aroma. Tastes of caramel, malt and raisins with a touch of bitterness at the end. Another beer shared with my brother. This tasted great as did every beer we drank that night.
"
1," NOV 3, 2007 Im re-rating this beer as I had it a long time ago, and had it again alongside the other two varieties of Chimay commonly available in the US (white and red) yesterday.  And I have to say that with the benefit of quite a bit more beer experience since my last rating, that I significantly over-rated this beer in my previous rating.  Yesterday, I found this beer is extremely mild, and while certainly not unpleasant or bad, I found it to be a bit boring.  Of the three varieties I had yesterday, this was definitely my least favorite.		Appearance was a dark brown/almost black color with a decently-formed whitish head with limited staying power.  Aroma was very mild and faint.  I got roasted malt and a bit of alcohol, but not much else.  Flavor was the highlight of this beer, but even that I found mild-mannered and rather unremarkable compared to other dark Belgian (or Belgian-style) beers Ive had.  A bit of roastiness and some alcohol, but not much else that you might expect like spiciness or fruit.  Mouthfeel was not bad, but unremarkable.		So Im left to explain why so many think so much of this beer while Im the odd-duck whos unimpressed.  And my hypothesis is this - that many folks (me among them) try this beer when first expanding their beer horizons, are wildly impressed by the difference, but havent yet revisited (as Im now doing) to compare against the craft/import beer adventures theyve had since breaking out with Chimay Blue.  Sound plausible?
"
1," There is only one word that describes this beer. TASTY! I have just started enjoying Belgium Ales and this is one of the Best. A nice deep auburn color with a deep tan head. No one else in my beer club enjoyed it, so I had the entire bottle (750ml) all to my self. It has a complex flavor with a little sweetness and some deep earth flavors. This beer s to be enjoyed not drank.
"
1," Has an okay fake hazelnut and malt smell. Decent brown colour and an okay head. flavour is a nice refreshing nut taste, with a medium finish. Its reliable and tasty, though simple.
"
1," Would have been a much better beer if it wasnt for that darn palate which I suspected to be much heavier since it is one of the only seven Trappist beers. Not at all bad, nice bit of bitterness which is the strongest aspect of the overall week aftertaste. Aroma is great, very fruity and the beer looks nice and red. Good beer but not exactly what I hoped it would be.
"
1," Pours with a frothy off-white head on  a light brown body. Strong sweet aroma with floral tones. Sweet malty taste with alcohol evident. Body is medium thick with an alcohol warming effect.
"
1," Hard to find a better beer... perfect to share, perfect to taste... an incredible complex sensation... i dont wanna know how much one should pay to get these qualities in a wine... Chimay blue is a lifestyle !
"
1, somethings changed
1," Had the 330mL bottle.  The aroma is reminiscent of caramels, malts and pulled taffy.  Beautiful  hazy, opaque dark red color with thick half frothy, half bubbly tan head of two fingers.  The flavor is indeed complex with flavors seeming to hit you in stages as the beverage warms.  Delicately spicy but the dominant flavors are the malts and yeasts.  Contrary to most other strong belgian ales, this one lacks the characteristic fruitiness in the aroma and flavor.  Mouthfeel is warm due to the high alcohol content, the cask conditionning makes this heavier beer seem to evaporate on your tongue like a champagne.  In all I was a little bit disappointed since I had the highest expectations (I still think I enjoyed the Chimay Red and Whites better) but this is without a doubt one of the finest beers commonly available.
"
1," Good looking dark beer, with a pretty good taste.  I don't normally like the stouts, but I was surprised.  Smooth and simple.
"
1," Pours brown with a small off white head.  Aroma is faint but of dark fruits and light malts.  Flavor is slightly roasty, slightly hazelnut and a slight sour bitterness which may have something to do with the age of the bottle.  Not bad but not great.
"
1," On tap at Alt Platz.  Murky brown with a brief white head.  An excellent Mrzen.  Nose is woody caramel and smoky apple.  Taste is caramel and nuts with a bit of butterscotch.  Light sourness plays nicely off sweet notes.  Medium body with just enough carb.  Clean finish with light pith.  Fresh and flavorful, top-notch.
"
1," Mainly ruby hue with orange hints. Very nice head off-white head. Aroma is malty with some sour  hints. Very smooth, almost creamy. Taste is roasted and slightly nutty. Very good belgian.
"
1," Pours a cloudy tan/light brown color with an off white lacy head.  Smells of malt and flowers.  tastes a bit fruity with a hint of hops and a lot of malt.  Very simple flavor, not as complex as other beers, but excellent nonetheless.  I highly recommend it.
"
1," Bottle, 01-04. i also cellaring another for next summer and il rerate if needed. has a cloudy red color with a beige fluffy head that fades. has a raisin/date aroma that is a little sweet. taste has a bite to it. flavors of assorted spice fruit and floral, but is very astringent. finish leaves a malty fruit, mainly raisin like, taste. not bad, i look forward to next july.
"
1," Bottle, 5.5%. Aroma of stable and spicy aroma hops. Clear deep copper colour. The flavour is powerful and malty. Sweet old grass hop flavour.
"
1," Dark almost black hue.  Large but not massive brown head.  Yeasty nose with alcoholic over tones.  Wonderful rich and complex flavours, quite sweet with yeasty tones and hints of orange, brown sugar and raisins.  This is fantastic, what a beer!  The best Chimay I've had to date (white and red).
"
1," (Bottle 50 cl) Pours a hazy amber with floating impurities, creamy, off-white head that leaves some laces as it dissipates. Fresh, malty nose. Medium body with lightly vinous, sherryish accents and some vaguely sweet caramel. A pleasant and easy drink. 190206
"
1," Very malty and boring. Drank a number of these before a concert in September October. Not a whole lot going on and felt a bit heavy. Still it wasnt all bad. And it is an Oktoberfest. Cant expect a whole lot.
"
1," why bother describing it? youve had it. an excellent example of its style. dangerously easy to gulp.
"
1," From 33cl bottle into chalice. Nice head, although it did not last as long as I would have wanted. Wonderful aroma and flavor, with a medium long finish.
"
1," OCT 21, 2007 Aroma"
1," Pours more of a light brown than copper, thick head quickly dissapates.  Might be my oncoming cold, but the aroma is quite muted, nothing really prominent.  Fruity flavours with a spicy underlay.  Cherry, dried apricot notes.  Full bodied with a balanced finish.  Cheers!
"
1," Pours a deep, rich brown with a good head. Smells of plum, fig, and alcohol. Flavor is malty, plum, fig, and other esters, with distinct bitterness in the finish. You cant beat the Trappist breweries.
"
1," 75 cl bottle Grande Rserve @ Gastropub Tuulensuu. Vintage 2002 (cork says 11/02), #LAK-574,  BBE 2007	Aroma has a lot of raisins. It is syrup-like sweet. Palate has just the right amount of CO2. Taste has a lots of raisins and some sweet, malty bread but it is not disturbingly sweet though. It does get too sweet when it warms up. Very nicely aged. Tasted in 2000-2002-2003-2005-2006-2007-2008-2010 comparison. This was the best bottle while others varied between 3.6 and 3.9.
"
1," Beautiful beer deserving of a Chimay goblet.  Fruity finish and aftertaste.  Just right.
"
1," Cloudy brown hue, lasting light brown frothy head with fair lacing.   Toasted malt, light hoppiness with subtle fruitiness taste and smell, citrus and banana, medium to full body, sweet brown sugar, average duration.  The benchmark for an abbey dubbel.  Always good.
"
1," Drank on tap (20 oz) at there brewpub, on August 5, 2010. Red dark, little head. Aroma of semi-sweet hops, slightly fruity. Taste of fresh hops, hints of peaches, aftertaste of bitter herb. One well-balanced IPA!
"
1," (swing top bottle) Clear, golden colour with a blond and thick foamy head. Slightly grainy malty aroma with notes of sweaty and slightly herbal hops. Mildly bitter flavour, light to medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. Slightly grainy malt-character with chalky notes and a rising herbal hoppy touch towards the mildly bitter finish. Smells not great but the rest is still likeable. 02.IV.11
"
1," malty, fig, with distinct bitterness in the finish. Top +++
"
1," Pours a deep amber color with an off white head.  Aroma is caramel, with grassy bitter hops.  Flavor is malty, caramel, with a grassy/earthy finish.
"
1," 12 oz. bottle.  Pours a hazy reddish brown color with a small beige head.  The aroma was caramel malt with some sweet candi sugar, rich fruits, and a nice toasty quality as well.  The flavor is toasted bread dipped in a sweet caramel sauce.  Candi sugar and more fruit round out the flavors.  There is a slight hint of alcohol at times.  Medium bodied and fairly smooth.
"
1," Great medium dry hop. Love the color the tast the head. Love this brew. Wonderful IPA.
"
1," Pours dark meduim dark with a roasted aroma.  Average off white to tan head.  Little lacing.  Roasted malt flavor.  Thickness is hinted to in body but covered up well.  Smooth to drink with a low lying kick.  Alcohol is covered well in this beer.
"
1," One of my favorite beers.  From bottle into glass. Beautiful dark color which is similar to the red just darker.  Sweet floral aroma.  Excellent mouthfeel. Smooth with a pleasantly sweet alcohol finish. Alcohol is present, but complements rather than overpowers.  This tasted very similar to the Trader Joes 2006 Vintage. For the price I will drink more of the Vintage, but the history of Chimay will get me to buy a few bottles to age for special occasions.
"
1," Draft-Big River Brewery-Chattanooga, TN. This beer had a small sized white head that contained fine sized bubbles that was mostly lasting. The body was uncarbonated and transparent with an orange hue. It had a malty nose and a bitter and hoppy flavor to it. The mouthfeel was bitter and fairly smooth. This was a light-medium bodied beer that was just so-so.
"
1," Chocolate. Roast.I never grow tired of this style. Lots of wood and vanilla. Wood? Yeah, it is there too. But in a good way.
"
1," came in the Summer mixer pack. pours a clear golden yellow colour with a thin head which disspiates quickly, taste first of lime and then a bit of pepper earth spice, better then other lime beers looking at you Bud Lt Lime
"
1," 33cl Bottle. Beautiful head that fill the glass. 	Really strong aroma.	But like the majority I prefer the blue one
"
1," Bottle from Morrisons supermarket. Deep red/amber/copper coloured pour with a medium head. Fruity, malty aroma. Tastes fruity, slight bitterness, caramel, malty. Drinkable enough but Chimay used to be so much better.
"
1," A good steady kind of lager, nothing too unpleasant, but nothing outstanding either. Hop presence is perhaps more noticable than average.
"
1," SEP 18, 2009 Big River Disney World-Rocket Red Ale(Gordon Biersch)-on tap-pours a creamy white head with amber color.  Aroma is malt, sweet (too sweet).  Taste is rich, malt, sweet, hops. 	 090918-rerate
"
1," Deep brown pour with a small tan head.  Nutty and sweet malt s with some caramel and subtle vanilla, oak, and bourbon.  Just a hint of spicy noble hops come out in the finish.  Medium body with soft carbonation.
"
1," Had many a time, but rating from a vintage 3L magnum had at my going-away party at Brouwers. Lovely deep, still pour. Bright carbonation on a caramel, sweet malt base. yeast, dark fruit, dark chocolate. Not an Abt but very nice.
"
1," earthy nose meaning, say, a compost pile on a fairly cool day that someone just threw some dead flowers on.Thin but viscous, with plenty of carbonation, with a flavor combining fresh bread, milk, grapefruit and dried herbs. a semi-harsh bitterness, sorta like dandelion or arugula, rides up top of the flavors, intensifying as you drink further. One does get a sort of glowing sense of well being from this beer still,which is nice since the flavor isn't as malty and smooth as it used to be. Still a very nice beer though that does for you what most can't, and I'll leave it at that...
"
1," Draft @ brewpub. Glassy clear, very pale gold color with a decent white cap and lacing. Aroma is subdued and mild, earthy and woody. The flavors are hoppier. Palate is sticky with grass. The hop bitterness is nice.
"
1," Bottled, 33cl. Pours a hazy orange. Mildly spicy malt. Lively carbonation. Overall a bit bland, especially for being a new trappist contender.
"
1," on tap-pours a tan head that laces with black color.  Aroma is sweet.  Taste is roasty, dark malt, chocolate with coffee aftertaste.  Not my taste but nicely done.
"
1," 750 ml - Dark orange-brown, foamy off white head.  Raisin and fig nose warms to soft hints of sweet iced tea.  Plummy grape flavors ride touches of yeasty sweet spice.  Light to medium bodied, medium carbonation, dark fruity finish.  A classic, but has been passed by many others over the years...
"
1," Pours the most opaque dark brown color Ive ever seen.  A weak head, dissipates quickly.  Smells like malti-/yeastiness.  Like if you were baking bread.		The taste is malty and a little bit fruity, with a lot of bubbliness on the finish, appropriate for a beer in a champagne bottle, I suppose.  Theres no overpowering bitterness or sourness, but plenty of flavor and mouthfeel to satisfy even the guys in the 100 beer raters club .  Just a tad of spiciness on the aftertaste, this is a wonderful beer from the second you uncork the bottle until the minute youre crying in the closet because its gone.		Makes you understand why so many American craft brewers go out of their way to imitate Belgian abbey-made beers.  Really wonderful, if slightly overcarbonated for my tastes.  At $8 for a 750mL, this is a great, great beer for a special occasion, or to impress a lady friend.
"
1," Bottle. Pours a clear amber colour with a  big foamy  off-white head. Sweet malty aroma with caramel, cloves and some alcohol. Sweet malty flavour with caramel, wheat, bit of fruitiness and clove. The finish is malty with some alcohol.
"
1," White head atop a lightly hazed pale straw body.  Aroma is medium sweet, clove, some lemon, some plastic.  Aroma is medium sweet, clove, light bubblegum, faint lemon.  Watery, soft light body, light acidity.
"
1," Pours a dull hazy copper with a tall off-white head that lasts. Sweet and fruity aroma with corriander/banana. Taste starts a bit sweet but quickly gets dried out with a crisper spice and hop finish. The red is a bit lighter on the palate.
"
1," Not nearly as good as the Blue. Less flavor, less aroma. Fruitiness, slightly warming, no obvious flaws but just feels like its missing something.
"
1," MAY 21, 2010 Aroma has mostly raisin and caramel malts. hazy, brown coloured beer with an off-white, big head. The taste is quite sweet, carbonated and a bit unbalanced.		Original rating from 2002"
1, Odeur de caf avec une pointe de raisins. Apparence
1," Bomber from LDB. Rich dark brown with a red tint, and nice doily delicate tan lacing. The aroma is quite nice, really, fresh chocolate-mint in mutual balance. Almost smells like a dinner mint, childhood memories of Andes surface! but it really doesnt smell too artificial or candylike at all. The mint is actually a welcome, fresh, and fun change of pace in the aroma because it smells festive and inviting. The body is a little thin, and the chocolate malts dont quite fill the palate or linger but the flavors are pretty good. The carbonation is lively. Thats nice but a little creaminess in the palate would really lift this up. There is more chocolate malt than mint in the flavors, leaving some nice roast on the palate. The mint just livens and brightens it up. Once you get over the bias against gimmick beer, its actually not bad and much better than expected. Worth trying for sure.
"
1," On tap at the Springfield, PA location. Poured a medium and see through orange color with a small sized off white head. Aromas and tastes on the weak side and contained some citrus, caramel, and grains. Body was thin and watery.
"
1," bottle from Quinns.Strong mid brown colour with a head you can really play with. Good estery banana notes with some milky chocolate. Unusually dry for the style that makes it really enjoyable. Lovely German malt and notes of marzipan. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel with some nice prickly carbonation. A good solid dunkel weisse.
"
1," Bottle from Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville. Dark brown pour with a thin head. Aroma of chocolate, green apple and vinegar. Rich malty, fruity taste with hints of chocolate and toffee. Full bodied with alcohol nicely hidden.
"
1," Most of you already have your opinions set on this one, but I'd have to say that this one was great but a little fizzy.  Once in my mouth the carbonation took over.  The taste going down was kind of salty also.  The alcohol is covered pretty well.  If this beer wasn't so expensive I'd drink it again, I'll probably make it a special occasion beer like tonight when the Sooners killed OSU 52-9!  Boomer!
"
1," Lovely, subtle beer. Dark red-brown, fine, light tan, lasting head. Comples nose w/ multigrain bread,  hints of spice, citrus, dark fruit. taste is mild but interesting, nice balance between the malt and spice and alcohol presence.
"
1," grapey, vinous character; strong ester and yeast component; well-balanced, layered, and very drinkable.  Medium yeasty, estery, and dried fruit finish.
"
1," Bottle.  Aroma of heavy wheat with grain and honey.  Lesser notes of lemon and spice, but not coriander - nutmeg?  Smell of dust from the carpet.  Opaque cloudy lemon color with a short white head.  Bitter clove much stronger in the mouth, and yes, reminds of nutmeg.  Generic wit notes.  Medium body with a touch of prickling, smooth yeasty aftertaste.  Decent, but I cant get behind this combination of flavors.
"
1," Dark reddish brown with big off-white head. Aroma is of dark fruit and malt, flavor is the same, plums in the front. Silky texture that leaves a tingly sensation.
"
1," This is the best beer ever!!!! So balanced and easy drinking....LOVE IT!!!!
"

1," Beautiful looking beer, with unplesant auroma.  Bla, this is sour and not fun to drink.  Oh well, at least it was free.
"
1," Tried it for the first time. I typically do not drink beers this dark but I wasnt aware of this when I bought it. Head did not last long but tasted good and packed a punch.
"
1," Cask, Blackfriars, Glasgow, RBESG 07. Amber copper, thin white head. Not much aroma, some biscuit malt. Fruity summer hop tints. Grassy. Mouth is quite malty, but some hoppy fruitiness. Hoppy bitter finish. Quite sweet overall though.
"
1," 3 oz Sample at thebrewpub downtown Cattanooga. Nice dark amber pour with a creamy head. Nice bold flavor , for Big River, carmels hints of chocolate with a nice finish.
"
1," FEB 10, 2008 From 75cl 2007 bottle. Dark ruby clear body with a beige puffy head leaving a nice lacing. Plum, apple, fig, cinammon, clove in the nose with a subtle roastiness. In mouth it explodes with all the fruits and spicesl plus a port-like sweet finish, that is enhanced later by a nice roast aftertaste. Smooth and filling body, that doesnt try to hide its alcoholic content. Low-medium carbonation goes perfectly with the diversity of flavors without killing them. A wonderful beer, that I love to drink during good meals instead of wine.
"
1," This hazy orange beer has a large  fluffy head and is quite fizzy (slightly more than Id like, in fact.) It has a spicy and bread-like aroma. The flavour is very nicely balanced between sweet, banana-like malt and bitterness from the hops with some alcohol on the finish. I found it very pleasant indeed.
"
1," Bottle, 2 years old, according to the date on the cork - I hadn't had this beer in a while, and it is better than I remember. A nice fruity aroma and taste, with the alcohol well hidden. This is easily the best Chimay.
"
1," ( 12oz bottle, courtesy of thirdeye11 )  Pours a hazy golden body with a small white head.  Aroma of pine, pepper, caramel, and citrus.  Flavor of hops (orange, grapefruit, pine, floral, pepper) and caramel malt with mild bitterness in the finish.
"
1," Cask at Edinburgh beer festival 2008 ... hazy yellow ... light lemon hop ... fruity light and quite dry ... not my thing.
"
1," APR 22, 2005 probably the most mainstream of all trappists. I decided to re-rate this after I had Rochefort 10. Very dark when poured, excellent aroma and the taste has a hint of malt, chocolate and raisins..very sweet and smooth also.. but there is something missing ! note"
1," Pretty good Belgian dark, hides the alcohol okay. Flavor is very malty with some fruit and malt, not too complex. Slightly overpriced compared to other Belgians in its class.
"
1," Just wanted to amend my four favorite Belgians. Westy 12, Westy 8, Rochefort 10 and Westmalle Double. Also adjusting my score from 4.8. Too high. Thanks. Carry on.
"
1," Tasted on 12/20/11 from a 12oz bottle, thank you to Jane.  Pours a completely opaque black with a very thick and rocky tan head that slowly recedes to thin, but rocky lace.  The nose is full of darkly roasted malt and coffee, but also has a very nutty, buttered popcorn, and oaky cinnamon aroma.  The flavor is vinous and fruity up front, moving to the cinnamon and vanilla oak, and finishing with the very darkly roasted, and lightly bitter coffee malt.  The body is full with average, but very smooth carbonation, and a long, vinous, and freshly roasted, lightly bitter coffee finish.
"
1," Bottle from Scottish Real Ale Shop. Virtually no aroma, cloudy light brown colour with almost no head. Slightly sour hoppy & apple flavour, watery texture. Very amateurish, like beginners hombrew.
"
1," Bottle 0,33cl. Brown/red color, with a persistent beige head, aroma like chocolat and roasted malt, high carbonation. Flavor like roasted malt and notes of aclohol, mouthfeel is good, the bitterness is fine.		Cerveja marrom avermelhada, espuma bege e persistente, aroma de chocolate e malte torrado o mesmo para o sabor e com notas de lcool. Deixa um gosto amargo e gostoso na boca. EXCELENTE!
"
1," Pours a dark brown rust color that is very opaque with a decent head. Fruity complex aroma of sweet malt. Great carbonation accompanies the sweet deep fruity flavor of this ale. It doesnt have much of an alcoholic taste for its content which makes it very drinkable.
"
1," JAN 9, 2006 (Bottle 75 & 33 cl) Vintage 1992. Reddish dark, hazy and impure with a tall head. Very full-bodied with a warming but never cloying alcohol - actually, it doesnt really appear that strong. Chocolatey and spicy - perhaps even a bit peppery? I cannot really taste the difference between the ""Bleu"" in small bottles and the ""Grande Reserve"" in the big, but try sampling different vintages at ""Kulminator"" in Antwerp - its a great experience. 201193
"
1," As I pour this Ale that comes with quite a reputation and the label of Grande Reserve it conjures up memories of special joys in life. Due to this occasion I must dust of my very rare Louis Prima 1964 King Of Clubs Casbar Sam Butera LIVE LP and invite my best girl over.		I sip this delicious ale with great joy and delight as  dolce mio arrives with her glorious butt cheeks ready to sway to the smooth sound of the master Louis playing on the turntable.	This Ale is full of all that is good and right with the world. It is yeasty, light, floral  oh so tasty. I go through the bottle with my dearest and am very satisfied with my purchase as side two ends.
"
1," Dark roasted malt aroma. Pours pitch black with thick brown head. Lots of dark malt flavor with lingering roast malt aftertaste. Some dark malt astringency which is okay.  Overall a very nice oatmeal stout.
"
1," Big full head, dark brown color, and rich alchoholy aroma. Complex falvor with a good mix of malieness with hints of hops, bitterness, and chocolate. A very good beer, but not worth the 4 bucks per bottle.
"
1," From a year-old 330ml bottle. It pours a dark amber/brown with a lively head (leaving the yeast in the bottle). Aroma of raisin, plum, peach, chocolate cake and herbs. Taste is sweet, but a flowery hop bitterness comes through quickly. The body is medium with good carbonation and a flowery finish.
"
1," On tap at Seven Bridges brewpub in Jacksonville, FL. Arrived at the table a very nice deep reddsih brown with a thin-moderate light brown head. Mild aroma of chocolate and malt, which also comes through in the flavor. A little over-carbonated for me, but otherwise a decent brown ale.
"
1," Bottle 33 cl. Pours a clear red with a medium white head and citrus ad ripe prunes in the nose. The aroma is really fruity too, with a bit of brown sugar and roasted malts and a hoppy, but sweet finish. Pretty good, but I like the blue one better
"
1," Served from a 12 oz bottle thanks to Craig. The appearance is a really nice ruby brown with a huge foamy light brown head. The aromas are chalky malts, caramel, light hops, brown sugar. The flavors share a bit of that chalkiness, brown sugar, some cereal, little chocolate. Palate is a touch off to me which distracts from the flavors. Overall a solid brown thats not too far off.
"
1," Dusty amber coloured. Not much head. Flavour of eelsmoked salami and bacon. Very smoky. Flavour is very roasty and smoked. Is surprinsingly vague and watery in the end. I much admit, that its interesting, but I find it rather bad. Il give an extra point for the bottle.
"
1," SEP 11, 2007 Focus, focus, focus.  All these Eastern religion crazes and astrological ombudsmen always blather on about focus, finding ones center and maintaining spiritual energy at the nexus and vertex.  Everything from urban development to cake decorating is centered aroundwell, the center.  Proper balance has become a higher art, put into form in everything, including beer making.  And that paragon of centered flavor and palate is the Chimay Blue.  What a beautiful beer; beautiful in its precarious balance.  The color is like a light baby bears fur, and the foam a casual light tan color.  The whole appearance is gentle and soft, picturesque to anybody with a disposition to tactile experience.  The smell is extraordinarily complex, fuming with copious yeast and some teriyaki sauce.  I must say, the aroma is quite mild, not unlike the taste.  The flavor is just light enough to match perfectly with the palate.  The whole flavor compound lingers on the tongue for a long time, allowing the drinker to take his time and really immerse himself in the Chimay Blue experience.  It lets one center themselves, finding the same coveted balance that the brewers at Chimay instill in their signature beer.

1," sweet, fruity, and yeasty, with (to my nose) a faint touch of apple. Taste was a richly complex sweet and sour mix, surpisingly mild but with just the right amount of hops to give it bite. It took some getting used to, but grew on me quickly. Its smooth, too, no foul tail at all. The palate was good also, a bit watery to start with but then you get a real tickle in the throat--and the nose, too. The kick is quite substantial, even in the small bottle, so be prepared. This is really a fine beer, though the price will probably keep me from getting it too often. Lovely stuff.
"
1," Great beer, smooth, medium bodied, silky finish.  Perfect in the Chimay glass.  Definitely better Belgium beers, only hard to get in America
"
1," Bottle. Pours a clear brown beer with a beige head. The aroma is malt and caramel. The flavor is malt, caramel and sweetness. The palate is sweet. Overall an average beer.
"
1," pours a slightly cloudy orange with a small, quickly dissipating white head. Aroma of hairspray. Flavor is moderately hairspray like with hops and slight earthiness. Taste is mainly hops with a very pronounced bitterness in the finish. Average or less.
"
1," JAN 15, 2003 I love this stuff, but the Gran Reserve is much better.  Great complexity of flavor, nice spicy, slightly fruity aftertaste.
"
1,"-) )		Pours a cloudy ruby/chocolate colour with a dense offwhite head. Honey and cinammon in the nose with a smell of almost some sweet fruit liquor. Taste is somewhat alcoholic with a strong fruit presence, a nice spicy aftertaste on the tongue leaves you longing for another sip.. Definetly a nice beer when you wanna spoil yourslef.
"
1," A little hoppy, not too sweet, raisiny, straight up dubbel flavors with anything off, really good.
"
1," 33cl bottle poured into a Chimay Trappist glass.  Cloudy brown with one finger tan head.  Faint aroma of sweet malt.  Taste is sweet and malty with a strong finish of alcohol.  Quite tasty and surprisingly drinkable for 9% abv.
"
1," NOV 28, 2004 Amber with lasting off white head. Great sweet carmel malt nose and flavor with light hopping
"
1," Pours pitch black and completely opaque with a two finger frothy beige head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. Spotty lacing left behind. 		Roasted malt aroma with a tamer barrel presence than expected. Slight toasted oak and vanilla notes with only subtle bourbon presence. Roasted malts with hints of chocolate, caramel and toffee.		Medium bodied and similar to the aroma. The barrel presence is there but pretty faint with only slight earthy oak and sweet bourbon flavor. The base beer flavor is very strong with roasted malt, coffee, toast, toffee and hazelnut. Slight lactic creaminess smother things out a bit before ending with a slight dry finish.
"
1," Dark red colour with a good head, very nice brune, it says Brune on the bottle but is known as Chimay Red?
"
1," NOV 5, 2004 Looking at this beer in my glass reminds me of the Charles River in Boston. From the swampy color to the tan foamy head. Aroma is complex, fruity, malty with a slight floral presence. Crisp and effercescent, yet smooth and medium to full bodied with an ever so slight metallic finish. Very drinkable especially at 55+ degrees. Good sample of a good Belgian Abbey Dubbel.
"
1," 330 ml bottle.  Good carbonation.  Fruity / malty aroma.  Cloudy.  Smooth taste, easy to drink.  Great beer
"
1," GABF 2010, dark pour, medium body. Roasted malts, vanilla, bourbon/whiskey. Pretty balanced as bourbon & wood lends itself & doesnt dominate other aspects of the beer. Nice stout
"
1," Dark black color, CO2 pour, light head and no lacing. Roasty aroma, very creamy, not too sweet. Light columbian coffee and chocolate (dark I think). Flavor is vague at best, pretty flavorless. Finishes dry and bitter but smooth. Eh.
"
1," Fest sample. Pours a clear copper color with an average rocky off-white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate to heavy hop citrus aroma. Medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy bitter flavor with a good bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Very good brew.
"
1," Great Ale.  This was my first real Trappist experience and one that I constantly go back to.  This is a rich, tasty ale with a strong head and strong aroma.  Beautiful late at night or after a good lunch.  Just lovely and quite affordable for the quality. Excellent.
"
1," At the brewpub, pre-Noogfest. Pours copper with yellow-beige head. The aroma is very sweet with honey and caramel, some light citrus and spice notes. The flavor is sweet nuts, honey, and some faint bitterness. Robust for an IPA.
"
1," Big lasting head. Golden amber.Very floral fragrance. Strong brew with a deep warming sensation and a smooth finish. I really enjoyed this one. Had it at Immys tasting.
"
1,	Plump honeyed cereals dive into a void of a finish in this clean and corny lager for the masses.		Further Personal Perceptions
1," Thanks STFUN for this one. Color was black with a red tint. Smelled of dark fruits and spices. Taste is toffee, small amount of chocolate, and fruits spices. Texture is light, not watery though, with some carbonation.  Like josh said almost a wine beer. Different but good. Thanks again josh.
"
1," Nashville.  Barely translucent and medium chestnut brown in color with a thin tan film as the center splotch of the head and a thick graying wrung around the edges.  So far so good.  Maple nut fudge with a light cocoa powder accent the aroma, and the house linen factor is still omnipresent.  At least weve got more nutty intonations (mocha beans, hazelnut, etc.)  Loose and acidic flavor as expected, with a nut extract trait delusionally keeping it from being completely incohesive.  Citric character is void, and conspicuous by its absence.  Mild sting of compressed orange toffee and cedar sap, pricking most at the outset.
"
1," Dark reddish-brown with a very quickly dissipating head. Aroma of malt, dark fruit and spices. Taste is sharp, of malt, fruits, caramel. Quite tasty and drinkable, but not incredibly interesting.
"
1," Dark ruby color with a medium head.  Dirty caramel aroma and a little nut.  Chalky flavor.  A little chocolate on the finish.
"
1," 22oz bottle, Thanks to jcwattsrugger at Richmond Summer Gathering @ Williamsburg. Pours dark brown in color with tan head. Aroma roasted malt and chocolate. Taste of roasted malt, dark chocolate and light licorice with dry finish.
"
1," OCT 2, 2008 33cl bottle, dark amber colour, soft white head with brown notes, yeast and caramel malt aroma, fruits (banana, raisins) and metallic notes, balanced sweet flavor, clean finish
"
1," An elegant brew.  Poured a robust brilliant whitish head.  I could taste subtle hints of fruit along with a definite malt flavor.  I drank the big bottle and had a warm, rosy feeling in my cheeks almost like I had been drinking wine or champagne.  Break this stuff out if you want to impress the ladies.
"
1," This is a deep brown to black beer with red hues and a large brown head.  The aroma displays vanilla, chocolate,  and a smooth burbon sensation.  Its a very round feeling complex beer with a plesant vanilla flavor along with chocolate, coffee and oak.  The burbon isnt very present until the beer warms up, but then its unmistakable.  There is a nice light bitterness that lingers that makes this a nice beer.  This is the second in Barley Islands Burbon Barrell beers, and so far both have been very nice.
"
1," drank from bottle at home. Fromed a healthy head with a dark brown body. A lot of spices taste and hard to determine which is whichThe taste was so palatable that I could drink all day . Unfortunately drinking all day 9.0% alcohol could damage my liver. I have to salute the monks for such a nice tasty beer.
"
1," On the nose I got sweet malts, ripe fruits, raisin, caramel and some yeastyness. Taste is caramel, ripe fruits, dried fruits and some sweet malts.
"
1," The best of chimay. My bottle is quite fruity,earthy in taste and smell. Trois Pistoles by Unibroue is a little better,that being said this is very excellent for the style!	You may read all previous remarks..but taste and make up your own mind!
"
1," DEC 15, 2010 From A 3yr Old Bottle.Dark brown with a hint of blood in colour,small head,lots of dark fruit,sweet malt ,spice and pepper,coconut and ear warming alcohol.
"
1," On tap at Alt Platz. Color was a dark brown with some reddish tints and a tan head that leaves a nice lacing. Aroma was a nutty chocolate and malt. Flavor gives you the same nutty chocolate and a nice bitter chocolate finish.
"
1," Tap.  Yeast and fragrant floral hop aroma.  Pours bronze with a thin white head.  sour hop flavor with a creamy yeast and malt body.  Medium bodied and creamy palate.
"
1," Pours inky black with rich but minimal tan head, low carbonation.		Smells of cinnamon, hint of molasses, roasted coffee, cereal grains.		Viscous and chewy on the tongue, though low in carbonation.		Rich roasted chocolate up front, very syrupy with hints of hop presence on the back end.  Not too much different than most oatmeal stouts Ive tried, only richer.  Overall balance is exceptional.		Some may find the rich sweetness to be overbearing over the course of one or two pints, but not this guy.  Leaves a stickiness on the lips and palate, so it may be ruinous to the effect of follow up brews, but its reasonable enough to make a fine nursing beer over the course of an evening.
"
1," Bottled. Pours golden with a white head. Aroma is hoppy and malty. Taste is sweet malty and somewhat hoppy
"
1," has a subtle nuttiness with a smooth drinkability and a pleasant aftertaste.  overall, one of barley island's best.
"
1," Bottle. Innisfil, Ontario, Canada.	Beautiful beer! Pours dark tan, good carbonation, head is gone quickly. Excellent aroma - fruits, yeast and caramels, a hint of something earthy. Smooth taste, good back-end bitter. Pretty silky, as described. Big yeast hit. Love this beer - cant remember if I like this or the gold, since this was a big bottle and Im a little tipsy.
"
1,plums and grape...	Appearance
1," Bottle - gift from my wifes co-worker. Amber pour with a short white head. Aroma is malty and slightly sweet with grains and light hops. Taste is malty and grainy with a light sourish twang and soft fruit notes. Grass and straw come through as well. Body is light-medium with soft carbonation. Ends with more grains, sweet malt, a light sour fruit twang and and a touch of grassy hops.
"
1," Little fat bottle, i think i got a sour one. It was all metalic, start to finish. The apearance was beautiul amber woody with a whipped cream topping. The flavor was like sucking a penny. A faint backgrounk of dried fruits overwhelmed by copper. Highly sulfuric and astringent finish, completly dry with little bitterness. Dont know whats up, this is the second time ive had this brew. Bought at Bevmo Mission valley. Bad beer or Burnt Beer?
"
1," (Bottle).  Very pleasant fruity aroma.  Pours red brown with a smallish creamy head.  Flavor is light fruit, with just the right touch of bitterness.  Complex without being inscrutable.  Finishes smooth.  An excellent and enjoyable beer.
"
1," brownish color, very slight vinegar taste (that's the only way i could think of describing it. VERY smooth going down.
"
1," Pours a ruddy brown, cloudy, with about two inches of beige foam. The head dies down quickly to a thin cap and a ring. A thin stream of bubbles rise from the etched bottom of the Chimay chalice. Very nice lacing. Mild sweet bready malt in the aroma.		The taste is rather dry and grainy, with a hint of musty peat malt. Beyond the dryness, I taste some mild fruit, sweet bread, and yeast. Lets call it medium bodied, with a bit of weak, flat, diluted rum & coke in the aftertaste.
"
1," Purchased @ TheBeerBox Mexico (a Mexico City Online retailer).	Amazing this was my first trappist  and oh boy,it was memorable.I poured this one into a wine glass to really appreciate all the malty,piney ,sweet aroma it holds, it pours a very extensive beige head that quickly disminishes to nothing.The taste and palate its sweet, the alcohol is nicely hidden , not any strong hop resemblance at all, great, the palate its very delicate and pleasant. I recommend this!
"
1," (swing top bottle, courtesy of Quack-Duck) Clear, deep golden colour with a mid-sized and slightly tanned foamy head. Sweet malty bready aroma with notes of biscuits, cara-malt and  a subtle fruity touch. Sweet and slightly malty flavour, medium to light bodied with a moderate carbonation. Slightly cara-malty and bready taste with a tinge of cooked carrots and shy hoppy spices; Slightly sweet and bitter, malt-accented finish with light hoppy notes to give a little balance. All in all a pretty drinkable, almost hearty Helles. 30.XII.09
"
1," On tap the Springfield PA location billed as the ""Fancy Lawnmower Light"".  Pours a translucent clear yellow with a small bubbly white head.  Aroma was lightly sweet and malty, really no hop presence.  Flavor was light, grainy, grassy and malty.  Just really light in flavor and aroma overall. Watery.
"
1," (Bottle 50 cl) Fully golden - close to amber - with a handsome, creamy head. Malty, bready aroma. Very sweet malt with lightly caramelish notes. Almost no bitterness. Very accessible. 021205

1, Poured from bottle into Snifter.		Appearance
1," yes very dark red in colour. Yeasty aroma. Hugh head, very bready flavour
"
1," Bottle via stfun.  Brownish color.  Smell of bourbon, vanilla, oak, malt, chocolate and toast.   Taste of Chocolate, hops, malt, bourbon, oak, vanilla, caramel and roasted coffee.  This was very weak.  The bourbon was mellow and a tad bit too weak.
"
1," This beer is a clear copper color with a thin and dense off-white head that diminishes steadily. Stringy lacing. Citrusy hops in the nose with floral touches. Medium body with flavors of floral hops and citrus along with light malt. The finish is hoppy with a bitter aftertaste that does not linger too long. Decent overall.
"
1," Sorachi Ace batch at Soire des Brasseurs 2011 in Shawinigan. Deep orange blonde topped by a whitish head. Nice aromas of bitter orange and pepper. Low to medium body, medium bitterness, a little thin for an IPA, but the finale is very refreshing. More an APA in my opinion with its low bitterness in the mouthfeel, but still a very satisfying ale.
"
1," Thanks JCapriotti!  The beer pours to a dark brown body with a thin tan head.  The aroma is pretty nice.  Raw barley grain thats been balanced by light bourbon and vanilla.  The flavor is bourbon, sweet stout, very light and kinda boring.  Thin boring mouthfeel.
"
1," MAR 31, 2009 Pours dark brown with an off-white head.  Magnificant sweet smell of yeast and spice.  Very full and smooth in my mouth.  Tastes of roasted coffee and slight hops.  Taste is almost too sweet and mouth is left syrupy, two bad things, but the smoothness makes this a very nice beer.  Rich enough that I cant drink more than one.
"
1," A top notch Belgian strong ale.  There is the expected malt and light sweetness as well as the alcohol, but the alcohol level is low enough; as opposed to the common 11.5% beers, that it does not dominate the flavor or aroma.  Heavy, with a fairly fruity, and floral-yeast aroma.  Great beer.
"
1," Its only taken me 10+ years to rate this standard.  Pours a cloudy, dark brown color with a large, off white head.  Very sweet aroma, dark brown sugar and dark fruits; raisins.  Sliky smooth body, sweet candi sugar, graham crackers, spicy, yeasty.  Roasted malts shine in the biting, carbonated finish.  Not the most complex or interesting, but is well rounded and satisfying.
"
1," Bottle. Amber with nice thick creamy head. Medium carbonation. Nice soft mouthfeel. Citric hoppy scent. Very bitter in a one-dimensional way. Good ballsy IPA and a nice surprise from Dead Frog, who are proving that they can actually brew a high quality craft beer. A lot of their product seems to be marketed to the Sleeman crowd (it is actually better), but this one is a keeper. Thanks Dead Frog!
"
1," Bottle. Brown colour with a slim head. Fruity aroma. Fruity, nutty taste. I found this a bit lacking in body; moderate carbonation. Nowhere near as good as the Blue.
"
1," Dark brown of color with a white head. An aroma of dark fruits, alkohol and spice. A flavor of fruit, alkohol, spice and dark fruits. IMO totally overrated! Cross tasted with St Bernardus Abt 12
"
1," Bottle 50cl. @ home.Unclear hazy, sparkling, medium orange amber color with a large, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white to light beige head. Aroma is moderate to light heavy malty, caramel, fruity, chocolate notes, light to moderate yeasty, light banana. Flavor is moderate to heavy sweet and chocolate bitter with a long duration. Body is medium, texture is creamy, carbonation is soft. [20090605]

"
1," Chimay Bleue is charmingly dark brew with rich creamy foam. Aroma is strongly malty and alcoholic. Flavor is combination of yeasty butter, plum and malt. Aftertaste is a balanced harmony of hops and malt and alcohol is warming nicely.
"
1," Silky. Crispy red color, very transparent for it class. Nice fine foam. Excellent.
"
1," Bottle
"
1," Bottle. Chimay Bleue pours a nice thick white head almost as beautiful as Duvel ,but only makes it to the neck of a tulip glass. Lacing is present but doesnt stick to the glass very well. Color is dark brown. From three feet away you can catch the bread aroma of this brew. When you get your nose into it, you also pick up notes of citrus, some fruit possibly grapes, and some malt. Bleue has some very sweet flavors of fruit, caramel malts, a hint of alcohol, and some bitterness in the finish.
"
1," Wow, what to say about Chimay Grand Reserve.....	Well to start, my mouth is watering just thinking about the rich flavor and complexities. It has a wonderfully faint coffee aroma, and an even further distant sent of chocolate. Make no mistake this is no type of chocolate stout or mocha flavored beer. This is a true beauty. Unique to itself and wonderfully crafted to have you craving more so the larger bottle is a must. As much as a dark beer on a hot day sounds like red wine in the sun, frost yourself a mug and pour slowly. The wonderfully roasted flavor goes down like......satin! Yeah, definitely satin!
"
1," Pours a cloudy hazy golden with thin white head. A touch of wheat, citrus and coriander in the aroma, but with the strange presence of chicken broth.  Starts full (for a witbier at least) and semi-sweet with a touch of dry orange peel.  Finishes crisp and semi-dry. Thanks atpayne.
"
1," MAR 10, 2009 New one from Barley Island. Not quite as good as Beastie Barrel, but sessionable nonetheless. Aroma is a tad weak; roasted grain and chocolate. Flavor is the same, nice mix of chocolate and roast, with a touch of cream and grain. Slightly boozy with a small burn. Mouthfeel is a little too watery. Overall, nice but not exceptional.**** Liked this much better the second time around, much more roast and a creamy mouthfeel.
"
1," 1pt 9.4fl.oz wegmans. Dark murky copper in color light bubbly tension for the head with medium carbonation. Aromas of spices, mellowed malts, slight alcoholic ester, light bread, light fruity esters of cherry and sour/tart apple. Slightly oily consistent of the palate. Flavors mostly all malts consisting of caramel, light cherry underneath, little bread/dough, hint of oak/wood (but well faint/subdued). Sweet, silky, dry finish, slightly cloying. A fairly well done abbey but Id prefer their others first for the high price tag.
"
1," Heavenly appeaance, translucent gold gradient, light to dark, bottom to top, 1/2 inch white head. Farm ale clean, wild yeast aroma. Just the slightest hint of being sour. The best aroma for a belgian that Ive had, and Ive had some. The flavor is well balanced between farm malt, candied apple, and yeast. Also a small amount of hop bitterness is detected. Clean, spring water-like finish. My favorite belgium thus far.
"
1," Poured a cloudy orangey color ale with a nice foamy head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of bitter dry hops is dominating with some light caramel malt. Taste is also dominated by some dry bitter hops with no floral or citrus notes and some very light caramel malt. Body is quite full with some good carbonation.
"
1," On tap at the brewpub. Clear deep gold with an off white head. Nose is bready with a light hoppiness. Bready, biscuity flavor, sweet malt. Even malty finish. Nice.
"
1," Bottle, 12 oz. Amber color with a beige head. Mostly malty aroma wtih some hops. Sweet at first on the palate, then some hop bitterness kicks in. Drinkable.
"
1," Draft. Pours golden orange with a white head. Citric hoppy aroma with sweet malty notes. The flavor has sweet citric hops and candy sweet malty notes. Good stuff.
"
1," Heavy in alcohol, deep brown colour with chocolate and malt flavours beind the strongest
"
1," 500 mL, pours fizzy with little to no head retention.  Murky, dirty appearance.  Pleaant aroma of chocolate, spice, figs.  Waaaay too much carbonation, most Ive ever seen, like fresh seltzer.  A little metallic, some alcohol, some bananas, roasty toasty nutty.  Overall, mild flavor, not offending, unremarkable, highly overrated.  Was decent after I got rid of most of the carbonation.
"
1," Reddish, light brown color. Hazy and cloudy.  Thick wispy head.  Very pronounced bread and yeast smell. A little bit of spice and some fruit.  Some sweet Malty flavors. Bready and grains. Some spice and some black pepper. Also some light fruit flavors like pear and dates. Overall, fairly sweet with a little sourness. Not much hop bitterness. Light to medium body.  Very smooth.
"
1," Browish red body, tiny and bubbly head. Caramel, raisins, coriander seeds and early. Sweet body that sticks to the mouth, even with the watery texture. Long aftertaste and alcohol is well hidden. This is the opposite of refreshing and although well brewed I never got to like it really. Cheap. (33cl bottle, 1,60 EUR)
"
1," 330 ml bottle in Ravenna, Italy.  Pours a dark amber color with a descent frothy head.  A malty hay aroma along with a hint of caramel and spiciness.  The taste is well balanced with a moderately sweet start to a slightly bitter finish.  Theres nice carbonation with a moderate alchohol finish.  Very well crafted!

1," MAR 31, 2009 Bottle"
1," Bottle.  Sweet strawberry/lemon malt aroma.  Hazy golden yellow color with large head.  Sweet berry malt and lightly bitter hay hops flavor.  Nice body.  Very fruity - a very good and unusual beer.
"
1," DEC 8, 2008 Lives up to its fancy bottle and big reputation.  Big crisp aroma of brown sugar, dark fruit, and yeast.  Flavor is sweet and malty, and never musty.  Definitely worth a try, if only for the great looks and superior mouthfeel.
"
1," (bottle 6/26/10). Cloudy brown/copper color. Medium off white head. Moderate fruity raisin aroma, with light spicy belgian yeast character. Flavor of the same. Avg duration. Light dry, light alcohol finish. Thin/fizzy texture. Moderate carbonation. Spare lacing.
"
1," A very tasty dubbel.  Maybe the best I have ever tasted.  Better than Westmalle, and better than Konings Hoeven, but not by much, as those are all great beers!  Great with Chinese, or mexican food.  A little too expensive at about $10 for a 750 ML bottle, but I none the less consume one every three or four weeks !!
"
1," Bottle from fiver29. Poured dark brown color with average frothy brown head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate toasted chocolate malty aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture. Moderate toasted chocolate flavor with an average bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Good brew.
"
1," Bottled. Reddish brown. Starchy, corn flour aroma followed by thin, fruity flavour. Marred by aftertaste of damp cardboard with metallic overtones.  Chimay claims corners have not been cut with this beer, which I find hard to believe. A serious contender for worst trappist beer.
"
1," Bottle@Home. Strong sweet, malty aroma. Dark yellow, white head, fair lace. Sweet, bitter, malty, hint of apple and perfume. Quite full yet sparkling on the tip of your tongue. Pretty much how I remember that Ritter Dortmunder used to taste like.
"
1," Bottled at Sokol, Ljubljana.  Cloudy orange, absolutely no head. Fruity grassy nose. Mid-sweet with light-medium body and soft mouthfeel. Notes of lemon and butter reveals that it may not be in top shape. Good amounts of grassy spicy hops covers the off-flavours fairly well though. Marked late bitterness.
"
1," Dark ruby color, creamy light head and lots of lacing (sampler in a brewpub, this is the standard here). The aroma is lightly spicy and hoppy, caramel malts are present and lots of darker specialty malts fill in the mouthfeel in the back. The flavor is slightly medicinal, but negligable as this is easy to drink. Finishes sweet at first on the palate but dries out from the hops with a subdued bitterness. A good winter beer from the far off lands.
"
1," Thanks for sharing afire.  Large Blue- Nice hazy nut brown pour with really pleasant foam head.  Yeast flora aroma. Great carbonation.  For me the best so far of the Chimays, although the alc. was higher than all the others very un-intrusive.  Smooth and even body Belgian strong with a touch of sweetness.  Just great all around.
"
1," A carmel brown hue with a fizzy tan head which lasted but did not produce much lace. The aroma is walnut, caramel, roasted malt, a tocuh of mocha, grassy and floral hops, and a bit of some dirty yeast esters. The taste is moderately balanced between the sweet malt, mild bitterness and acidity. While not much depth, it is drinkable. Overall it is a minor step above the standard brown.
"
1," A pleasing ruby pour with an ample but quickly diminishing head.  Looks like a foamy pinot noir.  Yeasty aroma with nuances I am at a loss as how to describe (aftershave?).  Pleasing creamy small bubble mouth feel.  Fruity flavor (cherry, banana, cloves) followed by a slightly mettalic and sour aftertatse.  Very interesting beer ... my frist Belgian ale.
"
1," This is not overly exciting.  Very drinkable but average.  The aroma is full of nuts and honey. Mouthfeel is thin and watery but balanced.
"
1," This beer was a little on the strong side and had too much of an alcohol taste for my liking.  Not terrible, but I expected something smoother.
"
1," pours amber orange (no surprise), micro CO2 with ringed retention, thin sticky lacing. A bit of malt on the nose. Aromas of mandarin orange and orange peel up front mixed with cutting-sharp chilled CO2 bubbles (stings the palate), and then finishes medium malty bitter - long and lingering bitterness. Viscosity is thinnish, low-medium complexity, low-medium length, low depth, and low carry. This beer is refreshing but it dies out fast in the mid and finish. I only enjoy the mandarin orange aroma, but one bottle is enough.
"
1," Orange, amber colored brew. Fruity, herbal aroma. Fruity, herbal, sweet flavor with some bitterness. Very nice one.
"
1," Pours a jet black color with a light brown head.  Aroma is malty, roasty, and some chocolate.  Flavor is malty, roasty, and some chocolate.
"
1," A very complex brew. Notes of alcohol, yeast, pepper, and slight apricot in the aroma. The flavor is very smooth and complex with notes sandalwood and a deep and rich malt flavor.Great stuff
"
1," A fruity aroma with a light yeast kicker. The first half poured a pretty amber almost like a brandy. The second half had a yeasty haze, flavor and aroma. Tasted fruity with a bit of a bitter-sweet palate. The finish doesnt last a really long time. A beer I enjoyed but for the money there are a number of other bigger beers in bigger bottles that I would choose over it.
"
1," I am not a fan of Scotch Ales, but this was a nice one. Aroma is full of nuttiness and Jack Daniels, with a touch of smoke and toffee. Flavor is smooth, notes of vanilla, wood, toffee, roasted malt, with a hint of yeast. Lots of Jack Daniels flavor, but very little of the alcohol or booze, which was nice. Whiskey worked hand in hand with the wood to create a nice complexity. The carmel from the barrels balanced everything out nicely, and added a nice smokiness to the finish. Quite nice.
"
1," 22 oz bottle, vis nolankowal.  Pours a deep black colored body under a one inch brown head that gained density as it sat, ending in a tight bubbled foamy cream.  Aroma is very roasty with just the lightest accents of vanilla and bourbon.  Some chocolate fudgecake, and a little chalk.  The flavor is pretty thin with a mix of chalky roast, vanilla extract, and a light lactic tinge.  Very, very, light barrel influence.  Mouthfeel is on the thinner side with an almost nitrogenated carbonation feel to it.  A little bit of sweet stickiness on the finish.  Overall, just a little bit too thin all around, and lacking in complexity.
"
1," Overall very nice beer.  The aroma is sweet and has a bubblegum accent.  The appearance is a thin coffee type look.  The taste is wonderful and has a bit of coffee aftertaste.  I liked this quite a bit.
"
1," This beer poors a dark mahogany with a suttle crimson edge. The head was nice and thisk with good lacing that lasted the duration of the tasting, and being that this was a 750, thats pretty damn good. 	The smell is heavy with cherry/chocalate, coffee, hazelnut, and alcohol. 	On tasting, the sweetness of this nectar honed in with sharp esters of chocalate, plums, coriander, orange zest and butter. The body cleans up with the subdued alcohol taste.	The mouthfeel is a dream with subtle carbonation that stays in line with the creaminess. 	All in all this is a superb drink that I would never think twice about enjoying again.
"
1," Deutlicher Malzantrunk mit milden, dafr aber breit gestreuten Rstnoten, die lange erhalten bleiben. Durch den Hopfen, der sich im Malz zu verstecken versucht gelangt Frische ins Bier. Nur wenig wrzig, dafr wird die Rstmalzigkeit zum Ende hin strker, das Bier behlt so ssine Grundstimmung. Wenig trockener Abgang, in dem das Rstmalz weicher wird. Nettes Dunkles. 8/9/9/8/9/8
"
1," MAR 20, 2006 In my opinion, the greatest in the chimay-serie. Aroma is dominated by yeast with notes of alcohol and fruit. The flavour hides both bitter notes and a sweet maltiness, strong alcoholic yeast and a mild and creamy texture which balances the brew. The aftertaste leaves sweet fruit and a metallic feeling.

1," Bottle, 330ml. A cloudy dark amber-coloured pour with a huge frothy diminishing head. Aromas of sweet honey and plum with a hint of bread/dough. A hoppy taste with toffee and biscuity hints. Alcohol is quite noticable. A light hoppy, fruity finish with some harshness from the alcohol. Very high carbonation. A complex brew, but the carbonation ruined it for me.
"
1,"  pours brown with a small beige head that quickly diminishes.  The nose is full of carmel and spice.  The flavor was good.  very malty, with great spice from the yeast.  The palate was exquisite.  small bubbles coat the mouth.  A very good beer.
"
1," Pours a dark brown with sediment, with a light off white head. Aroma is a nice floral sweetness; Flavors are yeast, floral hops, candied sugar, malt, dark fruits, light earthiness - mild bitterness, mouthfeel is a little chewy. This brew masks the alcohol content fairly well - Nice brew.
"
1," Gravity at Reading beer festival 2006. Not keen. Starts watery, ends sour and slightly off. Thin too.
"
1," Lovely aroma! Sweet & fruity, yeasty, spicey, theres everything in there. It might just be me but I get a berry aroma too (raspberries??). Great long lasted sudsy beige head. Dark red-brown colour, clear when held to a light. Light carbonation visible. Initial taste of sweet and slightly sour fruits (berrys? raisins?), followed by a lovely spicey yeasty taste. Slight biterness to it, not sure if its due to burnt grains or heavy(ish) hopping, cant really tell. Alcohol *very* well disguised, though beer is served at around 15 degrees. Slightly flowery hop aftertaste present too. So many subtle flavours. Lovely smooth mouthfeel, fairly full, but thinner than you expect. A real winner IMO.
"
1," Now I have to say right up front that I am extemely biased when I say that thi sis my favorite beer ever ( so far). My 10th Class Reunin was this past wekend and after a long evening of dancing and drinking we ended up at a friends house for, what else, more drinking. Guests were handed bottles of Sam Addams and Pete's somethin'-or-other and then this wonderful man who I hadn't sen in 7 years brings out a bottle of Chimay!!!!!!	Glorio day! Of course noone else in the place could appreciate the earthy and subtle complexities of JUST the aroma of this beer. ""Hey, man. That's Skunked!"" Fools. DE-licious. Dark and sweet, earthy and fruity. A fine balance between the hops and malt. Truly a fine end to a wonderful night. I would reccomend this over champagne at almost any occasion, if you have the kind of friends that will appreciate it.
"
1," First let me say that I didnt care for the beer being served in a chilled glass but I let that slide. The owner Tom is really cool and told me a bit about his love of beer. I was kind of shocked to find that he is so anti ratebeer.com oh well, the guy could do well if he just accepted the fact that anything served to the public will be critized and talked about. Anyway this poured from the tap like you typical IPA orange look to it with a light orange head. Aroma is unfortunatley killed because of serving the beer in a chilled glass but I can pick up a light sweetness and hops. Let the beer warm for a good 15 minutes on purpose. Finally upon sip the beer was very sweet I thought for an IPA. Not bad at all just very sweet. The malts obviously went crazy in this brew and the hops seem to just barley balance it all out. However I will say that despite its sweetness it was very drinkable and actually damn good. All I could get out of the brewer is that he uses nothing but German hops which are less powerful than say Cascade or Chinook, ect. so that is why the beer is sweeter.
"
1," (swing top bottle) Slightly hazy, amber coloured hue with yeast floaties and a huge and dense foamy white head. Dusty, malty nose with citrus fruits (grape fruit). The initial slightly soapiness fades quickly. Light sweet flavour light t medium bodied with a medium, well-carbonated mouthfeel. Slightly yeasty and fruity, malt-accented taste, light toasty notes; slightly yeasty-fruity and malty finish with shy hrbal hops. Still a decent Kellerbier, but I prefer the real rural (barnyard-like) ones.
"
1," JUN 1, 2006 [magnum bottle from peckhams 04] big fruity Nose, complex, plums, backcurrants, strawberrys, yeast and a background hint of liquorice. body is excellent, finish is refreshing despite the 9% alcohol, very well disguised. brilliant stuff.
"
1," non-descript sweetness overwhelmed by sulphites. This reminded me of when my father made homemade kiwi-fruit wine when I was a kid. Im sure it will find its fans, but this didnt win anyone over in my kitchen. The whole bottle got dumped into the sink.
"
0," Bottle, courtesy of fonefan. It pours a clear, dark golden to amber body and a small, white head. The aroma is chalky and chlorine like, some fruityness. The flavor isnt much better, I had a hard time bringing myself to taste it. Medium body, What an awful beer, does the brewery really sell shit like this? 110416
"
1," JUN 7, 2003 Dark brown, almost ruby in color with a large white head. Light yeasty aroma. Flavors of butter and  dried fruits came through, with a slight alcohol warming touch.
"
1," This is my favorite Chimay.  Ive had it only twice - the first time in a big, corked bottle, the second time at the Bentwood Tavern in New Buffalo, MI.  I swear the stuff out of the big bottle poured darker and had a rockier head, with lots of lacing down the side of the glass.  The smaller bottle was poured into the glass so as not to have a head.  Dude even rolled the bottle on the table before popping the cap.  Brown in color, yeasty in aroma, some sweetness and caramel in the flavor.
"
1," Quickly diminishing head, but small bubbles continue through. Mild aroma with some slight yeast notes. Hazy reddish brown. Some sugary hints as well as some plum. A quick bite from the carbonation, but finishes nicely.  A little tamer than the blue
"
1,"  Very dark color with small head.  Overall this is a fine Trappist.
"
1," Only my second ""perfect"" beer. 750 ml. brown, corked and caged bottle. Bottled in August 2001. I've been aging it since then. Purchased fresh in September 2001 from Total Beverage for $10.99 each. Poured out a deep dark clear brown color. The cork shot out of the bottle when opened. Very effervescent carbonation, champagne like in every way. Subdued cream colored head that left more than a decent lacing in my Chimay chalice. Aromas are of fresh grape wine, slight malts, and rum soaked dried fruits. Figs, plums, and dates come to mind. Very aromatic, and very delicious.	Tastes are of dried, dark, rum soaked fruits, vinous, and oaky as well. Hops make a brief appearance in the middle, only to be overtaken by the rich, creamy malts. Very rich mouthfeel, thick, but not chewy. Rich, flavorful, and complex flavors and aromas describe this beer best. Finishes rich, creamy, and very filling.	The good monks certainly did their homework on this beer.	Absolutely fantastic. The best Belgian beer I've ever had, hands down. Aging only improves this nectar. I'm glad I waited to try this one. I'll be laying down more of this soon.
"
1," Bouteille 330 ml. 7%. Couleur ambre-brune, effervescence vive, mousse beige ple abondante. Arme de levure belges et agrumes. En bouche, fruits, levure et trs belge.....je commence  comprendre...peut-tre que la Belgique All-Star, nest pas totalement pour moi ? Dunno...Charlevoix du Qubec Dominus Vobiscum BEAUCOUP plus gouteuse. En tk............
"
1," Pours a dark clear yellow, swirly filmy head.  Bananas, yeast, grapes, and raisins in the aroma. Full body flavor, with a sour to bitter well balanced finish. I also get some hearty grains and lemon zest. Very drinkable and enjoyable beer.
"
1," Aroma is spices and fruits. Poured into snifter, dark brown color, one finger head that faded quickly. Not much lacing. Flavor is spices, cinnamon, raisons, and a hint of banana. Texture is medium but a little to much carbonation. Smooth, no alcohol present in the taste. Over all a very enjoyable beer.
"
1," Poured from the tap at Big River to a golden-reddish color with medium thick off white head that lingered to mid-glass and left good lacing. Nose was the expected hoppy citrus (grapefruit) but with a pronounced presence of malty earth scents. Mouthfeel was full and tingly, but again slightly offset by malty sweetness. The bittersweet hops and malts combinred for a pleasing taste, and the finish was long and enjoyable.
"
1," Orange with big, foamy off-white head / Light, fragrant nose of banana, yeast, and spice / Medium body, crisp and lively, but with good malts underneath and excellent, bitter finish / Flavors of banana, orange, apple, clove, and coriander / Pretty much a textbook tripel.
"
1," Nice thick golden appearence, but brew was slightly hot and thin. Nice citrus hops, but slightly over-carbonated. Tasty treat but doesnt allow you to retain it. however, its still worth every drop.
"
1, Odeur dagrumes avec une pointe dpices. Apparence
1," Cask at GBBF08. OK malty aroma. Clear brown colour. Almost no head. The flavour is quite caramelly. Does not taste its ABV until the finish where the alcohol burns a bit.
"
1," murky and filthy with bits of yeast swimming around. i love it. not as dry as the Blanche but a bit smoother. the taste is a bit fruity.
"
1," Draught at Frederikshavn l- og vinfestival 07. Cloudy chestnut colour. Weak banana flavour, slightly roasted and slightly sour. A little thin.
"
1," Nice strong hoppy flavor. Pours a nice dark citrus colour, along with a good fresh aroma. Not too much bad to say with particular type, go out and buy one you hop-heads!
"
1," 75 cl bottle, Shelburne. Dark brown pour with orange highlights. Thin head that clings to the sides. Spice and fruit aroma. Very effervescent. Sweet upfront that fades to bitterness.
"
1," Pours cloudy brown with healthy tan half inch head that lasts.  Aroma is sweet with an alcohol bite.  Taste is full with hints of cinnamon, malt, and heavy yeast.  Creamy head makes the swallow smooth, but there is definitely an alcoholic taste underneath it all.  This is not bad, but is not my favorite Chimay.
"
1," Got a bottle of this for my friend Jeffs B-day. Strong beer but hides the ABV very well. Almost a champagne hint to this brew. Overall Outstanding!
"
1," Nice brownish red color with a moderately sized head, tasty beer but not nearly as good as the blue cap.
"
1," Small bottle, poured in to an actual Chimay goblet [ ! ] Pours a turgid reddish-brown with a big fizzt off-white head that disaptaes quickly. Nose of malt, spices, orange, fruit. Creamy, almost silky mouthfeel. Lots of sweet malt, plus the fruity flavors from the nose. Alcohol in back. Somewhat fizzy but it works well with this beer. Somewhere up above my Belgian-born mother is saying ""well, its about time you drank a good beer!"".
"
1," Hazy dark brown hue, with a frothy beige head, yeasty, toasted malt nose, with dark dried fruits accent of plums, raisins, dates, but when the beer gets warmer a passion fruity note came out, with a spicy flowery lavender accent, brown sugar and a hint od spiciness in the aroma follows through on a medium-bodied palate with a crisp sweet toasted, caramelized malt character, with a spicy accent, fruity notes of prunes,dates and raisins, with brown sugar, leading towards a sweet fruity, malty, and warmth alcoholic finish.
"
1," Bottled 75 cl.. Bottled. Very Hazy brownish colour eith beige bubbly head. Sweet toffeeish plummy aroma. Sweet caramelly flavour. Alcohol is well hidden.
"
1," Reminded me more of a champagne then a beer upon opening.  Served at room temperture, and it had terrific flavor.  But there was a noticable alcohol aftertaste.  Nice long lasting head, with a nice appearance.  Great initial sip, but that alcohol aftertaste bothered me.
"
1," A very nice Chimay, even though its unspectacular. Nice aroma and palate. Not as bubbly as the Bleu, and therefore more easily drunk.
"
1," Pours a clouldy dark brown.  Aroma is yeast with dark fruits.  Taste is terrific with a warm sensation coating your tongue and palate, which one might right away correlate with the 9% alcohol, but it is the one of kind carbornation of trappistes have that balances the alcohol while bringing out the full flavor of the beer.  Just another wonderful trappistes.
"
1," Bottled 750ml. Murky Orange brown. Tan head, never disappearing. Aroma is citrus and salt water, caramel, yeast, fruits (specifically apples and banana), alcohol, and chocolate. Flavor is yeasty and apple/cider fruity, booze, roasted chocolate. Ends clean and delicate and inexplicably floral; always lacy.
"
1," On tap in Nashville.  A nice red color.  Smooth mouthfeel with a light hoppyness and an additional citrus bite to it.  It had that same metallic aftertaste that all of their beers had tonight.  When the bartender foudn out I was on Ratebeer, he brought out an additional sampler  of this from ""the engine"" instead of the tap.  That second sampler was much nicer, with a hugely smoother and creamier quality, and none of that metallic taste.
"
1," Third of the big party bottles Ive had. I dont like what this ale leaves on my breath. Is that the finish or the after-finish? Aroma is a little bit stale--by intent, I conjecture. Either way its probably the worst I have to say about it. Dont have a clue what this style is supposed to be like, but this is a very woody, earthy beer. Very brown, foamy and persistent head. Nuttiness dominates. Oaky. Slight smoke. Not really bitter. Mild carbonation. Not too bad, but not worth the price, I decide.
"
1," This brew is a bit on the sweet side for my taste.  Some roasted flavors, not much nose.  Big molassas sweetness up front eventually yielding to a roasted finish.  Bold, dark color for a brown with little or no head.
"
1," Reddish colour with white head. Lively aroma of citrus. Taste is bitter, pine, citrus, with a kind of sweet aftertaste. A credible IPA.
"
1," Fredagsbaren p Biologi, Aarhus	Bottled	Red colour	Yeast-fruity notes	Well hopped
"
1," (33cl bottle) The nose is full of yeast and dough that wets the appetite. Upon my pour the beer produced a lovely head, but the head quickly dissipated. The palate is full flavored and refreshingly carbonated. Much of the flavors seem to be either apple or pear. The hops are slightly spice, but restrained. The finish is long sweet and full of rich candi sugar flavors.
"
1," Pours an opaque deep brown.  Aroma of malt, raisins and brown sugar but not strong.  Great bubbly mouthfeel, well done, with a minerally flavour.  Irony.  Enjoyable, but not overwhelming.
"
1," toffee, yeast, caramel,  plums and raisins. It has a somewhat weak mouthfeel, and lacks complexity. Its not bad though.
"
1," Bomber. Pale dull ochre yellow. Stable head. Lively carbonation. Lots of rising bubbles. Aroma is surprisingly not artificial. Smells more like wit than coconut with lots of sweet yeast and vanilla cake, is very refreshing on the tongue. Light and lively. The finish is very nice and toasty although I dont get coconut. Pretty dry but finishes a little sweet and sticky. Its thin but really not that bad and I appreciate the restraint on the coconut, in fact, its got none to speak of, which means that it doesnt have the artificial flavoring or aromas I was expecting. I think its pretty nice even if not the mosti sophisticated beer on the world.
"
1," On tap at Alt Platz served in 6oz glasses. Dark dark amber in color with a thick beige head. Aroma was full of spices (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, etc) everything youd expect in pumpkin pie and lots of pumpkin aroma. Flavor did not disappoint, it was like drinking liquid pumpkin pie. This was by far the best pumpkin beer Ive had.
"
1," Bottle. I think I got an old bottle because there were some floaties and sediment that were suspended after the pour. Other than that, this was damn tasty. Nose is malty and gives off some nice light fruity accents. Flavor is very smooth and malty with flavors of some dark fruits, maybe a little molasses flavor, and low bitterness.
"
1," Bouteille de 750 ml Dgust avec french tickler et Agaguk. Bire de couleur brune brumeuse avec un moyen collet tres collant. Arome de sucre, tres fruit, bananes et un soupon de vanille. Gout de sucre brun, vanille et bananes qui revient.
"
1," Best Belgium Ale I have had! 	appearence, pretty medium amber hue, white foamy head	aroma, Flora and sweet, slight carmel notes	taste Belgium yeast comes out, strong malt profiles, lots of bubbles	overall my Third favorite beer, I only have bought in 25.5 ozer size, oops i take that back I first tried it in the 11.2 ozer, anyway big thuumbs up!
"
1," Dunkelgetreidiger Beginn, etwas nach Roggen. Darin ist auch die leichte Herbe untergebracht, die das Grundaroma aber schon komplettiert. Das Bier bietet dabei kaum Abwechslung, was halb so wild wre, wrde das Aroma nicht schnell milder werden. So ist nur dieSffigkeit positiv herauszustellen. Die dunklen Getreidenoten bleiben noch eine Zeit lang in abgeschwchter Form erhalten. Im Abgang kommt noch eine geringe Bitterkeit hinzu. 7/8/8/7/6/8
"
1," (bottle) cloudy brownish colour with medium tan head; initial aroma of reminiscent of champagne, then bit of  caramel, dried plums; balanced flavour, well hidden alcohol; very competent but I would not rave about it
"
1," 330 mL bottle in a Chimay glass of course...  Finally finishing out the Chimay trifecta until I make it over to the brewery.  Although, this is the first of the three I have had, it has been almost 9 years since the last time I had one.  Hazy amber pour with a medium head.  Malty caramel and fruit aroma.  Rich fruity flavors with a nice hop balance.  Still as good as I remember from the first time.
"
1," On tap at the Springfield, PA location. Poured a deep and cloudy orange (almost a copper) color with a small sized off white head. Aromas or oranges and all around citric. Tastes of oranges, light caramel and a very light grapefruit finish. I too would not believe the 80+ IBUs - I found this one to have a very light bitterness with a medium sweetness to it. Light lacing left on the glass.
"
1," Cascade-accented, and well balanced.  I would put it ahead of Anchor myself, but I dont have any illusions about converting the masses on that one.
"
1," Ok, definitely better oatmeal stouts out there.  I was little let down after having Barley Islands Java stout which was amazing.  Has a normal oatmeal stout flavor, but the aftertaste is rather metallic.
"
1," Bottle courtesy of Doodler (thanks Scott) poured a clear reddish brown with a lasting tanhead. Aromas ofcocoa, carmel, nuts, toasted malt and light earthiness. Palate wasmedium bodied and smooth. Flavors of cocoa, carmel and light earthiness with a smooth malty finish.
"
1," Getting notebook online. Bottle. Lots of yeast flavors. Some hopy flowers as well. A bit too much Belgium yeast for my taste. I am aging some more to compare.
"
1," i think that i drink Grand reserve 2008 on Chimay party we have in Sibenik before few days ... this is strong beer and i drink to many different beer ... this beer is for drinking only one with some food ...
"
1," Draft at brewpub. Murky mahogany-brown with a thick tan head. Looks meaty. Smells meaty/gamey too. Some phenols, with earthy minerals in the nose too. In spite of the flaws, actually does not smell so bad. Has a great palate and the flavors are actually quite nice. Off-dry finish, and a higher ABV works by mellowing what could have been too many residual sugars. Its a pretty nourishing but strange brew.
"
1," Understated, and probably would have gone really well with dinner. Dark brown, or perhaps copper. Tasty, grainy flavors and an ever-so-slight hop finish.
"
1," 12oz bottle from the Hop Shop.  Pours black with a fair tan head that stays a bit and leaves some lace.  Aromas of dark chocolate, some coffee, and some roasted and burnt malts.  Flavor is quite burnt with good roasted malts, dark chocolate, and some slight caramel flavors around the edges.  Interestingly roasty throughout.  Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and a dry finish.
"
1," I enjoyed this one the most out of the other Big River Grille brews.  It has a fantastic nutty flavor that lingered just enough to make you want to keep drinking.  I found this to be fully balanced and enjoyable till the last drop.
"
1," Very nice.  I think of it as a cross between the maltiness of the red, with the crispness and alcohol presence of the White.  Little off-white head.  Peach aromas.  Lively, well-balanced with a toffee and plum finish.
"
1," Pours dark with red tones.  Aroma is musty with sweet malt and yeast smells.  Taste is malty and sweet with a spicy alcohol finish.  Great beer.
"
1," Pours a really nice ruby and mohagany with a large, sticky and solid head. Lotso of carbonation to it. Scents and flavors of bakers chocolate, raisins, kurants, and of course a high amount of alcohol. This beer is a sipper and is meant to be drunk slowly.	The best dark trappist !
"
1," Bottle. Dark brown with a minimal head.  Berries and the typical belgian trappist taste. Not Bad.
"
1," bottle, via trade with koelschtrinker, hazy light brown with huge foam, sweet fruity aroma, flavors are stewing fruits and a wheaty, grainy finish
"
1," Nice white frothy head with sediment floating in the glass. Amber/orange color. Smells and tastes very hoppy and very bitter at the end. Pretty good stuff.
"
1," Pale golden with little head. Very bland hay/straw aroma along the lines of a macro. Goes down easy enough. Sweet, very, could become cloying, the stickiness is annoying.
"
1," A pleasant find at the local beer shop. Nice hoppy taste that sticks with you after the swallow. A nice well crafted american IPA.
"
1," Bottle pours murky brown with a tan head. Aroma is fruity and somewhat spicy, showing notes of apricot, fig, banana, cocoa, and clove.  Flavor shows the same with the bread/caramel influence begining to show and providing the underlying malt influence.  Overall body is light to moderate.
"
1," Pours copper with a beige head. Aroma is roasted caramel and light dried fruit. Flavour is caramel, roasted notes and dried fruit.
"
1," Pours a hazy red/brown, with an initially giant head that is mostly white. Fruity smell methinks. Somewhat sweet, caramel and raisins are abound. Somewhat bitter and leaves the drinker with a sort of dry and champagne aftertaste. There is a sort of apple/pear taste in it as well. Not sure which one actually. Pretty sugary, a pretty good slow drinker I would say.
"
1," MAR 3, 2005 Very nice fruity Belgium. Ive actually only had it on tap never in a bottle. All flavors are evenly weighted of fruits and malt.
"
1," Deep copper colored and slightly ruby at the edges. There is also a long lasting head with a light khaki color. The nose has some strong grapefruit along with crystal malt type character. There is some toffee and a little bit of glazed donut. The taste has some strong grapefruit with some sweet hints. The finish is dry and woody with a little bit of grass. This starts out nice, but the finish is just ok, I would like a sweeter balance. Decent.
"
1," Bottle, huge thanks to yespr for sharing.	Clear golden coloured with no head.	Sweet aroma of apples, apple wine and almonds with notes of honey.	Sweet and fruity flavour of apples and apple core with an acidic touch.	Tart finish of apples.	Nice.
"
1," 22ozer from Khans on Keystone. Pours a clear brown with  abit of tan foamy head. Nose is dominated by the barrel aging giving it a one-sided aroma. It was nice tho as there were some underlying notes of toffee and chocolate just not upfront and personal.
"
1," Hazy brown with off white head.  Particles floating towards the bottom.  Spicy aroma with wheaty qualities.  Interesting.  Flavor is banana, clove cocoa, very good.  Has some Hefeweizen qualities to it.  Not quite to the level of Rochefort Trappistes 10 but one of my more favorite in the belgian style.  Also got the White, so wel see how that one stacks up next.
"
1," JAN 7, 2003 Bottled(2000ml). -honey-yellow colored, strange aroma(very near that this could be buttery aroma), nice head, because of 2000ml bottle the beer is getting warm and bad
"
1," Released at BI Barrel Fest 11/23/2007  cask tulip - Aroma is soft bubblegum, spice, subtle oak, vanilla and yeasty bread.  Pours black with a small creamy off-white head and great lacing.  Flavor matches aroma with a stronger oak and vanilla finish.  Palate is dry, sticky but finishes smooth.  The barrel aging does not overpower the base beer.  A nice improvement on a good brew.   side-by-side with non-cask version - The extra carbonation brings out a bit more of the oakiness but loses the smooth finish.
"
1," A dark, ruby red ale with a large off-white head, superb carbonation and excellent lacing.  I sampled the 33CL bottle.  This ale essentially is dry from start to finish, with a nicely balanced alcohol taste.  I enjoyed it immensely.  Theres a hint of sweetness up front, and its complex aroma hints of bready yeast, clove and, perhaps, anise.  It is complex, well-balancedeven delicate.  The initial palate is lemon, clove, anise and roasted malt.  This is a high ABV ale, but it is smooth and it does overwhelm the senses.  Truly, a classic by any standard.
"
1," On tap. A deep amber pour with an off white head and a creamy lace. A toastem malt flavor as well as a sweet maltiness. A lite ltie bitter finish and a decent mouthfeel make this a very pleasant brew.
"
1," roasty, hully, this is weird, an appreciable attempt at balance, mild fruit, this one goes many places it shouldnt. a gold at GABF? this is NTS!
"
1," Not my kind of beer. A bit sweet and hoppy.
"
1," Good stuff.  Coppery color, with a large head.  It had a subtle light fruity taste that flowed like silk while being quaffed.
"
1," bottle. Clear golden-amber colour, large head. Malty and slightly sweet with hints of herbs and marzipane. Slightly fruity.
"
1," bottle from Bierzwerg. Cloudy brown colour, mid-sized head. Malty with hints of caramel and cocoa, also plastic and onion.
"
1," MAR 15, 2009 33 cl bottle - Dark brown unclear beer with a nice head. Aroma is filled with fruits, dried fruits, prunes and yeast. The beer has a widely ranged, heavy flavor, with a fullness thats hard to beat. Flavors include Chocolate, sweet dried fruits, toffee and spices. Goes extremely well with the strongest of food flavors. Nice and rugged bitterness makes for a good late feel. 		75 cl Grand Reserve 2001 - Aroma is malty and slightly vinous with hints of cork(?), ripe fruits and nuts. Flavor is also vinous with notes of yeast, raisins and lots of fruits! Very nice beer, the beer has really softened through the years and become very vinous, though not in a negative sense.
"
1," From the tap poured brown with a good amount of head.  Nice flavor sweet with a lasting finish.
"
1," An excellent strong with a good kick, however I enjoyed the Chimay Rouge somewhat better.  Gotta give this the marks for appearance and velvet palate.  The aroma was more or less a standard Belgian aroma, with perhaps a bit of phenolic in the profile.  Tart, dry, alcoholic.  Some butterscotch tones.
"
1," One of my favorites.
"
1," 500ml swing top bottle, courtesy harrisoni. Best before 22 November 2008. Mid gold with a slight haze. Slightly malty and biscuity with a quite low hop profile. Clean but fairly soft in the mouthfeel not particularly inspiring. I prefer a little more hoppy bite in German pilsners. Slightly past its best before date so perhaps it might be a bit crisper when fresh.
"
1," A good Belgian. Doesnt taste strong at all. Only real defect is overcarbonation.
"
1," Bottle at Remedy Cafe in Edmonton.	Pours a rich bright brown, with a light fluffy head. Spices in the nose, usual to belgian ales, but there is a rich sweetness that is not generally found in trippels or strong ales. Taste is a meld of light and dark fruits with spices, such as cloves. Mouthfeel is medium with a nice carbonation - all of which suits the flavours well. Finish is very smooth, not bitter or acidic. Quite a nice beer, dont know if this style is my favorite, but this beer pulls it off well.
"
1," 650mL bottle, split 4 ways, pours a hazy golden yellow with a small white head. Aroma of lemon peel, light coconut, and wheat. Flavour of coriander, coconut and lemon peel. Watery and lacking in complexity. Not good at all.
"
1," Bottle thanks to thirdeye11. Notes of citrus, earth, body odor, poop, and sweat. So basically a nursing home.
"
1," 75cl bottle, tasted blind in a flight of 8 dubbels(this turned out to be the second beer of the tasting).  Reddish/brown color, bubbly head.  Very carbonated, very thin & dry.  Earthy(reminds me of seawater somehow) very muted aroma...maybe a little peppery.  very dry, and a bit of roughness in the finish...body is almost non-existant...slight fruitiness shows up here and there, but this really lacks any redeeming character.
"
1," Pleasant leathery brown color, little head. Foamy palate. Tastes a bit stale and metallic. Yeasty aftertaste.
"
1," On tap from Silverton Brew Co. Coal black pour with a thin head.  nice malty flavor with just a touch of roast malt.  Alcohol not overpowering in spite of being 10%.  There was a vinegar tartness at the finish.  I asked the waiter about this and he said it was because of the molasses used in the brewing.  OK, the tartness was not objectionable.
"
1,"  Aroma of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, oats, and some cream.  No hint of whiskey barrel aging.  Poured black in color with a small brown head that diminished but lasted around the edges.  Opaque.  Slightly sparkling.  Flavor is light to medium sweet and slightly bitter.  Tastes of coffee, roasted malts, chocolate, slight sugar, light lactose, and a hint of vanilla.  Again, NO bourbon whiskey flavor.  Medium body.  Lightly chalky texture is a bit thin.  Coffee, roasted malt, and lactose finish is slightly dry.
"
1," JAN 16, 2009 11.2 ounce bottle poured into a Chimay chalice. Dark brown with a very thick head that left a layer of foam throughout.	Aroma of cherries and plums, but neither is very strong. Flavor is consistent with the aroma, but stronger, with a sense of alcohol that makes this a great tasting drink. Medium to full body with very lively carbonation. Truly a great beer, one that will make me fabricate ""special occasions"" to have another.
"
1," an outstanding belgian strong ale. Did not notice any oveerwhelming alcohol,  it seemed to be masked nicely.  Mallt rather than hop and  a nice yeast factor

1," Pours a dark amber color with a medium off-white head. Thin lacing. This brew has a heady hops aroma which surprised me a little. There was also some malt which was not so much of a surprise. Medium bodied, and very hoppy for an amber which was a nice change of pace from what most Ambers seem to offer. There is also a nice finish that produces some hops and citrus on the tongue where previously there was none.
"
1," August 10 2005 in the pub of Sligachan Hotel, Sligachan, Isle of Skye, Scotland. Draught. Its a warm amber beer with a weak head. The aroma has notes of caramel and fruit and the flavour has notes of malt, caramel, light fruit, aroma hops and the finish is dry and lightly bitter.
"
1," Cask, The Phoenix, Inverness. Dark copper, lovely buttercream pale yellow head, fine and densea very pretty pint. Malt loaf and blackberry aroma, gently bell-toned. Exceedingly young tasting. Soft and sweet in a cream way, rather than a sugar way. As a young unpolished ale it has some charming points, but along the lines of taking a sip from the fermenter for interests sake, rather than something youd want by the pint.
"
1," bottle - Pours burgundy with a moderately sized head.  It has a light malty aroma and a good caramel malt flavor.  This is a simple, straightforward brown ale thats a little too thin and could really use more character.  Not bad.
"
1," I holded off on rating this for a long time...but I just shared two bottles last night at a French Bistro.  Pours a kinds of swamp bog brown and gives relatively little head for a belgian (ha!).  Aroma is fairly malty and has some solid notes of dried fruit.  Taste isnt too malty but maintains a lot of the dried fruit character.  In addition, there is some alcohol and chalky yeast tastes.  The mouthfeel is incredibly light and fizzy...kind of sticky too.  I know its not the best belgian and certainly not the best trappsist out there, but I think it is still worth the bucks...at least it made the meal better.
"
1," Light orange color.  Citrusy hop aroma and body, smooth.  Very bitter palate.  Sweet backgroud.  Finishes smooth and long.  Nice, similar but a bit better than that Narwhal.
"
1," Sweet caramel ramparts impart appreciable roastiness...They protect the nascent apples and almonds within...A glimpse of interest slowly returns to indifference...
"
1," And orange beer leaning towards amber with a powerful head. Aroma is full of tropical fruits and herbs. Rich in flavor where one picks up hints of pineapple, passion fruit and more herbs. Bitterness blends in well towards the end. Perhaps slightly too large late bitterness for me to give it a better score.
"
1," Pours a murky dark amber color with a thick, foamy, off-white head. Aroma is quite alcoholic, but not overwhelmingly so. There is some baked bread, some faint fruit notes, and some roasted malt. Flavor is quite warming, round and complete. Slightly sweet, delicately bitter. Well balanced. Creamy mouthfeel and the perfect amount of carbonation. Great beer.
"
1," 4 oz draft serving at brewpub. Pours a pale yellow with a small head. Aroma is very mild wheat and barely detectable citrus and spices. Taste is below average generic wheat. Very generic wheat beer flavor. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side for a wheat. Not anything I would like to drink on a regular basis.
"
1," JAN 10, 2012 Sampled from a rather attractive 11.2 oz brown bottle this brew pours a murky dark brown color that turns to red when held to the light. There is a large light tan head. The aroma is sour, tart and  fruity with notes of cherry, berry and caramel. The flavor is strongly sweet and sugary with sour malts, ripe black cherries, berries, notable caramel and faint hints of must and nutmeg. The finish was long, fruity and tart. Fairly thick body. Excellent.
"
1," Bottle 33 cl. Poured brown in colour with thick  creamy tan head. Nice appearance. Lots of dried black fruits as dadels and plums in aroma. Some pleasant sweetness also in form of brown sugar. Has to be one of the more perfect aroma so far. Leaves a nice, albeit quite quickly fading lacing on the glass. Flavour is malty sweet at first. Then in comes plums, raisins, brown sugar and some light  spices as well. Very much going on here. Also some dough in the flavour. Very pleasant sweet and dark fruits mixed with some spices and even a slightly nutty aftertaste.
"
1," Bottle.  Nice beer although hardly an attempt to regurgitate a Hoegaarden verbatim.  Id hold this against them if they advertised this as a Wit -- but they dont (its just Ratebeers classification).		A little darker than a true Wit but with nice, prominent foam.  Flavors are lightly citrus spiced like a wit but very malty/bready.  Sort of a bready witbier.  Interesting choice and well-crafted.  I liked it!
"
1," Bottle courtesy of stfun.  Pours dark brown with a dissipating white head.  Smells of tea, some caramel, hints of nuttiness.  Tastes of chocolate, some spice, molasses, fruity hints, earthy.  Interesting.
"
1," 330ml bottle. Pours a cloudy a hazy copper/amber (fresh bottle so guess the yeast didnt have time to settle to the bottom) with a finger of head that quickly disappears leaving almost no lacing. Aroma is overwhelmingly belgian yeast and delicious, reminding me of dough rising. Smooth, light and bubbly in the mouth with a floral and hoppy hints mixed in with the big bold yeast and sweat taste.
"
1," Nose has notes of caramel malts, floral hops, light tropical fruit, a hint of iced tea, and light citrus. Pours copper with a nice frothy white head and sticky lace. The flavor has notes of caramel, iced tea, tropical fruit, citrus and a pleasant floral finish. Nice and dry, light sticky resins. Well made.
"
1," 650ml brown bottle. Golden colour, clear. good sized fluffy white head. Sporadic lacing. Hoppy nose, grass, grapefruit, slight cannabis. Big burst of hops in the mouth, orange peels, grapefruits, grass notes. Long bitter finish with lasting grapefruit. Body is on the lighter side with decent strong carbonation. Nice job, tasty hops.
"
1," The color is incredible and the light passing through it is very light at the top, very dark at the bottom.  I dont get the fruity taste that the commercial description mentions; I get a caramel smell...actually, fruit is the last thing I smell here so I dont know where that comes from.  it has a medium bitter taste and I love the big bottle...tasty
"
1," grey wax dipped 12 oz bottle. pours a dark ruby red with a very small quicky diminishing beige head.  alcohol, cough syrup, dark fruits, carmamel.  sticky lip feel. like an easy drinking port.  pretty tasty
"
1," The body was an excellent deep brown, slightly hazy and had a sea-foam head. Aromas were pungent of fig, raisins, yeast, chocolate and alcohol. The flavor was great, full of dark fruits with alcohol with a smooth mouth feel. Finishes warm, spicy and satisfyingly sweet.
"
1," pours slightly cloudy tinted brown with a very small head, small CO2, ringed retention, and runny lacing. Coffee crisp on the nose (interesting!) and malted caramel. Muddled black pepper mixed with very mild and faint lime up front, roughness on the roof of the mouth, unclean short finish, thin-bodied with no carry. Low complexity, low depth, low length. One-note and quite uninspiring. The pepper isnt firey or aromatic nor is the lime.
"
1," Wheaty, citrus aroma.  Cloudy yellow with pale thin head.  Wheat, farily tart and oaky flavour notes.  Fairly smooth, but sour.
"
1," just as good as the bleu
"
1," Hey Hey its Chimay.I have had this before and seems to be better everytime I drink it.Fruit, Spices some nuts and alcohol is what i get from this.This is a wonderful brew that finishes clean.
"
1," Pretty good stuff has a lot of bite.  Pours a dark brown.  Pretty tasty. The Monks must know what they are doing.
"
1," JUN 26, 2009 Sampled from bottle on 10/25/2006 at the Junedale Beer Klub meeting...  	Murky dark amber color.  Huge brown head and lots of lacing.  Rich caramel malt and roasted fruit in the aroma and flavor.  Finish is a little dry with some alcohol notes showing.  Warming finish.  A wonderful brew that deserves to be sipped and enjoyed slowly.  Rating"
1," Really a fine ale. Very different than most abby ales I have tried. Seemed to come on stronger as I got further down the bottle. The bleu is not available in my neck of the woods but I will look for it on my travels as many ratings here deem it even better.
"
1," NOV 6, 2003 humungus frothy head that keeps growing for about 3 minutes after it is poured. cloudy brown to black. fruity, malt, smokey and wine like aroma. a tiny bit of chocolate taste, alcohol flavour, quite fruity and a little bit smoked. a bit sour, a little bit bitter. it gets better towards the end. i'm not to fond of these high alcohol ales.
"
1," The best beer there is. If I could only have one beer for the rest of my life, this would be it	Well i lie	But this is one of the beer
"
1," Amber and bright.  The aroma is gingers and mildly spicy. Thin, messy with bland amber and a bunch of incoherent spices.  Boring.
"
1," 33 cL bottle. Pours hazy brown/amber with a light brown, slight crispy and lasting head. Caramel malty sweet aroma with clear yeast traces. Sweet caramel and almost breadlike flavoured into the finish. Yeast does give the beer some more complex notes, but it is still my least favourite chimay. Good but not as good as the other 2.
"
1," Draught at 11th Southern Brewers Festival in Chattanooga.  Pours black with caramel brown hints at the extreme edges of the beer where light begs to pass through.  Dark roasted coffee bean aroma hits you like a freshly roasted cup of coffee and then some sweet caramel malt notes pass by your nose long enough to doubt that coffee is the only ingredient.  Carbonated coffee flavor is well balanced with a caramel to toffee flavor and very low acidity.  Dark and thin, almost watery palate, silky smooth.
"
1," the waitress said this was like a bid or miller light.  she was right.  of course i equate someone saying that with ""dont bother, this is beer flavored water.""  and like i said she was right.
"
1," Amber in colour with a thin head.Not much for the nose but save for a few hops. The flavour is o.k. refreshingly bitter some orange, an average beer.
"
1," Springfield... Poured a hazy copper color with a medium sized, off white head that left spotty lacing on the glass.  Aroma of yeast, dried fruits, clove, banana, and cherries, with light roastiness.  Aroma was very dubbelish.  Herbal taste of dark fruits, yeast and alcohol was barely noticed.  Slick mouthfeel.  Could have been more flavorful.
"
1," FEB 17, 2003 As all Chimay's I loved them. This ale is great!
"
1," Young bottle.  Sweetly malty nose with a little roast, light mineral water and candi sugar yeasty notes.  Dark ruby-mahogany pour does not let light through.  Sudsy off-white head.  Taste is sugary, yeasty, and richly malty, though a little one-dimensional; ends up drying off quite a bit, faint light fruit and air.  Medium body, lightly bitter.  For its relative blandness, this is still very balanced and composed, and the flavors have had some time to mature and mesh together.
"
1," JUL 24, 2005 (375ml bottle) Purchased at the SAQ at Atwater Market, Montreal. Pours a clean oily golden body. The nose if very sweet and sharp. Very viscous.  Flavour is sweet, tart apples with a maple hint. Good.
"
1," Pours brown with a full light brown head.  Rich aroma most strongly characterized by raisins and yeast.	A smooth beer with pleasing flavor of raisins, yeast, an underlying tartness, and a mild bit of alcohol. Leaves a light lingering taste of roasted malt and fruit.
"
1," belgium at its finest.  very sweet, perfect sipper.
"
1," Pours black.  Fine brown head.  Chocolately aroma.  Palate seemed a bit thin for a stout.  Slightly bitter flavor of coffee.
"
1," This is the most interesting of the Chimay beers,  very smooth.	pleasing bittersweet aftertaste.	the most complex of the chimay beers.
"
1," This was always the crapper of the Hagars lineup, but its gone straight up macro since Howe Sound took over.  Light straw colour.  Grainy aroma with doughy yeast note and ultra bland hops.  I doubt theyre using teutonic nor slavic varieties anymore.  Probably more like Willamette or something equally flavorless, and in miniscule quantities.
"
1," got it from the 207th street  beer distributor.  this might be the hardest beer for me to drink, but im forced to cause i paid 7 bucks for it and im not gonna throw it down the drain even though id like to. it has a light head that dissapears in a minute a watered down dark brown color.  id rather take it back to when i was 15 and drink olde english.
"
1," JAN 3, 2008 Re-rate 1/3/08"
1," Bottle. Clear, medium amber, short-lived white cap, no lace. Aroma is dominated by tangerine skin with underlying cereal. Flavour is bitter orange peel and weak caramel malt. Finish is brief, bitterness is low.
"
1," OCT 26, 2006 Bottle. Pours a rich dark brown with a big frothy head. Taste was of a smooth lite fruity flavor with a wisp of alcohol. As I drank it the other parade of flavors developed and brought a smile to my face. What a wonderful beer! Will definately be drinking more of this!
"
1," Pours a murky brown colored body with a slight reddish hue. Finger-width, creamy and frothy, tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is fruity with some nice caramels and deeper toffees. A good amount of plums and raisins, but there is also a nice citric, apricot, grape fruitiness similar to the Red. Yeasty with a light spice and just a hint of rum-like alcohol. Flavor is similar. Fairly full malty sweetness with a nice toffee and caramel. Deeper fruits, mainly plums and raisin stand out a bit more than the citric, apricot, and grape flavors from the aroma. Lots of yeast with a light spice and I get a faint roast as well. Finishes complex and fairly dry with a light bitterness as the alcohol presents itself with a light, but pleasing warmth. Aftertaste lingers for a moderate duration. Medium body with a creamy carbonation. Overall, my favorite of the three offered by Chimay. Complex and well balanced. Fruity, malty, yeasty, and a nice kick at the end make this quite enjoyable.
"
1," Chocolate sweetness; low roast.  Appears a dark, dark mahogoney but tinges of garnet.  Chocolate and molasses start and leave a slightly sweet finish.  Medium-heavy body.  A good porter; less smoke and more chocolate flavor.
"
1," Muddy red. Off white head. Slightly gamy aroma with yeast, spice, some citrus. Good body with some sweetness. Rich and lucious with some fruit and I get a hint of sarsparilla. Overall, very good, but not as complex as some.
"
1," Nice black in color with big creamy tan head. Nose of mostly coffee with roasted malt. Smooth and bitter.
"
1," I had the 2001 and 2003 versions. I liked the 2001 version much better. It was a little oxidized, tasted like cardboard,  but it was very good. Can't really tell. Some vanilla notes to it. Brown and red in color. Excellent beer. Gentle aroma. Fruity.  Excellent brew.
"
1," 12 ounce bottle shared by CrellMOset. Thanks! Pours a deep red color wioth a medium head. Poor head retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel, candi sugar, pear and other fruit notes. Taste is assertive hops, huge malts, including brown sugar and toffee, as well as raisin and other dark fruits. Very sticky texture. Medium bodied.
"
1," JUN 10, 2009 My favorite of the Chimays. Not too strong (like the Blue) but still with most of the complex character. Been having one of these every so often for 20+ years. Always a winner.
"
1," Fantastic Belgian beer!!  It is all about the perfect balance.  Fizzy, but not overly so.  A darker beer which is slightly sweet, surprisingly light, and very easy to drink.  A very very solid beer!  I had it ice cold on a warm Summer evening and it was perfect.
"
1," This one pours a very dark, cloudy brown color with a medium sized off-white head. The aroma is strongly sweet, with hints of malts, yeast, and spices. Full bodied and very fruity, the flavor is rich with tones of yeast and spices.wonderful mouthfeel, the finish is long and sweet. TaStY!!!, quite a nice Belgian ale. Dear God, when I die, can I wake up in a vat of fine Belgian ale. I not picky, at long as it is in a vat of Westveleteren 12, Westmalle Tripel, or if I barely make it to heaven.... Chimay. promise...I will be extra good from now on....promise...really
"
1," JUN 11, 2005 Brown gold against light, with a full inch of lively off-white head.  Lacing follows as the head diminishes.  This beer is all about smell.  Elegant aromas of caramel and buttered bread approach the senses from the moment of pour.  The yeast is rich on the nose and the tongue.  Taste is enhanced by crisp alcohol and includes buttery toast malts, and some plum.  Palate is broken up by the tiny bubbles of this highly carbonated strong ale.  Overall, this is a lush beer that embodies the fundamentals of Belgian brewing.
"
1," This is a really interesting beer to rate.	Poured somewhat cold into a Chimay glass. Bottle from Total Wine.	Poured cloudy red with a small beige head with copious lacing. Smell is of bananna and yeast. Note as complex as Ive come to expect from an Abbey. The taste is incredible though with a truly awesome balance of light fruits, yeast, malt and a slight bitterness to the finish. This is how an Abbey Dubbel should be, take note Brasserie des Roc. This one is dangerously drinkable. Alchol is well hidden and the carbonation is very lively so its very easy going down.
"
1," AUG 1, 2007 Fruity aroma, wonderful foamy head.  Sweet, malty and spice flavors are overwhelming.  Finish is equally enjoyable.  I say the brewmaster at Chimay has few peers.
"
1," nose of misleadingly unchallenging lager malt.  a wave of caramel soon follows and the journey begins. flavor is strongly sweet then quickly balanced with tastefully used hops.  the tongue sizzles in their presence and belgian spice comes in the aftertaste during an exhalation of bated breath. an eternally drinkable and satisfying beer.
"
1," NOV 21, 2011 Feb, 2003 Soft as duck down and twice as tasty. The alcohol monster sneaks up on crepe soled shoes to slap you around the head after a while - but by then you dont really care. The clove has lulled and numbed and whispered and you have either succumbed or complained. A strange and interesting brew. Take off your armour and let it seduce with its perfume. A warm and attractive beer that suffers from expectation. It aint the worlds best, but it is damn good. [3.4]	Nov, 2005 Yeasty fudge, varnish, paint and raw mushroom aroma with some burnt sugar and alcohol. Mostly chalky dry (yet sweet) with muddy spices, chocolate liquor,  some clove, a pleasant sudden sharp fruit just before the swallow, and lingering alcohol on the way down. Very late tobacco and toffee notes. Doesnt quite hold together. Light (almost thin) bodied, initially alcoholic and odd tasting, though with conditioning/aging the alcohol will mellow into a pleasant sweetness. [2.9]	May, 2006 Blind tasting"
1," Bottle acquired in trade with atpayne (thanks!). When I opened this one, a foaming tan head came gently rushing out of the bottle. Poured a dark brown color with a large sized off white head. Aromas of bourbon, whisky, light vanilla and wood. Tastes of whisky, bourbon, light coffee, and light chocolates. Lively and somewhat over carbonated body for my tastes. I was really looking forward to this one as I am somewhat of a sucker for barrel aged beers but found this to be somewhat of a let down. Id like to try some of their other barrel aged offerings.
"
1," ive never had a bad bottle of chimay.  i only wish i could try ti on tap....	i really have nothing to say about the flavor that others havent below.
"
1," Yes, Yes, Yes this is it. no alcohol smell. A bottle from 2001 I drunk it on 20 december 2003. You could keep the beer until 2007. You have to write it with CAPITALS.
"
1," Draft at Mad Anthony Oktoberfest. Poured a off-white head that mostly diminished, minimal lacing, transparent, no visible carbonation, and a yellow hue. Malty, hoppy, sweet, fruity, and spicy nose. Flavor was sweet, malty and hoppy but not overly done. Smooth mouthfeel. Light-medium body.
"
1," scura note tostate luppolate di futta secca compia a seconda dell invecchiamento ma anche dal formato della botttiglia
"
1," Deep brown and has a mostly lasting frothy bubbles with spotty lace. The aroma has notes of bakers chocolate, toasty and charred malt, prune and starfruit esters, star anise, floral and herbal hops, a hint of rubber and pipe tobacco. The taste has a Schwarzbier like dry toasty black malt character with a ripened fruity backbone. A bit sugary in midesection and anise spice all over the place. Peaty bite and a hint of sea salt too. The mouth feel is the weak part of the beer, sort of just sits there on the palate offering nothingness. A good beer for what it is but I think I would rather have a New Belgium 1554 first.
"
1," chestnut color with small head.  great aroma of yeast, malt, dark fruits.  Very similar flavors.  very well balanced and alcohol is well disguised.  very good beer overall
"
1," Red-brown in colour with a thin head that fades quickly. Musty, earthy aroma. Rich taste with initial sweet notes of caramel and cola and a more floral, hoppy finish. Quite easy on the the pallet but not very moorish.
"
1," Pours a hazy reddish brown with a nice tan head. Aroma of yeast, fruits, caramel, spices, malt. Flavor is fruit, caramel, yeasts, rasins and malt. Good stuff.
"
1," Awesome! Subtle fruitiness and interesting aroma make this easy drinking stuff.
"
1," Dark body with Amber tint.  Tan head, good amount, with less lacing than expected.  Sour, malty, bready aroma with alcohol and grapes present.  Noted something else dry in the aroma.  Lighter body than expected.  Spicy hops at the end.  Nutty (almond?), grapes in the mouth.  Great balence.  Not quite as remarkable as I remember it...
"
1," 330ml bottle. Dark, cloudy mahogany with varying shades and bubbly white head. Theres a sweet vinous nose with cloves and a dab of alcohol. The dry flavor is sultanas, cloves and fruity hints. A little clumsy and over rated from this sample.
"
1," Another Christmas beer of 2005.   I need to learn more about Belgium Ales. The froth form the head filled the glass.  The head then withdrew to a normal head.  The aroma was stonger with the yeast than the German Helles. The color was a deep dark brown.  The flavors were of roasted malt.  The first sip was overpowering but as I drank more the beer was more satisfying.  I like the IPA and Stout better but I want to try more these Ales.
"
1," Pours an eerily hazy dark brown, with a significant tan head. Deep fruity nose with a hint of spice, possibly cinnamon. Great combination of hops and malt once it reaches your mouth, keeps every sip interesting. More sweet fruit notes of plum and even some malt int he taste. The alcohol is present as you finish your sip, but its a nice touch.
"
1," DEC 28, 2003 pleasant aroma, subtle blend of fruit, nut, and fresh bread. fizzy, straw colored pour. lively nearly all white head that twinkles and it is a bit airy, but it doesn't turn me off. murky brick red, orange body. marvelous flavor - same as aroma, but it striking my tongue is much more rewarding. soft, slightly bitter - an excellent brew.
"
1," 12oz bottle-pours a dissipating brown head and black color.  Aroma is oak, vanilla, dark malt, raspberry.  Taste is oak, vanilla, dark malt-charcoal, raspberry, some hops bitterness.
"
1," Pours dark mahogany with a nice head.  Smells fruity and yeasty.  Full-bodied with raisin, chocolate, and spicy flavors. Very complex; great beer.
"
1," Bottled(2000ml). -hoppy notes, not so good charamel aroma, nice head, unpleasant finish
"
1," MAY 29, 2007 2006 Bottle -- Pours with a dense tan head with OK retention and little lacing. Deep red colour with active carbonation (visibile only with a strong light behind the glass). Aroma is malty with overripe fruit and bread -- Christmas pudding!  Glorious full mouthfeel. Flavour has a real nip to it up front, receding to bananas and more bread. The strong alcohol level never intrudes too much but adds background warmth. Terrific for cold nights in front of an open fire!		P.S. Love that commercial description"
1," Poured a golden amber with white head. The smell was sweet hoppy malt. The flavor was a simple malt and a slight bitter finish.
"
1," Tasted on tap at brewpub. This brown ale pours a dark mahogany color. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma is fruity and sweet, with some dark malt. A medium bodied brown ale. Malts are nutty and caramel, semi-sweet. Hops are earthy and floral. Not as sweet as a lot of brown ale. Mild flavors. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.
"
1," 11.2oz bottle, poured into Chimay chalice. Pours cloudy brown, with a moderate tan head. Aroma is sweet; candi sugar, raisins, chocolate and orange.Sweet initially, which gives way to spice and a medium alcohol finish.
"
1," On draught at Milltown. Pours a glowing orange with a thick, small bubbled white head that lasts. Very nice appearance from these native belgians. I forgot about that.  Aroma is nice with cloves, citrus, and belgian yeast. Flavor follows suit and is nicely dry and slightly bitter along with the expected malt sweetness. Its been ages since I last had this beer and I must say I am quite surprised with how much I enjoyed it.
"
1," Bottle. Has a familiar hazy brown color but its color really appears under more direct light as a great ruby orange. Topped with a large offwhite head. Aroma from the get go was of fruit - like raspberry honey. Lots of good fruit found in the flavor too - apricots and raisins. A spiciness and a tangy quality give it some extra kick and it is very easy and refreshing despite its high alcohol. High level of sophistication
"
1," Cloudy orange appearance.  Citrusy hop, irony aroma. Quite bitter, good long hop palate.  Quite like the Bengal.
"
1," JAN 9, 2007 I agree with my colleagues below, excellent. Everyone should at least try it.	Truly a classic amongst beers/ales. Just a little too much  something for me.Too alcoholic tasting. maybe Only for special occassions.RERATED 01/01/07 - 2001 BOTTLE. Best before end 2006. wonderful. tasted of port/wine etc..mmm delicious.Really improved over the years
"
1," JUL 13, 2008 An interesting dark, murky burgundy color with a thick head that dissapeared quickly and left a laced ring and slight film. An interesting aroma which despite familiar smells I cannot quit pin down, i think oakes may be right with the raisen bread. The flavor was milder than I expected but good, notes of toffee, bread, and as with chimay blue notes of banana. An interesting beer all and all. But I much prefer chimay blue over red.
"
1," Bottle courtesy mora2000. Very clear. No color at all or carbonation. Aroma is slightly sweet and ricey. Paper pulp nose also. Flavor is slightly sweet with rice and big alcohol sting. Finishes with cardboard and harsh tingles.
"
1," our 101st beer.
"
1," 50cl bottle from Quinns 	Good clean slightly hazy gold looks with a very stable white head. Typical malt and cereal stuff with some very slight cardboard notes.Nice bitter hop finish. Crisp, clean and drinkable.
"
1," Draft during Doc Lock Disney Fest 2010.  Pale gold pour with fizzy white head, this one was smooth with pale malkt,m mikld citrus, hops, and a decent amount of fruity notes.  Not bad for a light lager.
"
1," JAN 22, 2006 While I still enjoy this, I used to like it more. Brownish body with a moderate head. Aroma is yeasty with bananas, other various fruits, and some sugar. Still a great beer.
"
1," It has a wonderful flavor and a wonderful color. I love its exotic aroma. Beers like this are difficult to find in pubs [in Spain], and its a pity.
"
1," Bottle. Thanks to Sprinkle for sending me this. Poured a deep black body with thin head that faded quick. Aroma is chocolate, vanilla, light oats. Flavor is very strong bourbon, vanilla, light chocolate. The bourbon really came on too strong many times while drinking this beer and hurt the other flavors.
"
1," Bottle courtesy of bu11zeye. Clear reddish pour. Dusty malts in the aroma. Tastes of dry malts and clay flavoring. Earthy tones.
"
1," Sulfury nose at first, but turns to a fresh grainy smell. Clear caramel color. Big frothy head. Full toaste malt taste, though a little buttery. Good bitter end. Full mouth feel, and well balanced. I like this. Would be great with pub food.
"
1," Bu sur place le 28/8/08, en fut (10 oz). Rousse trs peu claire, moyen collet. Arome de malt pic sucr intense, surtout du corriande. Got dherbe et dpice sec malt, trs amre, mais rien de cochon. Cest trs tange comme abbey double qui pourait tre trs intressant si ag!
"
1," 75 cL bottle. Pours cloudy orange with a small white head. Aroma is spiced and slight caramelish. Sweet, caramelish, yeasty and light spiced. Lingering yeasty and caramelish into the finish. Ends medium dry and light spiced.
"
1," Lightly hazed reddish copper ale with a thin golden moka head. Sweet honey caramel with note sof maple and coriander. In mouth, sweet candy sugar with a good coriander attack, light curacao, lingering sweetness and alcohol warmth in finale. Rich and classy. Premire 650 mL bottle at LCBO.
"
1," 3 oz Sample at the brew works downtown. For an Imperial pale Ale this drops offs way short. 5.5 ABV? Does that even count as an Impeiral? Not in my book. But here it goes. Very dry light golden pour. Almost sour wheaty with a strong barley palet. I can pass on this one also. Big river has yet to impress.
"
1," Brown, as a beer with the word ""brown"" in its name should be. Decent tan head. Faint bourbon aroma, with some brown sugar, as well. Rich toasty, bread flavor, with a caramelly finish. Rather understated, but filling and satisfying. Draft at the 2005 Music City Brewers Fest, so this was probably brewed at the Nashville location, if that matters.
"
1," DEC 16, 2007 I had one years ago and hated it.  Oh how my palate has changed.  I found myself sucking the dregs out of the bottle to get that one last drop.  Really a well balanced beer with loads of complex fruity flavor mixed with some dark malt.  Yum.
"
1," Saved this one for #69.  Shared a large bottle of this for dinner.  This brew pours a dark murky brown with red highlights and some tiny particles.  The huge mostly diminishing frothy off-white head has fair lacing.  The soft but rich nose is flowery, fruity, spicy (pepper, ginger, brown sugar), citrusy, and alcoholic.  The flavor is balanced, rich, wine-like and complex with apple, citrus, pepper, prunes, anise, and traces of vanilla.  The alcohol is well hidden.  The medium dry body has lively carbonation, and finishes moderately alcoholic, and lightly astringent.  The Rouge has better flavor, but this brew is better all around especially on the palate.
"
1," Bottle. 2nd time Ive had this. Aroma nothing special. Flavor is really nice though. Has similar hop to that in north coast white hawk ipa. Really like it.
"
1," good malty notes with a sweet aftertaste. It had mildly hoppy with a great color.  The smell was fruity, yet light.
"
1," The ever delectable grande reserve! Definitely in my top 3. Superbly complex, with rich rosy notes. Wonderful floral aroma and thick lacy head. I still need to cellar a bottle to try the aged variety.
"
1," Large frothy head is somewhat lasting and leaves cobweb-like lacing.  Hazy straw color with average carbonation appears average in body.  Nose consists of bananas, wheat, and flowery hops.  Heavy banana esters in the taste like many german wheats.  Very soft in the mouth and sweet throughout.  Slight acidity at the end.  Hops add a nice citrusy flavor to this beer.  Tart, dry finish.  Somewhat watery body.
"
1," NOV 5, 2010 Bottle pour to Trappist glass gives murky color with thick off-white head.  Quite a bit of sediment.   Aroma of fruits and a bit sour..  Interesting taste of fruit, yeast, bread with a crisp slightly bitter finish.  Excellent smooth and carbonated mouth feel.		2008 vintage.  Was kind of underwhelmed, maybe I need to try a different batch.  rated at 3.4.		Re-rated a 2010 which I thought was better with no sourness - possibly the 2008 hadnt been stored well?  2010 score 3.8.
"
1," Bottle. Hazy and ligt golden with a white head.  Slightly hoppy and  malty with hints of spice.
"
1," I was only familiar with the Grande Reserve prior to drinking this one.  Significanly more mild.  The familiar fruitiness was still evident, but just not as complex.  Certainly worth drinking.
"
1," Pours very dark ruby brown in color. There is a sheet of head forming on the pour but is quickly gone afterwards. Smell is very dark ripe fruits. Too much plum and dark candy sugar.	Taste is even more of the unfavorable notes from the smell. Has a bit of a tobacco and burnt flavor to it. Whatever it is exactly is just way too dominant and overbearing. Almost tastes like they waxed the top of the bottle with no cap on it. Not enjoyable by any means.
"
1," 11oz. bottle. Big offwhite head, rocky, a buch of sticky lacing. Fairly clear, pretty chestnut color. Medium body. Malty, somewhat roasty and fruity. Carbonation is a little much. Dry, ho hum finish.
"
1," good citrusy hops in a moderate body of good caramel type roasted  malt that is slightly sweet and flavorful with %5.5 abv as stated on the menu this beer is a tasty amber dry enough to satisfy clean memorable finish slightly sweet
"
1," Pleasant hop aroma.  Malty body and a decent hop finish.  Not as balanced throughout as would be expected.
"
1,"  This one pours a very pale golden color.  It had a large white head, and left no lacing.  The aroma is lighter.  It has notes of lemon, very weak malts and some corn.  The taste is OK.  It is definitely light.  There are hints of the lemon, slightly light malt body, as well as some corn adjucts.  A good lawnmower beer.
"
1," Reddish brown. Nice white airy head. Slight fruity aroma. Refreshing. Crisp and clean. Sits on the tongue just right. Bubbly on the tongue
"
1," Tasted 8/11/10. Sampler from the Brewpub. Filtered with a dark brown hue. Trace ring of head. Aromas of toasty cereal malts. Medium bodied with a really nice malt roast. Very tasty with a subtle caramel sweetness. Undertones of dark chocolate and sweet cereal grains. Fresh and tangy. Solid drink!
"
1," A pretty sweet beer with a bit of an alcoholic taste, but a good belgian strong ale. Flavours of fruit and sweetness. Dark brown in colour with a white head.
"
1," Bottle pours black with tan head.  Aroma is vanilla, bourbon, coffee, and chocolate.  The aroma does not last long.  Medium mouthfeel.  Flavor follows the nose and has bittersweet chocolate, dark coffee roast, oak, vanilla, and bourbon.  Overall pretty nice.  I wish the aroma had lasted a bit longer.  And the mouthfeel could have been a bit more creamier for the style and bit more thick.  Still a nice beer.
"
1," beatiful ruby copper with a full tan head. dark fruit and caramel on the aroma. good carbonation and surprisingly light body. silky and smooth on the way down. tastes of lightly roasted dark fruits with yeast and a little caramel. fairly dry and not overly sweet. outstanding balance and an amazing example of its style. need to try atleast once
"
1," On tap Big River Nashville.	Deep red bodied beer with a thin head.	Hop aroma is there but not too overdone.	Just enough hops in the flavor to be a drinkable brew although this is average all the way. To endure service as bad as I experienced, the beer will have to be much better.
"
1," Carmel hue with a white frothy head that dissapated quickly.	Nice aroma with faint almost clove smell with alcohol.	Nice taste of malty spice that yeilds to a yeasty taste that lingers.  Initially enjoyed it, but the longer it lingered the more yeast and flowery it became on my palate slightly deminishing the experience.  Nice initial mouthfeel, but again almost feels coated in my mouth instead of light.  reccommend to those that enjoy the yeast.
"
1," OCT 26, 2010 A tremendous beere.Pours out a brownish colour and has a fantastic sweet-bot not too much-flavour.Has a good foam,but the palate is what is all about this beer;Its amazingly full.
"
1," Nose of raisins, bready and yeast, Mouthfeel is much lighter than the blue or white versions. Tatse is somewhat flatter and lacks the intensity of the other two. Dates and raisins on the tongue. Nice but not great.
"
1," Delicate fruity aroma.  Taste is crip, fruity and mellow yeasts and malt.  Warming alcohol finish.
"
1," Hellbilly on the hookup.  Vanilla, toffee, caramel, bourbon, milk chocolate aroma.  Flavor is loaded with sweet bourbon, light tart notes, roast,cofee.  Not half bad.
"
1," Shared bottle at RBNAG 11.	Sweet orange aroma.	Fruity body, very Belgian. Nice, but not spectacular.
"
1," The most easily drinkable of the Chimay lines, but the least complex.
"
1," Mild malzig-herber Antrunk mit geringem Gewrzgehalt. Weiter eher mild, wenig bitter und kaum hopfig. Im Mittelteil laff und trocken, minimal suerlich. Leichtes sffiges Lager.
"
1," Bottle @ Ulfborg Weekend, Jan 2011. Pours clear pale yellow with a small off white head. Hay, grain and svovl. A bit thin. Some almond and caramel. Dry and bitter end. Medium bodied.
"
1," JAN 14, 2006 Much better when I had this a few years ago. Very dark, cloudy color. Aroma is flowers, bread, cinnamon and some clove. The taste was strong with alcohol, a little peach and some cinnamon. Also notes of smoke and oak at the beginning. While still a very good beer, not incredible.
"
1," A virtually perfect beer.  Do not drink this beer cold (this one is worth tasting).  I usually open the bottle and let it sit for about ten minutes at room temperature before pouring.  It is dark brown in color with a thick, foamy, tan head.  It has a fruity aroma with a hint of butterscotch and honey.  It has a malty, fruity taste, and goes down smoothly.  It has no alcohol flavor whatsoever, but feels warm and fuzzy after it goes down. , most likely due to the high alcohol content and the the yeast still present in the bottle.  The aftertaste is sweet, nutty, and complex.  A delicious meal in a glass!!  Five stars.
"
1," Dark dark brown, light tan head.  Fresh pressed espresso, milky latte, chocolate aroma.  Taste is roasty, coffee, espresso, chocolate, a bit too thin for the nice flavors.
"
1," DEC 18, 2007 Bottle 33 cl. Pours a dark reddish brown with a medium but fading tan head. Smell is fruity (citrus, orange, melon and ripe grapes). Taste is complex, citrus, honey, caramel, chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, brown sugar and alcohol. Nice finish makes this a great beer.
"
1," Pours dark, tremendous head, mild carbonation. This is not a heavy or very complex ale, but there is enough interesting stuff going on that I like. No bitterness here, its all about the malt and typical Belgian yeast notes. Its good, and I have some in my cellar, but I probably would only add to it sparingly.
"
1," nice copper colour. almost pinkish. big off-white head. great fruity taste, grapefruity, and bitter.
"
1," 750 ml bottle. Pours deep dark brown with a creamy beige head. Sweet aroma of chocolate, fruits and malts.Flavour is velvet soft, chocolate, raisins, spices. Alcohol shines through in the aftertaste. Nice one
"
1," Surprisingly quickly diminishing head for what I consider to be a premium quality (or at least price) dubbel. A mix of large and small bubbles which is indicative of low quality (with apologies to Trappist Ales Rule). Mild aroma with some slight estery yeast notes. Hazy reddish brown. Very sweet. Some candi sugar, bananas, and maybe some plumb. A sharp bite from the carbonation. Definitely a solid Belgian though not the best. Not as complex as I like to see in a dubbel but, in my opinion, superior to the Bleu.
"
1," 750 ml bottle, cork dated 10/03, best before 2007. Mahogony colour with a frothy and rocky tan coloured head. Pungent, spicy, toffee, dark fruit, raisin, plum, and persimmon aroma. Flavours of yeast, toffee, raisin, plum, cider, and a light alcohol bitterness. Full bodied and very dry, with a touch of alcohol burn. Probably could have used some age.
"
1," pours a dark brown with no foam. nice alcohol content. liked the chimay red better personally.
"
1," Black color with a large head.  Aroma of merlot, cocoa and a bit of oak.  Very light grapey flavor.  Sugary yet dry.  Bitter and some astringency.  Full bodied.
"
1," This is my favorite beer.  I love the brown-amber cloudiness, the burning/warming feel of 7% alcohol, and the sweetness that develops in the finish.  I can smell light toasted maltiness, red wine, and floral scents combined with heavier syrup and alcohol aromas.  For me, the flavor and mouthfeel lift this dubbel above its competitors.  I enjoy its soft to lively carbonation, medium to full body, and moderately alcoholic finish.  Chimay Reds sweetness and bitterness are in near-perfect balance.
"
1," Belgian Strong Ale"" tasting 07. pours a good size white head and a nice amber color. looks tasty. nose has lots of dark candy sugar, some plum and caramel, and pretty yeasty. flavor is very sweet with yeast and pear. mouthfeel is lively but a pretty hot finish. a surprise unanimous let down at the tasting.
"
1," Almost opaque, but can catch currents running through it in just the right light.  The aroma was very nice, but it didnt last very long, and thats my biggest complaint.  Fizzy head that didnt irritate my nose.  Dark with a dark flavor, but very easy to drink.  Had it in a Chimay goblet that heightens the whole experience.
"
1," Ehdottomasti tmn hetkisist oluista paras. Tilaan tt lhes aina kun kyn Birgeriss.
"
1," Big sticky white foam, hazy golden color, slightly sweet, innocent yeastiness, subdued hops in aroma and taste, medium effervescence, crisp and clean with quality touches of leather and cologne. An impressive example of an impoverished style. Actually, damn fricken good.
"
1," This one seemed to be a little on the belgian ale side and less towards golden/blonde ale, but whatever. Nose was light with hints of grain, bread, dust, and a hint of yeast notes. Pours golden with a thin non lasting head and noticeable bubbles. Light grain, bread, dust, a touch of sweetness underneath, very light yeast esters. A little crispnes/drynesss in the finish, a hint of green apple perhaps too. A little Very easy drinking.
"
1," Coffee aroma. Something is off in the nose, though not sure what. Nice lace. Opaque body. No head. Pretty good. No flaws. Could be more complex in its flavors. Very nice. Just could be better. But, lives up to its ranking as the #1 rated Big River brew.
"
1," Botlle. Light brown head which dissapated fairly quick. Nice deep brown color and slightly hazy. The aroma is of molasses for the malt component and a slight smell of dough from the yeast. the hop component is flowery and of herbs. I also picked up raisin, toffee and brown suger. The taste starts off sweet and finishes a bit tart. The feel in the mouth is probably the best part. Medium body, slightly oily, with perfect carbonation and a light dry ending. This beer is both full of flavor and aromas and yet is very easy to drink.
"
1," Beautiful, deep ruby colors with copious fluffy head as served in my new Chimay goblet that I got for Christmas.  Huge dark sweet aroma that puts you on notice of the alcohol to come.  Very complex flavors of brown sugar, molasses, burnt caramel with sweet fruit notes of dark cherry, plum, and raisin.  Very good beer.  My new favorite Chimay.
"
1," Bottle from Mike (bbb63) Thanks.  Pours out a dark brown to almost black color with a little tan head on it.  Smell is mostly coffee, with a few hints of chocolate and roasted malts.  Taste is sweet and full of coffee.  Easy to drink but it left me jacked up.  There must be quite a bit of coffee beans thrown into this.  Far better once it has warmed up some than when it was cold.  Highly drinkable.  Good stuff.
"
1," light to medium golden brown, head is light beige and thin..not lasting. aroma is very faint citrus hops, very malty, slightly chocolatey with what i THINK is an oh so faint hint of peat. flavor is very sweet, fruity and malty. hops are very subdued in the flavor.
"
1," While this is an excellent beer, it simply does not match up to Chimay Blue.  In many ways these are similar, however the Red has a more pronounced carbonation, nearly becoming acerbic.  Despite this, the beer is rather sweet and creamy, with a feeling of clarity in the depth of it.
"
1," Rich, leather brown with a thin, tan head.	Nothing but yeast in the nose. Slight malt in the nose too.	Lots of malt and raisin in the first taste.	Highly carbonated but still smooth on my tongue.	Alcohol is very well hidden here!	I like blue better than red at this point.	White is next on the menu...
"
1," Poured a large head. I wasnt overly impressed with this one. Nose was Muenster cheese and leather shoes. I detected malt and chocolate with a sharp metallic bite in the finish. Too much hype, not enough follow through.
"
1," Draught at the brewpub. Its warm golden with a creamy head. The aroma is sour with notes of yeast and butter. The flavour has a light sweetness, notes of butter, a light sourness, fruit (but not really banana) and only a little bit of clove. It ends on a mouldy/earth like note with a little clove bite. Its a bit weird.
"
1," Bottled. Blackcurrant, smoke and fruits on the nose. Red/brown with a thick white head. Very foamy, extremely lively and thick on the palate. Taste of berries among others..
"
1," Black, with a small tan head. Aroma of roasted malt and chocolate with a little coffee. Taste is fairly rich, roasty and malty sweet with a mild bitterness. Pretty full bodied. Nice stout.
"
1," Golden coloured, stable, dense creamy head; caramel and sweet malts in the nose with distinctive touch of floral hoppiness; creamy mouthfeel, bitter (hoppy flavour), light bodied; dry, a bit malty and hoppy-aromatic finish"
1," Shared bottle 0.33 l. Deep red with a minimal head. Served a bit too cold. Initial nose has strong metallic tones with a spicy malty background. Lot of salty liqourice on flavor with some fruitiness and a bit of sweet alcohol warmth. Pretty nicely rounded and balanced. Nice mouthfilling smooth carb. Will have to re-evaluate this with a full bottle and see if the metallic nose is still there.
"
1," Quite different compared to my last tasting of chimay, definatly has a stronger larger bitter flavour but yet still a sweetness which is customary for chimay. The aftertaste is mellower than i expected after the first sip, a great all round beer is definatly worthy of wearing the trappist name.
"
1," Courtesy of Kim, handbottledCloudy amber color; creamy head. Creamy aroma, cheesy; berries, a bit sour. Weak body, fairly sour and astringent, a bit lemony. The astringency is the only interesting factor here.
"
1," Pours clear gold. Aroma of fruit and grain. Pretty basic but way better than BMC.
"
1," (Draught) Sampled at WaaZuBee Caf in Vancouver. Referred to as Backwoods Timberwolf PA. Lasting cloud of a white sponge foam atop clouded amber orange body. Nose of Stilton cheese, cantaloupe and butter. Thin, warm peach box drink with the momentary citrus Screwdriver finish. Gag-Reflex initiating...
"
1," Bottle thanks to tytoanderso, I have now found this available at local stores. Pours clear and water like hue, very pure, with strongish legs. Aroma of vanilla almond, pear, melon, koji, butter and higher sweetness than a +2 would have you believe. Quite clean and pure smelling.  Taste is nice, sweet and pure. Excellently balanced. With notes of nuts, vanilla, light umami, rose petals, lychee and concord grapes. Very nice and extremely light alcohol presence (btw, my bottle read 15%, not 16.5%). Viscous and full bodied, yet refreshing. Very, very pleasant.		Paired exceptionally with cavaillon melon.
"
1," This beer and a cigar will put you on cloud nine and make you want to listen to Pink Floyd.  This is probably the first ""rare premium beer"" that I tasted, maybe5 years ago. Yeast is overwhelming from the aroma to the finish.  Alcohol comes through quite nicely.  This is a highly carbonated beer that sort of foams when you sip it.  Malty, little hops.  I will re-rate in a few months as there is more going here than my primitive taste buds can discern.  There is no question, this is a quality beer.
"
1," Pours a darkbrown  beer, a little cloudy with some proteine chunks floating around. Off-white head that clears fast (dirty glass?). Smells like caramel and coffee, ripe banana. A prickling mouthfeeling. First flavour is pretty sweet, caramel, chocolate and roasted malts. Ends like sour apple, brown sugar yet not sticky, cinamon. Aftertasty is pleasant hoppy.
"
1," Clear brown with a tan head, sweet, peppery, weak and not to great.  Drinkable but I aint buyin...
"
1," Hmmmm...could we have found a new favorite?  Possibly.  This Trappist Dubbel is delicious!  The fact that it is unfiltered and unpasteurized is evident the minute you start to pour.  Trying to stare through this brew's murky depths is like staring through a pond after the silt has been stirred up.  The head is heavy and thick, and it lingers for quite some time.  The flavor is fruity with just enough malt and hops.  Finish is slightly citrus with a touch of alcohol, as one would expect from this potent 7% potable.  All in all, I must say the monks have done it again...WORLD CLASS!
"
1," The first thing I noticed was the floaties in the bottle. Do not be alarmed by this. Upon opening the bottle, a volcano of froth escaped. Poured, carefully, into a glass it became half head. The smell is acidic, but not unpleasant.  Has a sweetness to the aroma as well. The taste is heavenly. A hint spice (clove?) is present. Something citrusy is going on too.  Bitterness only lasts a moment.  I wish I had another one of these.
"
1," This is an exceptional beer. All of the Chimays are. It is truly something to savor as you drink.
"
1," Aroma is peanut, with light caramel, some chocolate malt showing.  Taste like it was served a bit young, crystal malt is evident, and chocolate.
"
1," This beer is a deep brown-black color with a medium tan head that recedes quickly. Top ring of lacing with spots underneath. The aroma consists of dark malt, oak and coffee. Full body with flavors of oak, vanilla coffee and burnt malt. Bourbon character is well-subdued. The finish is malty and leaves a nice vanilla and coffee aftertaste. Overall this is a decent Stout that falls more on the side of a good Coffee Stout rather than going overboard with the barrel aged flavors.
"
1," Corked bottle.  Had this to celebrate the end of a long exam.  A rich dark color.  I found this a little too dry.  It was spicy and fruity but not as rich or complex as the Bleu.
"
1," Received a 750ml bottle as an award and had the little capped bottle. 11oz did not hold up at all for a year and the 750ml aged nicely. Malty with a suirt of yeast. Well balanced.
"
1," You just cant go wrong when it comes to Chimay.  Yeasty flavors are dominant here, with some sweet brown candi sugar flavors, caramel and toffee, and just the slightest hint of dried dark fruits.  Delicious.
"
1," AUG 25, 2005 	Pours a rich, creamy head that lasts the entire drink. Body is dark amber/brown. Head is an off white colour. Aromas of spices, plums, some rum, and fruit. Taste is fruit, floral, run, prunes. FInish is spices in the aftertaste, smooth and full bodied. This is my second re-rate of this beer. FOr some reason as of late, it seems to be almost watery. Still really good, but not as good as I had first thought.
"
1," Bottle (0.75 L). Pours brown with a half inch head. Aroma and flavor of plums and raisins. Delicious.
"
1," Slightly cloudy, nice natural carbonation. Slight winey flavour/fruity taste. Lots of flavour. Strong yeasty flavour. Nice ale.
"
1," A very dark ""reddish"" murky brown color with big head that goes to lacing which sticks around forever. Light bubbly carbonation. Aroma of sweet prune. Flavor is very much sweet plum/prune with lots of yeasty dark fruit esters. I let it warm a while. It gets very smooth indeed, as described. I think it needs a little more ""bite"", something to hook it on the back side. Otherwise, this is a super drinkable world classic.
"
1," Clear. Aroma is rice and alcohol with not too much else going on. The flavor is more complex. I get some rice and some alcohol, but I also get some melon and vanilla notes. Pretty good.
"
1," Pours a hazy brown-gold color with a substantial white, fluffy head.  Aroma is of fruit and yeast.  Flavors include some spices, yeast, alcohol, citrus, hops, and it is a little bitter.  Quite good though.		11.2 oz. bottle.
"
1," One of the first trappists I ever tasted, and it piqued my interest in trying different types of beer. This is by far the finest chimay offering. Nose is nutty, full bodied taste with port and dark chocolate notes. Alcohol taste is present but finishes smooth.
"
1," Poured black with a fizzy large light tan head.  Strong alcohol aroma, some roastiness and some acidic paint thinner.  Taste is roasted coffee with a surprisingly large alcohol character.  OK, but I not sure the barrel did this one a world of good.
"
1," Spicy aroma, particularly cloves.  Fruity/clove flavour, palatable but no way near as good as the other Chimays.
"
1," Finally rated this one.  I like the blue so much, it is hard to want to buy the red.  A clear brownish-orange pour, large creamy off-white head.  Hints of sweet in the nose with a nice noble hop spiciness and breadiness.  Lovely mouthfeel, tastes of sweet malts and spice balanced with decided nuttiness.  Delicate, yet complex.  A lovely dubbel.
"
1," Bottled. A hazy amber beer with a light tan head. The aroma has notes of wheat, caramel, cloves, and oranges. The flavor is sweet with notes of wheat, caramel, and cloves, leading to a dry wheaty finish. Thanks Timo for bringing this to Denmark.

1," When you meet a wine snob who turns their nose up at beer, let them try this.
"
1," DEC 30, 2009 Beautiful copper colour and candy sugar aroma.  The mouthfeel and aftertaste are both very pleasant with gargly candy sugar notes.  Obviously not a session type drink but one I would pleasurably return to time after time.  Score 4.0Subsequent rating scored 3.8. Average becomes 3.9
"
1," Pours the usual belgium red, hazt fairly active carbonation.  Head is initially ver full, but diminishes very rapidlt, much like soda.  Flavor is very dry, woody.  Bananas, cloves, and apple core, as well as slight bubblegum are here, as is grass and tobacco.  Ending is bitter and dry.  Palate is slightly thin for the style.
"
1," Great hazy dark brown colour, fantastic fruity, malty smell...full taste, with hints of fruit and a short distinct aftertaste!
"
1," pours a root beer brown mixed with red an orange overtones, large foaming off-white head, highly carbonated, sweet (sugary) spicy aroma, fruity, also slightly musty and yeasty; flavor is initially alcohol, but is also sweet and fruity, a definite musty-yeasty taste as well, bitter aftertaste, alcohol is not hidden as well as in other Trappist ales, good texture
"
1," Bottle. Poured brown with a tall off-white head. The aroma found malts and spices. The flavor appeared fruity with light spices. Medium body and slightly sweet. I did not find anything particular that stood out other than it was very smooth and overall enjoyable.
"
1," A little less complex than the Bleu. But a bit easier to drink also.  The balance of this beer is almost perfect.  Body is much lighter than its dark amber color would have you believe.  It is not as flavorful as either Chimay Bleu or White.  But its another enjoyable Trappist Ale.
"
1," 2008 bottle from West Lakeview.  Pours a thicker darker chestnut brown with a small frothy beige head.   Sweet aroma of Belgian yeast, candi sugar, banana esters, light touch of dark chocolate, and a bit of mint-chocolate cookies, a bit cedar with some noticeable alcohol, smells almost like a dunkelweizen.    This beer draws some parallels with Bells Hell Hath No Fury.  First taste is semi-sweet bakers chocolate, lightly burnt candi sugar, touch of banana but quite estery, light spices and some light dry chocolate cookie.  Some earthy dark bitterness, tart ripe berries and finishes a bit metallic.  Really easy drinking, the dark bitterness is nicely balanced.   Drinks like a chocolate soda.  Medium/light syrupy body, light chalkiness with minimal carbonation.
"
1," Beer pours (in Chimay glass) a dark brown, near black with some dark red that light can penetrate with a medium amount of off-white head that dissipates, but develops a smooth top of head about 1/4 inch thick.  Aroma is of grape, plum, raisin, and fresh, sweet fruit.  Flavor is of grape, plum, raisin, malt, and fresh, sweet fruit with a lightly sweet chocolate ending.  Very smooth.  Outstanding.  Bottle is 25.4 oz, cork is dated 12/02.  No alcohol aroma or flavor detected.  None.  This beer could benefit (IMHO) from being opaque, and not so bubbly on the tongue.  Those are this beers only faults.  However, the head more than makes up for the not-so-opaque appearance and this brew being smooth going down more than makes up for the initial tingling on the tongue.  No beer is perfect, including this one, and I don't like giving out perfect scores, but this is as good as it gets.  Sampled at 72 degrees Fahrenheit.
"
1," Poured medium dark brown with substancial head that stuck around for a while. Flowery nose with roasted accents. Somewhat hoppy, the alch. is well hidden on the finish. Superb brew.
"
1," A deep dark stout with a thin moka head. In aroma, a nice chocolate with light woody notes, vanilla. In mouth, a bitter woody chocolate with light vanilla beans and intense bitterness, again, unbalanced. On tap at the brewpub, July 30 2011.
"
1," ~Pours a cloudy light orange colour with medium sized creamy white 	head. Some residue floaters	~Smells nice. Like mild wet hops. Has some minimal fruity notes.	~A good roasted(?) bitter hop flavor. Nice balance of sweetness and bitterness. 	~Feels light, but a bit chalky. Sticks inside my mouth.

"
1," APR 7, 2009 This is what you expect from a dark Belgian Strong Ale.  Well its what I personally expect.  Its spicy, the alcohol is not very noticeable, its really nice to look at.  Its got one of the best, tightest heads Ive seen on a brew.  Aroma is somewhat lacking, but its got a really good flavor.  Its not too yeasty, and its not too sweet.  Really, I may be underrating this one.  Ill have to check back because I drank this the other night and Im just going from memory here.  I really enjoyed it though.
"
1," My favorite abbey ale simply because I can find this one when I want it.  The last bottle I purchased was very sweet and had concentrated caramel flavors and some fruitiness.  The amber color was extraordinary and the head was relatively thick.
"
1," A dark clear reddish brown porter with a thin moka head. In aroma, a pleasant nutty chocolate, caramel, light butterscotch. In mouth, a bitter porter with bitter chocolate, faint maple extract, not bad. On tap at the brewpub, July 30 2011.
"
1," Dark amber brown pour, aroma of dates and dried cherries, flavor is sweet but balanced, warm, anise after-taste, slightly watery mouth-feel.
"
1," Was sich zuerst als streng hefiger Geruch definiert, kippt alsbald in einen Ton von verbranntem Plastik. Suerlicher Antrunk, der danach erneut einen unangenehmen Brandgeschmack entwickelt. Sauer im Abgang. Ich vermute das Bier ist schlecht - dem widerspricht allerdings das MHD. Unterste Schublade.
"
1," Bottle 50cl. @ home.Unclear medium orange amber color with a average to large, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, grain, hay, dusty, dry grass, caramel notes. Flavor is moderate sweet and bitter with a average to long duration. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. [20091016]
"
1," Heavily carbonated autumn brown appearance.  Feint prickly, woody hop aroma translating into rather similar flat, punchless flavor. Medium-to fuller bodied--this beer is belly warmer, but it lacks sharpness/crispness. Quite dissapointing--maybe do to a flat bottle.
"
1," Pours black with a thin tan head.  Aroma is subdued, dark chocolate and bourbon.  Flavor is bitter dark chocolate malt, black coffee, with a heavy bourbon and oak presence.  Finish is slightly medicinal and body is thinner than I would have expected.  Doesnt compare to some of the better bourbon stouts out there.
"
1," 12oz bottle poured in an English pint.  I bought this as a one-off item in Granite City, Illinois.  BIBMJS pours... (drum roll, please)... black.  It has a small tan head that doesnt stick around for the majic show.  The nose is solidly coffee with loads of butter and hints of toffee.  the body is meaty and thick just the way it should be in a stout.  The coffee has a nice flavor without overpowering the beer.  The oatmeal not only adds body to this stout but adds a nice smoothness.  The buttery flavor comes out especially well in the finish.  With the medium-to-low alcohol this beer sports you could tag this as a great session beer.  If I were to suggest any improvement it would be to add a touch more oatmeal to balance out the hop & java bean bitterness.  It would be nice to see how this beer faired if it were juiced up to an imperial level.  I feel this beer is a bit underrated by the community but the masses have spoken.

1," Outstanding!  Pours dark, reddish - brown color.  Off-white head with nice lacings.  Sweet aroma.  Taste is sweet with a slight bitterness, some dark fruits.  Medium carbonation.  Slightly bitter aftertaste.  Medium body.  Outstanding brew.  Not overly filling, which I like in a dubbel.  Very easy to drink.  Probably my favorite beer.
"
1," JUL 19, 2007 Bottle, from Butik Moskva, Cph. Pours a golden yellow with no apparent head. Aroma is sweet with a sour fruity edge to it. Flavour is quite hoppy bitter. Begins with malty sweetness before turning to a peppery hoppy side.
"
1," To me, this beer tasted like pitted fruit, which I like very much.  I enjoyed drinking this beer, but feel that I should try it again considering I tasted it at a beer festival and was not on my game at the point I got to Chimay.
"
1," awesome stuff.  beautiful lasting head.  a bit yeasty in smell.  tastes divine.
"
1," Draft sample at IBG Winterfest 2009.		Poured clear brown color with an average frothy light brown head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate toasted nutty malt and yeast aroma. Medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Medium bittersweet flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. 		Good brew and my expectations where met.
"
1," ""beer poured a dark amber color with a nice head which lasted about half the beer. Nice lacing, had a spicy aroma. Felt very smooth with a citrus taste. Would get this again and again.""
"
1," Mild yeasty aroma.Smooth medium hoppy yeasty flavor with a touch of banana.Clean finish.Lacks the character the other Trappist, and many, abbey dubbels have.
"
1," 750 mL Pours a hazy reddish copper with an inch thick off-white head. Typical belgian yeasty smell with some dark fruits coming through. The head disipates rather quickly. Sugary, fruity (notably apricot) and pleasant malt in the taste. Almost no alcohol to be detected here.  A really nice abbey that finishes without the bitter aftertaste of most Belgians.
"
1," Draught at the Charlotte, NC Rock Bottom location. Orange color with thin off white head. Malty molasses and citrus hop aromas with similar flavors that are accented by raisin and dried cherry undertones. Finish is slightly bitter.
"
1," Like the rouge, only stronger.  More alcohol.  Similar flavor.  Berries, nuts, mild yeast and cocoa.  Dry and doughy with hints of rum.  Not as strong as Rochefort Trappistes 10, but has some unique and nice flavor.
"
1," Bottled. An amber beer with a thin lazing beige head. The aroma has notes of malt, caramel, and spices. The flavor is sweet with notes of cloves, cardemomme, malt, and caramel, leading to a dry spicy finish. Thanks fiulijn for sharing.
"
1," Bottle 500ml.Hazy medium orange color with a average to large, frothy to creamy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white head. Aroma is light malty, light moderate yeasty, clove, cheese whey, spicy, light fruity - banana. Flavor is moderate sweet and light bitter with a average to long duration. Body is medium, texture is watery - creamy, carbonation is soft. [20091122]

1," During the five-plus years that I lived in Jacksonville, FL I only visited the Seven Bridges Brewpub once. I had one beer and I dont even remember what it was so I have no way of knowing if they even brew it any more. Of course, I wasnt anywhere near the beer geek that I am now, so what purpose would it have served me then to go and taste beers when such a thing wasnt any part of my reality. Now is a totally different story though, and during my most recent trip to Jacksonville a few weeks ago, I made sure to make it to Seven Bridges and take a flight through their beers, tasting-pad in hand.By now we should all be well aware of my critical lager palate and unfortunate disdain for bad lagers. Ive had a few good lagers of various styles in the last couple years, but have yet to have any enjoyable light lager experience. So what should my first beer during my Seven Bridges flight be but their Southern Flyer Light Lager. Raising my tasting glass, I prepare to begin my journey of, ultimately, six different beers.My Southern Flyer was appropriately a very light dried hay color. There is absolutely no discernable head before and after a couple small swirls to stir things up a bit while at the same time releasing her trapped nose. Surprisingly, her nose is replete with lemon zest and fresh grassy hops. This could actually be a good portend of things to come. My first quaff is clean, crisp, and bright with lemon and summer grass which fades into a sweet toasted malt finish. Adding yet another dimension to this light lager is the addition of a light chewy mouthfeel reminiscent of chewing on a piece of hay or straw. Soft and delicate, cereal grains add a solid and lightly sweet backdrop to Southern Flyers prominent citric lemon and grassy palate. As far as sample glasses go, she was over almost as soon as she began, but I was pleasantly pleased with the Southern Flyer Light Lager. A clean finish with lingering faint grassy esters concludes my very first good light lager experience.I must say, this light lager had a more balanced body and colorful palate then some standard lagers I have tried. One thing about lagers and lighter beers is that it is nigh impossible to hide any mistake no matter how small. I would have to say that Seven Bridges has with their Southern Flyer the quintessential light lager which many only dream of accomplishing. A brew well done.
"
1," 1998 vintage.  I was trying to save it for 10 years, but I ran ran out of fresh bottles. Whats a man to do? I subsequently realized that I have never rated Chimay, even though it has been one of my favorites for many years. It poured with a short (probably due to aging) tan head, eliciting a pleasant yeasty aroma. The alcohol was even less noticeable than usual from its mellowing over time. The flavor was still complex but more balanced than a fresh bottle, with a slightly chalky finish. The aging definitely altered the flavor but neither improved nor diminished it. Its back to the beer store for more Chimay.
"
1," Orange pour with white head and lace that fads quickly. Light citrus hops on the nose. A very nice citrus bitter preceded by a slight medicine taste. Medium bodied with aggressive carbonation. A very average ipa
"
1," Sampled at village taphouse in West Vancouver. Standard nut brown colour with thin cream head. Aroma is very subdued (served too cold) but still I had a hard time picking out much but a small whiff of malt. Taste is more interesting. Light slightly woody tasting malt, a little thin and astringent. Flavour dies away rapidly with little if any hops. Okay, weak in style.
"
1," Bottle. I would almost agree with those who would rate Chimay Blue higher. However I found that I needed to look beyond the first impression to find Reds beauty. Its fruity aroma is very subtle and its look in the glass is all class. Red has great color and head to match. It is a bit over carbonated, but I am willing to overlook it because it has  a near perfect balance of malt and hops and alcohol. The bitter aftertaste is just right. This is a very dry and refreshing brew. Not to light and not to heavy. It makes me wish I had some fresh sourdough bread and hard cheese to eat.
"
1," The aroma is  fruity but not over whleming, slight hint of strength, appearence very nice with some yeast in the bottem, flavor complex with tastes of fruit and of barley mixed very well, palate, crisp bite but very smooth, no bad after taste... overall wonderful beer
"
1," NOV 26, 2007 had this the other night.. was so excited to see this in a friends hand and demanded to try some. totally uber. Unfortunately i was too drunk to remember how it tasted.
"
1," Bottle.	Cloudy amber coloured with a white head.	Sweet aroma of malts and caramel.	Flavour of malts with notes of spices.
"
1," Bottle from Alko. Originally rated on 18.9.2009. Classic trappist with a well balanced taste.
"
1," #100! Bottle. poured a grayish-brown haze, off white foamy head. An interesting aroma of a wet street in the rain as well as grapes. Nice complex taste of pears, white grapes, bready malt, yeast...a champagne yeast maybe? very effervescent...hops give a very clean dry finish, fruity. Its nice how different the European hop character is than the big bold American variety...much more dry and fruity vs. oily and piney. I LOVED this beer!  Wonderful, the monks know what they are doing.
"
1," This is not retired.  	Cloudy yellow brown color.  Lemon and soap in the nose, light body with lemon peels and goldings hops and a rounded finish.
"
1," Pours amber light head quickly disapates. Aroma is fruity (apricots) can smell the alchohol. Starts with a light fruity airyness slight hints of malts and a nice counter of bitterness Ending is sour and watery not big enough. Still very good overall.
"
1," A cut above the White.
"
1," Bottle thanks to some fine trader that I cant remember (I think its moejuck or Puddintane).  Dark, blackish pour with a small tan head. Aroma is sweet and milky with some roasty and chocolate notes detectable.  Flavor is milky/creamy, chocolatey, and smooth.  Some sugar and cream mixed with a bit of chocolate and coffee.  A nice, sessionable stout that was pretty good.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours a clear amber with no head.  Hoppy aroma with lots of grapefruit.  Piney and citrusy hop flavor with a good malt balance.  Medium, almost thin finish.
"
1," JAN 4, 2010 From a 33cl bottle on august 26, 07 at a Botulfs in Lund.   Aroma is floral and citrusy with a touch of alcohol.   Rich cloudy redish brown color with a thin off-white head that dissipates quickly.   Flavour is well balanced with caramel malt dominating and the high alcohol showing slightly with the hop notes in the aftertaste.  Palate is rich with lively carbonation that sticks around as the beer warms.   Overall, a good beer-the best that ive had in Sweden so far.   This is my first Abbey Dubbel and if it is typical of the style, then i am looking forward to trying more.   I would have liked slightly more hop bite to balance the richness of the malt, but it worked all the same. (6,4,7,4,16)	Rerate"
1," My new favorite beer.  Truly wonderful aroma - think Juicy Fruit gum layered over malt.  Beautiful appearance - almost opaque with visible sediment.  Very malty flavor.  I didnt notice the alcohol - noteworthy given that its a strong ale.  Awesome brewage.
"
1," JUL 22, 2010 (bottle) cloudy reddish brown with tall thick head; aroma of bread, cereal, bit of fruit; lightly bitter flavour with some mineral aspect; can not say I particularly liked it
"
1," 12oz. bottle.  Predominantly citric, fruity hop aroma, some faint lemon and grapefruit detected along with touches of doughy yeast and toasty malt sweetness.  Hazy light-medium amber color, full of particulates, with a very fine but lasting head. Flavor profile follows the aroma rather closely, primarily showcasing the hop presence, which makes itself known here in the form of a light acidity and increasing bitterness, alongside the juicy citrus, leafy herbal qualities and faint, grainy malt sweetness.  Semi-dry and thin on the palate with plenty of effervescence and a medium body.  Does feature a nice amount of hoppiness, but is a bit thinner and less complex than many others of this style.
"
1," Pours slightly hazy amber with an off white head.  Aroma is caramel, toffee, and some citrusy hop (the bottles are pretty old but arent dated).  Flavor is citrusy hop, but with toffee and slightly oaked flavors from the age.  Not bad.
"
1," Bottle pours a beautiful brown with a think head. The nose has yeasty caramel, vanilla, an array of malt notes, and spiced fruit. The body is creamy. The flavors starts with sweet malt, which turns bitter quickly and fades slowly. To me, the nose is more appealing than the actual flavor, but this is a nice introduction to a trappist/dubbel.
"
1," Absolutely amazing beer. This is a must try for anyone who appreciates good beer. Pure magic!
"
1," very basic.  not too exciting.  lots of hops, some malt, but nothing else much going on.  blah...
"
1," I cant believe I havent rated this one yet. Poured a medium to darker brown color with a larger sized off white head. Aromas and tastes of plums and other dark fruits. Lightly spicy with light yeast in the tastes as well. Medium sweet.
"
1," From the tap, served in a standard bar 22 oz. pint glass.		Poured a clear reddish hued brown with forthy, fluffy off-white head that settled into a sudsy lacing.		Aromas of toasted nuts and a soft sweet fruitiness, earthy with cocoa and caramel maltiness in the background.		Good even carbonation and a soft malty crisp, dryish, smooth medium bodied mouthfeel.		A pleasant nutty brown ale taste, nutty yeast, toasted grains and cocoa, subtle sweet fruitiness in the middle, a soft hop bitterness that lingers at the end, and a dry nutty, malty finish.		A welcome addition to the taps here in central Illinois, easy, smooth drinkability, I could spend a long evening with this.
"
1," Im sad I didnt get to try this by itself. Someone had it at a homebrewers meeting and I tried it but it was one of the last beers I tried, along with all that great homebrew. I didnt realy get to experiance the totality of the Chimay Red. It was good is all I can remember or say.
"
1," Bottle from Midtown. I cant believe I have not logged a rating for this. Pours a dark walnut brown with a frothy beige head that dissipates to a ring. Aroma of cherry, vanilla, and Belgian esters. Medium to full bodied with soft carbonation and an earthy texture. Flavor of chocolate, vanilla, and raisen transitions to a white peppery bite. Finish is yeasty and dusty with light alcohol and a very very slight lactic note.  Very nice, sort of like a tamer Quad.
"
1," Sampled on cask at Market Porter in Southwark along with SilkTork.  Pleasantly honeyish sweet, fruity aroma, perfumed and lightly citric.  Light-medium golden color, clear, with a head that diminished entirely.  Flavor is indeed vaguely cidery and fruity, a moderate amount of malt sweetness is present, with a nicely hoppy, floral, balanced finish.  Palate is virtually free of effervescence, body is medium.  Refreshing and unique, highly drinkable and better than anticipated overall.
"
1," Tap at the broad ripple location.  Pours cloudy amber with thick foamy white head. Nose is fairly intense citrus hops.  Taste is sharp and crisp juicy orange/grapefruit hops with moderate carbonation and a mild peppery spice to it.  Kinda salty in the finish actually.  Not bad.
"
1," Bottle thanks to thirdeye11. Orange in color with a small off-white head. Aroma is of wet towel, wet dog, wet grass...caramel and malt. Taste is of hops, grass and caramel.
"
1," Honey golden. Tall and thick white foam collar sticks to the glass. Very bright aroma loaded with chamomile, mandarin orange, coconut oil, rose petals, and pulverized coriander. Some phenolic esters and wet straw, as well. Soft, very fluffy carbonation paired with a slick body. Gorgeous interplay between buttery chamomile and leathery yeast flavors. Swaths of sweet honeyed malts and, almost nutty, malt husks slice their way through the bold yeastiness. Coriander overexerts itself, lending more sweetness to the rich honeyed malt elements and masking much of the leafy hops aspects, rather than highlighting them. Tongue-coating oaty smoothness adds more body. Deliciously juicy, throughout, due to the fresh mandarin orange flavors. Finishes minimally spicy yet resoundingly floral and sweetly malty with a smattering of buttery chamomile and honey underneath. Phenolic belches complement the lingering honey flavors and lessen the sweetness, somewhat. Quite the fanciful witbier.
"
1," 500mL bottle. pours a dark amber color with small light tan head. very fruity aroma. has a roasted malt taste and the alcohol taste is covered nicely. not my favortie chimay but still very good.
"
1," DEC 27, 2010 I enjoyed this beer, though its pretty mellow for a seasonal winter ale.	Christmas Beeracle is a festive, rich, warm amber ale with a glorious medley of spices including cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg.
"
1," 22Oz bottle, thanx to DChmelas super sixpack shipper. Bewwwww! 	Great pure darkness cascading with a creamy fluffy head. Great stuff.
"
1," JUN 26, 2005 In the early Hagars days, this beer was a showcase for BC Kent Goldings.  A couple of batches were among the finest APAs Ive ever had.  Then that hop disappeared from the landscape and the beer became more of a standard-issue EPA similar to many others in the region.  Today, its a golden-amber ale with light bitterness, a faint papaya note, light maltiness, a hint of minerals.  Rather light overall, but with nice balance and complexity.  A subtle but enjoyable brew.  Of all the current Hagars brews, this seems to best evidence a shift from Gary Lohin to Howe Sound as it is crafted much the same as the HS beers.
"
1," Tried a fresh one - 2006 330ml bottle from the grog shop in Porirua.  Its still a great beer but not what it was only a few years ago.  Will put some away to see how it ages.  I now have some of each year 2000 - 2006.  The 2000 (1500ml bottles) remains the best each time I have a vertical tasting of it.
"
1," Growler.  Poured a very dark brown color witha ruby tint and a small tan head.  The aroma was fruity with coffee and light ash.  Coffe flavored with roasty malt.  Some tartness like you sometimes get with coffee.  Dry bitter finish.  Light to medium bodied.
"
1," It poured a dark hazy reddish liquid wiht a medium sized dirty white foam that dissapeared very fast. So fast it dissapeared before I had a chance to take a picture of it.		It had a sweet smell of caramell, spices and wood.		The mouthfeel was fairly smooth with a medium amount of carbonation. It had a medium body and a low bitterness. It had a sweet taste of caramell, vanilla, tea, sugar and wood.
"
1," Cask, Loughborough Fest 07.  Amber red with a small head.  Aromas are sweet malts and lemon with quite acidic notes.  Flavours are sweet and sour.  Vinous with some chocolate.  A bit of a mess.
"
1," Bottle from Rayboy.  Pours dark brown/black with a foamy tan head.  A decent coffee stout with all the standard attributes of chocolate, espresso, bitter roasts etc.  A bit thin but very enjoyable.
"
1," 12 oz bottle from Archer Liquors. Dark brown oily pour with messy brown head. Aroma of roasted malts, vanilla a bit of oak and alcohol. Flavors are similar but on the watery side, kinda bland, mouthfeel is oily. Not that impressed by this or the other barley Island availiable in my area.
"
1," A dark brown body with a foamy thick head. The aroma of leather and sour. The flavor was sour with Brets. A good full carbonation.
"
1," Bright red amber. Medium body with sweet herbal hop aromas. Toasty caramel malt flavors with prominent dried hop character.  Well carbonated. Somewhat sweet, but balanced with bitterness. Very nice.
"
1," I guess this isn't my favorite style of beer. Different to the IPA's and Stouts and Porters I'm used to. 750mL bottle. Unfiltered deep red/mahagony pour with a lacing tan head. Fruit/floral aroma. Kind of an odd taste, I thought it was a bad bottle, but the descriptions on this site match what I taste. Strong taste, sticks to the palate. Fruit, spice, and a definite yeast presence. Strong aftertaste, too much for me. Overall not bad for the style, but I don't want to get this again.

1," Bottle, 2.6%. Citric Radler aroma. Clear pale yellow colour. Small unstable white head. The flavour is sweet and citric. OK for a Radler.
"
1," Dark amber color, brownd and persistent foam.	Fantastic aroma, caramel, malt, porto, some caf andf fruit notes; mice beer!!!
"
1," Mildy hazed amber with a two finger beige cap eliminating into a small layer and chaotic waves of lace in its wake.  Aroma of citrus, oranges, caramel, malt and hints of toffee and perhaps pine.  Taste of resinous hops, grapefruit, caramel with a nice bittersweet finish that turns to bitter after a time.  Overall a nice IPA with a good sense of balance and flavor.
"
1," Pours a cloudy, deep shade of red with a thin white head. Sweet aroma with hints of yeast. Very smooth and not too carbonated. Tastes of sweet fruits, caramel, yeast, malts, with some hops. Well-balanced and complex in its flavor.
"
1," bottle, thanks to thirdeye11,  a reddish pour,  short white foam, aromas of mint, herb,  lemon, . flavors of bitter, sour, cocoa, rough dirtlike
"
1," Bottle courtesy of chadspivey.  Thanks for sharing this huge 1.5 L bottle!		Pours a rich reddish caramel color with a small beige head.  Smell is caramel, and fruitiness in the way of strawberries.  Taste is fruity, sweet caramelized raisin, red fruits (strawberry) and a fizzy body with medium thickness.  Nice flavor overall, and very pleasant and bubbly.  Solid beer.
"
1," No head, but high carbonation. Grey golden colour. Nose i s semisweet with a touch of smoke. Fulbodied and some length. A slittle sweet taste with light caramel and hay. Well ballanced but a littlte to thw sweet side. (must retry as it was better as draft at the Gasthof)
"
1," Clear golden, with a thin fizzy head, skunky lime aroma, lime taste with intriguing peppercorn? light malt and hops. This was a staple in my beer fridge last summer, and I not sure why... better than the Industrial Swill lime offerings like Bud & Chill.
"
1," Deep gold,thin fast fading white head.Acidy nose.Lightly acidic malt flavor
"
1," 75 cl botlle w/ cork and wire. Served in Chimay goblet. 2004 edition. 		Deep, hazy brownish red. Nice, clingy, off-white head w/ good lastability and lacing. Warm, spicy aroma - malty, slightly peppery. The flavor is full and rounded w/ great warmth and nice complexity. Malt dominates along w/ spices (pepper, among other things). Nicely balanced. Pleasant yeast presence. Impressive, fluffy yet full mouthfeel. Very easy to drink; a slight alcohol presence in the finish merely adds a pleasant warmth.
"
1," Bottle. Ruby Red in color.  Pours a good sized tan head than diminishes fairly fast. Some spotty lacing. Got a good whiff of alcohol in the aroma along with some yeast and fruit. Flavor starts of sweet with raisin and caramel ends with a some spice and a bit or an alcohol burn.  Rather smooth beer overall.I prefer the Rochefort 8 over this one though.
"
1," Hazy brown  color with nice ring of light brown-grey head.  Very fizzy body with a distinct hazy body.  Almost like a saison without brett.  Very dry finish - I really enjoyed this.  Thanks JK!!!!
"
1," This was in an international mixed pack from United Distributors. Golden yellow with a decent sized head that laced the entire depth of the glass. Sweet floral and green hop aroma. Same on the palate with nice pale malt evident and a little salty and bitter finish. Actually very enjoyable indeed, and in my opinion worthy of ""premium lager"" status. A pleasant surprise.
"
1," TheDM and Hotstuff vacation brew 9.  This draft brew was enjoyed at the Big River Brewery in Chattanooga Tennessee which was hosted by a pleasant accomodating staff.  The manager paid for our samples and even bought us appetizers to help clear our palates.  This brew poured a small head of off-white colored foamy finely sized bubbles that left behind a semi-transparent brown colored uncarbonated body.  It had avery mild dark malt aroma and the mnouthfeel was initially smooth and slightly tingly while finishing with a lingering mild brown tingle.  The flavor contained some of the good brown malt notes to it but not enough to be real good.
"
1," Lovely abbey dubbel. Nice murky dark colour with small head. Aroma and flavor is malty with a very delicat fruity note.
"
1," Draught, Seven BridgesBright gold.  Clean.  Slightly herbal aroma and palate.  Good balance.  Sweetish finish, refreshing.
"
1," Plum and mild alcohol nose, dark almost black with a large head that dissolved into a nice thin layer on top. Malty and sweet with a taste of plums with a kind of grape like bitterness that I will compare to some of the red wines I have tasted. Certianly enjoyable. Though I not sure I would make this a regular item in my fridge.
"
1," Biting odor, vaguely cinnamon/rhubarb. Deep reddish color, with auburn highlights. Medium white head. Biting, bitter flavor. Very carbonated.
"
1," (330ml Bottle from Waitrose) Poured very dark brown but had no head whatsoever. Spicy malt aroma with orange, vanilla and dark fruits all present. Not as BIG as expected though. Gorgeous flavour with a big chocolate and coffee finish and warming alcohol. Hints of spices and wine like fruit. So well balanced that it is difficult to pick individual flavours. Awesome though - big tasting with prickly carbonation and lovely smooth thick feel.
"
1," Hand bottle... Pours dark with a bubbly, light brown head. The aroma is a glorious swirl of sorghum molasses, pipe tobacco, chocolate and espresso. Full-bodied with a velvety mouthfeel and faint carbonation. The flavor is bold with lots of bittersweet blackstrap molasses and dark chocolate. Black malt and the accompanying ashy bitterness is added to attempt balance. In that regard, this beer fails. However, Im not always looking for balance. Im looking for interesting malts and hops and originality. So far, this brew is grossly underrated. Give it another try... or dont... your loss. Bottle shipped to me by StFun!
"
1," AUG 10, 2006 Better than the Rouge. A good beer. But what does that mean? I havent tried enough of it to feel confident about my judgement. Well see, but I sense a Duvel style disappointment emerging.
"
1," Aroma is robust yet light. Has a nice, off-white foamy head that lasts for quite a while. Taste is a lot like the aroma...light yet full of flavor. Goes down extremely smooth and leaves a nice aftertaste. Definitely a good beer to try, even at $10 a bottle.
"
1," Bottle.  Deep brown in appearance.  Rich, foamy pour.  Lazy head that slowly fades.  Soda-like in body with distinctive high alcohol coating of top of the mouth.  Odd mix of spice and fruit tones.   Eminently drinkable.
"
1," MAY 20, 2007 Va BF 07 Draft"
1," Pours very dark brown with lots of tiny tan particulate chunks and a 1 finger creamy tan head that has great retention. Aroma is floral, citrus, fruity yeast, yeasty bread dough, grass, lemon, pungent dark fruit and burnt sugar. Flavor is licorice, dark fruit, ginger, herbal notes, floral sweetness, earth notes, dark rye bread. Finish licorice, a little roast and a nice soft bread like quality. Palate is soft and somewhat chalky but creamy at the same time like chai with cream or something, carbonation level is just right.
"
1," Tasty dubbel. Reddish brown in colour. Fruity smell, Yeasty, fruity chocolaty taste. Not too diffrent from Chimay Blue but not quite as nice.

1," 22 fl oz bottle, courtesy of fiulijn. Pours clear and golden orange with a small white head. aroma is peachy, grapefruity and citrusy hops flavoured. Crisp hoppy and citrusy flavoured. Citrusy, orange fruity and slight mango flavoured.
"
1," Draught, Seven BridgesDark brown.  Nice chocolatey aroma.  Lightish body is nonetheless fairly smooth.  Chocolatey notes.  Decent example.
"
1," AUG 18, 2007 22 oz bomber.  Being a Buffalo Trace bourbon fan, I was looking forward to trying this one.  The nose is all bourbon, almost like you have a shot of bourbon in your hand.  The first sip is very strong with the oak and bourbon from the barrels, with a mild, smooth aftertaste.  A little one dimensional for this style, but very drinkable.
"
1," On draught at the brewpub.  It pours mahogany with a reduced ring head that leaves ring lace. The nose is roasted and malty, clean. Roasted malt flavors with licorice and cloves noted; nice touch to the style. Some nuttiness hits mid-palate and finishes with a nut skin crisp hop. Soft carbonation lends a smooth mouthfeel.  Decent nut brown, and an interesting take on the style with the lightly numbing licorice and clove.  Enjoyable.
"
1," Mid bodied, good carbonation. Dark red in color almost a maroon. This is a very good beer. Not too strong of a flavor but it has enough that it doesnt need to be that strong.
"
1," Bottle.  Malty chocolate and roast aroma, touch of air let out of a tire.  Pours opaque black with a soon-gone dark brown head.  Bitter, roasted, and burnt taste.  The stale air continues to plague this one - is it oxidation?  Lasts through the aftertaste.  Potent initial taste, will give it that.  Some oats and acidity, and a light woody note to accompany the mild bitterness.  Medium-light body with an occasional swish of sweetish creaminess.  Touch of hop prickle in the finish.  Needs some work before I award it the seal of approval.
"
1," JAN 23, 2007 Date on cork - 05/02; Best before - 2006; Deep copper colour lots of tan, rocky head. Yeast, plum, apple, and berry aroma. Plum and raisin flavours, with yeast and an underlying spicy but mellow bitterness. Creamy, smooth, and full bodied.
"
1," Dark amber with a reddish tint and an off-white head. Spicy, sweet aroma with hint of alcohol. Flavor is of dark ripe fruits, sweet malt, and a somewhat bitter finish. Any alcohol flavor is hidden by the thick malt. Its quite carbonated with a dry mouth feel.
"
1," ...overall, a great all around beer, with a good dose of alcohol.  Nice flavor, with fruity apricot notes, as well as a nice color in the glass.  Very well balanced, and always a great beer, like most Trappist beers, they know how to do it.
"
1," A dark brown pour. Aroma is very fruity -- dark cherry and plum. Flavor is of similar dried fruit and brown sugar/caramel malt. The dark fruit consumes the finish. Carbonation is very fine.

1," Bottle.  Deep dark red (with some brown) pour with a thick creamy, lacing tan head.  Roast, nuts, caramel, and some earthiness in the relatively potent nose.  Same notes in the mouth, earthy nuttiness dominating with gritty roast right behind.  Burnt and dry.  Aftertaste the same but with lingering hops.  A lot of flavor for a not-very-full body.  Pretty damn good for a Brown Ale, even manages to avoid most notes of sweetness... but still, just a brown ale.
"
1," Pours a deep cola brown with a fading fizzy off-white head and spotty lace. The aroma has notes of candi sugar, molasses, plum wine and figs, a hint of clove and cardamom, and a touch of tobacco. The taste starts fruity sweet and spicy with along spicy finish. Some notes of alcohol, red wine barrel and hop bittering. The mouth feel is quite sticky and lush, warming and soft carbonation. I am perplexed by this brew, there are some excellent characteristics but it still missed the mark overall for balance. ""E"" for the effort never the less.
"
1," 330ml bottle brought back to the arctic north from a supermaked in Crete!. Cloudy brown. Beige head. Fruity and sourish aroma. Milk caramel flavour profile with a rummy touch. Slight bitterness in the end. Crispated.Well rounded taste, but though a bit too sweet.
"
1," A somewhat mixed review. I liked it quite a bit, MB didnt so much. I liked the bitter finish on it, she thought it tasted a bit off. So who ya gonna listen to?
"
1," A white nice head, which didnt last that long. Darkbrown, little redish colour. Some sweetness in the smell and some malt. Little fruit and alcohol in aroma. Soft, round and creamy feeling in the mouth. Little cake or tart in the taste and some bready malt.
"
1," Botttle to tulip. Deep dark pour with tan head. Notes of toastiness and sweetness. Heavy bodied. A very interesting beer. I enjoy this one a lot. I definitely have a few four packs aging in my cellar. Very excited about that. Its pretty complex, but it seems to work very well. I love that it was aged in cabernet barrels. They impart unique qualities to it.
"
1," Murky dark brown beer with a rich, beige head that leaves a huge amount of lace behind. The aroma has some crunchy sugar, fruity hops, vanilla and banana. The taste has a lot of syrupy malt, a little iron and bittery hops.
"
1," Hazy orangish copper with a one finger beige quickly dissolving topper.  Aroma of nuts, sweet malt, ample, brown sugar and no real hop aroma.  Taste of caramel, mild nuttiness.  Cola-like and sweet the sweetness has kind of a funky aftertaste that just hangs.  Okay.
"
1," 33 cl bottle, Indianapolis, IN. Cola colour, faint sweet malt aroma that transfers to the flavor. Some sharp aftertaste on the finish, otherwise a decent beer.
"
1," Pours a golden colour with a very thin white head and light lacing. The aroma is hops and pine citrus and the taste is similar but little light on the palate. leave you with a bitter dry palate. enjoyable IPA
"
1," Bottle.  Poured a clear gold color with a two finger white head.  Aroma was malty with some random spice notes.  Flavor was biscuit.  This beer lacked the subtle hoppy bite that most pils have on the end.  Overall it was drinkable, but I wont buy it again.
"
1," Full British pint served at The Caffe Barney in Vancouver.  Clear copper brown with good head & excellent lace. Medium body - a good session beer. Sweet malt with some fruity notes.
"
1," OCT 2, 2004 Big foamy tan head on an acorn/copper colored body. Has a fruity aroma with big bursts of malt, and yeast. and  This beer is filled with big malty flavors, doughy yeast, light hops, and smooth alcohol. At first I thought it was a little bit overcarbonated but once it settled in the glass it was just perfect.
"
1," Bottle pours brown with reddish hues, large off-white fluffy head, small yeasties floating about, with fairly sticking lacing but no carbonation.  Aroma is of spices and apple/pear, maybe a light plum and raisin tinge as it warms.  Flavor is earthy, slightly nutty, maybe some of that light plum or raisin flavor.  Good body and mouthfeel, and that 9% ABV isnt even noticable.  Finishes with the typical belgian yeasty flavor, along with the spices.  This is one easy drinking, readily available, knock your socks off Belgian Strong Ale! 
"
1," I couldn't believe the head on this . . .poured it in a 14 oz. goblet and it maintained a 2-3 in froth for the duration of the drink.  Tasty, but not that much better than New Belgium's abbey offering.  I agree with Gusler though, that every drinker should try thisor their Blue at least once.  Cheers!
"
1," 33 cl. bottle.  Cloudy red/brown coulor with a big off-white head, that slowly fades to a fat cap. Aroma is those complex Belgian yeasts, brown sugar, bread, light pepper, and light apricots and banana.  Sweet taste with notes of bread, malts, sweet fruits and a light bitterness in the finish. Medium to full body, Nice and creamy texture. Long lasting finish. An excellent dubbel - enjoyed this one.
"
1," (Bottle 750 ml, Grande Rserve 2001, aged 7 years) Dark reddish brown colour with brief, frothy beige head. Spicy, earthy nose with notes of cellar, liquorice, dried fruit and black-currant. Malty, fruity, spicy taste with dried fruit, liquorice, hints of ginger, black-currant, chocolate and a spicy, fiery finish. Slightly earthy, but less cellar and more dark fruit in the flavours than in the aroma. Slightly above medium body, sweet but never cloying. Very nice, truly a classic.
"
1," Like a port with a very  speciel taste. The best beer I have ever tested. Colour and head is perfect.
"
1," A truly wonderful beer.  It isnt as complex as some other similar brews, just a straight forward blissful ale.  It has a yeasty, malty aroma with a wonderful full taste.  What really sets it apart for me is the mouthfeel.  It has a nice medium carbonation tingle that leaves jsut the right flavors lingering in your mouth, niether too oily or to watery.  Simply amazing.
"
1," its hazy brown with a huge beige head. musty smell, spices, cloves, yeast-mold smell. honey flavour, really rich fruit cake, dried figs, pleasant sourness, its good. ill admit i ate a lot of very spicy food right before this, slight dissapointment on the smell, though its still great!		rating adjustment.. after letting it warm up a bit, an incredible taste just like biting into a perfectly ripe black plum, opens up.. wow now i see...
"
1," Fennel?  Anise?  The taste is unique and pungent and those are, for now, the best approximations I can do.  This beer, though, is beautiful in the glass and in the mouth - it is the perfect symbol for the Bob Frost quote on my personal page.
"
1," Draught at Amberjack Tap House, Surrey, BCGolden color; small creamy head. Light malt and hop aroma. Creamy malt flavor, ordinary; the yeast more than the hop gives a light fruity final. Correct bitterness. Simple but pleasant.
"
1," Bottle. Golden clear colour with a nice average lasting big creamish head. Aroma of hops, grass and grains. Flavour is bit crispy, hoppy, grainy, some sweetness, bitter metallic finish. Better than Kotayk Lager.
"
1," JAN 25, 2005 I figure I would go ahead and re-rate this. The first bottle(750) I had must have been defunked. I had this a few nights ago, in the smaller bottles, at a club. Man, I went through 3 of em in a new york minute!! Deep brown pour with a conventional cocad head that layed around in a creamy manor throughout the drink. Taste was soft and sweet with a chewy feel. Nice overall sweet and spicey aroma and taste. Plums, a little clover, brown sugar, some cherry and mollasses. Second time around, ding ding!
"
1," Pours orange with a white head. Heavily carbonated. Aroma is of weak hops, alcohol, dirt, caramel, grass, and malt. Doesnt smell very attractive. Taste is of hops that are way past their prime, dirt, grass, and citrus. Has a backbone of dirty malt soaked in caramel and smegma. Mouthfeel is very carbonated. What a very unpleasant beer, with no drinkability or redeeming factors. A dismal dissapointment.
"
1," From a 12 oz. embossed green bottle with no bottled/freshness date.		Poured a hazy dull amber with a foamy head that settled into a thin lacing.		Aromas of metallic melts, light spices and sweet lemony.		Fizzy carbonation and a smooth without much crispness light bodied mouthfeel.		Bland, watery roasted and metallic malts, a watery spiciness, a light lemon flavor and a watery finish with a strange metallic flavor lingering in the palate that hurts the drinkability.		I didnt find this to be too pleasing and for a dunkel, pretty poor overall.
"
1," Clear crimson coloration, with busy fizzing above in the beigish head, which dies quickly..nose is spicy, sweet, caramel, and cola, dark fruits and more, but, really, not enough...these days, I expect more from a dubbel. 	In the mouth, tasty enough, but not much more than average...nutty, slightly chocolatey, very light, very lean, leaves the palate quickly, though...and a dull fuzz remains on the tongue, and dies...pretty average, really. 	Boy, this used to be a good beer, I mean, a really good beer, but, this is just kind of dull. Medium bodied, dull, soporific finish...fizzy cola-ish taste...very dull, compared to other Belgian, hey, even, no, especially American offerings!!!	I am damned disappointed in the dullness of this rather dreary, lackluster, coasting- on -the- coattails- of- its- past-kind of brew. 	Its been several years since Ive had a bottle of this, and it may be many more, now that Ive had it again. Its like you get a glimmer of the taste, but it dies too quick, and does nothing...thisshould never be thought of as an exemplar ofthis style, if you really want to try the real stuff...even Maredsous is better than this!	A better beer than, say Milwaukees Best, but not a match for St. Bernardus or even Allagash!
"
1," Nice trappist. Considerably better than Chimay Bleue. (This beer rating was imported from FB and unfortunately lacks any further comments.)
"
1," (bottle) Clear and pale golden colour with a foamy white medium head. Herbal hoppy and slightly grainy malty aroma. Moderately bitter flavour, medium bodied, crispy mouthfeel. Initially light sweet malty, dry and medium bitter hoppy finish. Decent Pils.
"
1," I dont really know what to say.  Monks make this stuff, and they deserve  eternal life and happiness for making such a delicious beverage.   As I was drinking this glass (poured from the cute small bottles - $4.50 @ Whole Foods) I couldnt figure out if I liked the blue, red or the white the best.  I guess thats the key to a good brewery, you cant pick a favorite.  All I know is this is good and im glad its so widely available.
"
1," 75cl, new French Trappist Anno 2011, from 2nd Gents Bierfestival, thx to Klaas!, complex brew, spicy/malty and slightly sweet/bitter, balanced, hazy, good head, good brew
"
1," simply my favorite beer. Dark, big taste but at the same time not strong. Goes great with more or less everything - and also just to drink. Just dont take to many...
"
1," Dark brown in color. Fresh aroma of plums, raisins a little yeasty on the nose. Alcohol is mild, doesnt interfere with the balance of malts and dried fruit. Still not as creamy and bold as I excpected. The aftertaste leaves me warm but unispiring. Overall still enjoyable.
"
1," APR 3, 2007 My favorite beer until recently - my experience is that Chimay quality is very inconsistent. Which is a real shame, because when you get a good bottle its great - too bad my last two bottles had a really unpleasant alchohol taste - stick with something with better quality control. Or e-mail the monks and tell them to make the beer before they get fed up!
"
1," Pours a dark amber with little head.Aroma is strange hard to describe.Definately sweet.Flavor is crisp, slightly fruity, malts and quite crisp.The finish was clean.It did linger for a bit but not too long.
"
1," Big head, good darkish brown in coulour. Woody nose, kind of alcoholish and slightly bitter. Overall, very good and drinkable. I am typically not a fan of ""dark"" beers, but this was plesant.
"
1," Bottled 50cl. Courtesy of Quack-Duck. It pours a murky amber beer with a tall, nicely remaining lacing creamy head. Caramel, mocha, raisin, asparagus, walnut, lemon peel, vanilla and brown sugar in both nose and taste. Malt accented. Good bitterness. A bit too sticky. Wonderful finish which makes you eager to take another sip. Delicious. Thanks a lot Stefan!
"
1," (bottle) Clear, golden colour with a dense, mid-sized foamy white head. Sweet and a bit biscuity pale malty aroma with a shy grainy and fruity touch. Sweet flavour with a light but balancing bitterness, medium bodied with a soft and pleasant mouthfeel. Pale malt-character with biscuits and a light grainy touch; medium-dry, sweet and slightly bitter finish with shy hoppy notes and alcohol showing up. Not overly exciting, but still decent pale Bock (17.05.08).
"
1," Pours medium brown with light head and little carbonation. Very easy to drink for its ABV. Light and fruity at the finish. Truly a fantastic beer.
"
1," pours hazy gold with very nice fothy white head,nice fruity nose hints of raisin,yeast.very nice aroma..aaaahhhh.tastes sweet at first.nice bitterness along sides of tounge and a dry bitter quick finish.Makes you want another drink.Very nice enjoyable beer.
"
1," Color is hazy, golden orange. Head is quite thick and lacing is nice and long lasting. Fruity and yeasty aroma is also dry. Taste is spicy, fruity, sour, yeasty with a hint of alcohol. Hops brings nice bitterness. Palate is medium and much carbonated. Foams quite much in mouth.
"
1," Dark ruby colored.  Smells of dark fruits and wood.  The flavor is very sweet, and a little spicy.  Very full, almost sticky, mouthfeel.  Quite good.
"
1," Bottle. Beer of the month club. Hazy golden with a big frothy white head. Great aroma of citric, floral and slightly piney hops. Flavor is hoppy and grapefruity with some sweetish crisp malt in the background.  Lingering citric bitter finish. Medium-bodied. A very good IPA.
"
1," Draft. Pours dark amber with a beige head. Sweet malts dominate the aroma and flavor. Dry finish.
"
1," (draft). Clear golden color. Small white head. Hoppy pine aroma. Light hop flavor. Avg duration. Light bitter finish. Slick texture. Moderate carbonation. Spare lacing.
"
1," 750ml bottle from the LCBO	A more detailed description will follow on a second tasting	I have misplaced my comments for this beer
"
1," Sampled at Seven Bridges in Jacksonville. Pours a dark brown with a good clarity. The aroma gives off scents of chocolate, slight smokiness. Pretty good.
"
1, A bright and crisp hoppy blonde Ale.  Refreshing and tasty.	How
1," Pours a dark chocolate brown color, topped by an inch or so of very soft light tan foam. Nice lacing. Some sweet smelling chocolate malt in the aroma.		Bready malt flavor with some bitter chocolate, raisin, and a little coffee. A little bit of burnt raisin in the aftertaste. The medium to full body is softly carbonated, and kept going strong due to an authentic etched-bottom Chimay glass.
