1,"5 ENTHUSIASTIC STARS This is a large, well maintained botanical garden, teeming with birdlife and abundant in blooming cacti, succulents & other flowers. Even though it can be HOT, it is very easy to spend half a day here, as we did, wandering the trails. If you need a break, there is a patio cafe where you can get a cool one. This place is a true delight and a great asset for Phoenix."
1,Decent food at a good price. Bargain lunch specials in a good atmosphere.
1,"Good food, friendly people. We like the Gold Strike Burger -- we get it almost every time. Also try the shrimp appetizer and the bread pudding dessert. Appetizer and dessert, plus a Kiltlifter Beer or two, is sometimes all you need. The only sad thing is, because they are a bit off the beaten track, they will have to close for the summer, until November. We will miss them until then."
1,"My boyfriend and I were searching for a dive near our house in Old Town for when we just aren't feeling the typical Scottsdale vibe. I gotta tell you, I think we found it. We walked in around 7 on a Thursday night, just looking to have a few drinks and some time to talk. I immediately realized this was not an Old Town bar. I think I might have been the youngest person there and no one was pretentious at all. They have a dart board and pool table, and seating with walled mirrors all around. The patio was extremely well-misted, which was great since it was the day before 4th of July and everyone was pretty much sweltering. Drinks were stiff and not too expensive and the crowd grew younger as the night went on. I didn't meet tons of people, but the ones iI did either seemed drunk, super nice or both - not a bad combination. I would go back again, just not every night (what do you think I am, an alcoholic?) Also - for those of you with bladders of steel and small wallets, I saw a sign that says they do bladder buster deals on Tuesday night. Small cover and incredibly cheap drinks until someone ""breaks the seal"". I would suck at this, but I'm sure many a person has taken advantage of this interesting drink special."
1,AMAZING! This is the first time I ever got what I ordered!!!!! 140 degree grande peppermint latte! WOWZA! YIPPEE! Though the staff did not seemed thrilled to be there or had any sort of personality-it didn't matter because my drink was perfect:) FYI-this was the location outside of the B security check-point.
1,"3 stars - Yelp says - A OK That means, sure, I'd go back and I should state here and now that the 3 stars might not be all their fault but my fault too. Plan to see mid-week movie with my daughter who teaches at junior high school and after school volleyball and we have plans for 7:45 movie which means time is compressed. Daughter has limited sense of adventure for foods so I figure this place always offers her bail-out choice of Italian. Enough background... Problem is, I had lunch too late and I arrived less than hungry. I'm equivocal what to order. I ask waiter for advice (mistake). I order cream soda and he comes back and asks me what flavor and listing too many choices. I order cherry and it seems to be a club soda with grenadiene (sp?) - mistake. Orders arrive - daughter shocks me by ordering Pad Thai which was quite good. I get winter special of Ishikari - Salmon, cabbage, tofu and rice noodles rather cleverly cooked in a miso based soup in industrial type mini-bucket with oak sealing lid and apparently brought to table from oven. The salmon infusion into the miso was an incredibly delightful broth. The salmon appeared to be generous, good quality but a bit undercooked and I didn't have the time window to do anything about it. The rest...the tofu / cabbage / etc. seemed to derive no benefit from the delightful miso broth. So in the end...I probably could have given them 4 stars because there is nothing inherently wrong with CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe. The waiter wasn't all that helpful but he was available at the most important times and we managed to get orders, served and check paid in time for movie which by other reviews worried me because of our narrow time window and the fact that this place is indeed busy. I would definitely return a much wiser person and next time, I go with my gut instinct and order the Champon as I had intended to the first time."
1,"Walked into this place on a Saturday night (i am from out of town) with my 4 girl friends...this place is HUGE! Very packed and loud but in a fun way. Love the decor and ambiance. Huge bar in the middle with a nice wine list and a variety of drink options. The wait was a little annoying, as we had reservations and still had to wait about 40 minutes. The menu had some vegetarian options, not a whole lot, but what i ate was really good. The vegetable Crostini appetizer was amazing and the Hummus was not that bad either. I had the margarita pizza which was good, my friends had a pasta with chicken and they loved it as well. The sangria we had was ok, I've had better in Chicago. The crowd was upbeat and lively, seemed to have quite a few out of towners as well, and the age ranged anywhere from college to seniors...price wise it wasn't the cheapest place but it won't rip a hole in your pocket either."
1,"My sweet hubby brought me here for my b-day the other night. Note, this is a Scottsdale 5 star, otherwise known as a Chicago, California, or New York 4 star rating. This may possibly be my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. Amazing food. Unpretentious and cozy atmosphere. Got the steak frites. Asked for veggies instead of frites and ended up with steak green beans. It was excellent. We asked for a smooth red wine. I had possibly my second best red wine ever. We also ordered a scallop appetizer and the escargots. Both were cooked almost to perfection - however lacking in salt for my personal preference, which is an easy fix. I would definitely go back. Don't recommend this for large parties. However, it is the perfect place for smaller, intimate parties."
1,"We recently moved nearby Pho Ao Sen and dine there often. I love their food, the service, and also the atmosphere. My favorite's are the bun dishes, I always order the no. 26 with chicken instead of pork and they have a delicious vegetarian lemongrass beef vermicelli that I would highly recommend. Pho Ao Sen is a great place to dine with friends, mine have always enjoyed the experience."
1,"i just finished licking my fingers clean and almost ate the dressing-drenched paper that held my very first, and surely not last, lucky boy international burger. crispy bun, tons of dressing, fresh lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions, and a perfectly tender, smokey burger. thick, perfectly salted, crunchy on the outside and soft and burning hot on the inside fries. thick and deliciously sweet chocolate and peanut butter shake. gone. in less than 5 minutes. place closes early, so unfortunately there will be no drunk trips through the dangerously narrow drive thru."
1,"This was a brand new experience for me, but so much fun! The staff was very patient and helpful, and we felt perfectly safe after some one-on-training even though we were all newbies. Only complaint is that the beginner's walls were a little crowded, while there were a lot of super advanced walls not being used. May want to swap the ratio to match the customer base. But a very good time and an amazing workout. It may be days before I can lift my arms again..."
1,"This place really hits the spot. It's everything a hamburger place should be and nothing it shouldn't. Their burgers are good-sized and delicious. I attribute their scrumptiousness to the bread in the buns, but their meat is phenomenal as well; add some cheese and green chiles, and it's like a bunch of awesome ingredients decided to get together to take part in creating one of the best burgers in town with a little help from the grill. The fries are effing good too. The pitchers of beer are cheap and cold, and if you want to feed your inner hipster they also have bottles of PBR and cans of Schlitz. Not a lot to feast the eyes on - the place has a real old-school ""bar"" feel - but the food compensates for what it may lack in elegance."
1,"10/12 Friendly and quick, although I had to point out a few spots where extra attention was needed (tar on one side was initially observed as paint scratch, until I told them to check it again). I also found a few spots that could've used another one or two swipes of the towel, and the sunglass case was never touched and thus dirty. Be sure to visit during the early part of the week, and not on the weekend to grab the best deals- I paid $100 for both interior and exterior detailing. Am so happy with the overall results- the spots between the bottom of my car seats and the floor are completely clean of caked-on food debris (I am living in the middle of the desert, after all) from a few mishaps throughout the years!"
1,"Finally a place to watch local sports with sound. I always find it unbelievable that many sports bars here in town look past our local teams and support the foreign hoards from Wisconsin, Minnesota, NY, Illinois etc.. Not at Dukes...local first. Please return to your frozen tundras and leave us with the Suns, Cardinals, Devils and Coyotes. The food here is nice bar/pub fare and is always fresh and hot. Drinks are plentiful and service respectable. Would like to see a little more variety on the taps but other than that Dukes is a great place to catch a game."
1,"Family friendly and we love the soups and salads. Mushroom soup is our favorite!!!! We also enjoy their veggie sandwich but all of them that we have tried are delicious. Sunday brunch is great too. We do frittatas or banana pancakes, yum. Or a simple Wildflower capaccino and scone does the trick. We'be been going for years and will continue to go. Oh, did I mention the free WiFi? Great for some business lunches."
1,"For the price, Xona is a clean, beautiful spot in North Scottsdale adjacent to the upscale Princess Resort. Place was virtually empty during our recent two-day stay, so we had a tranquil pool all to ourselves. Unlike some of the other reviewers, we received great service from the staff. Food from the onsite restaurant was tasty and convenient. Surrounding area safe for walking or jogging. We stayed in a king suite...comfortable and roomy. Thought this place was a bargain."
1,"I went out last night in search of a restaurant with good soup, but instead decided to try Texas Roadhouse. As soon as you walk in, you feel welcomed and right at home. The staff are all smiling and welcoming you, and just the atmosphere of the place was great! Roasted peanuts await you at your table, along with some delicious bread! I had a bacon cheese burger, which I could only finish half, while my husband had a steak that he actually enjoyed! Our waitress kept up with the drinks and checked up on us enough, but not to much to where she was bothering. All in all the service and food was great! I will definitely recommend it to others, and be back myself!"
1,"We had a very nice meal here last night. The curries were pretty authentic and carried enough spice to make them very tasty. Unusual location but it wasn't hard to find. Good service, though we were only ones there when we finished at 8pm."
0,"Played today, course in decent shape for the money. Would be nice if they would educate groundskeepers on not running mower up to you when trying to play. Also would be nice if beverage service would continue after 4 oclock. Course was packed play was slow and no beverage service. Called in but pro shop phones shut off at 4 30 . No ranger on course either to keep groups moving ended up not finishing eighteen,teed off at 12 30."
1,"Located in the W Hotel in Old Town Scottsdale, this hipster hangout is always busy. I recommend a reservation if you're planning to dine here. The Better Half and I drop in here from time to time. Since I don't eat Sushi, I order: Ji-Dori Chicken Skewers withTeriyaki Sauce - $10 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=x_60nAIMvJX9k_s9HAPiOA Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus with Soy Mirin Sauce - $15 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=19cHPtx8ahwZTPC5xIARFQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=_4XhXTuYKQnypHmylm-mQg And for Dessert, a warm Chocolate Cake...yum! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=KoyBtoSTBrhM2dLD8zs_PA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=iKBiwthdGtENIqWfGK1V1A The Chicken Skewers are very tasty. The Teriyaki Sauce they are glazed are sweet and have the right amount of ""sour"" kick to it to balance the flavor. The Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus is awesome...the Filet is tender and juicy and the Asparagus compliments it well. Of course, the Chocolate Cake dessert is a nice ending for the meal. The service can be a bit slow at times, depends on the server. Generally speaking, it's pretty good considering how busy they are. The people watching here is pretty good...watching all of the hipsters is hilarious. Return Factor - 93%"
0,Meh....decent Filibertos knockoff but the place feels like a major health hazard considering how new it is. Just think Filibertos with less quality control and smaller portions.
1,"Holy crap is this place good. With the gazillion milkshake flavors to choose from, I had vanilla....... kinda anti-climatic I know. Next time though. The burgers were huge with 20 some odd topings to choose from. I had onions and pickles...... I know, another let down. Next time I sware. Also the onion rings are tops here. Fries looked good too. The decore is a nice 50's diner type with very friendly staff. Outdoor seating is nice when it's not hot out and it's very close to the theatre which makes it the perfect stop before seeing Mama Mia........ J/K on that one. Saw Batman."
1,"So I am not usually in the Tempe area, but a friend told me about this place. So I though I would go try it out. I got a Grande Latte that was around $4. Not a bad price. But what made it worth it was that I guess this Friday I went was a Free Shot Friday. So I got an extra Espresso shot in my latte making it a triple for $4 bucks...no that is a deal. Not sure if they always have the promotion on Fridays. But it sure did make my morning a little better. Their menu is very easy to read and give those no too educated in the was of coffee a good description of what each drink is and how it is made. The had a ton of great looking pastries even though I didn't sample any. Cakes, Eclairs, Scones, and I think even what looked like cheesecake. The decor was very interesting. An old fashion coffee house meets a gypsy vibe. I think they have Wifi too. I saw a few people on there computers. The service was a little slow I think. Felt like I was waiting for my drink for 10 minutes and the place was not really that busy. This was probably because of the guy ahead of me when I walked in who had about 7 different modifications to his drink. I have worked in a coffee place and those people are kind of annoying. So I will let them slide on the time of service. Overall a great experience. Would have been 3 stars, but when you get something for free, in my book that is an automatically another star."
1,"My experience at Old Town Tortilla Factory is probably very different than that of the average patron. I dined here with a semi-private party with 40 other guests and we were served buffet-style. Our group was seated in their outdoor dining area, which I absolutely loved. I thought the atmosphere was great and brought an authentic Southwest feel and vibe to the restaurant. The food was as decent as you would expect sharing buffet-style with 40 other people lined up outdoors: nothing mind-blowingly memorable, but nothing too bad, either. My one complaint would be the servers. Especially at our single table of 8, it did not seem the server we were assigned was equipped to take care of a large group. There was much unnecessary confusion at the end of the night when it came down to settling some bar tabs. Overall, it did not ruin our experience, but definitely took away from the overall positivity. Regardless, I would love to come back here with a smaller group and enjoy a fresh plate of food! The outdoor dining is definitely something you can't pass up..."
1,"This is my favorite public pool in the entire valley. It's super cheap - 2.25 for adults, 1.00 for kids. You can bring in drinks and snacks as long as they are not in a cooler (weird). They have a snack bar. It's very clean. Oh and the most important part, they have a lazy river, two big water slides, a whirlpool, toddler play area with more slides, basketball, lap pool, diving boards.... I think that's it. It's quite a drive but it's worth it."
1,This place is great for a big group of people. We originally thought we were going to have 6 people. We ended up having 11 by the time everyone showed up. The staff was more than happy to accommodate us. The Kota Athenian chicken is very good. The price range is moderate. All in all a fantastic place.
1,"...NOW WE'RE TALKIN'! Killer Mexican Food! The chips 'n salsa kicks ass! You get a red, blue & regular tortilla chips with reg, spicy salsa & bean dip! Hellava start! A kick-butt margarita! Had Chicken Fajitas!...THE BEST! Cannot wait to return! Great ambiance."
1,"Great Korean Kalbi and other table top meats. rest of the dishes wasn't that impressive . Weekend could be really busy you might need to wait for a while to get your food. but weekdays pretty slow. If you like Korean BBQ, this is the best place in chandler ,gilbert area."
1,Had breakfast this morning while waiting on getting my windows on my car tinted. I had the build your own omelete. I got it with chorizo bell peppers and cheddar cheese. It was pretty good and the portion size was big for the price. They had fresh squeezed orange juice too. Not the best breakfast I've had but it was good.
1,I was at Liberty Market this morning for breakfast. The grilled bread pudding is amazing. And the bathrooms are so adorable!
1,"I am very happy to say that Angela's truffles are taking off here in Cottonwood. I hope I am allowed to say I am a proud purveyor. When they arrived I was impressed by their design and further blown away by the flavor. (Tears in my eyes...) My darling, have no fear, there are people up here who understand flavor, quality and most importantly: Great Chocolate! My beautiful patrons have latched onto these delectable wonders and I am happy to say The Cocoa Palette will always have a place in Northern AZ Wine Country with Bonne Lait! Bravo mon ami!"
1,"The PERFECT Breakfast :) If only I could have this every day :) Matt's is all you want a breakfast spot to be...cute, friendly and the most amazing food out there. I highly recommend the hog and chick. You just can't go wrong with eggs*, bacon*, home fries* (get the home fries, not the hashbrowns) and their toast* served with Terra Verde Farms preserves. * = best ever, ever, ever I could write on and on...you've seen the reviews. Just make sure to make it there, you won't be sorry, you'll be addicted!"
1,Excellent family owned business that knows how to make real Italian dishes! Their prices are a little on the high side but you get plenty and it's good. We had enough left over for next day's lunch. The waiter was nice and attentive even though it started to get packed at around 7ish. They even gave us free Amaretto drinks after dinner! :) Going back for another romantic dinner soon.
1,"This was my first trip to Culver's and it came highly recommended. At my friends suggestion, I tried the butter burger deluxe, fried cheese curd and the.....I forgot what it was called, but the frozen custard - basically the equivalent of a DQ Blizzard. The burger patties were paper thin (thus the reason I ordered the double), the lettuce was crisp, tomatoes fresh, bun soft and buttery. I thoroughly enjoyed my burger. Very flavorful! I had never had fried cheese curd and had no idea what to expect. The closest thing I can think to compare these to would be mozzarella sticks. They are about the size of a grape, and full of salty cheesy goodness. The custard was delicious! I had the vanilla with butterscotch and oreos (I ordered butterscotch and brownie pieces, but there was a mixup, but I had no complaints). I really loved everything I had. The menu is big and I can't wait to go next time so I can try something new. The thing I didn't like was the bible verses all over the walls. Seriously?? It's not that I am anti-religion or anything. I am Catholic, went to Brophy and go to church twice a year. I don't need it thrown in my face while trying to eat with my friends. take a tip from In and Out. Put them on the under side of your cups. Work on your subtlety Culver's."
1,"I hate food shopping. Okay that is probably an understatement. When I go to a big market I am so overwhelmed and usually end up with a million things I don't need, while forgetting the things I do need. Fresh & Easy is small, but it has most things I need. I like that they have meats and chicken that already have seasoning on it and are ready to cook. This makes shopping extremely easy. I also really like their brand of food, especially the pasta. I think it's some of the best tasting store bought pasta I have had. Don't go here if you need to buy kitchen supplies like cake pans or cookie sheets. They simply have food, drinks, wine and beer here."
0,"Have been going to LGO since 2003 and have always enjoyed the cuisine. Several times - either when ordering in the grocery or dining at the Pizzeria - the music has been so headsplitting as to wipe out any ambience or semblance of a welcoming neighborhood restaurant. Last night the demographic in the Pizzeria during the course of our meal ranged from 30-80 years of age. Several pleas to turn the music down just enough to be able to hear the waiter standing next to me were greeted with ""it's just how we do things"" and ""there's no point in asking because they won't turn it down even a little"". The waiter, David, said many servers consistently relay complaints but that the owner ""really doesn't care"". Hubris is so unappetizing. I think the food is great but, because I have no desire to support a business that really doesn't give a crap about its clientele, I'll spend my money lavishly elsewhere."
1,"Despite all the recent bad reviews of this place, I actually liked it. The heat inside isn't THAT bad, people. Yes, it's warmer than the 75 degrees you keep in your house, but it's not the 110 outside. I went the other night to see A House Divided (which you would like if you like Chevelle and Breaking Benjamin) and it was ROCKIN'. Sound was pretty good. I like how it's small enough for the band members to see who is standing in the back and terrorize them. Ladies... one stall in the bathroom. Be forewarned that there is going to be some drunk chick that will probably go and make a mess in there. Just plan on not using it as the evening progresses. All in all... it's a pretty good experience. I like that those who aren't drinking get to be up front."
1,"I found the food excellent, but keep in mind this isn't typically Mexican food this is Tex-Mex which is a whole different variety. Our waitress was fantastic, and talked me into getting the melted cheese on the side. It was quite tasty, indeed it has a bit of skin but generally if you cook cheese or milk included products into a liquid quickly it does get one..and personally I didn't haven't issue about it. The menu isn't extensive, it would be nice to have a bigger menu but with how accommodating the are, you could probably something off the wall and they'd be willing to do it. I ordered the bean and cheese burrito, which is delicious, and large. Its a fatty, and I loved it. When asked if they cook with lard the hostess had an immediate answer and listed what they used to cook everything with. I was so happy. Most have no idea, and aren't very polite if you ask. She was very friendly like everyone else we encountered there. I was told that the Steak was perfect, and mr.hard-to-please was filled up (had left overs) and stayed that way the rest of the night. Which was great. The salsa has an interesting flavor, and I must I dig it. I""m not a big fan of mexican rice so I didn't partake in eating it, however the fan of mexican rice at the table liked it, (but not as much as the fajitas) Conclusion - Excellent Staff, Great Food (Its Tex-Mex..not just Mex so bare that in mind. There is a difference!) Atmosphere reminds me of some place that would be placed in a Tarantino film. Price is average sit down if not a little high. Expect 2 people = over 30 dollars."
1,"Went here for brunch this morning (Sunday) and there were a few things that diminished the experience for me: * You claim New Mexican grub and then you charge for chips and salsa or sopapillas which are standard complements to any New Mexican restaurant meal. * At $3, the coffee is a rip off! Seriously? We're not talking cappuccino, people and you're selling build-your-own Bloody Marys for the same price! * The carne adovada was tender but not very spicy. That said: * The green salsa was really good. * I'm so desperate for carne adovada, I'll settle. (besides, $9 is more than a fair price for 3 eggs, black beans and carne adovada in a bowl on a flour tortilla - even if it was more beans than pork.) * There are several options for $5; and, if they are all like the eggs benedict, they are generous portions. * The patio is nice and the bar area feels like a neighborhood pub (not a cave, but that's not got to be a bad thing!)"
0,"Not bad, but not great. Service was really friendly, and prompt. Food was ""meh"", maybe I just ordered the wrong thing."
1,"The first time I went to YC's was in scottsdale. I loved how you choose what you like in your bowl and sauces. they cook it up right in front of you. you can stuff your bowl as much as you can. don't worry about getting alot because all you pay for a take out box is 50 cents. it is great for leftovers, the food tastes fresh still. The one in tempe was awesome as well. I love this place. I had one larg bowl, a bowl of rice, chicken soup, and a soda for $10.25 how can you go wrong with that???"
1,"I love this place, saves me and my family some serious cash. I do agree with allot of the other reviewers on the meat and produce - my wife gets those from the store across the street. I also love the fact that they have a Sushi shop inside the store. Makes a great quick snack. The lady the works there will make almost anything you want. And, you can call in your ""order"" ahead if needed. She (or her son) have never let me down in quality and freshness of the Sushi."
1,"I visited one Sunday afternoon just to check it out in reply to an ad I saw to visit for free for (5) days. Typically, when you respond to ads like that from a gym, the staff requests your information such as name, address, & phone so they can sell you on a membership later. That was not the case with me. It was very informal. I advised I was not a member and wanted to give their place a shot. The guy in the front desk said come right on in; no personal information requested and no tour. I'm glad there was no sales pressure. I thought the no tour part was kind of odd, but after doing my walk through, I understand why. The place is not very big. They have weights and cardio machines and the treadmills each had a personal television on the machine. The whole facility appeared clean and there were free towels for the taking for your workout. The lockers in the men's locker room were really nice. They were made brown wood. You can view a sample of the interior of the facility on their website. They looked really classy, but they were not free. There were cabinets offered outside of the locker rooms that you can keep your personals in with a latch that allows you to insert your personal lock on. There was also a small room for classes. I wasn't very impressed with this gym mainly because it was very small. I came during a Sunday afternoon when most gyms don't see much traffic so I don't know what it's like during normal high traffic periods such as early mornings and after 5pm on weekdays. I would imagine that due to the small size of this gym that they cater more to the very local crowd. I wouldn't give this location a poor rating because there wasn't really anything that stood out that was negative other than the limited space and equipment. You might think of this location as the alternative to the larger chain gyms like 24 Hour Fitness, LA Fitness, or Lifetime Fitness. You can always take a look for yourself; apparently, they don't provide too much sales pressure for visitors. Anyway, that's my say on Mountainside Fitness at Bell Rd in North Scottsale next to the Ice Den skating rink."
0,"Busy right after school which is to be expected...Wasn't very clean which is disappointing, especially for an ice cream parlor. We stopped in to try the new soft serve ice cream with sprinkles that turn the ice cream a new color. Don't know if the boy behind the counter was stingy or what, but the kids got only a couple of sprinkles that didn't even cover the ice cream which was disappointing considering they charge for them. All in all wouldn't visit this location again. We prefer the one closer to home :)"
1,"The staff is great, the food is great, even the cappuccino is great (had my first one today). i work close by and I have a choice where to eat and it's very often Acacia for breakfast and lunch. A few of my favs are: - Chicken Salad Sandwich - Southwest Ranch Salad - Omelets Enjoy! (maybe I'll run into you there)"
1,"This place literally just opened. I didn't really know what to expect, but when I walked in the doors I was immediately greeted by Nick, and he was very nice and down to earth. This is a shop for people who like to garden/grow plants hydroponically or in the ground. They have all kinds of gardening supplies and Nick said they will be receiving their seed shipment from Seeds of Change any day now. I will definitely be back, as my green thumb (or lack thereof) has been sparked:) P.S. I was informed that the in the next issue of the New Times, Grotown will have an add to clip out and bring in to save 20% !!Yay plants:)"
1,"Our waiter was Vincent. Very polite, helpful, accommodating, and knowledgeable about the menu and the taste of each item. Service was A+! The food was fantastic. No errors, was tasteful, unique, and fresh! I will definitely come here again."
1,"I almost wept when I saw they had opened a Slices at this end of town. I don't know what makes this pizza so wonderful, but it's delicious. Try the veggie or white pizza... I hear the potato bacon is good too. The downside: The place is usually wicked hot inside. I dunno if they are trying to save a couple bucks and not run the A/C but those ovens make it warm! Just grab your slices and go sit outside in the foodcourt area instead."
1,"Pretty good food. Place is funky, weren't many people in there for a Saturday lunch (especially considering the proximity to ASU) but the service was decent and the food was good. Very inexpensive, 2 lunches and drinks for $15. I'll stop by again when I'm out that way."
1,I really enjoy this place and have eaten there several times. They just recently changed their menu but I like the brew additions. The coconut shrimp are awesome and the ahi tuna salad is to for for! I did have the chimichurri flank steak sliders but they weren't good. Our waitress was great and offered me something else.
1,Mojo made me fall in love with fro yo. I love Mojo's Twitter Tuesdays where you can get half off of your fro yo. The location is awesome; I can go to Mojo between classes. It's here where I found my love of the pomegranate & acai flavors as well. They have awesome seasonal flavors as well as the other usual staples. I love their different toppings and it's a good place to hang out with friends and get your Mojo on :)
1,"flemings is always top notch. we went for the thursday night wine tasting 20 wines for $25 introducing there new 100 wines by the glass. The selection was good from lite whites to deep reds a great way to sample a portion of there new wine list. then to top it off we received $25 gift cards for dinner. so we stayed and had the AZ resturant week pre fix dinner for $39 the food was wonderful. salads, soup lamb chops and filet. i guess to sum it up you can't go wrong with a meal from flemings. they also have a great happy hour."
1,Island Terrayki is a great place to eat at. The owners are nice the prices are right you can't go wrong with that. My coworkers and I have been going there for a few years now and we all love it. Highly suggest eating here if you are in the northwest valley and want some good quality food.
0,"I was stuck between wanting to give a two star & three star. The concept of this place is a great idea. I have to say that if you happen to go on a day that there's a large party going on, it kinda like you're an unwanted fly on the wall. This play town is located in a large older shopping center that blends in with the other faded store fronts. Inside, the owners seemed to be very nice, although stressed due to hosting a party there. I was very bummed that the jump house was removed. That was 65% of the reason to go. All in all it had it's little themed houses to play in, but the whole place seemed to need a good fresh painting as well as cleaning. $8 admission."
1,"When dining out, I am a big fan of steak, and great service...Fleming's offers plenty of both. Having dined at Fleming's on more than one occasion, I can confidently say that they know how to cook a steak to your requested temperature. At these prices, this should go without saying, but plenty of chophouses still don't meet this criteria. All side dishes are a la carte, and on the large side, so I'd recommend sharing. The potatoes and vegetables are always great dishes. Mixed drinks are poured well, and not priced too crazy, relative to the entrees. My staple, a Jack & Coke, was $7.50...I've paid more. The wine list is extensive if you so choose. Service was excellent, if a bit methodical...could be a bit more personal. Four stars instead of five, because everything is just done well...nothing stands out as above and beyond, especially at this price point."
1,"I am with some of the others in not understanding these poor reviews. I am from Rhode Island and Italian food is at our fingertips, and in Arizona, there are few and far between authentic non chain Italian restaurants. I feel that although ambiance is important, I didn't see anything wrong with Lo Cascio's. There were no cheesy paper protectors over a linen table cloth, and there were no paper place mats with several business names, so not sure what the issue was there. And as far as the music....I would be annoyed too if I had to work there every night, but again, it only added to the atmosphere. In my opinion, some of the best Italian food does not come with yuppie atmosphere. For the appetizer we had the fried mozzarella which my husband and I enjoyed very much. The marinara poured over it was on the chunkier side and I loved it because it tasted just like a sauce an old Italian friend of mine made. It was perfect. I had eggplant parmesan for my entree, and it tasted just like NYC Italian. The eggplant didn't have the shit fried out of it, and it had the finest light coating just the way I love my favorite dish. And my husband had veal milanese which was out of this world. It was in a sauce of lemon and wine, mushrooms and artichokes. I also want to mention, we had the most Attentive waitress that I have ever had. Her name is Katie, and she was very sweet always asking us after each course if we needed anything and how everything tasted. We will definitely be back here, we live down the road now in our new home and I am very happy there is a great little Italian restaurant nearby. I am also happy I didn't let the negative reviews scare me."
1,"I can't dance..yes I can! Well tonight the hubby and I took our first dance lesson and what a hoot! Had a blast. The instructor's approach was clear and easy to follow. She did a great job at blending focus on the instruction with keeping it fun and upbeat. The facility is pleasant, immaculate and huge - and available to students for practice at any time, not just during their lessons. As mentioned in a previous review, they have a great deal for first time students. The best thing for couples is that the price per lesson is the same whether for a single or a couple. Because I've only done one lesson, and my first dance lesson every (well since high school, but the dinosaurs because extinct since then), I'm looking forward to more lessons and the opportunity to add a star."
1,"I love their boneless wings! They also have a good burger, but I wouldnt recommend their chimichanga. Good beer and good service."
1,"The food is good, but took a while to get to us."
1,"I used to frequent Homme for Tuesday night karaoke, Friday night French Kiss, and spent Saturday nights upstairs. I have to say that for the sheer, unimaginable amount of times I wastedly bowled over the dance floor, tumbled down the stairs, or made out with someone I never intended to, Homme has never done me wrong. The bartenders on both floors are fantastic, though the upstairs is better tailored for more intimate lounging. I've been to countless events here, and they've been well-organized and (as far as I can remember) really fun. There' s a great crowd here, and you won't feel like you're dancing in a dirty, sweaty shoebox like other hip dives in the valley. The parking situation is shady on weekends. I recommend going early to avoid irrational towings and cover charges; while it's purportedly not socially acceptable to leave the house before 10p, you'll be glad you did."
1,The classic example of why we need half stars. Doesn't merit a four star endorsement but slightly better than the three star Meh. The hot dogs are decent but you'd expect more due to the pedigree of the owners. The place also doesn't feel well put together and like it's been neglected in recent times.
1,Best Chai Latte- Great atmosphere and friendly staff
1,"We stayed at the Sheraton downtown and Matt's was a short walk. Definitely worth the walk, and it helped to justify eating such a large breakfast. There is probably something there that is not very good, but we did not find it. When you get there, make sure you check in with the person running the register"
1,Need your Bianco fix but don't want to wait in line for three hours or get in a fight because of a shortcutter? Eat here instead. Take out only and very limited menu but who cares there food is great! Lucky for me I live close by so I can bring it home. There sandwiches are made with all fresh ingredients and their bread is wonderful. Next door is a place called Lux Coffee House. Erick is a hoot. They are very good to their customers and I had the best Vanilla Latte every here. You can sit here with your Bianco sandwich and surf the net with your laptop. A small piece of paradise!!!!!!Be forewarned Bianco's is not cheap!
0,"I have driven past this place a million times and never stopped, so today I did. I basically was in an overpriced Subaway called Port of subs. The sub was ok, nothing special. They do not have a good variety of bread choices and none of their subs really sounded that good. I was SUPer starving, if I wasn't I probally would have left and ate somewhere else. The staff was very nice and the place was clean. I do think I will eat there again."
1,"I go frequently because every day, from 2-4pm, 44 oz. strawberry limeades are on ""happy hour"". But more importantly, chunks of more or less real strawberries come up the straw into your mouth. There are also real limes down in your gargantuan tankard of ice crunch and sweet sweet nectar. For a dollar. Sometimes I get something big and fried at Sonic and it makes me feel a little gross, but on the whole their food is great if you can handle its intensity of flavor. I should note that I have a very fond memory of eating bacon cheeseburgers (and the aforementioned strawberry limeades) there after a hard day's work, but that could have been the heat and poverty of the Tennessee county in which I was day laboring, or my avid youth, or the sheer novelty of my new southern surroundings. I do stick more to drinks and desserts if I go here though. Total Americana - there's a lot of junk to pick through, but you can make your personal choice for something special. I chose limeade."
1,"If you go prepared and early, you can be in and out within an hour. If your not 100% sure what you need, go online and check BEFORE you go. Save yourself the time and hassle of making that second trip. Not bad overall."
1,"It's a pretty standard Panda Express- cheap pre-made Chinese food with a few different choices. This one has always had good service, been prompt and never had a problem finding a place to sit. They are also clean inside. Good Panda."
1,"Best cajun food in town, not just from a truck. Phoenix doesn't have the greatest selection of cajun offerings so I was amazed at Food Truck Friday to find Jamburrito. They have a pretty stellar selection of meats & meals considering it's from a truck. The spices were perfect - just spicy enough to enjoy but nothing that's going to harm. I had the catfish once and the jamburrito twice... not in one sitting because the portions are VERY filling."
1,"this was our first breakfast hit-up since we moved back, and gotta say it again....the protein pancakes are still da bomb. so lucious, cruchy yet soft, sweet yet salty, healthy but so much syrup...mmmm! go at an off time or you'll be knocking elbows with the elderly."
1,had a great time here the other day! the food was delicious and the staff was just as wonderful. i can't wait to come back here and try out more of their dishes!
1,"I waited months before finally getting around to coming here, and it wasn't all I had hoped for. Went for my birthday, and got the garlic bread appetizer, wasn't very good and got crumbs all over the table. It had an odd burnt taste. Got the mushroom and steak calzone, which was huge and filling, but very greasy and took a long time to actually get to the table. They claimed it was the Hoagie that one of my friends had that took so long, but it shouldn't take so long to cook a sandwich. Either way, delicious, but nothing too special for the price. I won't likely return here, since some of my friends don't like this place."
1,"Nestled between the bright lights of the once famous Graham Central Station and a no-name BBQ place is a lovely gem I like to refer to as ""Skips"". The bar side of this place is nothing too special. Don't get me wrong, its BIG for a bar, but the ambiance and furniture are pretty dated. So, unless you enjoy playing pool, I don't know why you would want to come here. That being said, the pool here is great! They just got around 15 brand new Diamond 7' tables which play AWESOME. Their 9' tables also play well, but they have some PRETTY unforgiving pockets. So if you are a beginner, I wouldn't play on the big tables unless you like to be frustrated. They have no house cues on the floor. you have to rent them up at the bar for $1.00. This is great because they can maintain a better quality cue for you (if you use house cues). Their food is actually REALLY good! I've had their Turkey Burger which was moist and delicious. It comes with a nicely sized basket of fries. Also, their Nachos are ridiculous good (That's saying a lot coming from me)! The only bad thing about their nachos is that they use that liquid fake cheese... I prefer shredded blends on my nachos. The waitresses there are uber friendly. Yes, UBER! They always make a point to remember your name and they are always SOOO busy! Make sure to tip them well. They will remember you! Wednesday night is league night there, so unless you want to watch, avoid Wednesday from 7-10pm. Oh, and HH is from 2-7 and lots of the food (including the nachos and Turkey Burger) are priced to sell! Go shoot some pool!"
1,"I think this place is hyped up a little more than it should be. I've tired their bruschetta, pizzas and salads. They were decent and I have no complaints but nothing to rave about. A decent place to pop in to for lunch since they have counter service that you order at."
1,"Yummy! We would go to Canter's in LA before I moved out here so this is a good comparable Pastrami Sandwich. Very close to where we live which is great. Prices are fine, a bit pricey, but oh well. Overall, thumbs up!"
1,"Just returned from the Phoenix area and so my friend insisted we check this place out. Well basically the place serves an alcoholic versions of ""Slurpees"" in a variety of flavors. If you've been to Las Vegas it's the same as those slushy alcoholic drinks but made in a small Arizona-sized portions. I was ok hanging out on the patio but I don't think I would trek here as my destination. The prices were ok as well as the scene. In fact we saw a table of 8 people apparently just walk out without paying their bill so we watched half of the staff burst out the door running in different directions trying to apprehend the suspects. Weird huh?"
1,"Chopped Salad was fabulous, as was the lamb burger. Service was top rate."
0,"I went today to meet my daughter for lunch. We are both big sushi enthusiasts. The interior and atmosphere was beautiful. Well appointed. The service was excellent. We ordered edamame, was good...nothing to rave about. Not much you can do to mess that up. Drinks were well poured but exspensive for what you got. Ordered five different sushi rolls. All five were bland, not much flavor and stale. The fish was not fresh. Paid $12 for a soft shell crap roll and it tasted days old. Will not go back. Did here they have good pizza and a happy hour at three. My daughter says to give it another try. We'll see... I'll let you know if I do."
1,"This review corresponds to my first Check-In to Oregano's. Outside of the wait times, I've not had a bad experience @ Oreganos. The food was good, the people were friendly and I had a good time. This visit was no exception. Even when my wife got meat in her minestrone soup, the situation was handled impressively well. I've known for years that my wife is a VERY picky eater when dining out, she left all smiles and so did I. It's one of few places I go to with ""stuff"" on the walls that I don't find obnoxious. Keep up the good work."
1,"There's a certain amazingness that comes from fresh made ice cream. It's soft, creamy, and not filled with high fructose corn syrup and preservatives to keep it together for months in a freezer. Growing up in Arizona, we always made homemade ice cream in the summer and if you've never experienced homemade ice cream, just go to Churn. I had the banana ice cream with caramel sauce on top. I can't say anything bad about it at all. If someone doesn't like their ice cream, it's because they've been subject to all the fakeness added to ice cream in the stores and national ice cream shop chains. The shop has lots of toys and candy and knickknacks that will give you a sense of nostalgia. I'll tell you what sounds like the best day ever: riding my bike down Central on a beautiful Phoenix day... stopping in to Churn for an ice cream break (and then popping into one of the restaurants nearby for a cocktail)."
1,Decent airport with a limited variety of food choices and a strange layout. It feels a little outdated but I was only at the airport for a quick layover.
1,"I have lived steps away from this place for years and a few months ago, my boyfriend suggested I give it a try. Since I'm very picky with mexican food places, I had doubts, but boy was I wrong! All I can say is wow!!! This place is amazingly delicious. I thought I would never find a place who served authentic Mexican tacos and out of the blue I found it in a hole in the wall strip mall and just steps from my house! This can be a good thing, but also a dangerous thing because I am trying to lose weight. This place is so good. I got two tacos and I know I will be going back again and again."
1,"Decent farmers market with several friendly vendors. Look for the jalopeno peanut brittle, the incredible maccaroons, sweet republic ice cream and crepes from torched goodness! lots of yumminess and it is dog-friendly!"
1,"This is one of my favorite bars in the area. The bar has a good vibe, the food is good, and the bartenders are attentive. The prices are reasonable so you can have a good time without digging too deeply into your pockets."
1,"I've eaten a huge percentage of the food on Green's menu and I love it all. If nothing else, come here to try the Soynami's (vegan Blizzards). I'm not a fan of rice or soy ice cream but this stuff is amazingly good. The bowl meals are packed with great fresh vegetables. I mostly eat whole foods and don't consider the fake meats to be especially healthful, but I love to eat the fake meat here once in a while for the texture. It's so good. It's not exactly like the real thing, but it doesn't need to be. It's delicious as it is. There is always a huge variety of people eating here all the time. It's always packed, always hard to get a table. Good for Green Restaurant! Atmosphere: The restaurant is made with green materials. Every time we go they are showing the work of a different artist. It's college-indie and casual. The employees don't act super enthusiastic, but they're decent and polite and do a good job. I love the humor of whoever it is that writes up the food specials on the chalkboard. BTW, you can get vegan whipped cream here and it's SO GOOD! :)"
1,"Very clean and well thought out floor plans, nice to have a friendly staff with smiling faces. Best Target I have been to in a while."
1,"I admit it I eat donuts almost everyday and twice on Sundays. Today a I found a new addiction, french crullers, uhhh they are soo good. Melt in your mouth."
1,"I have only had their pizza once, to go. It was ok but nothing to write home about.;... would try again but will be more skepitcal...."
1,"I'm very new to PHX. I ended up talking to a cop at the airport who told me about Thursday Rockabilly nights at the Blooze. I had to check it out. My friend and I walked in and were instantly comfortable, excited, and impressed. The AC was pumping, beer was cold, the music; rockin, and the crowd; refreshing. The bathroom was great! They don't have food there but they will let you bring in whatever you want. We went there pretty early, around 7:30ish. Unfortunately, because of ridiculously early work on Fri AM, I had to leave once it was starting to get really packed and lively around 10:30/11. I am so glad that I finally checked the place out though. I will definitely frequent The Blooze as often as I can."
1,Good for an easy and leisurely business lunch or outing with the girls. The market downstairs is great for takeout and a great selection of bakery treats.
1,"This review is based on an event I attended here. I did not stay at the hotel as a guest or experience the bar. I was a guest at the Etiquette Dinner put on by ASU and affiliates. From the moment I entered the hotel, I felt welcomed. Each employee I passed greeted me with a smile and professionality. I thought the hotel interior was really cool also. When I was leaving the event, I thought how strange that locals never frequent hotels in their cities. I should try it!"
1,"I really love this place. I'm not sure why there are so many mixed reviews... maybe what they ordered? I always get the regular size custom burger... blue cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomato (and sometimes bacon). Simple and delicious. The rosemary fries with Smash sauce are also amazing. The only thing I didn't care for were the fried pickles... a bit too salty."
0,"Was in town for a business meeting and tried to catch a movie with a friend. First impression of the place was that it needed a total make over. I mean TOTAL MAKEOVER. Walked up to buy my ticket, and the lady was a total jerk! She had no idea when the movie times were, and she clearly thought we were stupid. She messed up our change, and didn't believe us when we told her. When we walked in they ripped the tickets out of our hands. When it came time to order our food, the butter on the popcorn tasted like cough syrup. The theater was extremely dirty, and kids were screaming throughout the movie. After the movie I politely told the manager about our horrible experience. He was not understanding at all and even threatened to kick us out. I was appaled by this whole endeavor and that is why I am writing this review. It was a complete waste of time and money and I recommend everyone to stay away."
1,"Today was the fist time I have been to Chino Bandito. My friend has been there several times and loves this place. After having a few beers, we were pretty hungry and decited to go here. This place is mixed in a sort of industrial corner behind a Walgreens and a transmission shop. Walking in you will notice how big this place is inside. Customer service was excellent. The counter person was great in explaining the different options on the menu which is a mix of Mexican food and Chinese food. Great concept for something different. For ten dollars I had the Carnitas burrito and a Jerk chicken burrito with Jerk fried rice and black beans and a large iced tea (all you can drink). It also comes with a Snikerdoodle cookie. Wait time was minimal and the food was brought very quickly to our table. I really enjoyed the items that I had order and I found the carnitas had the right flavor and tenderness in a burrito (you can also get it in a bowl). The Jerk chicken burrito had some zing to it. Enough to make me sweat a little. One thing that I noticed was that the employee's were really good about keeping the place clean. Sweeping, cleaning the tables, wiping up around the drink dispensers. I also noticed that they wrap all of the highchair trays in plastic to keep the clean and dust free. One last thing, they have free wifi!"
1,I am not the biggest fan of fast food ever. But I really like Five Guys and this location is superb! They have really yummy fries and they give you so many! Like your bag overflows with the greasy buggers. Say what? Yeah they are really greasy. But good! The burgers are really quite the bang for your buck too! Not the best burgers in the world but it is fast food not gourmet burgers. Be considerate for what you are eating and enjoy it for what it is. The pop machines are radical. You can pretty much have flavoured any beverage you like. The staff here is really friendly and that is a plus anywhere you go!
1,This place has really good mexican food and a very nice ambience.
1,"Joe's Farm Grill features everything that is All-American. Burgers, pizzas, salads, hot dogs, and a variety of other classics, each with their own twist. I was pleasantly surprised that Sonoran Dogs were on the menu (I rarely see them outside of Tucson). I got a burger that was gigantic and yummy--don't forget to ask for grilled onions. There are a number of novelties in each of Joe's restaurants, but my favorite part about this one is that it is nestled right next to farmland. The ingredients here touted to be fresh and local, and I could definitely taste the difference in my burger and especially in the fruit cup. I took my brother here for his birthday; he got a 4B and looved it. He wasn't able to complete the trifecta but there will always be next year!"
1,"Ohhhh, I like, I like! First of all, if you haven't seen Distrito, scope the photos on the website. High-five to the interior designer. From the gold glittery tables to the gumball wall, this place screams fun, energy, and overall a kick-ass atmosphere. I stayed at the Saguaro for five nights, so I had plenty of time to get my dinner (and breakfast!) on at Distrito. Actually, for dinner, I had room service but Distrito is where it came from. I was absolutely starving after a long plane ride, so I ordered the chicken tacos, guac, and a plantain appetizer, and it only took about 20 minutes to show up. Win. The chicken tacos were really, really good. Little corn tortillas, marinated chicken, slaw, radish, and a perfectly-sized slice of avocado. There were three of them and I could only eat two, but they were so well made. The plantain dish was also impressive, and had some black bean puree underneath that balanced out the sweetness of the plantains. The star of the show, however, was the guacamole. Tons of lime, zing, and flavor. I ate almost all of it and it was definitely worth it. Usually when I have guacamole it's just so-so and I have to add some spice, but this showed up completely perfect. When I had breakfast, things were also on point. They made me an egg white omelet with tons of vegetables inside, and my co-workers seemed to love other menu items like the pancakes and french toast, as well. If I lived in Scottsdale I'd definitely visit this place a time or two more. Consider me a fan!"
1,"Been to the Spotted Donkey in Carefree multiple times and always been happy. (can't speak to their new location on Hayden as we haven't been there yet). The drinks are very good, if a bit pricy and the apps are wonderful. Ordered the short stack of nachos, stuffed peppers and enchaladas this time. All very good and tasty. One note, everything seemed to be a bit ""saucier"" this time, especially the nachos. While the sauce is very good and tasty with a good amount of spice, it was a bit mcuh for me. I don't remember it being that way before so perhaps this was a fluke. Will definately be back"
1,"This place is great. The food is Northern Chinese similar to Chinese Muslim food. They have a great variety for reasonable prices. Also, everything is freshly prepared and you can even see them make the dumplings and pork pie behind a glass window. We got the stir fry spinach (bok choy) with garlic, sesame bread, pork and napa cabbage dumplings, pork pie and green onion pancakes. I know its a lot of food but we wanted to try a good variety and it cost about $27. Not to shabby! the spinach and garlic was really fresh and flavorful. The bread was decent, almost like a dense curried bread. The pork dumplings were similar to soup dumplings, one of my most favorite dumplings ever. The pork pie was almost like a pork patty covered in dumpling dough and pan-fried. It was crunchy, moist, juicy and delicious all at the same time. We were getting full so we ended up only eating half of the green onion pancakes which were well prepared. We will definitely be making another trip back here soon. Side note: They sell bags of frozen/take-home dumplings. About $10 for a bag of 40."
1,"""Gosh-Awful-Gooey Banana Split: fresh banana split lengthwise, Turkish coffee ice cream blanketed with caramel sauce, red raspberry sorbet smothered in marshmallow sauce with delicious whip and a juicy maraschino cherry atop."" Heaven!!"
1,"I ADORE this place. Matt's has been a staple breakfast, brunch, whatever place for me since I moved to Downtown 5 years ago. They just moved to a great place up the street (where Verde used to be for locals) with more room so now everything isn't so crammed! Not that we all didn't enjoy their original house, this one just says, ""I'm still awesome, I just stepped up a notch."" Everything is delicious. I love their 5 Spot, the waffles are great, and their lunch specials are always amazing. If you like jelly - try their homemade stuff. Try the bacon."
1,Good pizza. Nice and laid back. Good staff too.
0,"I've been to Barrio twice now. Simply put, I do not believe that it is worth the prices that they charge. The first time I went there was with the pseudo boyfriend and he adored his meal, and so I embraced it and loved it. The second time was last night for Dottsy's birthday dinner. Dottsy and I ordered up the guacamole that everyone raves about. We were unimpressed, as we had huge chunks of avocado in there and have both made our own guacamole and didn't see what the big fuss was about. I've had the enchiladas suizas and enchiladas de hongas and although they weren't bad- they were not amazing. Not worth the 16 bucks, at all. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't complain about the cost if it tasted like it was worth it, but not so much. Because it was Dottsy's birthday, they brought her a complimentary flan which we both agreed was pretty tasty flan. So, if you are a flan person, this may be a place to check out. I am not a flan person- too jiggly (which makes me think of what fat looks like on a person's body which stops me from eating it). The two things that make this place worth going for are the margaritas and the service. The margaritas are 50% tequila and fabulous- I usually just stick to the house margarita and am satisfied. The people that work at Barrio are friendly and cool. I imagine that they all enjoy working there. I don't really ever need to go back to Barrio, unless I'm craving a serious margarita served up by a cute hipster. I'd go for a drink or two and then go elsewhere for dinner."
0,"I purchased the Enotria groupon when it was released last year and had a horrible experience at the restaurant. 1) I ordered a cheese platter. The platter was very much overpriced at over $18.00. The most problematic thing is that Enotria ordered the food from another restaurant on Mayo Blvd and had it delivered to them. The same is true with Pizza. If you order pizza there, it will be delivered from another restaurant in the Mayo shopping plaza. Enotria is taking a significant markup on the food because they are paying another vendor for it. AVOID THIS!! 2) Another disturbing aspect of the visit was that we were served disproportionately small portion because we were using a groupon. We ordered two glasses of red wine. The waiter (who also happened to be the owner) served us a glass that was 1/3 of what is typically served. The only positive aspect of Enotria is that they have a good selection of wines. To be sincere, you are much better off going to a more reputable establishment in the area like White Chocolate Grill. Oh, also keep in mind that the current owner bought the restaurant over a year ago. It has changed ownership several times and the overall quality is suffering because of this. AVOID."
1,"BYOB and you can get a flaming boat of sushi?! #winning This is an awesome neighborhood place with reasonable prices and delicious menu options. Plus, it's BYOB - a rarity it seems. I attended with a party of four and we spent about $110 and were stuffed on tons of food. The noodle dishes and sushi were great and our server was a lot of fun."
1,"Since this is a Kimpton Hotel my standards are fairly high. The reception area and pool are very well done, in typical Kimpton fashion. The rooms are nice, however could use more work. The bathrooms are completely remodeled, but the little amenities that I'm use to like the Ipod docking station, flat screen tv, cordless phone, room service past 11pm and multiple outlets (i'm an electronics junkie) just aren't there. The room really feels like any other average hotel. The spa was lovely, but it is not a full spa. I was hoping to sit in the steam room before my 90min massage, but unfortunately there wasn't one to sit in. The massage room was nice and the largest I had ever been in. It had it's own private bath/changing room and a large copper tub close to the actual massage table. I was pretty bummed I didn't add a bath to my massage. All in all I would stay here again since it's in a great location. Plus, the guys at the bell desk will give you a ride (within 3 miles) in a Cadillac Escalade free of charge. That was a great when it came time to partying at night!"
1,"I think this is the best frozen yogurt I've ever had. Even better than Golden Spoon, which is saying a lot cuz I love that place. I tried the peanut butter, triple chocolate (not my personal fav but my coworker loved it), cake batter (to die for), strawberry (tastes like a strawberry malt), snickerdoodle, and prailine. They have the best toppings of any yogurt shops I've visited. Favorites include choc chip cookie dough, mini gummi bears, mochi, yogurt chips, cheesecake, and boba... not to overlook the fresh fruit...."
1,"Great food, great Sangria, great live music, great vibe, great service EXCLAMATION MARK. Overall it was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon."
1,"Pretty good place. You never actually know who is your server because several different people actually wait on you. The service can be slow at times which can get annoying. The space is pretty big, bigger than what it seems from the street. The food was so-so."
1,"How have I gone this long without reviewing the lodge? Sheesh! I get all fluttery inside when I think about the lodge. The Mac and Cheese is not something to play around with. It is a dish of fantastic, cheesy wonderfulness. Also, please note the veggie wrap. HOLY SMOKES. Its a heavenly combo of sauteed veggies, feta cheese, and some kind of lemon/herb/heaven sauce all wrapped up in a pita! Really? Really Aaron May? The other aspects of the lodge I enjoy involve the friendly staff, and comfortable setting. It's decorated all rustic and cushy, and true to form there are antler-chandeliers. You will also find pool tables, darts, several TV's, jenga, bean bag games...they have plenty going on at the lodge to keep you and your friends entertained. Check it out..."
1,"Great work lunch. Valet parking, only. Waitress was helpful in narrowing down my selection (salmon salad) and listened to my criteria. 4 stars since wait staff seemed otherwise aloof."
0,I don't know how this place stays in business. The menu is so limited. Would you like chicken or chicken? Chicken in a pita? Chicken on some lettuce? Chicken rolled in a tortilla? And the pita chips are bland! Yuck! And the potato salad has something in it that is way too tangy. I've only been twice and tried different dishes both times but I just don't get anything greek about this place.
1,"Not bad. Not super amazing. My cafe rumba burrito was okay, line was moving a little slow but the employees were nice."
1,"Amazing cheesesteak. One mile from my home is Corleone's. About 15-20 minutes from my home is Capriotti's. I never go to Corleone's. I go to Capriotti's all the time. The workers here are nice and the cheesesteak is terrific. The large is 20"" I believe, so if you're ordering for yourself and in no mood to eat until you have a stroke, get the medium. Also, try it with the hot peppers. It adds the slightest bit of spice without becoming too overwhelming. That's really all I can say about this place. Wonderful cheesesteak. I haven't tried anything else because the cheesesteak is too good to pass up when I make the drive down there. The patrons rave about the other sandwiches, though, so I absolutely would not be afraid to try something else. There's maybe 5 or 6 tables inside and 2 outside? so be prepared to order to go if you arrive at prime dine-in lunch/dinner hours. Do yourself a favor and go to Capriotti's. Help this place attain the reviews and ratings it deserves. The fact that there's only 8 reviews is criminal. I understand it is in the heart of the suburbs, but it's worth the drive."
1,"Yummmmm .... so authentic This is one of the few mom & pop's type of restaurant in N Scottsdale that taste oh so authentic and fantastic This is by far my favorite italian restaurant in town, way better than the big chain like Brios (don't get me wrong, they are not bad either) It is not a fancy place but very cozy. And it does make you feel like you walk into one of the ristorante in Italia .... the owners are 100% italiano and they only use the freshest ingredients .... I had the best lasagna there, you can taste the texture of the noodle, the creamy-ness of the chess, the meat favor and the freshness of the tomatoes... totally awesome. Had tried the seafood linguine there too .... oh so good as well and with plenty of seafood ... definitely 2 thumbs up. During winter, make sure you make reservation ahead though .... this place seems to be snowbirds' favorite too"
1,"I do love Chinese food, and for such a big city I find that Phoenix (or at least Scottsdale) lacks in options, either because they aren't the most welcoming of places, or simply because there aren't that many (compared to sushi restaurants for example. I've been to this location maybe 3 times since moving to Phoenix (8 years ago) and must say that I usually go because a friend as a ""Pei Wei"" craving. I found the food to be ok, but I'm typically one who doesn't like spicy food as I find it takes away instead of enhances the flavor. I wasn't too hungry and decided to take the chicken fried rice. I have to say that my favorite chicken fried rice is the one from Tottie's in Scottsdale that not only is delicious but always gives me left overs for lunch the next day. Portion was ok though the fried rice was a little sweet and the person I was dining with had the chicken lettuce wrap which wasn't too bad either. Service was disappointing as our food took about 10 minutes to come, but I must say the staff was helpful when I was asked where to get takeaway boxes as well as a takeaway cup. I'd give it 4 stars if after a handful of experiences I had Pei-Wei on my ""must have"" list but with Pita Jungle, Sack's , Subway, Rubio's, etc. nearby, the competition for ""fast casual"" is stiff and Pei Wei just doesn't cut it for me unless I really had a craving for Asian food that day."
1,great place to go and the pizza ia great too
1,"We were craving some BBQ, and hadn't been here in a while, so we decided to head over. It wasn't overly crowded on a Sunday night, but it wasn't empty, either. Hubby and I ordered the same thing, 2 meat combo (brisket and baby back ribs) with double grilled veggies--extra grilled. For some reason, we both got the same thing, sometimes that happens. First, we got our cornbread, which is always so delicious. They serve it with butter, but you don't really need it. Our meals came quickly (we didn't order appetizers), so we dug right in. The brisket, as usual, melted in my mouth. It's probably one of the best places I've ever been for brisket, and that's saying something. I always order it wherever we go. Also, my husband is NOT a brisket eater, but he will order it here. Now for the ribs, I need to let you know, I'm a sweet & savory BBQ fan, definitely not spicy. I've had the ribs before, and they were always sweet and tender, plus they literally fall off the bone. These were like they usually are, fall off the bone and tender. But, there seemed to be a spicier rub on them, which was a little off-putting to me. Even my husband mentioned it, and he doesn't mind a little heat. Neither one of us remember them tasting that way. I dipped them in the sweet BBQ sauce, and that seemed to cool the spice a bit, and I did eat them all, but I'm not sure I'd get them again. And, lastly, the grilled veggies, which consist of green peppers, zucchini, squash, onion and mushrooms--wonderful!! I love the charred grill taste, and I gently dip them in the sauce. I really adore them! We rarely get dessert, because we're so full. We have taken some cobbler home before, but it's never quite the same as having it fresh from the kitchen. Plus, they bring you each a fresh mini sugary doughnut with your bill. These are the perfect finish to a very good BBQ meal. They bring them to you in a bag, but to be honest, they've never made it out the door. The only reason I'm giving this restaurant and meal 4 stars instead of 5, is because of the rub on the ribs. Other than that, it was a perfect meal."
1,"Huh. I guess it's a love it or hate kind of place. Me? I love it. But put butter on a shoe and I might just kiss you. Oh butter, is there anything you can't do? Is there? This is one of the high roller places in Scottsdale. I saw a guy take a wad of Benjis out of his pocket that seriously made me consider rolling him. But my boss might have objected. Damn boss. It's all about service and steak here. And I'm down with that. We had crab legs for an appetizer. Quite nice for a land-locked state. Fresh and tasty. A tomato salad with sharp onion that I enjoyed. And shared a porterhouse the size of my... yes. My ass. If one could give a nice slap to a porterhouse, this would be quite a spankable piece of meat. I love the way you can hear your steak coming to your table in all it's sizzling glory. The first thing to hit your nose is the lovely perfume of the butter. Chanel # Yum. Then that aroma of the meat. I know we had a couple of sides. But I honestly can't remember because the steak was so freaking perfect. To a corn-fed born and bred midwestern girl this is perfection. The service is near perfect too. Our waitress gave us a wine selection for the steak that was spot on. Not too tanic. Not too tame. Held up nicely against the butter and the porterhouse. At the end of the meal I was I nearly unable to move. And that says a whole lot. I've been known to out eat grown men without batting an eye. Oh, and if you don't like butter on your steak? Three words. ""Hold the butter."" May save you some pain."
1,My sister and I went here the other week and got gel manicures! They turned out beautiful and lasted forever! Ithink Biagio is now my go to nail salon! Keep it up!
1,This is just like Filiberto's. Fast-food mexican food. It's really good and taste pretty authentic to me. My hubby and I stopped in for a quick bite to eat and we went there because he heard it was good from his co-workers. I'm a huge critic of mexican rice and beans and this place has it down. I got the lunch special of the day which was 2 bean tostadas with beans and rice. It was sooo much food and I was so stuffed! Next time I will get something smaller. You can't beat all that food for $5! They have a good salsa bar with all the fixings!
1,"Food was good. I had the Choppino Fruittas de Mare. Apparently the serving is large as the server hinted that it may be too large for me, but the serving was typical for a Fruits de Mare type plate that I've had at other restaurants. Sauce was nice: spicy and good flavor. Pasta was cooked well and the right portion size, I think people add too much pasta to make the dish look larger. Other than the imitation crab (a disappointment but not a deal breaker) the seafood was cooked nicely between the calamari, mussels, etc. Kid's spaghetti was very good. I taste all the kid's spaghetti since I have 3 kids and invariably someone doesn't finish or even start their bowl. The pasta was cooked well, the meatball was decent, but the sauce was shick and chunky (not watery which I hate) and covered all the pasta (which for some reason other restaurants can't seem to do). There isn't a specific kid's menu but the server said they make kid's portion size of anything on the menu but the price isn't available to be seen so you have to trust they aren't going to bend you over on those, which they didn't. Bread, of course, was available prior to meals. The butter used is very tasty, some type of garlic I think. Bread was warm, soft, and not overcooked. Now I would have given 4 stars except for a few exceptions: the decor and slower service. Decor was dreadful, sorry. Old and dated. I think their target demographics is 50 years old or greater as the chairs, pictures, and everything inside screams 1970's. The chairs remind me of an old conference hall. The lighting is on the dark side. I guess if I was out on a date or with 4 retired couples, it would be a nicer decor, but with 8 adults and 5 kids it just doesn't fit quite right. Kid friendly not quite, but kid accomidating is more like it. Since the ambience is darker and softer volume on conversations, having loud and obnoxious kids is not the right place for them. Overall, the food is good, servers friendly but not the family friendly place I usually prefer."
1,"On one of my many visits to see mi amore, he took me to this fantastic little pizza joint. The aesthetics of the place were overwhelmingly perfect. I believe the maximum seating capacity of the dining area is 45, yes folks, 45. So the 2 1/2 hour wait was expected, and very VERY worth it. The pizzas are baked to order in a classic brick house oven. The toppings arent what youd find in your local Pizza Hut, either. You can choose from fresh slices of mozzarella, slices of perfectly seasoned italian sausage, pepperoni slices, salami slices, arugula, fresh basil leaves, tomatoes, etc. Basically what Im getting at, is this is beyond words delicious, classic LEGIT Italian pizza. Around the dining area, you will see freshly baked loaves of focaccia bread, that is later served to you with extra virgin olive oil for dipping once you are seated. The smell in that place is heavenly.....incredibly reminiscent of my grandmothers kitchen!! PS GET THERE EARLY!!"
1,"I feel like an East Coast gangster when I roll up to LGO for breakfast. I'll take the Jersey Girl... pump fist and hair toss!! Hands down, it's the BEST omelette I've EVER had. And the fresh-squeezed OJ hits the spot. After a hike at Camelback, it's relaxing to come and sit on the patio... if you can find a spot. Weekends this place is a zoo!! During the week is pretty crazy but has its peaks. The French Toast is pretty tasty and they do pastries just right. Muffins are baked fresh, toast is always spot on perfect. I want their toaster! I've had the pizza, which is pretty decent but not the best I've eaten. The salads are delish."
1,I love this place.Their italian beef with hot peppers is a must. I have also tried their sausage and pep sandwich which is just as good.Their prices are as good as you can get. So if you're hungry stop in & get full!!
1,"Okay, judging a Vietnamese restaurant on the decor is a little jaded IMHO. Ambience is certainly a factor when dining, and if that's your most pressing criteria you're probably not fit to go into most Vietnamese places. Pholicious does a great job with their food-went their for lunch over the weekend and tried their oxtail pho which was very good. My buddy had chicken & vegetable chow fun which was also delicious. Sizable portions and the most unique serving of Thai iced coffee I think I've ever had. Almost like a half old time Italian espresso pot on top of a coffee cup that holds the coffee and condensed milk. You're supposed to stir this then add the contents to the accompanying glass of ice. Unlike dummy me who just dumped it in the ice :)"
1,"Now that this place is under new management it's gotten better. i went once before and it was kind of nasty, now it's cleaner and has a better selection. Its hard to find edible chinese food in Phoenix, this one is one of the better ones now. I think it's renamed Fuji Buffet. It even had a sushi bar (not a sushi eater, but it had one) and everything was as fresh as can be expected. Large shrimp and chicken selection, and pizza and things for the kiddos. Stay away from the desserts tho', not so great."
1,"I was a little hesitant of Zipps when we pulled in - didn't look from the outside like it would offer an awesome time. Walking in around 7 on a Friday night revealed a place that was almost full. We chose to sit on the chilly patio, which did have a couple of heaters. The heaters were a little high up and less effective, but it was also one of the coldest nights this year. Service was fast and friendly, we never ran out of beer. I got the BLT on Sourdough, and so did my friend, her husband got the Black and Blue Burger. The fries were good, but not as crispy as I like. The flavor was great and I ended up eating all of them. The BLT was awesome! Tons of crispy bacon, and they cut it so that you were able to eat the sandwich without bacon attacking you. The sourdough bread was thick cut and lightly toasted. The burger was a little less than we expected - 2 nice size patties, but the blue cheese could have been done a little better, and it was very messy. The onion rings were nice sized and with great, fluffy breading on them. The on tap beer list was a little heavy on the cheap domestics for my taste, but they did have an Alaskan Amber that went great with the food. We were able to sit and talk for several hours, and the server made sure that we always had what we needed."
1,"Probably more worthy of 3.5 stars. Damn the Yelp constraints! Marketplace was pretty busy tonight now that you can actually go out in the evening without a gentle breeze feeling more like a blow torch in your face. In spite of that, our wait to be seated was fairly quick. But where was our server? Outside listening to the band? We need liquid refreshment! Finally our server arrived and apologized for the wait at the same time the manager arrived and also apologized and comped us an appetizer. Wow! We hadn't even complained. We had the hummus which was very tasty but a little thin and a mango tandoori chicken pizza. Nice combination of sweet mango, spicy curry sauce, and the grilled chicken. Service was excellent once we got over the initial bump. While I usually don't plan to go to CPK, it's nice to know this one is there."
1,"Pretty damn nice! I made reservations for the Compass via OpenTable and upon arrival, i was greeted by first name. We were seated promptly and thank God I didn't pre-drink too much because the restaurant spins at a pretty steady pace. It's a great concept and for all the theatrics, the cost of the meals were very reasonable. I had salmon and opted for polenta with my meal instead of mashed potatoes and I'm glad to see that both grits and polenta were mainstays on their list of sides. The only miss for me was the chili cornbread which I didn't find to be that great, although my comrades seemed to like it. Service was prompt and consistent and I must say I enjoyed my meal and the whole spinning experience."
0,Bad... food was horrible... do not waste your time or money
1,They came to my house the same day that I called which was a pleasant surprise. I'm glad that I didn't have to wait a week for them to fix our fuse box. With labor at $65 per hour it's pretty affordable depending on what you want them to do. Be aware that there might be two guys coming out to you though- so it'll be $65 per hour x2.
0,"Never Again, I brought my Mountain Bike in (which I bought 1 week earlier from Walmart) to have them replace my flat inner tubes with puncture resistant tubes.) I came back 20 minutes later when they said it would be done and as I rode away, the back tire rhythmically rubbed against the back brake. When I returned and told them about it, I was told the back wheel was not true. It was true for the whole short week since I purchased it from Walmart. I plan to take it to their competitor (Landis) and pay the extra $15-$25) to have the wheel put back to the straight condition it was in when I brought it to Slippery Pig in the first place. I would never give a shop another penny for an extra service I should never have needed on a brand new bike which coasted perfectly when I brought it in."
1,"Ok here is the deal with Red Devil Pizza. The key to making pizza with crispy crust is to have ovens that great sufficiently hot. That is why I like places with brick over pizza's. They don't use Brick Ovens at Red Devil but I have been told that Red Devil has some really old pizza ovens that are not available any longer or hard to get. I can't verify that, I don't even remember who told me that, maybe I read it some where. Don't know if it is true or not. What I do know is that Red Devil is one of my favorite pizza place in the Valley. Their pizza is consistently good. Thin-Crisp and delicious. I have had pasta's and salads there as well. They are fine, nothing to get excited about. But the Pizza at Red Devil is something I will stake my reputation on. Actually I don't really have a reputation, but if I did I would lay it on the line for Red Devil Pizza. The long and short of it is, I am very passionate about their Pizza. Period."
1,"This place is gem behind the Central Phoenix library and next to Walgreens. They have great lunch specials that are worth a visit. My favorite dish so far is the spicy noodles. The noodles were flavorful and pretty darn spicy, just how they should be. If you're in the mood for some authentic Thai food, you gotta give this place a try."
0,"Great donuts but horrible service... Didn't get anything we wanted due to a language barrier between us and the limited English speaking employee. She claimed, in broken English, to only speak Spanish. She understood ONLY the word ""dozen"" and we got a dozen of what ever she felt like giving us, then proceeded to ignore us while using her cell phone! Donut shops are a dime a dozen and we will never again return to Bosa."
1,"Finally tried Pei Wei and overall we were very pleased. I ordered the Spicy Ramen Noodle bowl which was not overly spicy, and tasted good. Others ordered the Orange Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and several appetizers of egg roll, lettuce wraps, and edamame. Everything was good. You can also opt for brown rice instead of white rice for a healthier route. What amused me a lot were the Touch Screen Soda machines that had many varieties carried by Coca-Cola. It was pretty cool! Overall, good food, good service, okay prices."
1,"WOW! Great donuts! Honestly you can't eat just one! I loved the plain glazed and the old-fashioned! Not like the franchise donut shops, these have the real bakery taste!"
1,"So, yea. Kelly's review has me more than a little concerned. Thinking we won't go back for awhile. Most likely quite awhile. I'd rather be sure they have that crap taken care of. Literally. But here's why we'll still end up going back. It's all about 3 things. It's conveniently located. It makes you feel like you're eating healthy (Note - doesn't really encourage healthy eating, more just a healthy attitude. Keeps the brownies, chocolate pudding, pizza and mayo based salads in large supply) And then finally - Coupons. They have coupons ALL the time. ALL the time. Special note - if you aren't that hungry - don't go here. Go somewhere else where you can split your meal or take 1/2 home. Here that 1/2 a plate of salad greens is going to cost you just as much as the guy on his 4th plate."
1,"My wife and I originally went last Sunday only to find it closed. But since I had a Groupon deal I purchased last month, we went back Wednesday night to cash it in. And we're so glad we did. Kind of hidden in a shopping mall with movie theaters upstairs, we were quickly seated and served our drinks with chips and salsa. My wife ordered the fish tacos (2) with rice and black beans. Tacos and rice were both good. Black beans so-so. I ordered the Cuban sliders. 3 mini sandwiches w/ham, cheese, and a Cuban seasoned beef - oh so good - with a side of sweet potato fries. Wasn't a fan before. But now I am. Fries were hot and crunchy. I could only put down 2 and took 1 back to our hotel for breakfast Thursday. Would definitely return for another meal when in PHX again."
1,"I love that the food was freshly made and the place had a great ""down home"" feel. The owners are also very welcoming, made us feel like family. We ordered the Bean Enchiladas, Chicken Enchiladas & Chicken Gorditas. All came with Rice & Beans. We all enjoyed our meals. Good prices also."
0,"I wasn't feeling RnR at all! We don't usually venture into Scottsdale for many reasons, but the siren song of a non-pretentious late night eatery was just calling to us. Unfortunately, non-pretentious doesn't apply to the prices. We came shortly after opening day, so I completely forgive the awful service, the place was packed. I was irritated though when we were told they were only going to be serving sandwiches and burgers, nothing else, even though we were specifically told that this place would have breakfast all day. Breakfast is what I wanted. Oh well. We ordered the burger and got some mini corn dogs as an appetizer. The mini corn dogs left a lot to be desired. They were served with plain ol' ketchup and plain ol' yellow mustard. Yuck. The corn dogs were only okay. The breading around them was way too bread like and it was just lacking in flavor. The burger was enormous. Unfortunately, what it lacked any flavor. I guess what it lacked in flavor it was clearly making up for in size. The bacon that came on it was equally huge, roughly 2 inches wide and at least 8 inches long... (that's what she said! Ohhhh!) Anyway, I was obviously not impressed. We might come back sometime, because their breakfast really does sound wonderful, but hopefully they've figured out how to efficiently serve a busy restaurant by then."
1,"This is the place my friends and I go for Mexican food. Very tasty, affordable, and fairly quick service."
0,Wow. Worst food poisoning of my life. Ate here Saturday night for my birthday. Started to just not feel right about 20 minutes afterward. Sunday I never left the bed except to go be sick. I lost a full FIVE pounds in one day. Stay away from the salmon. I for one will never go back. I'm really sad too because I decided on it from the reviews. Another reviewer said they were disappointed in the recent quality. I should have listened!!
1,"Okay, so I have a little bit of bias towards Nordstrom. I freaking love Nordstrom! The store is always clean, and the staff are always friendly. I have never had such good service anywhere else. I especially love that Nordstrom will return or exchange an item with no questions asked. Aside from the service, the selection is very nice. I always go during the half yearly sale, so that I can get some good deals on my designer duds! I am big on shoes and the selection is very good. They always have some cool shoes that I can't seem to live without. Also, the staff in the shoe department are very good on helping to make suggestions when I am not sure what I want. If you go, go in June or January when the sales are great! Make sure you check out the shoes!"
1,"Delish! We drove around looking for a good steak without a wait and ended up at the Phoenician. With the restaurant concept by Jean Georges, we knew we were in for a treat. The only reasons I'm giving 4 stars are two-fold: The shrimp cocktail was overpriced - $18 for 5 shrimp? C'mon...yummy but lame. And The desert menu is seriously lacking - I was expecting to see at least one amazing thing and they were all boring: cake, apple fritter, cheesecake, gelato...boring!! Other than that, everything was amazing. I'm getting over a cold and they brought me out my own tea kettle which sat next to the table and stayed hot for two hours. And the finishing salt they provided in a tiny bowl was a great touch! Order a steak, it'll be cooked perfectly with a great crust on it. Have them bring all the sauces too; their bernaise is ridiculously fluffy - they infuse it with liquid nitrogen!! And the beurre blanc is perfect and delicate. YUM (PS, if you get Mercedes as your server, you're in for a treat! She's amazing!)"
1,We finally visited the new restaurant 3 1/2 years after the Richardson's fire. It is quite amazing how similar the new Richardson's looks and feels like the former landmark restaurant. Their service is great. We ordered a pizza and salad. I should have known better to order a pizza from a New Mexico style restaurant... roasted tomato sauce with New Mexico sausage and mozzarella. It brought back memories of conversations with my Papa debating whether Prego or Ragu was the better canned tomato sauce.
1,"So i'm not here to buy spices or shop for sheesha, i'm here for food. Lots and lots of food. Luckily for me, Haji-Baba is known for tons of food at decent prices so I have a promising evening of stuffing my face without breaking my wallet. God, I sound like a really cheap buffet commercial. But really, to be truthfully, super blunt, honest-to-go-honest truth, Haji-Baba's food is not the best in the world but it is 1) fresh, 2) good quality, 3) tasty and 4) cheap. I am sure you can find better Mediterranean food around town, but this place is really good on your wallet and fits my needs just right. And hey, 215 reviews can't be lying. THE PEOPLE LIKE IT. They like it a lot. I ordered the gyro deluxe (gyro with raw onions and feta cheese), a side order of hummus, Babaganoush (eggplant dip), tried my friends lamb tongue and a pistachio baklava. If you are feeling adventurous and want to try the lamb tongue, lemme tell you: don't. Really, don't. There is nothing tasty about lamb tongue. It tastes slightly like roast beef but the texture resembles congealed liver patee and the big chunks are really scary. The only positive about eating tongue? Infinite pun jokes about talking about it forever. Get it? The gyro meat was pretty standard in the Gyro deluxe sandwich, the best thing about it was the creamy fresh salty feta cheese. Its the freshest i've ever had and they really DO slap it on that sandwich, like a boss. The babaganoush was also very very tasty with the pickle and the black olive- however- i would have liked bigger pieces of roasted eggplant than a hummus-like texture. The hummus was just A-OK, it needed more of a PUNCH of flavor. Last but not least, the baklava is my favorite dessert in all the land.. so obviously I enjoyed it. Heavy on the honey and not very crispy on the nuts, but pretty decent nonetheless. In conclusion, only use the tongue in your mouth and not the one on the menu, get as much feta cheese as your body can process and buy a desert to-go. BAM, lunch is served."
1,Amazing food and excellent service. LOVED the porcini rubbed delmonico.
1,"Stopped there for breakfast. A cozy little place, with very friendly and smiling persons. Their house coffee is fine, but will have to go back for a dirty chai. I had also a bagel (just like any other). A nice drive through, and a good alternative to start the day!"
1,"Dam you Doug !!! Ok, I thought I be the first but Doug beat me to it. Any establishment that has a free happy hour for it's guest is a plus nuff said. Yes -the 4th floor grill is awesome and the bar staff will give you the In's & outs of Scottsdal-ing culture and the pizza they serve is pretty dam good- the complimentary breakfast was was actually good too. I'm not sure if they still do the free happy hour thing but what sold me on this lets say resort - is that while I was there , there was a whole bus full of girls that where promoting - some kinda of alcoholic beverage - and I heard from a good source many beverage companies uses the Chaparral as a pit stop for their promotional tours... Word- I guess they come for the pool's..."
1,"I made it home for two nights, and I would do it again. It is extremely close to ASU's campus. It was clean, people were friendly and I got a free ride to the airport. It was a great price; normal mid-range hotel with no amazing views. It has the amenities you need for a quick visit-including a pool and gym. The free continental breakfast is ok, especially if you just want cereal. I would not order bacon-not worth $2 extra."
1,"Went here to meet up with LA friends during Superbowl weekend. The decor is pretty unique here and the bathrooms are quite the trip. Bartenders are ace, cocktail waitresses are good looking, and the music is a healthy mix of bangers and decent indie hits. Tip for the door guys there don't let in 6 dudes at a time, even if they are Persian dudes with tons of cash who want to buy bottles. Boo!"
1,Charming cafe and it doesn't matter what you order. Breakfast - Lunch - you can't miss.
1,"It's usually a ghost town at the downtown Phoenix bars, but when a game and/or concert is happening, suddenly the bars are bustling. Such was the case last night at Majerle's, former Phoenix Suns player Dan Marjerle's sports bar. With the Beyonce concert across the street at the arena AND a D-backs game at the ball park, Phoenix was a hoppin'. My friend and I stopped into Majerle's, which I've been to a few times before, for dinner and drinks before going to see Beyonce. I had a cheeseburger and Cesar Salad. While I realize it's hard to mess up a Cesar Salad, my salad was seriously the best Cesar I've ever had. And my burger was packed with flavor. No wonder AOL named them Best Burgers two years in a row. We also had a wonderful chocolate martini (with Vanilla Vodka, not creme based) here. And on Fridays if you're in the mood to really start the night, the bar offers a Corona or Pacifico with a shot of tequila for $7 as part of their Sizzlin' Friday special. My only complaint was that our waitress suddenly went M.I.A for about 15 minutes when we were trying to close our tab so we could go to the show. But I'm still going to cut them some slack because this is one of a few fun places to drink in the downtown area. HOT TIP: A second Majerle's will be opening in Chandler in the fall."
1,"Did I ever write about the time I left my ipad here? Didn't realize for a couple of hours. Heart racing, I called, emailed, hoped it would be recovered. What gracious responses! I got an email early next morning, lots of reassurances, help for when/ how to pick up... Ok so I've reviewed this place before, key words are wonderful creative dishes, a light touch for subtle flavor (right now I'm having a delectable plate of greens, shaved herbs, summer squash wrapped around burrata--- who woulda thought?) but most amazing is the heart warming genuine service of all who care for you here. Oh.. And there's mightly fine wine on ""tap"". Heh heh.."
0,"I was so disappointed. After drooling over these pictures and rave reviews for weeks I finally drove the ten miles to get my fantasy pizza. Imagine my surprise when they handed me this tiny box weighing almost nothing. I actually asked the waitress if she gave me the right order. Funny, she asked me where i'd heard about the place and I told her the internet, she said ""Yawp (sic) ?..yeah most of those are family or friends, we got 5 stars or somethin'."" That explains ALOT! Gee, good thing me and my husband weren't really hungry, twenty bucks for a snack? Not bad quality but tiny quantity for price. Sauce is kinda raw, undertaste of wine and exactly two nickel sized slivers of garlic sausage per slice. Cheese is good quality. I see why the place was empty at 7pm on a Saturday. If your single or on a date and don't mind high prices go for it."
1,"A decent southwestern restaurant if you have a hankering for it. The margarita was good and the Taos combo was also good. The service was attentive and bumped this up to a three star review. Otherwise, the food is good not great."
1,"Dropped in today for the first time...and can I say it's worth the drive? No attitude. No c*nty saleswomen like that OTHER PLACE THAT SHALL NOT BE MENTIONED. Cashier, sales people and customers were all so darn friendly and helpful I don't know what to say other than...YAY! I'll drive the 20 miles here to get my dog the food he needs. Buh-bye local business pet store that's closer to me and sells the same brand of food I buy for my dog...I'm a fan of the BEAST!"
1,Festive with a deep beer list. Great set up if you like live bands delivering music from up on high while drinking micro brews. Lots of tv's and pretty good selection of Az brews.
1,"I am not sure what the deal is with all the two star reviews. For a casual dinner this place is doing a great job. The atmosphere is fun and friendly, the outdoor patio sparkles with all the little lights and the water feature is very cool to look at. My husband had dinner here and found everything much to our liking. The server was friendly and knowledgable. Our drinks were never dry and the food was just was just as described. It was a little cool the night we ate here but the dozen or so heat lamps did their job well. The layout of the courtyard is such no matter the size of your group everyone can have a great private meal."
0,"""No."" If you ask me about eating at Papaya Thai, that is what I will say. 0 stars for the single kinda scattered and scruffy staffperson. 0 stars for the cook who cannot prepare an offering from the menu as the menu describes it. In this case, I was down to two remaining untried Thai restaurants within quick reach of the Valley Metro Limo, and both in Tempe. The other half was in Tampa, and since he does not care much for Thai, I get the chance to try one. The limo arrived at Southern and Mill at 5:17 PM, and connected me with another limo at Broadway. With traffic, getting to McClintock took nearly 15 minutes. On exiting the limo, 5:50 PM, I walked back about half a block to the restaurant. On entering the restaurant, I picked up a menu and rang the bell and a somewhat harried staff person came to greet me. He asked me where I wanted to sit, at a table with 1 bench looking directly into the side of a huge fish tank...or the next table, which would leave no buffer between myself and the only other table seated in the restaurant. There are at least 120 seats in this restaurant. Why so fiercely contain people in the first three tables close to the door? You must get your business in fits and hurries and keeping only the 3 tables active is working for you? Then again, your telling me you are the only staffperson does not surprise me. The Help Wanted sign on the door was more than an indication that Help is NEEDED! When I was seated, staffperson offered to bring water. The phone rang and he was off, as he offered another version of ""I am the only staffperson here..."" I looked at the menu and made my decision. In the menu, there is a $2 charge listed for sharing. This goes against everything Thai I have ever known. The traditional Thai meal has everyone enjoying some of each dish served. Because of my proximity to the fish tank, I was quite up close and personal with the fish. The water probably isn't filthy, but the plexiglass tank is not helping the perception. 6 PM, as the cellphone chime reminds me of the passing of an hour. I am waiting for water and a staffperson who can take my order. 6:01, the staffperson comes, bearing a pitcher of water and a (My eyes are rolling in opposite directions because I am either overworked or stoned) smile. He filled up my glass and asked if I was ready to order. I replied that I was and ordered Som Tom, the Thai name for the green papaya salad. Staffperson replied that he did not know the Thai names for the menu items. The phone rang again. Staffperson's attention was no longer on me. The phone, his Pavlovian stimuli, had taken him away. I asked if he had heard me. He replied that he needed to go answer the phone. He asked if I minded waiting, as he was the only staffperson. I said I would wait. Off he went, in pursuit of electronic interaction. 6:10 PM, staffperson returns, apologizing for the telephone delay and asking about my order. I ordered the papaya salad without the green beans and steamed rice on the side. Staffperson took the order and went to the kitchen. The phone rang as he left the table, his pace quickening as he approached the phone. 6:18 PM, the door opens and 2 potential patrons enter. The bell rings and staffperson rushes to the waitstand to greet 2 new patrons. 6:20 PM, staffperson returns. He brings the salad and a bowl of rice. The salad that appears has some of the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad. Som Tom does not have cucumber, shredded lettuce or cilantro. On sending back the initial preparation, staffperson returned with the original preparation, advising the chef stated ""This is a traditional Thai presentation of the dish"". I sent the order back, citing the inconsistencies and asking for a new presentation. 6:25 pm. As I empty my water glass, the salad I received previously is returned, minus the cucumber. In asking staffperson if this is a new presentation or if it is an attempt to correct the original, he replied that he did not know. I stood and left. While the advertisement on the window of the establishment says they have ""The Best Curry in the Valley"", they will get no second chance to prove it to me. For all the phone activity, there was no one who came to pick up a carry-out order. Between this and the somewhat glazed staffperson, I have to wonder if this place is not a front for a drug business."
1,"RnR strikes me as a casual, urban place to meet up for drinks and a bite to eat. It's not what comes to mind when I think old town Scottsdale, but places like this popping up are helping to change my mind about the area. Unfortunately after I was finished I was reminded that it's still old town when I walked by a pan flute band on Main St. The old town parking corral is directly behind RnR, you can get to it from the alley next to RnR or off of 2nd Street. The space has a refreshing, industrial feel. I was impressed by the thought put into the seating options. Inside mostly features traditional high top tables for four, but I noticed they had a table near the bar that could seat at least 12. The downstairs patio features another bar, and both table and lounge chair seating. The upstairs patio has the best date seating, lots of tables for two. There was a lot of staff working during my visit. The host was friendly, and my waiter was attentive. My water was never empty and I got my sandwich in under 10 minutes. If anything they were a little too eager to please. I was both impressed and bemused when my waiter refilled my water glass, apparently noticed my ice had mostly melted, then returned with a scoop of ice to add to my cup. I just got a grilled cheese (which includes tomato and bacon) on my visit, I had dinner plans later but I was interested in feeling this place out. I really enjoyed it. The bread is cut pretty thick, which made me a little nervous. But it had a wonderful texture, and after a few bites I decided it worked for me and didn't overpower the delicious sharp cheddar and bacon like I expected. I look forward to returning to try other meals, and to sample what the bar has to offer. I understand RnR will have both late night hours and breakfast service. This is a great place to visit any time of day, but I'm excited about having a new, good place I can frequent after (or during) a night out."
1,"This mall has all the upscale shopping that you will ever need. Just make sure you come here with your credit cards in check as you are bound to fall in love with something when you come here. They have some of the best department stores in my opinion, and if you're looking for that perfect dress for any occasion, you have tons of options to choose from. I love how clean and perfect this mall is!"
0,"Soggy overpriced fast food burger with allot of hype. When you have to cover the walls with quotes how good your product is, then you have to something to hide."
1,4.5 Stars The seafood tower was amazing and my ribeye was very good. Very expensive. Much better experience than the ocean club in Newport Beach.
1,"Let's make it very clear that this is not a country club, but if you are a golfer like me and play ""slightly"" over par, this is a good course to play. Here are the pro's: -Cheap green fees (summertime, it is only 10 bucks for all you can play, I believe after 3 p.m.. I've shown up earlier than that and they still gave me the same price, with a cart. Awesome) -The staff is pretty cool -You almost never need a tee time, you can show up and they will usually fit you in no problem -No dress code (a huge plus while playing in the summer) -A pretty forgiving course, wider fairways -Cheap hotdogs in the snack area and they pump the AC pretty cold in the lounge -No doglegs on the course (I fucking hate those) -They don't seem to give a shit when you smuggle your own beer on the course -No punk kid cleaning your clubs 2 seconds after you are done playing so you feel obligated to give him a tip The Con's: -A good portion of the grass is fucked up. I've dinged the piss out of my clubs having to hit from the dirt on this course -The greens are in bad shape. You throw away a lot of shots putting from the ""mud"" or ""dirt"" I played there once where some asshole carved a pentagram in the green next to the cup. It always makes me feel better knowing Satan is watching how shitty I am playing -No bathroom on the course except for the port-o-shitter half way through the course. It usually has so much urine on the floor and walls you are better off pissing in the bushes or out of the cart when you are driving it. I was there one time where someone actually shit on the floor of the fiberglass shit house -There seem to be a lot of homeless people between holes 7 and 8 asking for change and/or beers set up by the dumpster next to the golf course -There are a bunch of cats that run out of the brush in the wash. I almost hit one with a chip shot the last time I played there. All things considered, this is a good course to play and have fun at. Plus you can't beat the price. Just don't expect Judge Smails at Bushwood Estates."
1,"With quaint accommodations, friendly staff and interesting selection of food choices, I was able to forgive, and forget, that the Centurion didn't yet have a liquor license. The Centurion is a cozy (and by cozy, I mean small) place. But it has personality and I can imagine myself hanging out on the patio after work - in cooler weather. For those vegetarians out there, Centurion offers a diverse selection choices. For our lunch, my companion and I split a Heirloom Tomato (with Brie) Panini and the Shitake Spinach Risotto. Both were flavorful. And the prices are quite reasonable at $8/each. The menu offers a diverse selection which includes burgers, pizza, pasta, salads (all around $9) and some higher priced dinner entrees (ranging from $23-$42). I hope to return to try their dinner entrees, the blue cheese crusted filet mignon sounds wonderful! I feel like I had fallen upon a hidden neighborhood gem. I'm crossing my fingers for their liquor license!"
1,"I'd leave my Scottsdale bubble for a few reasons (and yes there are additional exceptions) 1. Nobuo at Teeter House. 2. Fez. 3. My friends in various parts of the valley and 4. Mekong Supermarket. I consider myself to be a huge fan of Asian cuisine. Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Indian. You name it, I'll eat it. I have my healthy moments, but I am a seasoned eater and I am not afraid of exploring the world through my palate. Mekong is the perfect place for me to massage my senses. The aroma and sensations from the exotic product. The stunning visual of a catfish being bopped on the head, and then cut up and packaged. The cheesy elevator music on the loudspeaker. The delicious taste of a spring roll from the hot food bar. This place has it all. I usually come here for my Asian condiments and live seafood. Want a live crab? Boom. Done. Want spicy mustard or sriracha in a large bottle for cheap? It's yours. To me, there is nothing like taking the 10 mile drive in traffic to Mekong because I know I am going to get everything I want. Make the trek. You won't regret it."
1,"My sweet tooth was yelling at me! I had to stop in. Four times (to date) and each time I try something different. Other than the cheese curds (which where just ok) each visit was for the frozen custard. VERY RICH and CREAMY a little goes a LOOOOONG way. I have tried a small berry sundae, a pineapple malt, and a small black cherry cheesecake concrete mixer. The sundae by far has been my favorite. I love the simplicity, the berries were not overly sweet, strangely artificially thickened. The malt was nice and malty which I really appreciated and was rather thick even after melting slightly. Now the concrete mixer was the richest of the rich. Maybe it was because I decided to go with a cheesecake flavor (to which you can add any other fruit or topping flavor). It was very tart like cream cheese (about as tart as a good Greek yogurt) with small bits of graham crumbs swirled through and of course the blackberry flavor."
0,"Donuts are really good, if they have any when you get there!!! Went in on a Tuesday morning at 1030, and they only had a total of 10 donuts. Drove out of my way to go there and still ended up at Dunkin Donuts. Very disappointed!!"
1,"If you got a craving for pizza and don't want to feel too guilty about eating it, this always seems to satiate that fix. The pizzas here are ultra thin and there are many varieties available. Bryan and I always get 2 pizzas because we would still be hungry if we just order one without an appetizer and we can always take the extra home. Today we ate the pepperoni and mushroom pizza and the potato and feta cheese pizza with olive tempanade. Both were yummy in their own way! We ate the tomato, mozzarella, and pesto bruschetta as an appetizer which came out unbelievably quick while waiting for our pizzas. Sauce's pizzas are unique in their own right that I crave when I want something lighter than regular hand tossed pizzas yet don't want to spend as much for gourmet pizzas. It's a comfortable yet yummy in-between compromise!"
1,"4.5 stars! I've eaten at Liberty Market a few times already, but this morning marked my first breakfast- and what a fantastic meal it was!- of pancakes (3 in a stack; $6.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg#Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg w/ added topping of ""market-made granola"" ($1), a side of Grilled Flattened Meatballs ($3.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw#MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw, and a double-shot of espresso ($2) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg#M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg. Service was in fine form-- I couldn't have the market-made maple syrup blend, nor any of the house-whipped cream, blueberry compote, raspberry and apricot jams, or any of the flavored syrups used at the coffee counter (my server patiently checked for those items we were unsure about), and when I asked for chocolate chips, I was, instead, offered a chocolate syrup made from scratch composed of chocolate, sugar, and coco oil... good stuff! This syrup would be excellent on ice cream sundaes, too. (FYI, I didn't really need anything extra to add to the pancakes and meatballs... the two paired well!) I've mentioned this once before, but I think it's such a great thing to yelp about again-- buy an espresso (or any of their specialty coffees), and you can have unlimited cups of regular coffee during your meal! Not like I needed more caffeine after the double-shot, but I did have some of the house-blend coffee. After 1.5 pancakes, the meatballs (watch out, they're very greasy!), and caffeine, I'll be good to go for a few hours, despite only having four hours of sleep! (I'm hoping, anyway!) p.s. Despite tipping more than 20% at the cashier upon ordering, I thought Bruce, the server who took care of me at my table, deserved a couple more bananas for not displaying annoyance at my staying here so long. One more reason why I love Liberty Market so much! Addendum: After getting directions from Bruce as to the quickest way to 101 N, he asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee to go, gratis! Have I told you how much I love Liberty Market?? Helpful hint: Free wifi can be accessed by entering the code printed at the bottom of your receipt."
1,I love the Humble Pie on 7th Street. Great staff who always remember us and are very nice and attentive. The food is always good. One of my favorites is the burger. I know the is strange since you wouldn't think of Humble Pie for their burgers but they are fantastic! Also love the tempura green beans and the veggie salad! Drinks are great too. My favorite is the Pomegranite Martini which I have to limit to one per visit! They have a great happy hour and a super relaxed atmosphere!
1,"After a night of debauchery with friends, my friend and I found ourselves craving a comforting bowl of Pho. I've been a regular at Cyclo's for quite sometime but decided to branch out and try something new. I was pleasantly surprised with Pho Ao Sen! I am always happy when I enter an Asian restaurant and see Asians patrons...probably sounds a little weird but to me it speaks volumes. The tranquil aesthetics of this quaint cafe made us feel welcomed and relaxed. The decor had a modern Asian feel: minimalistic organic zen with soft ambient music playing - perfect for a Sunday afternoon. We ordered the Pho Dac Biet Bo Vien- House PHO'nomenal (House special combination of *sliced eye round steak, well-done brisket, well-done flank, soft tendon, tripe, and beef meatball) and the Pho Tai (Sliced eye round steak) and Goi Cuon- Spring Rolls. As with most Vietnamese restaurants the portion size of Pho is quite large and we could have shared. Both were delicious, filling, and had a nice aroma but nothing too overpowering. I've experienced a few places that use a little too much anise, so much that you can't get an overall sense of all the delightful herbs and spices used in this delicious creation. The Spring Rolls had a very fresh crisp flavor and were the perfect accompaniment to the Pho. I give Pho Ao Sen 5 stars! Best Pho I've had in the valley, beautiful atmosphere and friendly staff makes me one happy girl! :)"
1,"I have a fond place in my heart for this establishment I've been covering my all white meat rice bowls in their sticky spicy teriyaki sauce for 10+ years I've lived all over the world I always crave three things when I'm not living in Phoenix (or the USA) 1. Skim Milk 2. Mexican food 3. Tokyo Express Now pay attention If you like spicy food and teriyaki sauce, here's what you should order An all white spicy chicken teriyaki bowl 5 extra sides of spicy sauce A small salad 2 extra sides of salad dressing Ok, so I REALLY like sauce. Really. This place makes me want to cry I love it so much."
1,"I was up for a cold sugary drink before getting onto my flight so I walked over to the Wendy's next to this place. The guy at this place looked bored so I walked over to his counter to buy the drink. He was quite friendly and very prompt to charge me for the drink, which was quite a bit cheaper than the same drink at Wendy's. He also said I could either use the Coke machine or the iced tea dispensers. He had two kinds of iced tea, regular and a green blackberry. I took a little bit of the green blackberry which was very refreshing and tasted pretty good. I then went over to the Coke machine to get that. The sign on the Coke machine basically said once you buy a cup, you can refill it again and again the same day of purchase. I'll remember this if I ever have a layover in Phoenix. The prices at the Starbucks in this airport would drain my wallet fast if I had to be in the airport for any amount of time."
1,"Best Thai I have found in Phoenix, so far. This is not just excellent Thai food for Phoenix, this is excellent Thai food for the Bay Area. It's that good. Thai Lahna's food will intrude into your thoughts for days after you eat here. Like gustatory flashbacks, you will find yourself thinking about how wonderfully flavorful everything was. We had dinner here with Christine O & Myles (+1) and shared 2 appetizers and 4 entrees. We had Chicken Satay and Angel Wings. The Satay was the least interesting item we had, it was merely good. Everything else was great. Our entrees were Phaht Thai which we ordered with no spice and Khung Nahm Prik Pow which was sauteed shrimp with roasted curry paste, onions, chili, bell peppers and mushrooms. Our friends ordered a spicy pineapple fried rice and a beef dish which I can't recall the name of. All of the dishes were richly flavorful and had plenty of sauce to carry over to the steamed rice. One enjoyable highlight was the point counter-point going from the spicy heat of the rice to the almost sweet sauciness of the Phaht Thai. We can't wait to get back here and try more dishes. My only complaint about this place is that they need to put some sort of tinting on the windows to a height of about 3 feet. When cars are pulling into the spots right in front of the restaurant some diners were blinded by the headlights."
1,"Wings + Beer + Football = LOVE I am such a girly girl 99% of the time but come fall, I sort of turn into a dude..... This is not my most favorite place to catch the game, but a good alternative when I want to mix it up or my team is on a bye week. Good selection of boneless wing flavors. Oh god, just writing this makes me yearn for the season to begin!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Best BBQ ever. Go here and thank me later.
1,"Oh. Mah. Gawd. Let me get this out of the way.. the ONLY reason I'm dumping a star on America's Taco Shop is because they charge extra for chips and salsa. I HATE that. Charge me if I ask for extra salsa or something, but otherwise, come on. Now. Said chips? Perfect. Salsa? Perfecter. My taco? Made me cry a little bit. I am picky about corn tortillas, but these were brilliant. Go to America's Taco Shop. I will see you there."
1,There is a huge menu for this restaurant. Only tried sushi and noodle soup combo dinner so far. Lots of options on noodle soup dishes. Each noodle soup has a different soup base. The combo dish adds another small side dish option. Lots of food for your money. Sushi is decent and reasonable price. Great Japanese family-style restaurant.
1,"I don't think there is anything else to be said about Delux, it's been around and they offer nothing but great food; the Classic Burger and the Delux burger are both very delicious. I like Delux better and I do recommend medium rare; the quality of the meat is unbelievable. Love the sweet fries; I do prefer the mixture of both sweet and regular fries."
1,Guacamole was best I've had!
1,I am not going to complain about the quality of my manicure! They did a fabulous job...On the other hand their customer service was a little off. Very unorganized and they could just not get it together. It took them forever to assist us since we didn't have an appointment and are not regulars.
1,"I've got to hand it to Smart & Final for providing some incredibly economic pricing options for both name brand products and supplies. It's worth a visit to save some big bucks by shopping here. This is one of my go-to stops for party supplies like plates, cups, napkins, water, etc. Think of Smart & Final like the Dollar Store meets Costco."
1,"They do small engine repair here, so I took my lawn mower in. It needed some attention -- a new carburetor, spark plug, bulb, and gasket. Dropped it off in the morning and picked it up in the evening, very reasonable price."
1,"The hubs and I stroll through the indoor market when we are down at the farmer's market on the weekends. They seem to have a good assortment of items, though the prices are quite high. But I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt because they are a local business. One morning we were at the farmer's market and decided to grab something for breakfast - its never a good idea to shop hungry :). I got in line for coffee while the hubs ordered breakfast. The coffee is fabulous! I like my food simple - so when the hubs came back with an egg and cheese I wasn't looking for anything fancy (eggs, cheese, maybe a little butter, salt and pepper on some sort of bread product). I quickly found out that this was some sort of a hipster egg and cheese. Lettuce on an egg and cheese? Who does that? There were also tomatoes, mustard and assorted spices. I'm willing to admit that maybe its just me and my underdeveloped ""simple"" palette. So if you are a hipster and you're hankering for an egg and cheese - this is your place. Regardless, be sure to get a cup of coffee, its awesome!"
1,Amazing place. I had the swordfish with pasta and fresh veggies. Delicious great service! Although the check was a little late the waiter brough amaretto on the rocks to apologize!
0,This store is banking on the hope they are the only place to buy what they are selling. The mgr at the cash register was not only snobbish and unhelpful but down right rude. It is 12/21/12 I know Christmas time is tough for retail employees but I was at many other retail stores today and their mgrs and employees were extremely friendly. I spend approx 1/2 hour talking to a sales assoc who was very friendly and all was good until I got to register with the mgr and I ended up walking out without purchasing anything. I then went to my car and purchased desired items on amazon while in this stores.parking lot. I know business is good this time of year and maybe this companies business is always good. But the post office and Sears also used to be the king! I could explain all the facts of the situation but I am sure it would make no difference as I am confident this is the culture of this store.
1,Great place and experience. Food and beer cocktails were great. The scene is laid back and fun. There is something for everyone here. Enjoy it for what it is a great retro bar serving old school beer you wont find anywhere else so don't be whining for the latest micro brew or looking for the Scottsdale scene here. Parking is easy in the back alley and side streets. On weekend nights I'd like to see a separate entrance if you want to go just for the food and not have to pay the cover for the band. A fun place for kids too.
1,"I am so glad I found this nursery! Not only is it a beautiful place but the employees are unbelievable, so helpful and knowledgeable. Needed to get my garden ready for planting and they helped with everything. The plants they have look great, not all wilted like some other places. Think this has become one of my weekend stops."
1,"I LOL just thinking about some of the cast members and skits that I have seen at Jesterz. The first time I saw Jesterz, I was expecting it to be pretty awkward and honeslty didn't know what to expect. I was blown away how funny it got at times. Good clean funny. We went again soon after the first time but didn't go again for a good 2 years, we went back recently and was kinda worried as the crowd was not as big as past times. Even with a smaller crowd there were tons of LOL moments. Writing about it kinda makes me want to go back."
1,"This is a tough one. I'd found out about Mrs. White's by way of Lo-Lo's, and thought I'd try Mama's food before Son's. It was good, I'll say that. I had the smothered chicken and regretted it immensely - fried chicken covered with gravy amounts to a mess of watery breading. Between that and having to dig through the mess to find the bones, it wasn't exactly a lot of meat down my throat. Mac & Cheese and white rice as my sides were good. The ambiance? There IS none. I found more entertainment from the writing on the wall, which had clearly been painted over MANY times since the 60s, and the open/close sign which reads, if closed, to contact ""Jesus"". LOL. Unaware of the church across the street, I arrived right after Sunday services to find the place fairly full - some churchgoers, at least one newcomer party, and several regulars. Based on the caloric content of the entrees, I wasn't surprised to see about 50% obese customers, while the rest were inexplicably thin. As a Whitey, I can't say that I was comfortable. Clientele is almost all Black and while they are some of my best friends, I only felt welcome because of the cordial words spoken by our waiter and the cashier at the checkout, who clearly could have beat the crap out of me with one punch. Other than that, there were a lot of ""what are YOU doing here?"" looks from fellow customers. I kept wishing I had brought my sista friend with me, who would have loved this place. I'd go back, but it's not a perfect choice. Perhaps on a Saturday when church hadn't just let out. Also, the price is extreme - it's almost as high as Knott's Berry Farm which gives you more food for only about $2 more, and that's at theme park prices. This is just dumpy outskirts of downtown..but again, I don't wanna judge. I love small business and I'm proud of Mrs. White for making it this long; hope she continues for a long time to come."
1,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Paws Salon. I used to take my dog to Canine Preferred but the ladies at the front dest were flakey, so I thought I'd try a new place and I am SO glad I did. The owner Tracy clearly has a passion for animals. Walking in you are greeted by a cat, dog, and Macaw that call the front of the shop home. You are able to see them grooming the dogs (a big plus for me, you never know what some places do behind closed doors). She is very professional and seems like a no bullshit kind of lady (in a good way). She's to the point, tries to listen to exactly what you want and offers options and suggestions to help. They keep track of the previous cut that was given (it's annoying some places you to have to tell them every time). I would highly recommend this pet salon. They also offer daycare, and overnight boarding. I can't want to try the daycare to socialize my pup some more! Can't go wrong at this salon.."
1,"This restaurant reminds more of Hong Kong (where I lived for a couple of years as a college exchange student many years ago) than any place in Arizona. The atmosphere is definitely not upscale (more like some of the Long Wongs in PHX), and may be a bit of a culture shock to some, which is why I don't recommend it for everyone (4 instead of 5 stars). The food, however, is very authentic, though they don't always have the exact ingredients that you would find in Hong Kong. The dry flat rice noodles (ho fun) is among my all-time favorite Hong Kong dishes, and this place does it right. The clay pot dishes are also worth a try - really good. (Among the Chinese restaurants that I have tried in Phoenix, the Gourmet House of Hong Kong is #2. Number 1 is the Great Wall, which I review elsewhere.)"
1,"A friend of a friend was telling us about this place on Sunday morning, and how awesome their pizza is. It sounded awesome, but he warned us the line is usually an hour and a half long. Oh well, we went anyway. Luckily, we were early enough where we didn't have to wait long for a table. When we were leaving, though, the line was easily an hour long. We started with the wings, which come in an order of 14 and were delicious. Five of us were dining there, so we ordered two small pizzas, with each one being a half, so we had a nice variety of pizzas to try from. We got the BBQ Chicken, the Frisco, Grandma G's, and one more that eludes me now. All were pretty delicious, and I give them mad props for going out of their way to create unique pizzas with untraditional toppings (Grandma G's had potato on it). Our entire bill with a few drinks came to under $80. Oh, make sure you sit outside... the inside had a lot of loud kids, and it seemed to echo off each wall and annoy the hell out of our party. The women in our party also said the air temperature kept changing in there. Keep in mind, too, that they don't have a full bar, so if you're going there hoping to start off with a bloody mary, you're out of luck."
1,"Seriously need a remodel, but totally worth the money due to the free 24hr shuttle in a 5 mile radius!! Nice staff. Clean. Just worn down a bit..."
1,This place is heavenly!!! I have dreams about it on a regular basis. The cookies are so fresh and you can choose two different kinds and two different ice cream flavors. TASTY!
1,"Excellent customer service, super clean, and the food's not bad at all. Despite the fact that I asked for extra mayo on my sammy, but got NO mayo, was a little annoying. But, for some reason, something told me to pick up some packets of mayo. So I was in the clear and my annoyance never gained traction into anything that prevented me from returning. That, and the sandwich was pretty yummo. They also give a pickle and a free bag of chips to go with it. I do not, however, recommend the chocolate chip cookie. No bueno."
1,"Good service. Excellent value. I went for the ""All You Can Eat"" deal they have from 2-9 PM and was there for a few hours. I'm not fat or anything, I just felt like finding a good place to study and eat for a bit. The server was pretty attentive and the kitchen staff was pretty fast. I was kind of disappointed that the menu for the all you can eat deal was missing many of my favorites from the regular menu, but there were still quite a few good choices."
1,"Planet Sub is definitely a good option for solid, good tasting subs. I'm next door at Gangplank a couple times a week and we usually hit this place up for lunch. It's much better than the last place that was in this spot, has tons of options (we decided you could eat lunch there for a month and not have the same sandwich), and friendly staff. I'm definitely glad they put this in. It's a great option in the downtown Chandler area."
1,I would give them a 5 if the service was better. The food is always great. I've tried 6 or 7 different versions of the calzone and the stromboli is awesome. My boys love the pizza. The price is great for the portion. Great family spot and the delivery is on time.
1,"Yum! I was a fan of Grimaldi's...but this place surpasses them! We had half chicken tuscana (garlic cream sauce) and half chicken artichoke (pesto sauce). Amazing! Great flavors! Usually, I'm a fan of ranch on pizza fan (don't hate)--not needed here! Comes with the traditional crust, which was really enjoyable, but also available w/thin crust or wheat crust ($2 extra for wheat). Server (Zach) was nice, offered suggestions, and was on top of things. Kind of soft spoken, given the tv's and other restaurant noise. Hostess seemed like she was pretty excited to be there and everyone was polite. Prices weren't too bad--$18 for a large pizza, $8 for an individual. Variety of toppings, salads, appetizers, calzones, and drinks. Beers ranged from $3.75-$5 for the 16 oz. Excited to go back and try some more pizza!"
1,One of favorite happy hour places in town. If you get the wings here it shouldn't matter if you get anything else. Great location and nothing else needs to be said. Maybe a renovation on the parking lot.
1,"Mmmmmm...why did I wait so long to try this???? Unbelievable pizza!!!!!!!!!! I would give 5 stars, bjt the service was...well, not great. Its ok, we all have off days. We'll be back!!!!"
1,"A great experience every time we make it here. Where else can you slide into the dining room? We always have large groups and they are very accomodating, every table we've been at affords a beautiful view at sunset. They try to make it a complete experience. Servers are always very helpful and attentive. Steaks are good and the sides are good if not very inventive. The birthday dessert and cotton candy really cap off the dinners."
1,Great brewery and open atmosphere! Had the Buffalo Chickens sandwich. It was great. Washed it down with a Sunspot Golden Ale which was awesome. Will return to sample the other beers. Making a reservation online worked like a champ.
0,"I used to be a Los Sombrero's local. Started going (1998) before they were in their current location. The past few years Los Sombreros has gone hill. Increasing prices and food not as good. Marg's are subpar now. Los Sombrero's is no longer living up to what it used to be. Food is still good, just no longer great. All great things change and I am sad to see Los Sombreros change for the worse. The original chef/owner Jeff Smedstad has left and started Elote in Sedona - I must try there as I here it's what Los Sombreros used to be."
0,"I will be moving to Phoenix in the Winter and I thought I'd scout out some LFS while I was visiting, which led me to Reef Culture. At first I was positive seeing some nice looking displays and LED use, however this soon changed. On closer inspection, lots of the tanks were infested with aiptasia and bubble algae, and prices of coral were hugely inflated compared to other prices in the area and back home. The people were very unprofessional and unfriendly and first ignored me entirely despite trying to flag someone down. When I did manage to get their attention, I was belittled and treated like a child who knew nothing about the hobby (I have had marine tanks for over a decade ranging from large 55 gallon+ to tiny DIY LED picos). After this rude and demeaning experience, I continued to peruse the last few tanks and came across an angler fish. I watched him and he followed me as I walked down the isle as far as his tank would go and I backtracked a couple steps, amused that he was slowly walking along the tank with me. There was a loud crack as the man behind the counter slammed the phone down, snapped his fingers at me, and told me to ""stop harassing the fish."" Keep in mind, I was not tapping on glass or prodding anything as I am quite short and I could barely reach to the high up tank where the angler fish was, much less reach to ""harass"" any fish. After this rude treatment I promptly left. This kind of unprofessional treatment of the customers is shocking and unacceptable, not to mention the bubble algae infested tanks (one spore of that on the water that you get your coral in and your tank is infected too). I won't be doing business here when I move."
1,"Three stellar write-ups pushed me over the edge and I decided that it was time to take my self for a much needed pedi. When I arrived, the place was packed, but thankfully they gladly take walk-ins and I had only a brief wait before I was whisked away to my massaging, bubbling chair of goodness. I have to echo the other reviewer's comments on cleanliness and down-right bargain for the service provided. Not once did I have that ""eww, you aren't actually going to touch me with that"" reaction. I didn't swoon from toxic vapors as soon as opening the door. And my attendant was super friendly and completely cool with the fact that I had clearly neglected my heals for the last two months (something that was hugely apparent after she started filing away - how mortifying... skin flying everywhere!!!) And for those of you that might fear the Elaine experience (Seinfeld reference), fret not. You can actually understand everyone one that works here and shouldn't find yourself sitting and wondering ""what in the hell are they saying about me now?"" Take your twenty-bucks (plus a little extra for tip - unless you get flowers you will need thirty) and go get some much deserved pampering. Dear Paulene - my toes and heals thank you for the love! -- see pic ; )"
1,"Finding this quaint location wasn't to hard... i like that there is a parking lot right north of the place... as well as street parking :) you walk in the place and wow... its a completely different atmosphere... low lighting but in a calming way rather than creepy... they have a DJ.. the music makes the setting but to be honest it was a little odd for my taste,,, Our waitress was very nice and helpful... automatically served us cucumber water... (which tastes amazing!!) and then asked for our drink orders ... a good waitress can seriously turn everything upside down or completely make your visit ya know... its a pet peeve of mine.. customer service... every table had a pink candle lit... pink lights hung above the chefs area... it was just so relaxing! the mirrors on the wall around this cool looking splatter painting... i was diggin it... everything on their menu is served as appetizers... which kinda sucks.. they are all at least 6-12 bucks at least ... from what i saw.. and the waitress said that they recommend for people to get at least 2-3 a piece.... wow, on top of drinks.. its kinda pricey to me.. good thing we shared everything... the lemongrass chicken (cant remember the full title) was amazing!! so good... the gyozo (dumplings) were alright.. a little too minty for my taste... we had this other thing where they bring you the hot stone and you cook your own meat... it was alright but the stone only stayed hot enough to cook the meat med rare... i don't like my meat to moo at me... so its was alright... but i prefer it well done... the beef wrapped in grape leaves.. well i was soo excited to try them.. but was sadly disappointed... they were so fiery hot (spicy) that i almost had tears in my eyes... never did it say on the menu .. SPICY... after a server came over and saw us gasping for water.. he filled us up and said, oh yea those are pretty spicy... wow good thing i had my TUMS lol over all The atmosphere was amazing..... the staff was fabulous... the food... eh... the menu is crap... if your gonna serve spicy food you should say its spicy! isn't that some sort of health hazard?! and its kinda on the pricey side... i think i would go back again... But i don't think i would opt to... there are alot more dishes i would like to try... maybe a different location would be better?"
0,"I will still call it the Counter, because I'm the curmudgeonly type that is sometimes slow to accept change. (Who is Chloe? Fox Restaurants need not have changed the name just to eliminate the boutique...) The food has always been tasty. The split pea soup is absolutely amazing. The hot turkey sandwich is delicious, the chopped salad is a spot-hitter. I don't think the prices are too terribly high, after all, it's in Kierland, which isn't exactly a discount enclave. The service. Ah, the service. First, let me spare the hard workers in my tirade. The cooks, and those who actually are putting together food and cleaning, do a fabulous job. The servers - or register-runners, have been incredibly disappointing. They invoke this kind of back-story imagery: ""Mom! My gas card didn't work, I almost didn't make it to Dana's party, I mean, can you imagine if I would have run out of gas, and had to talk to a commoner?? Wtf, Mom!"" ""Shannon, your father and I decided that you need to pick up a part-time job, we will still pay for your BMW, your insurance, your condo, your cable, your birth control, your health insurance and your part-time college education, but we think it's time you worked about 8 hours a week."" ""OMG! This is soooo ridiculous and unfair, Mom, wtf!"" And that is how Shannon (name made up) came to work at The Counter. And that is why she sucks at service. And that is why she doesn't appreciate how hard the rest of us work to purchase an $8- sandwich, and how a simple smile, some humor, and a ""thanks for coming in"", or ""how is everything tasting today"", could make such an enormous difference in someone's dining (albeit counter style) experience. Instead, after ordering the Chopped Salad and the Pea Soup from ""Shannon"", the cook brought me my soup, and I enjoyed it. And I waited. And waited. There was no ticket, there was no chopped salad in the works. (The prep area is fully visable.) I graciously asked the cook if there was an order in for a chopped salad, and she said, ""oh no, I'm so sorry, let me make one on the fly for you!"". She did, I ate, it was delicious, and I thanked her. ""Shannon"" then presented me with my bill a full few minutes after I sat in front of an empty plate, I paid, and as she handed me my change she said, ""bye."" I don't think I need to elaborate on that. So - to the Shannon's of the world - hurry up and get a rich boyfriend and become a trophy wife so the rest of us don't have to deal with your shitty service, bad attitude and hateful unsmiling demeanor. And to the awesome cooks and service folks out there who manage at least a smile, bless you. Bless you, every one."
1,"Sweet Potato Tater Tots..................why are you still reading? what more needs to be said? Yum Yum getcha some! The only thing keeping them from 5 stars is their unwillingness to enforce rules with parents who bring kids and think everybody else wants to enjoy watching them run around the place like its a playground, its NOT - keep your kids at the table or at home."
1,"I have to say they are better than Subway, that's for sure. At least they put meat and cheese and the fixing's on your Sub not like subway where they measure everything and you get home and you pretty much just taste the bread. The staff is young but very polite and helpful. Maybe a little suggestion...if you can make homemade salads like Macaroni, potato salad it would be alot better."
1,"They really do a great job, and you will really pay for it. I don't have incredibly pricey clothing, so getting my $50 blouses dry cleaned here just doesn't make sense- but I would absolutely trust them with very important articles (nice sport coats, lined trousers, wedding gowns, blood soaked mattresses... haha, kidding)."
0,These donuts don't taste good anymore. They have an aftertaste like they are using a different type of oil
1,"Pupusas?? As a hardcore Mexican food enthusiast I was intrigued by the concept but barely able to figure out how this fascinating dish was pronounced. I am proud to say that I am a HUGE fan of pupusas now. Salvadoreno popped up in a search of mine to find a low-key, nice Sunday night place to relax and enjoy some food. It definitely was worth the visit to an interesting part of Mesa. The restaurant is very similar to a lot of Mexican food restaurants anyone who has lived in Phoenix will be familiar with. One room with several tables and a counter with interestingly-named dishes posted behind it. The waitress was very friendly, but I will say that knowing a little Spanish helped. My girlfriend and I both ordered the Pupusa combo platter, real risky based on other reviews - I know. I went with Pollo and the revuelta mixed with pork, cheese and beans. She had the chicken as well with carne asada. This little dish is fantastic! I think next time I'll just stick with getting two pupusas because I was extremely full and did NOT need to add rice and beans to the mix (although those were good too.) The only disappointment was the fact that Independence Day was on the TV in Spanish, but the volume was too far down to hear. I'd love to hear the voice-over actor for Will Smith busting out a ""Bienvenidos a Tierra, P***!"" On a more serious note, I look forward to heading back here as soon as possible. I'd love to try the Ceviche, as it's on the Best of Phoenix list, and there are a few other dishes (think breakfast) that looked intriguing."
1,SawTh[sic] Sense Christmas show for the second time last weekend. Great show - laughed my ass off. Thinking about going back for closing weekend... :)
1,"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley. I usually go for the turkey wrap or one of their pizzas. On this day we went for happy hour, which is daily after 9pm and tried several tapas and a 4 peaks beer. Everything was really good."
1,"I was thrilled to find my room huge, sheets crisp and clean, and the staff super friendly."
1,Love Love Love! All you need to do is order dessert here. It comes in small shot glasses & the flavors explode in your mouth..
1,I had dinner at Frank & Albert's while attending a conference at the hotel. Normal I try not to eat at hotel restaurants due to overcharging and quality of the food. I decided to try Frank & Albert's based on the reviews from Tripadvisor. Tripadvisor rates this restaurant as number two in Phoenix. We where seated on the patio next to the open fire pits. How romantic except I was with my work colleagues. Frank & Albert's is perfect for a date or anniversary. The location is nested in the luxury hotel setting directly below some kind of canyon. I ordered the Fillet Mignon. Yummy!! Everything on the menu looked so good. Frank & Albert's also had a great wine list. My work colleagues were very happy with my dinner choice. I used opentable to make the table reservation. I would definitely come back Frank & Albert's if I was in the area.
1,I have been eating at this Waffle house since I was a teenager and it has never failed to provide good food. The employees are courteous and the service is fast. The portions are good for the price and the small dinner feel is great to eat in. I have gone here many times with my disabled brother and have never had any problems with the staff or employees. I also like the fact that they are one of the few 24 hr restaurants available to eat at and this has come in handy many times.
1,"Decent upscale place in Tempe. Great ambiance outdoors on the patio. Service is very sketchy...sometime good, sometimes bad, never great."
1,"WOW!!! practically half price on everything compared to the chain stores. Staff is always very friendly and helpful, and i've literally saved hundreds of dollars since I discovered this store just under a year ago!"
1,"I have not been bowling in 24 years,so you can imagine i was worried. But, this place is clean and fresh. On certain nights,(Monday)and a few others you pay a $5.00 cover charge,then everything is $1.00 .Food ,drinks , games and most important bowling games. The instructions were easy. We got shoes in our size then went and picked out a ball. Lots to choose from! Lots of fun!!! It was a $20.00 night for 2 of us. The workers are very helpful and Friendly. Bathrooms were also clean. I did not see them spray the shoes with Lysol so that was a little gross.But, other than that it was a great time."
0,"Having a miserable experience flying from Boston to Reno. My connection was in Phoenix, and the flight from Boston was running a bit late. I asked both of the flight attendants if it would be possible to deplane before the other passengers as I had a very tight connection to make. One actually laughed at me and told me I would be fine. 12 hours, a horrible nights sleep (as they did not offer me hotel accommodations) and two delicious airport meals later I am sitting in the terminal waiting for my flight from Phoenix to Reno to board. Sorry buddy, not really fine. I missed my flight by 5 minutes. I would have been fine if US Airways offered their customers with tight connections the opportunity to deplane first, as every other airline I have flown on does. Will avoid them at ALL costs!"
1,"One of my favorites. The crispy chicken tacos are overstuffed with meat,lettuce,cheese and always filling. The prices are reasonable for what you get. Also like Julios g too next door for quick take out or ""no Tip"" casual meal. Self serve chips and mild chunky salsa are terrific."
1,"I love the clothes and accessories, the staff is friendly and the prices accomodate everyone!"
1,"This is the second time I've eaten here and it was as good if not better than the first. The first time I had the meat lasagna and the second time I had the cheesesteak. Lemme tell you this is one of the best Italian places I've been to in Phx. It's very Back East feel to it and I love all of the authentic Italian foods they have there, especially the meat, cheese and pasta counters. Check 'em out you won't be disappointed!"
0,"I will precede this lackluster review by stating the following: 1)I have only been to this place once. 2)I didn't get a chance to actually try the cuisine. 3)I am a sympathetic person to servers, as I have been one. That being said, I give this place one star for reasons of poor service. About six months ago, at around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon, we decided to eat at this place. The atmosphere was warm and cozy; typical college bar with college-aged waitresses. We made sandwich selections and ordered happy hour beers. The beers came, the food never did, and we watched other patrons come in, eat, and leave. All the while, our waitress never came by to give us an explanation or even get us another round of drinks (we got them ourselves from the bar). Since my bf and I both worked in food service, we are always sympathetic when we can see that a place is under-staffed. But after an hour of waiting, we finally crossed the room to speak with our server. She said, ""I can't imagine it will be much longer."" I think the more professional approach would have been an apology and admitting to forgetting to put in our ticket, which is what we gathered when we saw her speaking frantically with the cook. Where was the manager that day? Or someone who noticed that we sat there so long without our food or any communication at all? We left money on the table for our beers and walked out. I guess there is a first time for everything."
1,Pretty good coffee. Nothing special but better than starbucks by far.
1,Still love their bagels and apparently I am not the only one since they won Phoenix New Times for Best Bagel (2011).
1,"Always a healthy, fresh meal. One of my favorites is the hummus and grilled chicken appetizer(which is gynormous) and I have them add in some tabbouleh, then cucumbers on the side. Perfection. All the pitas, and the seasonal specials are always super good. Wine is also inexpensive if the mood strikes. Otherwise, great casual lunch and dinner spot that is extremely reasonable in price for the quality of food you are getting. There is something for everyone here, veggies, kids, etc. If I ever moved from AZ, this is the first place I would come visit upon my return. Parking can get hairy at the Arcadia location, and one time someone actually backed into my car when I was legally parked along a curb but that is hardly Pita Jungle's fault. The douche didn't even leave a note - but I digress and karma is real and nothing would keep me from coming back to Pita!"
1,"Preface: I'm being nice 3 stars is an OK rating and I don't want my opinions to skew the rating scale but a 2.5 star option if available would be welcome, again I'm being nice. This place is terrible. (I might be exaggerating) I have heard horrible stories about the brewery in Tucson, how the beer is fine but the food is absolute crap. I figured hey they are moving to Scottsdale in an area with an insane amount of delicious dining establishments, they have to of retooled that menu ... they didn't. The beer honestly is good not great 4peaks IMO is at least 2x better (again being nice) but I respect a local presence and craft beer so I cant knock them for trying and building a successful brand. That being said the food is really nothing special at all, they offer pairings like mac and cheese pizza (too gross to try) to things like salmon and steak (too fancy for here). I tried a burger, usually safe with a mix of sweet potato and regular fries. I also had the monkey shine which has the highest alcohol content (something I am supportive of) and even after that beer the food disappointed (how can that be?!). It wasn't that the burger was horrible but it just wasn't anything special, it was bland and I got the western that had tons of stuff on it. The biggest problem was the fries which ironically seemed to come out of the frozen food section of a local Frys Food and Drug (not even a signature, Kroger brand - house brand aka the worst). A friend joining me had the wings, the wings were actually pretty good but they were wings and wings are gonna be good in a place like this especially after some beer so I feel that we should take that for what its worth. With mediocre food at best and OK beer I don't see any reason to go here over 4 peaks. Improve your menu and I'll give you another shot. :)"
0,Donuts are worst I've ever had. I bought 2 dozen donuts using their 10.99 sale and it was the worst donuts I have ever had in my life. All the donuts were dry and stale. I should have gone a couple of miles over and bought Krispy Kreme. Krispy Kreme donuts are always fresh. These ones were worst that those that sat on the shelf for a week in a supermarket!
1,"Well, apparently Netflix just wasn't down with the whole ""Extraordinarily Happy Customers"" and ""Providing Tremendous Value For The Money"" business model that I raved about in my previous review. They're now changing their pricing structure so the One DVD At A Time ""unlimited"" package is $7.99 and the Watch Instantly unlimited package is also $7.99. So $15.98 together. They used to be $9.99 together. I'm keeping the ""Watch Instantly"" package for now, but the $7.99 for ""One DVD At A Time"" is just ridiculous. Yeah, they have a quick turnaround, but it's still the mail. You'd have to be a pretty hardcore movie watcher to get a better value out of an $8/month ""unlimited"" Netflix plan than just renting 8 $.99 movies at Blockbuster or Redbox. So yeah, I guess they're okay. The Watch Instantly service is still a decent deal. But ""One DVD at a Time"" is a total rip-off, and I never thought I'd use the word ""rip-off"" to describe Netflix."
1,"I'm from California and every time I visit Arizona I have to make a stop here. The ambiance is very nice and classy and located in a great/fun area. The bar and drinks are great and the food is fantastic. Like i said, I'm from California and live in the Bay Area, so I thought I knew what great seafood was - wrong! Who knew that the desert had better (well almost better) seafood than San Francisco or Monterey Bay? I had the Vanilla Battered Sole with Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese - Amazing! Never tasted anything like that - I recommend that this place be the first stop to anybody looking for a fun night out."
0,Seriously the most pathetic burger I've had.... ever? On the level of a Burger king or the like. With tip I paid $15 for the burger and fries. What a waste - and they even managed to get the order wrong. A buffalo burger that had no buffalo sauce on it. When I told the waiter he made up for it by bringing a little cup of sauce. Oi... pathetic.
0,"I read the two good reviews here on Yelp, so I was looking forward to a good Italian dinner. Unfortunately, it must have been an off night. The waitress didn't want to be bothered and the meatballs and the tomato sauce on the spaghetti didn't have much flavor. That's the test of a good Italian restaurant for me. If the sauce is good, they usually get thumbs up. This sauce wasn't ""bad,"" but it was bland and watery. Even the bowl of spaghetti wasn't drained properly so there was a dripping, runny mess at the bottom of the paltry bowl of pasta. This place is right around the corner from my house and Dominic is my brother's name! So I was really disappointed."
1,"All I have to say is get the California Club. I live in the East Coast and I still crave for the sandwich. I wish I had the chance to try other things on the menu. The drive-thru concept is pretty neat, but there was a bit of a wait. Guess you can't rush perfection."
0,"Maybe I should have had a hot dog but I crave Chicago's Italian beef, I didn't get it here just some greasy old beef of some kind, use beef broth if the meat gets dry, not a whole can of olive oil, YUK! It didn't have that good Italian beef flavor so I asked for giardinara to add some flavor, it was very oily too and I had to pay extra for any peppers either hot or mild. No stars for that beef, the only saving grace was it didn't make me too sick, I expected to be sick for days not just one day!"
1,I love the menu here it has many selections of many cultures including Italian!!!
0,"Don't bother with this place. I had never been here, my husband and I decided to pick up some food to take home. We ordered a shrimp tempura appetizer, an assorted tempura appetizer, a lobster appetizer, and yakisoba. When we got home the order was totally wrong. Instead of lobster we were given mussels (which were gross), instead of assorted tempura and shrimp tempura we only got assorted tempura with 2... that's right only 2 shrimp in the whole mix. The yakisoba was the only part of the order they got right and it was not that great, pretty bland. I love Japanese food and I was really excited to find a place near by and while we were waiting for our order we were excitedly planning to come back and have their sushi, but after this complete mix up and poor quality food there is no way I would trust them with anything raw. Never going back, such a complete disappointment."
1,"I'm not gonna lie, I possibly had the best sunny side up eggs ever. A simple dish so rarely cooked perfectly."
1,"Great customer service, competitive rates, and I always get a call right back from Jeff! Nice to have an agent who actually cares about his customers. I would recommend giving him a call."
1,"Makes the job of shipping packages a lot less miserable. I can purchase any supplies needed, heck--they will even fill out the forms! I come bring all my packages here, ship them whatever method I want and get it all done without stressing. While I hate dealing with shipping things... this place makes it even a bit fun with their service with a smile and fun conversation added in."
1,"Always wanted to stop by, and give them a try. Only thing that stopped me were some bad rumors of how clean they are? But then again, how clean is all the places we eat at?? So I had their 8"" Meat Ball sandwich, this was my second choice? I wanted was their cheese steak! But they were out of cheeses steak. But I do not regret their meat ball sandwich. It was very good, wish their bread would have been more toasted. But I thought it was good anyways. Place looks like and feels like a lot like Subway. But I do agree, they do add more meat to the sandwich. I will probably come back again."
1,"My first ever trip to Bass was overwhelming. Like walking into a Sportsman's Warehouse that had mated with Dick's Sporting Goods, and then gone on steroids. Bass Pro Shops is an outdoor person's dream. And it's good for the whole family, oddly enough! Once you get inside this massive place, you have an upstairs and downstairs. There is a kid's area, a restaurant with fresh fish, a huge women's section and mens, and areas for fishing and boats and hunting and camping and survival and gear for any occasion. You can look at the giant fish tank, climb up a faux rock side for $3, and just be purely entertained for ages. They have snack foods and jerky and sweets. BBQ grills. Do they have guns? I don't know, probably! They have GPS equipment and water bottles and on and on and on. It was exhausting in a great way. My camping/outdoors needs tend to be more mimimalist oriented so I prefer an REI. But I like it here a lot. I picked up some socks that have a lifetime guarantee, and a nice woolen shirt for almost nothing, and a couple of gifts for the hunter/outdoors people in my life back in Tucson. Bass: it is an experience."
1,"I've heard way good stuff about this place for a while and finally had the pleasure of sitting down and having some lunch there. Thoughts: Staff was friendly and quick, nice place, very clean and some hi-tops and lots of tables and outdoor seating as well. Chicken salad bagel sandwich wasn't too bad at all, except for the nuts in it - I'd probably eat it again however. Had a tomato basil bagel toasted with it... yum! I'm wanting to go back to try different menu items now :)"
1,Fast. Friendly. Cheap. If you get the ultimate package you get a free basic car wash in a week. Just keep the receipt.
1,"I enjoy some burros because it's a good cross between fast food and sit down Mexican food. The taste is always fresh, and good - the service is fast and friendly, even with a packed house. It satisfies my Mexican fix and does not leave me regretting life afterwords .... (like Filbertos does) I have only had this location, but have gone back numerous times and will continue to hit this place up and work my way through the menu ... I had the beef taco and been enchilada today ... see pictures ... you will want."
1,"Cowboy Ciao is one my favorite restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale. To start with, they share a wine list with Kazimierz. My favorite menu item is the Stetson Chopped salad. My only wish is that the serving was bigger! I can't get enough...and I'm too embarrassed to order two. The flavors in this salad are amazing! Smoked salmon, Israeli cous cous, creamy dressing. For dinner, I actually like the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry. The tastes are really unique and I got to try mushrooms I hadn't had before. It's great! I did try the Bacon Peanut Brittle for dessert and I cannot recommend this. It was not good at all. It just makes the brittle really greasy and then you run into chunks of bacon...ick. Thank God my husband ordered the Chocolate/Peanut Butter pot pie so I could steal from him!"
1,"I love Greek food, but I need to stop letting my friends drag me to this restaurant. The staff is extremely friendly and the place is comfortable, but for me the food is always a disappointment. I know I know, it's a chain... and maybe I just have high expectations, being that I'm from back east where we have small family-run Greek restaurants on every corner."
0,"There are few things I cannot stand more than eating out for pizza-by-the-slice. Those are: slices so big they contain an entire days worth of calories and charging additional for traditional toppings. While I understand the appeal of this centralized pizza joint -- a slice is 1/4 the pizza itself. The crust is a couple inches high and the pizza itself is barely 1/4 inch. I had cheese and while cheese pizza isn't remarkable as is, the slice I had here was considerably unimpressive. We paid $9.31 for 2 slices and a 20 oz beverage. What also put me off to this place was the cold staff and multiple things did not seem to be working right while there -- including their ice machine and their sound system (cut on and off). I was also not impressed how, never truly hearing of Sal's before, the employee made it seem like a chain of few. Go to their website and you will realize otherwise. This location is franchised. I will not return (unless I am not paying). Instead, I will take a jab at one of the other multiple fast food options on that corner."
1,"Having been to Dave & Buster's in California, I was pleased to see one nearby in Phoenix. Our family enjoys the games and food offered at D&B's. It's not the best bar food you ever had, but it's alright. Some of our favorite dishes... Chicken Sandwich & Fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f2z4RM_ungk_zQwcpZcpcQ?select=pL9gMcMhSu66djzRs0EE0g Sliders, Wings, & Fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f2z4RM_ungk_zQwcpZcpcQ?select=duqkD08yPYfZzK2BdwXSOw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f2z4RM_ungk_zQwcpZcpcQ?select=gmI2y1_o4YxyNsuhu4-PGA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f2z4RM_ungk_zQwcpZcpcQ?select=-SYnpluFm_tcBObKnYpR1w Chicken Sandwich w/Bacon & Sweet Potato Fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f2z4RM_ungk_zQwcpZcpcQ?select=EkZL6PdNv4kkgopmT6IK8g Besides the video games, my Son and I enjoy shooting pool on their championship size (9 ft) pool tables. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f2z4RM_ungk_zQwcpZcpcQ?select=_L7O1ZhQ9EDnO1LHv9b10g http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f2z4RM_ungk_zQwcpZcpcQ?select=6IveT3g9EW-lLEjwbrblZQ Overall, it's one of our favorite places to go where the entire family can enjoy a night out. They serve alcohol at the bar and restaurant, so the adults can enjoy themselves while the kiddos play games, bowl, shoot pool. Return Factor - 100%"
1,"Good food, good service, good price, shitty location. I had the carne asada plate which came with guac, beans, and corn tortillas. The tortillas were amazing, the carne asada was above average, as were the beans. Unfortunately, as good as it was, it's still Mexican food. Not that I have anything against Mexican food, it just, for the most part, all tastes similar. Nothing really stood out as AMAZING. If I'm in the area (god forbid), I'll def. eat there again, but I'm not going to drive from the E. Valley to go here. Bonus points for having 7-Up in a bottle, made with sugar."
1,I visited Sala Thai with a friend and I had the Pad Thai. Food was pretty tasty and very filling. It had a nice tang but I might have preferred to have a fork and knife to cut the very long noodles with. Other than that I'd definitely visit again.
1,"After hearing good things about the Scottsdale location, I was looking forward to lunch at Arcadia Farms when visiting the museum for the Ansel Adams showing. Unfortunately, it was a little disappointing. Service was painfully slow. I'm not sure if that was the kitchen or the server, but in either case, I was not impressed. We started with the baked goat cheese. For some reason, I envisioned the caramelized onions and roasted tomatoes atop the cheese, but everything was combined. While it was quite good, only the bottom portion was hot. The rest of it was only lukewarm. I wondered if perhaps the dish is prepared ahead and refrigerated, resulting in the uneven temperature. We also shared the smoked turkey and warm brie sandwich with white bean salad. They generously served each of us a full side of the salad with our half sandwich, which was more than enough. Although the sandwich had just been grilled, the inside was still somewhat cold. I also would have preferred just a little more apple, but overall, it was A-OK. The white bean salad with red peppers and possibly cucumber if I remember correctly was sorely lacking in flavor. Salt helped, but not enough to save the dish. If it was dressed with anything other than oil, I missed it. Arcadia is just fine if you're already at the museum and looking for a bite. Otherwise, I don't know that I would return."
1,"Indulge Burgers got a few things right and a few things wrong, but overall, I was very pleased with my experience. We had a Living Social deal, and got the sweet potato and regular fries combo, as well as a side salad to start. The fries were good, but nothing special. The salad made me want to cry. I know you don't go to a burger joint to get a salad, but couldn't you at least try to make it a decent salad? It was all white lettuce and a few sprigs of sliced carrots. My husband wanted me to give the place 3 stars for the lettuce alone. But, the burgers themselves were good, and the Build-Your-Own was a really good deal. There is good variety on the toppings, cheese, sauces and buns to choose from. My turkey patty was huge - it was overflowing out of the English muffin. Some plusses: the service was really, really excellent. One of the best servers I've ever had. Also, while we were waiting for our table, the owner/manager came around and offered everyone samples of margarita. Since I'm pregnant and couldn't try the sample, he said I got a free milkshake. After we were seated and he was walking around, he made sure our server knew that he had offered a free milkshake and made good on the promise! That was so cool. I left totally stuffed and very satisfied."
0,"I called this company to move a pool table that I had purchased from a private seller from their home to mine. I was able to set up the appointment easily, but that is the most positive thing I can say about this company. On the day of the scheduled delivery, I got a call from the person I bought the pool table from, saying that Diamondback Billiards did not have my address or phone number and didn't know where to delivery the table (even though I was the one who set up the appointment and definitely gave my information during the phone call). So, I gave them my address, they showed up and set up and re-felted the pool table without incident. When I went to sign the invoice, I noticed that they even had my wrong last name on the invoice and had the seller's address listed as the Buyer and the Seller. I dont even know how this would happen except that the person I talked to when setting up the delivery was not doing his job. Also, I asked on the phone if they could bring an extra yard of fabric to cover a cue holder that I have and was told that it would not be a problem. And, you guessed it... the delivery guys knew nothing about it and didn't bring any. So, I went to the store the next week and asked if I could purchase a yard of the felt that they used to cover my table (I couldn't find a good color match at JoAnns). They told me that they would have to order it and it would cost $55. For a yard of felt.... yeah... that's nearly as much as I paid to have an 8 foot pool table covered. Needless to say, I didn't buy the fabric and I definitely will not use Diamondback Billiards for any of my billiard needs - too unorganized for my tastes. Also, when I was at the store I noticed that their selection of pool cues and other accessories is very limited. Unless you're in the area to go to Ikea, don't waste your time."
1,"Two words for you. Mouth. Orgasm Wifey and I decided to eat here for our 5 year wedding anniversary. I have to say this is one of the best meals I've ever eaten, hands down. We bought a Restaurant.com gift certificate that cost $10.00 for a $50.00 Gift Certificate. They also have half priced bottles of wine on Friday nights as well. I went with the 5 course menu. I chose 2 of the dishes, and let the chef pick the other three. We started out with the Crudo Cheese plate that was phenomenal! It had goat cheese, goat feta, goat mozarella (sooo good), cherry compote, roasted dates, tomatoes, cured lamb jerky, smoked olives and truffles with toast. If that doesn't give you a food stiffy, your not human. The first dish I had, which was one I picked, was the butterfish crudo. It was served with oven roasted tomatoes and lardo with some sort of escebeche type sauce, hands down my favorite plate in Phoenix right now. Holey cow! Next, I had the albacore crudo with truffles, apples, black garlic and pepper. Another amazing dish. My next dish was one the chef selected as well, it was their Japanese Fish Market Special. I don't recall the type of fish, but it was good. I felt bad for this plate though, it had to follow some illlll dishes. The 4th course I had was the mushroom gratin. It had hen of the woods, crimini, potato and was topped with an egg. I felt it was just too much, a little clunky. That's probably just my taste though, there was nothing wrong with the execution of the dish. I finished with the roasted veal served with parmesan creamy polenta. Friggin amazing, I wanted to whisper sweet nothing into it's ear and smack it on the boohiney. We went with a great bottle of Nebbiolo, that was exceptional. The service was excellent. At first I was kind of weirded out with the restaurant being inside a retail shop, but we moved to one of the high top tables and it felt more like a quaint little cafe. What a great meal, fargin amazing!! Pics to come"
0,"Well...no worries for the continued bad service...awful prices...average inventory....and just overall bad experience....because the store closes forever this weekend. I have never cared for the place....so I definitely won't miss it. However if your looking for some decent electronic gear at 60-80% off....then this is your weekend to go. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends"
1,"Meh..not particularly memorable. I've eaten at this location and the one by ASU, though I like this location better. I would probably only eat here if I was walking by and I was starving. The cookies ROCK though, I like that you get one with your sandwich. And they have my favorite flavor of Jones Soda (Sugar-free Black Cherry) which kicked ass. Warning: The roast beef sandwich (Overture?) comes with horseradish sauce and it is hot as a mother. I like the spice but it was almost unbearable. My nose pretty much turned into a snotty waterfall. Go to Opa Grill next door instead."
1,"This wasn't the first time, but we went to Tutti Santi for a family Christmas Eve Dinner. All I have to say is that everything was simply perfect. Not only the food, but the service. Which to me makes a restaurant with great food go from good to great. I ate the lamb shank- Angello Dorato, which fell off the bone and was delicious. I cleaned the plate. Dad had the veal marsala with fettuccine alfredo. The veal was fantastic and the alfredo was just right. The sauce was not too thick-not to thin. Dad cleaned the plate. From him being in the food industry for 30+years and eating in many italian establishments both here and Chicago, believe me that says more than alot. Mom had the special of the night, which was a cioppino with tons of seafood. When most italian restaurants serve this dish at least one of the seafood items will be rubbery or fishy tasting (not in a good way) especially the mussels. Not here. Everything was the way it should be. I felt this was the plate of the evening out of 3 great dishes. Mom didn't clean the plate, she has a small stomach. But I will be eating the leftovers in about two hours after I sleep off my meal. Everything from the bread, the calamari fritti, to the tiramisu was fabulous. I'm glad we couldn't get reservations anywhere else for this special meal. Gratzi and Buon Natale. Oh yeah, I didn't get the raviolis this time, but if you've haven't had them it's a must try."
1,"We stopped in to Copper Blues on Friday night after a Mercury game at the US Airways Center. Fantastic place! Unbelievable beer selection, great views of downtown and an excellent band the night that we were there made for a really great downtown experience. Will definitely be back again soon!"
1,"I love Sapporo. They have reasonable prices, a big menu, great music always playing, entertainment (people watching), etc... Their sushi is very good. They have fun drinks. If you make a reservation for dinner you usually don't have to wait. P.S. They have amazing deals for happy hour, but get there early cause it gets packed!!"
0,"I'm going to break this down to explain my two stars. Here we go. THE GOOD: * Great Sindhi biryani - the rice is flavorful, the chicken is tasty, all in all a great dish. * Chicken boti tikka (boneless pieces of marinated chicken grilled in a clay oven) - also tasty, but have had better elsewhere * Naan - Really good stuff. Crisp and soft in all the right places - exactly how it should be made. Better than 95% of other Indo-Pakistani places in the Valley. THE BAD: * Chintzy interior which seemed like you just warped yourself straight back to the Punjab somewhere, complete with water-stained panels on the ceiling. 99.99% of the time, this doesn't faze me at all, but something was a little off and I don't know why. * A surly ""aunty type"" who's standing behind the register and doesn't even want to greet you unless you're apparently related to her or go to school with her kids * Said ""aunty type"" disappears into the kitchen for 5 minutes at a time, so you stand around and wait. And wait. * Said ""aunty type"" expresses nonverbal displeasure when you ask her for anything. Case in point: Asking her for tamarind chutney. Even though you waited for your food for 30 minutes. * Said ""aunty type"" brings back a tiny plastic cup of goopy, thick tamarind paste. Huh? * Said ""aunty type"" doesn't say ""thank you"", smile, or anything when you go up to pay, even though you've been nothing but friendly and appreciative. So much for engaging a potential repeat customer. She could care less about your patronage. THE UGLY: * Big screen TV tuned to some badly acted Indian soap opera about some ancient king of Sri Lanka who tries to get it on with his handmaidens while his brother schemes for the throne while twisting one end of his moustache, but then switched to another channel showing bad, unknown songs from 4th-tier mid-90's Bollywood movies. Although I am not kidding you...there was one video where a guy and a girl were doing their running around and singing thing....in the SWISS ALPS. And then, all of a sudden, in the middle of all that snow, a table appears full of Indian food and an umbrella advertising beer and pretzels. WTF? So, in the end, here's the equation: 1 Pretty Good Food - 1 Dubious Dining Room - 1 Surly Aunty Type - 1 Singing/Shrieking Girl/Guy While Eating Curry On The Matterhorn Which Makes No Sense - 1 Overly Randy King of Ancient Sri Lanka Who No One Really Needs To See = 2 Stars. Bah."
1,"If you are looking for only raw vegan food, this is your place. Nothing is cooked, everyhthing is 100% raw. They offer a variety of creative options from appetizers, wraps, soups, pizza and pasta. They have freshly squeezed juices, smoothies and a variety of different health shots. The dessert is yummy as well. This is a must try!"
0,"For a chain or restaurant in general with ""wing"" in the name, this place really doesn't impress. If all you're looking for is standard draft beers, mediocre wings and sports, sure it'll fit that bill but it won't stand in any discernable way. Wings are just average sized. Selection of sauces is good, the hottest is pretty hot but not extremely flavorful. I suppose it's just there to burn you twice, you know what I'm talking about. I won't go on promoting a bunch of local bars or chains locally that do the same thing with wings, beer and sports. Oh okay, I will; Hazelwoods, Native New Yorker, Zipps and Tweakwoods all do some/everything better than Wild Wings."
0,"No, I don't want to take the bus to get to the train. In my opinion, they didn't go far enough for people who live in Phoenix. It may be a good solution for Tempe and Mesa residents commuting to Phoenix, but it isn't effective for Phoenicians who want to get from the north valley into CenPho."
1,"As you may have read in a previous review, so graciously provided by Dally, that Four Peaks is our post-Tuesday night hockey watering hole. We normally show up stinky and limping or in some sour mood or another. Somehow we always leave a little happier, but still limping, well I do anyway. Unfailingly, we are greeted by the bouncer, who no longer cares to see our ID's, either because he can see the age in our strides or because he knows us now. I would like to believe the latter. Also, waiting for us is the lovely and nicht so talented Karina. Bless her poor soul for putting up with our asinine questions about her life and our requests for more water. She humors us anyway. We are made to feel like this place is home, at least for a couple of hours on a Tuesday night. Karina knows what we order for drinks and never has to ask, just brings. I usually switch between a simple salad with a great balsamic vinaigrette or a plate of fries. I know, diametrically opposed. Just depends on the mood and how committed I am that day/week to my diet. I always get the 8th St Ale though. It is very good and for 3 bucks can't be beat. I have enjoyed the pretzels, the now ""famous"" nachos, with chicken mind you, the spinach-artichoke dip, some of the various wing flavors, and a pizza. For late night dining they are all very palatable. I have a funny wing story, but I think it is only funny to me, Dallas, Z, and our friend Peter. If we ever get the elusive Z to join, I will make sure he shares his story on here. Until then, check out Four Peaks in Scottsdale. The late night menu satisfies and is not hard on the wallet. Tell Karina Brad sent you. You won't get a discount, maybe just a laugh."
0,"I have always been a fan of Burlington's deals, however I will not be shopping at this one again. I went to return a belt... pretty simple. Instead, I stood in the customer service line for 15 minutes thanks to an employee of Burlington buying/putting things on layaway. It took three other staff to help her out. There were no words said to me except ""Hold on"". I was pissed. When the lady was finally done, the employee at the service asked ""what do you want?"" Serious help is needed there! If you work in the area of ""customer service"" I think you should have some."
1,"Sidebar is a trendy, hip down town bar located above Pei Wei and Starbucks. The bar is small, the decor is modern with a retro feel (Urban Outfitters, maybe?), dark wood, curvy white bar stools, ambient music and muted lighting. The beer and wine selection is good. A little pricey ($3 PBR, but at least they have it, and $5 Blue Moon), but not too bad. They have a good selection of spirits, too, Patron, Chopin Vodka, Booker's Bourbon, as well as the standard stuff, so there is definitely something for everyone. The ""smoking patio"" is a stairwell that leads outside the building. So, needless to say, it can get a little ridiculous with people crammed on the stairs puffing away. The place was cool. The crowd was definitely the hip and trendy crowd, but not too pretentious. After a second trip here on New Year's Eve, I am sold. The cover was only $5, the staff is/was friendly, warm and welcoming. They have great drink specials, not just the price but great creations."
1,"!!!!!!! *** O M G ......So GOOD *** !!!!!!! My family & I keep coming back to this place. We drive over 10 miles to get our fix. I think it's safe to say that we are officially hooked, and when we are jonesin for Tacos Atoyac there better not be anyone or anything standing between us and our Food! Today we all came aways lickin our chops and yummy in our Tummy. I might not brush my teeth tonight! Here's what we had: ~ I had scrambled eggs with chorizo (dry), cheese, onions, potatoes, and Jalapenos. Served with side of refried black beans and spicy rice, and a little plate of grilled onions (sweet & tastey) and jalapenos. ~ The little woman had a Spicy burrito:al pastor, cheese, onions, jalapenos, mayo, avocado, ~ The kid had 5 mini carne asada tacos with cheese."
0,"I guess you really can't put lipstick on a pig. I will say this, it's nice inside all new building and equipment, but it's very much a westside gym. Many Raider hats and 0.0 eye candy. I would rather go to Moon Valley all the same new stuff but much better loking people. I will say this, it's good to see people in a gym that need to be there, and it also seems very gay friendly."
1,Great iced tea. Terrific Roast Beef and mashed potatoes. Love the biscuits. You can't go wrong at Cracker Barrel.
1,"My husband got back today from New Jersey (what a relief he isn't stuck in Hurricane Irene's path anymore!) and since we were in the neighborhood we figured we'd go to Over Easy. Read my most recent review on how that went (ie, a bust.) We stopped at Starbucks at the Safeway next to Over Easy and got our kids a pastry each while we figured out what we'd do. I turned to trusty yelp on my droid and they said that not only was Taylor's Cafe open, they do breakfast, and they were only about a mile from where we were. We decided to give breakfast one more try, called Taylor's and put our names on the list. When we arrived it was a little hard to find, but we called and they told us where it is. The decor is cozy and inviting. We waited at the bar for a few minutes while a table was readied, the manager was very attentive. I told him what happened at Over Easy and he was horrified. We live in Avondale, we're willing to drive for a good breakfast and also pay a bit more for good food and good service. Let me tell you, Taylor's Cafe really turned the morning around for us! My kids each ordered an apple juice, and one got chocolate chip pancakes, the other got strawberry waffles. Their kids menu is $8 each, but the portions are huge, it's easily something an adult would put away. I stole a bite from each, they were very tasty and there was enough for doggie bags. My husband got a build your own omelet with 3 different cheeses and chicken sausage. With his omelet he got 2 choices for sides, so he chose hash browns and cottage cheese (he almost went with a bagel but was pleased to hear about the cottage cheese.) The chicken sausage was an interesting option that we had not expected. He also ordered a mocha, which at $4 was about the size of what you'd get at Starbucks, and my husband said that it was on par with their quality. I ordered the Joe's special, intrigued by the list of ingredients. It was flavorful and delicious. The country potatoes were very tasty. I ordered the homemade raspberry lemonade, it was tangy and sweet, really tasty on a hot summer day. We came to the decision on 4 stars because the food was good, but not out of this world. They have fantastic options for the health conscious, and it seems to be popular with the patrons of a local gym because there were tons of people coming in work out gear. There is plenty of space (you don't feel like sardines in a can), the staff is polite, competent, and professional, and the ambiance is nice. We will definitely be coming back."
1,"I started going to Sushi Eye since it opened. I quickly befriended Paul and Richard Cho who are the owners of the establishment. A more genuine and convivial Father-Son team of restaurateurs have never opened an establishment in Arizona. Koreans (by ethnic group) are by far the largest sushi bar operators in the USA and very successful at creating American pleasing establishments. The Cho clan left Northern California to come to the Valley for sun, golf and open sushi bars. They succeeded at all three. Loud House music, Sports Center on ESPN and lots of Shochu, can accompany your fresh escolar sashimi and ASU roll. If your sushi'd out try the Nippon-Hawaiian fave, Chicken Katsu. A warm, ""Irasshaimase"" awaits all who enter this charming dollhouse sushi bar. By the way, I drank so much Shochu at Sushi Eye that I took a little nap on the gravel out in front of the establishment until Richard Cho came and rescued me from passing out in the gravel. A sushi chef and a finer wingman never existed in Chandler"
0,"So I had this important event to attend in California and I've already spent a lot of money preparing for my trip. Earlier in the month I had received a coupon for $40 off any service at Epic salon. Wow, that is a lot of savings and I could sure use to save some money. Epic uses Goldwell products which is my product of choice. I just needed a tint touch-up (about 1"") so I went to this salon... I had already had an awesome experience at another salon in town, but I couldn't pass up the savings by using the $40 coupon) I was second-guessing the idea of trying a new salon since I had already found one I absolutly loved. .Again though, the coupon lured me in. Anyway, I walked away with the worst experience ever. Not only was my color wrong ( I am a golden blonde and she colored my 1' outgrowth to a 3"" ash) when I went back in to explain what was so wrong with it (5min later), the front desk lady was rude and cut me off as I was speaking to her. Not the best way to handle a pissed of lady expecially about her hair! I gave them a chance to fix it and the only thing they did was put a gold glaze on my hair, which did not help at all. The style sucked too. I just left. I did not have time to see if they could fix it again. I will not be going back to this place for any services. Noy only because the hair experience was bad, but because the front desk gal made a bad impession of the place even worse with her nastiness. UGH! I will give this place 1 star only because on the coupon was also a savings of 30% off products."
0,"Can i just say, i hate everything about this store. If youre too lazy to go to goodwill and dig it out yourself for a third of the price, then i guess this is the place for you. If you are trying to sell anything, good luck. Their askew sense of fashion will make most of your goods obsolete unless its tacky 80's regurgitation. The chick actually told me that the band t-shirts i was trying to pawn were too outdated while i had a bay city rollers and rockos modern life shirt in my hand off their rack. They are incredibly overpriced, the staff has an elitist air for some reason (which you think would be hard to pull off in a tutu, leggings, and cowboy boots). Saving grace, they have some killer old punk and skateboarding t-shirts on the cheap for guys and gals. But the only time i even go here is when the boyfriend decides to go thru eastside records vinyl catalog in its entirity. its like a plato's closet for lady gaga."
1,"We have been eating here for years. I am as picky of a new yorker as they get (with food). I will say we do not eat there Monday or Tuesday's, The cook must be different, its not as good on those days. The rest of the week is 5 stars all the way.Great sesame chicken,fried rice, lo mien etc. Highly suggest."
1,Thai House is a great find! The restaurant is very clean and simple and the food was fresh and tasty (and affordable!). I had the Pad Thai and Spring Rolls. Both were gluten free. It's a great place for a week night date night with my husband. I can't wait to go back.
1,"Seriously. I seldom give 5 stars, but it deserves at least this much. If it wasn't for the location and the super scary after dinner club scene, I would go every.single.day. Truly one the best BBQ places in greater Phoenix. My mouth is watering as I'm thinking about the Hog Heaven special. In fact, my puppies mouths are watering too. Decent prices, giant selection. One of those places where the early cowboys of the SW would appreciate. If you are a cracker family, I suggest going super early, like super early bird special early , like when the snow birds come out for the senior special early, because after dusk, the whole place transforms into a pulsating super loud, super dicey Mexican Dance Club, and the blue hairs are sure to have a coronary attack after indulging in such a lipid laden meal as they attempt to make their way out of the Club. Ah the sacrifice for decent BBQ...."
1,"This is my go-to pizza joint. I've been here numerous times and the pizza is always delicious. My favorite is the Barro's Special (Pepperoni, ham, onions, green pepper and mushrooms). It's a nice thick and hearty style pizza with a great tasting crust. They have a play area with a little kitchen, legos and TV playing Nickelodean for the kids which is great. They also have ESPN on so I can chill and watch some sports while the kids play."
1,"Talk about options! It's almost unfair to have so many items on a menu. Especially when the food is so good. I have gone to the Cheesecake Factory several times and have not been able to even put a dent in the menu. So, I wasn't too hungry this time, so I decided to order from the small plates menu. We started with the corn fritters. Then I ordered the shrimp and grits and my husband ordered the hibachi steak. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because we didn't get our appetizer until the our food was ready. And by that time, we had already stuffed our faces with bread and butter (which is delicious)! The server apologized for delay in bringing our app and the manager came by and didn't charge us for the corn fritters. That was much appreciated! We only had one of the fritters since our other dishes were in front of us and we didn't want those to get cold. I really like the shrimp and grits. I think the dish came with a little too much sauce...but that's just me....I just really liked the taste of the cheddar grits. My husbands steak was really really good! The hibachi steak is what I normally ordered. I will go back again!"
0,"2nd time messing up our carry out order. Boneless wings have bones and no carrots or celery again!!

1,"The family and I love this place, as does anyone I've taken there. First time I went I had a cheeseburger pizza - huge and delicious. Their beer is great too - brewed right on the spot. My wife loved the fish tacos -- it says a lot about a place that every time you go, everything you try, is fantastic. You'll pay a little bit, but it's worth it."

I have traded my gold Starbucks card in for this amazingly Delicious start to my day. The iced coffee ( actually, its Toddy, which is better) is amazing. They roast their own beans, and allow the iced coffee to sit over night, creating an extremely potent concoction. The hot drinks, A+++ as well. And, the food? A+++++ (5, yup its that legit). Grab the cheddar bacon muffin... its literally heaven. No joke. Heaven. Little clouds may form above your head; white clouds of course! Not those nasty rain clouds. OK, maybe not clouds. But defiantly your day will be sunny because you stopped into Coffee Cartel. And not because you live in AZ. Duh. Only complaint I have is the hours. I live right next door, and their only open M-F (like so many places in DT-Pho). PLLLEEEEAAAASSSEEEEEE open up for the weekends!!! I'll work for free! Well...wait... I'll come visit."
1,"I cannot say enough about how much I LOVE We Care Family Wellness Center! I refer everyone I know to them. Dr. Ross, Cheryl, and everyone on staff are truly wonderful. They genuinely care about you as a person and always make you feel like you are the only patient on the planet whenever they are with you. They are never rushed and will take all the time in the world to listen to you and figure out what's going on with you. After having seen more doctors than I care to remember, I feel so blessed that I have found such amazing healthcare providers!"
1,I am obsessed with this place! I cannot say enough amazing things...I love their exhibits...I love Arcadia Farms inside...I love the architecture and design of the building...I love the staff (they are so helpful)...the gift shop is fabulous (I got the cutest watch bangle)...I love the giant red t-rex out front...I love the kids area (or at least my son does)...I love the diversity of the art! I would recommend getting a membership because it allows you to be able go all year long with your loved ones and family! You can have weddings here and they are beautiful! They have events here all the time if you sign up for emails or become a member...at least just go once and you will fall in love!
0,"Not good. The patio is top notch for relaxing if the weather's good but I couldn't shake that chain feeling when inside. Table and chairs had a slightly sticky feeling to them (nice, eh?). Food was typical pre-cooked, oven heated dollop of too much grease and cheese. Not impressed. It's a shame cause the garden and even the nachos & salsa had me expecting big things."
1,"I'm on a community social action committee and have spent the last year planning a community-wide service day. We were each responsible to lead a team of volunteers in a different community service project and per my passion I chose the Humane Society. We arrived on Sunday afternoon with a group of 12 people at the Campus for Compassion on Dobbins Rd. Kathy - the head of volunteer services - met with us and gave us a thorough introduction. She included the history of the AZ humane society and the process and procedures by which they take-in and shelter animals. She really focused on promoting spaying and neutering pets and cited some very impressive statistics. Did you know that over 7 years un-neutered cats can breed to reach 420,000 in numbers??!!!! and dogs 67,000??!!! thats CRAZY and so compelling. Kathy proceeded by giving us a very educational tour of the facilities... we saw dogs, horses, cats and bunnies. It was very eye-opening. First off it shattered any stigma you have about a shelter. The animal accommodations are so impressive!! The dogs have BIG size kennels with indoor and outdoor spaces that are really spacious. I was nervous to go in and see the dogs in kennels but I really wasn't as heartbroken as I thought I'd be bc they really had nice size spaces. There are sprawling lawns in the back where animals can run and play which even include a public dog park! There are also private puppy rooms. The cats have big crates as well and even private bedrooms where they can hang out in groups and the facilities were squeaky clean w/o any odors. The volunteers were so nice, kind and devoted to the animals. We got to feed horses, play with cats and bunnies and put together leashes for dogs. The most encouraging thing though was that the place was busy on a sunday! buzzing with people wanting to adopt pets and several cats were actually adopted during the 2 hours we were there. It was a wonderful and meaningful experience and I encourage anyone who is looking for a pet to adopt from the Humane Society and to look into volunteering with them"
1,"The food at Beaver Choice Scandinavian Bistro is delicious; a little unusual, but easily understood. Hearty and reasonably priced. You can find out all about it at azcentral.com in an article by Howard Seftel. Then, after reading this survival guide, you should go and try it. Things you will need: 1. An afternoon or evening with no commitments other than your meal. This could take a long, long time. 2. A pen and a piece of paper on which to write your order (along with an alternate choice). 3. Dining companions who all enjoy the same foods and are willing to eat off the same plate. 4. A snack to tide you over until your food arrives. 5. A sense of humor (but try not to laugh out loud), Here's our experience: Four of us entered the small, 20 seat restaurant at 12:10. There were six other people seated at the minimalist glass top tables. A large, and very appetizing looking catering order was taking up another table. We were given menus and told to order at the counter. There were many, many choices of entrees (a few warned that they would take between 20 and 35 minutes to prepare - we avoided those), and each one came with a choice of four side dishes. You can see why a paper and pen might come in handy. Ken went to place our order, but he had to wait for three other people who had arrived before him. It took a while. Then he was told that my entree choice was not available because they had run out of gravlax. I came up with another selection, and Ken went back to the counter - where another group of people had taken his place and were ordering. Another wait, then my second choice wasn't available either. The sauce had to be reduced and wouldn't be ready until Tuesday. I figured I'd be safe with a third choice of Swedish meatballs, so I yelled over to Ken who saw that each of our orders was being written on a separate piece of paper. Odd. We settled in to wait for our food. Our drinks were brought to the table. Sena's eyes popped when she sipped the pitch black coffee. The waitress said it was always that strong and that there was no milk or half and half available, but she could bring out some heavy cream. I noticed that food was coming out of the kitchen painfully slowly. One dish to one table, a while later, one dish to a different table. Companions were left twiddling their thumbs. It so reminded me of Hell's Kitchen - I could hear Gordon Ramsey going ballistic: ""Shut it down you &*#$%!!!!"" . At about 1 PM my Swedish Meatballs were delivered. I put the plate in the middle of the table and invited everybody to dig in. Luckily the servings are large. We finished that off and waited another ten minutes before Sena's chicken schnitzel arrived. That too was shared. At about 1:35 Ken's entree was brought. That left Leon, who had ordered Tilapia. We flagged down the owner and told her that we had a 2 PM engagement and would like our remaining dish. She said she'd look into it, went into the kitchen and was not seen again. A while later another staff member came over and told us that there had been a large catering order, that they had only a six burner stove and that 2 employees had called in sick. I mentioned that I didn't think it was right to serve some people at a table and not others. ""This is the way we do it, we're not going to change it, and Howard Seftel thought it was all right"", was the emphatic reply. More waiting. At 1:50 a different staff member came over and said it would be a few more minutes. To our disconcerted rumblings he said - and you're not going to believe this - ""The fish has to be defrosted slowly because of the parasites...."" At this point, I'll confess, I started to laugh loudly and somewhat hysterically. It may have been rude, but I couldn't help myself. We were out of time, so Leon decided he'd take the fish to go. Ken went up to the counter and gave one of my Valley Vittles cards to the ""parasite"" staff member, saying that the food was great but the service terrible. At which point the staff member had a melt-down, yelled at Ken to get out of his restaurant, then went slamming through the kitchen kicking something on the way out. This was truly one of the oddest dining experiences I've ever had. Very Alice in Wonderland. But if you go equipped with the five items mentioned above, you'll have some excellent food."
1,"I love that there is a locals place right within walking distance of my apartment. I've been drinking there for a couple weeks now and I love the good beer and cheap prices. I just ate there for the first time last night and the chicken sandwich and curly fries are delicious. The service is reasonable, the atmosphere is friendly, and the patio makes for a great hang out."
0,"The new Fry's in the burbs are awesome, but this old relic is pretty bad. Ugly with a with a smaller selection, plus staff who pass you in the aisles (when you're obviously looking for something) without asking if they can help. If you're in this neighborhood, head over to the nearby Safeway."
1,"I enjoyed a pleasant lunch here with my carefree grandparents-in-law who recommended Tonto as a delicious place. When we first entered the I thought it might be full of retirees and rich Arizonians but I was pleasantly surprised to find a crowd of all sorts enjoying lunch on the outdoor patio overlooking a pretty view of the golf course and elegant Saguaros. Elegantly Casual American describes Tonto. Indeed it's pricey, but the food is fresh, creatively presented and delicious. (Extra pluses for using locally-sourced ingredients) I enjoyed the Mexican white shrimp tacos. The petite shrimp comes drenched in a sassy ancho chili green pepper sauce, complemented by a cool and zesty cabbage-carrot-cilanto slaw, avocado cream sauce and chewy homemade white corn tortillas. The fun is getting to assemble your own tacos. I ate nearly every bite and was stuffed for most of the day. My companions enjoyed the Reuben sandwich (layered corned beef on crispy rye, served with skinny fries that don't need ketchup) and the Halibut served on potato cake with spinach and carrot salad. Grandma-in-law said the halibut was tender and flavorful. I can imagine a bunch of friends or foodies mingling and laughing, sipping wine in relaxed delight as you drink in the beautiful view. Worth a visit, whether you're a local foodie or traveler."
1,"Sadly, my mom fell down a wet grassy hill walking her dog on Monday night and broke her ankle in two places. Ouch! She was rushed to Scottsdale Healthcare North in an ambulance and texted me on the way to alert me of her injury. Let's just say I hopped in the car without blinking and drove up to Scottsdale from Tucson as quickly and safely as possible. When I first arrived at the hospital she was in a very small room, directly off of the ER waiting room. Seriously, I thought this was a closet, no joke! Jay, the RN, came in several times to check her blood pressure, take her to get x-rays, etc. You know....the typical hospital drill when you break your ankle! Anyhoo, he was so kind, gentle and had my mom in stitches (no pun intended - HA!) with his witty jokes. I could tell my mom thoroughly enjoyed his company and care. He was so wonderful and really helped take the pressure off of what was going to happen next....surgery! Shout out to Jay...You are awesome and thank you so much for going above and beyond to take such great care of my mom! After five LONG hours of being in the ER, my mom was moved to her own room on the Orthopedic floor...FINALLY! (Side note, all rooms at Scottsdale Healthcare North are single room occupancy. This is such a fabulous accommodation!!! That means no fighting over the remote or loud snores coming from the other patient.....YAY for mom!) At this point I knew this was going to be a long night and an extensive journey. We arrived at her room (on the 5h Floor) and were pleasantly surprised by the immediate welcoming of the evening nurses. They quickly got her settled into her room and made sure she was comfy. The room was small but super clean so no complaints there. A little while later we were told that my mom was going to have surgery sometime in the early morning but didn't have a confirmed time. Let's just say we both too tired to care because by now it was going on 2AM! I left the hospital and headed to my mom's house for a few hours of sleep before I returned in the morning for her pending surgery. Got there around 8ish and still no surgery time. Ok, at this point my only complaint was the waiting and the unidentified time of her surgery. This seriously went on all day until finally at 6pm she was wheeled down to pre-op. Again, more waiting as the anesthesiologist had a crisis situation with another patient. At this time I was fortunate enough to meet Dr. Nelson who was performing the surgery on her ankle. My impression of Dr. Nelson was that he was very warm, compassionate and informative. He asked for my phone number and said he would call me directly after mom's surgery with an update.....and he did! An hour or so later my mom arrived back at her room from recovery. All went well and it was time for sleep. I returned the following day (Wednesday) and waited her release. Ugh, more waiting. My mom was finally released Wednesday evening around 8pm with no problems or issues. YAY, we are going home. Overall, the experience at Scottsdale Healthcare North was pleasant and satisfying and I'm so thankful for their excellent and professional care with my mom! The doctors, nurses, physical therapists and aids were amazing, caring and extremely helpful. You can really tell these people are passionate about their job. Fabulous job Scottsdale Healthcare North!!! Oh, one more thing..... Note to mom - no more slipping down wet grassy hills!"
1,Such good sandwiches! The meat is cut fresh just as your Sammy is made. Desserts to die for. Plus the family that runs this joint is cute! Yummm!
1,"NOTE TO SELF/OTHERS: Check zoo hours before going. Apparently they close at 4. On a Saturday. When it's beautiful weather. Maybe that's an obvious close time to everyone else but we sure were disappointed. I guess there is a whole slew of stuff we missed seeing, and some other exhibits we passed were closed for a wedding. I guess it's cool to get married in the orangutan exhibit. Or else the orangutans were getting married. (Maybe those anti-gay marriage folks were right in that it would lead to animal marriages??!) Anyways, we all know it's not the greatest of zoos because it's freaking hot half the year and it's not super nice to subject a lot of animals to 115 degrees. But it's a decent enough selection, they have friendly staff, it's clean, and they have free parking. GD I love me some free parking. Lots of the ""learn more by pressing this button"" things didn't work. At least one water fountain didn't work (but hey- it was conveniently next to an overpriced soda machine!). Like most other zoos they make you exit through the gift shop, so your wee ones can spend the car ride home crying about how they didn't get x overpriced toy/stuffed animal. I do think if your kids are young enough, you could probably just take them past the ticket counter and check out the animals you can see below the bridge/in the water. Those ducks, fish and turtles are FREE to see, and what 1 or 2-year old needs the whole menagerie anyways?"
1,"Cesar Chavez park is the best that the SW Valley has to offer! Located at 35th Ave & Baseline at the base of South Mountain, it's a great location for the residents of South Phoenix and Laveen. I've seen it very busy, but it also seems to be one of the best kept secrets in SW Phoenix! There is ample seating throughout the park, including ramadas and benches. A 1.1 mile trail wraps around the lakes in the center of the park, making it perfect for runners and walkers. There is a small tot lot and playground on the east side of the park that families will enjoy. No matter what time of day you visit the park, you will find people around the lakes fishing. Be careful- a friend once tripped on a fishing line that a careless fisherman didn't remove from the sidewalk and broke his elbow! Drawbacks: this park is always dirty, as no one seems to clean up their trash after visiting and it is not safe in early morning or evening hours. Otherwise, enjoy one of the better city parks!"
0,"I heard nothing but praise about the food and atmosphere of this chain restaurant. I loved the look of this place inside and out. Great rustic barrels and old barber chairs in the bar area gave a unique look. Service was friendly and fast. Food was less than desirable. Salad was nothing but iceberg lettuce (and I got a stump) with some shredded red cabbage. My pasta dish was spaghetti with a white clam sauce. It was too salty and there was a sprinkling of microscopic clam bits. I always take leftovers home, this time I didn't. While the prices are good it's not worth a less than average meal. Husband was equally disappointed with his chicken marsala. Chances of going back are slim to none."
1,"Got there at 11am on a Sunday, it was packed to the gills. WOW! I should have listened to Michele M. We ordered shrimp dumplings, roasted pork, bbq steamed buns, turnip cakes, shrimp egg rolls, chicken feet, spare ribs, steam sticky rice with meats, fried tofu, egg tarts, etc... Everything was good. This is the best dim sum you can get in Phoenix."
0,"Lets just say i was not to please with my experience at Nails R Us. After two days my nails were lifting on about 4 nails by the end of the weekend i had 6 nails lifting, so i went back and showed them and she was like its normal. No it normal to lift but not after 2 days! They did fix them for me free of charge but were very rude to me!!! Will not be going back there or will not refer any of my friends there!"
1,"I use to LOVE Kazimierz so I am trying to be fair in giving it 3 stars. Most of my experiences have been 4 stars but the last two visits here have been a 1 or 2 star so... Kazimierz is a hidden, fantastic wine bar in Scottsdale, which use to be very intimate and was a great spot to cozy up to a date. Lately though they have been packing people in to this awesome bar which has so much potential. It's elbow to elbow now, with pretty bad service but still a great wine selection. I'll still come here whenever I'm visiting the area because I have a soft spot for it, and I am hoping it returns back to the awesome, secret cozy wine get away it use to be, and I know in the area, there isn't really any other spot, no matter how bad the service, that compares to it."
1,"Great new multi-purpose entertainment facility that just opened. They just started serving food last night and I had a fabulous ""Punk Panini"" sandwich ... value for the price....and a rock band going last night..... Can't wait for the theater to open and the bar to begin serving in the next couple of weeks....."
1,"Some family were in town and are Blackhawks fanatics desperate to watch the game. This was the only place in the east valley that we could find had the NHL Center Ice package (though the girl who answered the phone had to ask somebody else (""What's NHL?"")). Not only were they kind enough to put the game on, they put it on a flat screen in the corner of the patio and we were able to have the sound on. He shoots, he scores! The shepherds pie was good, the beer was cold, and the waitress was very attentive. I'll stick with CK's or the Baseline Pub for the NFL games though. While RT's had plenty of TV's, most of them were small old tube TV's. My uncle asked why they weren't showing the score of a basketball game, and I told him it's just being cut off by the old TV's screen"
0,"The ambience is a feast for the eyes and for the touch, this much is true, but one is paying a very high price for this exclusivity. While I liked waiting in the lobby- couldn't sit at the sushi counter until it was open for dinner service at 5:30p- I did notice that for a venue that strives to project a life of luxury, housekeeping hadn't come by to clean food debris off of the coffee table (closest to the sushi restaurant's host desk). Not even when a rep came by to alert me to a bar menu sitting on the table and asked me if I had wanted anything from the bar- she had to have noticed the mess?! I ordered a $9.50 spider roll (soft-shelled crab), a $10 veggie tempura app, and a $19 baked lobster roll, all priced at 50% for one week during their 1-year anniversary. They're all good, and factoring in the ostentatious surroundings, I'd pay $9.50 for the soft-shelled crab roll, but I'd put my foot down on the other two. 50% maybe, but $19 for a five-piece lobster roll? Yes, it was very tasty, and yes, the cream sauce was orgasmic, but for $19, I expect moments from the restaurant scenes of ""The Ugly Truth"" or ""When Harry Met Sally,"" take your pick. If you've money to burn or have someone else paying for the bill, then this is your sushi stop near Old Town Scottsdale."
1,"always consistent quality and value. we have been regulars of pappadeaux in our previous home of TX, and we still are big fans!"
1,Good steakhouse. My steak was great and the sauces and salts you add on made it mire interesting than a usual steakhouse. Almost all members of the party were satisfied and happy.
1,"I have been here a couple times now, so I thought I should review it. The ticket prices are a bit higher than other theaters, but the drinks are cheaper....a wash I guess. I saw the Mechanic there this week and had an overall pleasant experience. Usually I hate going to the movies because of all the sick people coughing on my head but this time the theater was relatively empty and I had a blast. The sound system in the theater we were in was great. Clear and crisp. The movie quality was also good. The concession stand was quick, in and out with my food and drinks. Yep, definitely one of the better theaters in the valley."
1,ouchh...my fuckin head is pounding this morning. thanks a lot guys!
0,"BBQ has to be one of my favorite foods and when a co worker suggested this place I was all for it. Living on the west side it was quite the drive but being that I am a BBQ fanatic I had to see what this was all about. First off Lucille's has a good location. Its located by Dave and Buster in the Tempe Marketplace. The look of the place is gimmicky but in a Famous Dave's kinda way. They have old school signs, mason jars to drink out of, and all the little fake things to make you seem like you have gone to Memphis or where ever they are trying to transport you. The service was absolutely awful. It took way to long to get drinks and even longer to get refills. Attitude the whole time. Here is a tip if you want a good tip bust your butt. Then you will have more money to pay for your tuition (half the staff is college kids). And do not roll your eyes when I don't want to try your suggestions. They tell you they smoke all their meats in house im not impressed. Now onto the most important part the BBQ. We had the brisket,half chicken and rib tips with a side of greens and sweet potato fries. The chicken was good. It had a smoke on it and was tender not real complaints. The portion size was good. Brisket was dry and you couldn't cut it with a fork. That tough. Maybe over smoked? Portion size tiny. 4 strips maybe 3 or 4 inches long. Rib Tips were dry and covered in sauce. Hardly any meat on them. Most places in the valley load you up on Rib Tips when you order they are a cheap meat. But not this place. You get a scoop full. Boo. Collard greens were disgusting. Cooked in some weird pork parts and they were bitter. Greens are not supposed to be bitter if cooked right! Sweet Potato Fries. You can't really mess these up they probably came frozen. So I would recommend these over regular fries. The starter of a biscuit with sugar on top was just weird. WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD. And the biscuit wasn't even warm enough to melt the sugar I mean apple butter. One last thing the house and spicy BBQ sauce's main ingredients are CORN SYRUP thats how they thicken it! seriously that should tell you something. Overall two thumbs down. Stay away there are plenty of other great BBQ spots in the valley."
1,"Fresh. Tasty. Interesting. Good ""People Watching."" Love everything I have tried here. The Happy Hour ""tapas"" are excellent. My daughter could not get enough of the garlic chicken one. The 3-bean plate is delish - kinda like ""meatless chili"" but you don't miss the meat. The fruit salad is massive and the fruit served with it is completely top-notch. Wait staff is mostly cute college girls, which is hardly ever a completely bad thing. Never had a problem with good, attentive service, which CAN be a problem sometimes. I go eat there as often as is reasonable. Highly Recommended."
1,"Cherry on Top is a rare example of design by market analysis committee, who couldn't decide on a unique concept so they decided to ""borrow"" from all of their competitors' styles, turning out at least as well as if not better than its individual inspirations. The result provides convenient answers to the following frozen yogurt questions: - Can't decide between tart and traditional? Why not both? - Can't decide between standard or high-end sweet? Mix vanilla, taro, green tea, cheesecake (but only at your own risk.) - Feeling constrained by four fit all sizes? $0.39/oz., cup weight subtracted. - Wavering on the topping healthiness spectrum? Fruit to sugar cereal to nuts to crushed big brand candy available. The quality is close enough to most of the relevant rivals (as long as one is not requiring the desert honey Sweet Republic tart variant) but, correctly and perhaps intentionally, the value proposition is that most patrons won't care about the slight dip, trading off for the flexibility of purchasing (only) as much yogurt and toppings as desired while satisfying Hershey's-acclimated children with a Frankenstein of saccharine flavors and junk toppings as well guests from the city pining for the nearest Pinkberry with original tart plus kiwi, strawberries, blackberries and pineapple."
1,"This is probably one of the more unique, trendy looking places in Phoenix-metro to lounge at. Everything about AZ88 is eye-candy, literally., from the furniture to the drinks to the decor and of course, the patrons. Drinks are made really, really tasty. My usual choice of cocktail is the French 75. My go-to appetizer is either the waffle fries that comes with three flavorful dipping sauces or the shrimp ceviche! The menu is pretty diverse with a little flair. What makes this place a hit for me are the contemporary, artsy decor making it a refreshing scene to come to compared to other Phoenix-ish ambiance. Of course, you can't have all these modern, sophisticated attributes without a DJ playing fresh beats and sounds! Bottom line is the look and the vibe makes me feel like I am back in New York or Los Angeles. I had given a 4-star prior, but I can honestly say AZ88 can hang with the big boys."
1,"I love this place! I have been coming here for ages. My favorites: Elsa's Chicken sandwich, any of their burgers, dragon chicken wings, china's little chicken sandwich, and the hot pepper chicken sandwich. The atmosphere is always fun and the art they display is very abstract but totally cool!"

1,"I brought DD and her friend here today after a long day of Summer Camp and running around. We showed up shortly before 3 p.m. for their Pop In Playtime, which is supposed to be from 10 am to 5 pm. There are two rooms of bouncy house contraptions that are appropriate for children older than age 3. I don't know if they have actual age or size restrictions, but kids younger (and/or small kids) would have a difficult time here. One reason it would be hard for younger kids? There are specific instructions for the contraptions which they go over with the kids before they are allowed inside. Some have a max of 2 kids at a time (the obstacle courses), some have a max of 6. One has a max of four, with three on the ladder and one going down the slide. Younger kids would likely need to be constantly reminded of the rules, as they can be a little rigid. Both my 4 year old and the 9 year old LOVED it here. They both said they preferred it to Jumpstreet. The girls were bummed out when at ten minutes to 4 someone came in and said playtime would be ending in ten minutes. Then the guy said if parents wanted to know why, we could approach him. Upon approaching him, he said that two birthday parties were booked for 4 p.m., so they were ending Pop In Playtime early. Some parents were VERY upset, having just gotten there less than 30 minutes prior. DD was very disappointed. It took a little prodding to get her to put her shoes back on and get ready to leave after only an hour of playing. On the way out, some parents stopped by and talked to the shift manager. She just handed out cards for another session since ours was cut short. Pretty cool; we will use the cards to bring another neighborhood kid back with us. There were JUST the right amount of kids here at this time of the day. I cannot imagine how nuts it must be here on a weekend or during Summer mornings. Still, bring a book and some bottled water and sit on the sidelines... or do as I did and run the obstacle course several times on the insistence of the kids. ;) It was fun!"
1,"Been to the Rose and Crown a couple of times now and have sampled some food. They have an extensive beer selection, including Sessions. It's an American lager. Very tasty! They also have Carlsberg, which I am told is the Bud Light of Europe. I still love it! The french fries are the TITS! They are so good I was unashamedly eating them off of someone else's plate without asking. I have had the Reuben and was uninspired. The corned beef was good, but overall just lacking. I guess that is what I get for getting a Jew sandwich at an Irish pub. The decor is cool! There are futbol kits and scarves along the walls. Ya know soccer? Wonder if they show games there on the weekends? Do they have TVs? Oh well. The place is a little small, but quaint. They do have a nice patio that has ample space. Cool place to hang out on a spring night. I think they had live music too."
1,Very authentic and very good Vietnamese food. Great value for the money and clearly a favorite with the local Vietnamese. The spring rolls were very tasty and came with a terrific peanut sauce. They also provide many other typical condiments on the table to spice up your dish. I had the slice beef Pho and it was delicious! I'll be back.
1,"It usually takes a good word of mouth review from a friend for me to try a new Chinese restaurant. However, I was craving this cuisine and this restaurant is close by and tucked away in a small quiet strip mall. Wasn't busy at all on a Friday evening. We were greeted right away as we entered into the clean, open, no frills dining room. We ordered beef and broccoli, chicken fried rice and lo mien. As we waited our super friendly server offered bowls of egg drop soup on the house. The soup was a nice touch but nothing superb. I was satisfied with our meal but it was not the best I've tasted. Fried rice was a little bland. Beef and broccoli was delicious. Overall I'd say the service was way better than the food."
1,"This is my favorite place to get thai and I have not found a place to rival it. Now it's not perfect. I got on a regular basis (they know me when I walk in now... I go that much). The service is either great or slow, and the heat ratings varies enough that you can be surprised. The decor isn't fancy and it's hard to find from the street. Now that being said, the food is always great and across multiple dishes on the menu. I'm always satisfied with my lunch. It gets busy every week day during lunch because of the Intel crowd so show up before noon. For dinner and the weekends, it's never that busy, so a great time to go if you have time."
1,"I cannot recommend Phoenix Knife House enough. There are very few places where you can go and physically put your hands on so many different Japanese knives, which is obviously key in any knife purchase. If you've ever spent hours in the kitchen doing prep and chopping, blisters are a very real possibility if the knife doesn't fit. I've discovered over the last several years of cooking at home that I prefer a lighter and bolster-less knife for high speed chopping, which ultimately led me back to PKH for a purchase. Last year I purchased a Fujiwara 150mm petty for less than $60, and it's been a great knife; my girlfriend also likes it because it's light and maneuverable. She bought me a Misono UX10 for my birthday, which will ultimately replace my Henckels for most uses. Bottom line, go in, tap into Eytan's knowledge of the knives (and care and maintenance), and get better tools for the job. It's well worth it. I bring all my kitchen knives here to get sharpened, either by hand or on the grinding wheel. Today I had four knives sharpened, three on the wheel, one by hand, and two with tip damage. Total cost = $13. Bonus: purchases are tax free. Highly recommended."
1,"Sandbar gives us North Scottsdalers another chance at a casual bar on our side of town! Located near Scottsdale Road and Shea, Sandbar has a pretty convenient location and is usually a fun spot to go out dancing and drinking. The DJ is either hit or miss; sometimes he plays awesome music and everyone's on the dance floor and other times the dance floor is completely empty because the music ain't so great. I've always wondered if anyone has become so intoxicated while at Sandbar that they have fallen into the little pond outside. Unfortunately, I have never seen this happen. But I have woken up in the morning with a Sandbar server schedule in my pocket with no recollection as to why. My friend was dancing so crazy one night on one of the platforms, that when she jumped off, she sprained her ankle. See? Sandbar's a really good time. Oh and if you get hungry, there's a little hot dog cart out front, so you can eat a wiener, drink and be merry."
1,"Alright this is the deal of deals, 2.75 for students and Im not sure if its a quarter more or not, but less 4 dollars. half an ice cream cookie sandwiches, trust me its enough. Its a great pick me up for something sweet on mill Cookies are made their along with the good ice cream, and if your not into that they have italian ice. Place is small, but is packed with flavor, and smells like fresh cookies. Recommendation: If you love cookies made into sandwiches"
1,"We had a large group and they honored our reservation with having the tables ready at our specified time as opposed to getting them ready when we arrived. We had a somewhat set menu. The tofu dumplings were delicious. Satay chicken was alright. We had a choice between 3 entrees. I want to give them higher ratings for their service, but the spiciness between the dishes were very inconsistent. You get to choose on a 1-5 scale and finding a dish that suited your desired spiciness was a hit or miss. Some people's 1-2 were super spicy and other's 4-5 weren't that spicy. (note: 5 is spiciest) Also, we had a huge mess with the bill where they put all the appetizers onto one bill for a table, and none on ours. It was quite a mess trying to figure that out. Also, their timing for food was so bizarre. By the time 1 table had basically finished their dinner then the rest of the meals arrived. Then again, dealing with 40+ people is a lot."
0,"Meh. Maybe it was just that we decided to dine in 10 minutes prior to closing, but I was definitely not impressed. I had not been here in ages. Probably 10 years, maybe 15. No exaggeration. I remember nothing but good things about Miracle Mile. I remember being excited to come eat here. So one night while shopping at Arrowhead with a friend, I got a sudden craving for a pastrami sandwich with coleslaw and Thousand Island dressing. I was very excited to walk in and find that it was on the menu! I didn't have to special order it! It was a good size sandwich. Big enough that when cut in half, you still have to use both hands. I took my first bite and was immediately disappointed. Not that it was bad. It's just that I had fond memories of this place and I was really expecting something near the level of perfection of the #19 at Langer's in Downtown L.A.....or at the least Like Gandolfo's in Tempe. Nope. It was nowhere near as good as either restaurant. It was just okay. The bread had a slight toughness like it was day old bread. The meat was chewy and lacking flavor. The coleslaw was really good and had the perfect crunch. The flavor of the coleslaw was not strong, but still masked the flavor of the pastrami. I will stick with Jason's or Heidi's next time I have a hankerin' for another deli style sandwich."
1,"Everyone point and laugh at the nerd reviewing a convenience store. Oh yeah? Stuff it. Like donuts? Check this out. Get in your car and drive here around 3AM and try their donuts. Had every single donut place in the area, and nothing can hold a candle to the QT donuts. My guy begrudgingly takes me here every couple of weeks for the donut stake out. It's so worth it. They get hard during the day, so seriously - 3AM or bust."
1,"I am only reviewing this location as the other locations are hit and miss. The one on Tatum and Dynamite was bad both times we went there. So, I go out of my way for this Barro's Pizza. The decor is similar to all locations. Very drab and not very comfortable. But, we are talking about a pizza joint, so they will get a pass on the decor. I had a mini Hawaiian pizza on my last trip and was delicious! The crust was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sauce was tasty and the perfect amount. I ate every bit of it with no crust leftovers. That was how outstanding it was. I am surprised that the consistency between locations is such a wild swing from outstanding to mediocre at best. The owner should look into that."
1,Great food. Service consistently blows. Sit at the bar and you will be fine.

1,"I love this Gelato! My favorite combination is the panna cotta with the mint chocolate chip. Weird but wonderful. I am rarely down this way, especially since I've moved, but I still fantasize about digging in to this deliciousness! I only ever had great service, and fantastic product here. So far it is the best Gelato I've had, although I hear Arlecchino's is pretty fantastic as well. I miss visiting Angel Sweet, I will have to go back soon."
0,"Decentfood, but horrible service. Both servers walked by me three times while I was sitting inside without acknowledging me at all. I was by myself and felt as though everyone else that came walking in were immediately welcomed. I wish I would have received the same attention. I was ready to walk out when i was finally approached. Nobody came back to check on me to make sure everything was ok after they delivered my food. Being from Vegas I am not accustomed to such non attentive service staff. I guess that flys here in Scottsdale, but I expected more from the type of clientele that they have. On a positive note, they do have a cozy place that gives the feel of a French coffee shop/bistro. Hopefully this review will be helpfull in giving them insight into making sure that every guest is treated with the same attentiveness to service."
0,"I'm sorry. You're too busy to look up my club card information? Too busy too push the button to do the search, enter my phone number and click ok? I took the time once upon whenever to sign up for your card. And now, you can't take 5 seconds to look it up for me? Let me clue you in, the cashiers here have always looked it up. It always takes 5-10 seconds at most! Great customer service. Insert sarcasm here for the uneducated. Other Big Lots this hasn't been a problem. Just the one."
1,"Satisfied my sweet and savory liking in a single swath. Just had my first visit here and will be back soon. The crepes were tasty and light, the service was attentive and friendly. Too bad they aren't open later for a sociable evening with dessert and caffeine."
1,"I drove by last night and noticed the sign and decided I needed to check it out. So I stopped by for a late lunch and was the only one in the place which made for some nice time to chat with the owner and her mother, who was the one whipping up the great food in the kitchen. They've only been open since February and had relied on fliers and the painted signs on the windows to attract customers. While I was there, supremely enjoying the chicken curry roti, a few other people came in because they drove by and saw the sign. I couldn't decide between the jerk chicken or the curry for my roti, so I was given samples of both. I thought the jerk chicken was a little too hot for me, but the curry still was able to clear out my sinuses. Wow - slow burn! I was told they could tone down the heat upon request. I'm not sure I'd want to ruin the experience, though. The menu looked interesting - goat curry, oxtail - along with the jerk and the curry options. I opted for the guava nectar to drink (so yummy!). This is in my neighborhood so I'll definitely be back to try some more. The atmosphere was comfortable and I was encouraged to linger longer, but I needed to get on with my day. The food and the music piped in made me feel like I took a mini-vacation. Nice."
1,A very professional company that takes the time to deal with you on a personal level. With great reassurance from Nate and his team they were able to handle the short sale of our home with very little stress and in a timely manner. They really helped when we thought no one could. From beginning to end we were always kept informed and they got the job done.
1,"I wandered into this store while wandering down Mill on a Saturday afternoon and what a pleasant surprise it was. Their design fit perfectly with my tastes and I wish I had the extra cash to redesign my house with their products. The salespeople were friendly and helpful, but not pushy. Great experience!"
0,"Vegan Mexican with a urban funk to it. Should it work? I dont know. Did it work? Not really. We walked in, it was empty quiet and after 20 seconds a surprised guy walked in and greets us. We take out seat on the purple booths and browse the menu while we sip watermelon water. Things got a bit stranger from there. The menu had many interesting options, but each one we tried to order we found out that the didn't have chips, mushrooms or chorizo, key ingredients in many of the things on the menu. We had to just ask what can we order. We ordered and waited, as the sun set it became quite dark as no one had turned on the lights. Another customer walked in but the waiter was busy working as a cook. It became even darker as we waited. The other customer finally was given a menu and the lights were turned on, however it was still pretty dark. Our tacos came, they were a bit small we each had 2.5 tacos I assume the 1/2 a taco to make up for the lack of chips on the side. The tacos them selves were good, nice flavors crunch etc. for $8-$9 they should be good. However the other problem sunk in as we were leaving, we were still hungry and after $21 and 45 min we were less than happy. The next day they had posted a photo to Facebook, not about their food, or a special but look how how our waiter/cook is. So I guess if you want to look at toned male waiter this is your spot. Otherwise there are many kinks that need to be worked out."
1,"Grew up in San Antonio and Austin. Have traveled extensively and sampled BBQ all over the country. The term Texas-style means beef, first. Period. And good smoke, and that ain't mesquite. Oak is king. These guys have changed the face of Phoenician BBQ forever. It's a shame that the Scottsdale location was touched by ... well, Scottsdale. Friggin morons. If you have not been here, you need to go down to 24th and E. Roeser and try it. Hands down the best Q in the area, including Cave Creek. The guys are FROM Texas and they know the whats, wheres and hows of Bar-B-Que. And for those ""the meal in a carton on butcher paper"" snobs who think that such is declasse, please, do me a favor... Head on down to Austin or, better yet, Lockhart. Stand at the front of the line at Stubbs or Black's or Kruez Market and loudly proclaim your thoughts as a BBQ aficionado. Just let me know when you are heading down so I can hang out and watch the ensuing festivities. Freud said it best: BBQ and being horrifically anally-retentive is ALL about your unfulfilled dreams of your Auntie Ma. Or, shut up and grow up ya infantile gomers..."
1,"So I e-mailed East Maryland the same afternoon as my visit, explaining that I was disappointed that the coupon I had given them was not honored, and they e-mailed me back before the end of the day, apologizing and letting me know that my Visa would be credited the amount of the coupon. Then they called today to see how the boys were all doing after their shots, and acknowledged the bill issue again, and hoped that everything had been settled to my satisfaction. This kind of immediate and friendly follow-up redeemed them and gained them another star."
1,"I love this place they do the best job, I even drive 45 min because I moved and they are worth it! I'm always happy with the results. My nails don't lift or chip. I have also had a facial their and it was amazing. It was my first facial however I was happy and it wasn't expensive. I would recommend this place to anyone. Just bring cash for your tip, they do take cards but not for tips."
1,"Well, it dropped a star for me, and I'll tell you why. Eaten there probably 20 time in the last quarter. I've had it all; All you can eat sushi, bowls, desert, beer. Ate alone, ate with Sandra K, ate with son and family (including 3 year old grandson who plays drums with the chopsticks) had a party of 12 there. Service....slow on Saturday for the AYES, otherwise I can't complain. There are some ""bright"" spots. First, it's close to my neighborhood, a start and there is more than sushi and that is helpful when you have non-sushi lovers with you. The bowls are very good and you can order them in the heat index you like. Funny names to them as well, like the ""Exit Wound Bowl"" or ""The Classified Bowl with this description;Don't Order this Bowl"". Squid Salad is great, great, great! Calamari, ok. Hey they put a lot of thought into their beer selection and that is cool. And their dessert sushis are very unique. As for the sushi....I now have way too many sushi restaurants to try and they are all falling over themselves for your business. Sushi has become really ""hip"" lately but there will be a fall out in this category as the economy continues to slow and people, let's face it, are pulling back. This is not a place for a sushi purist, but give me good food, a cool gathering place (close to my central Phoenix abode) and I will be there. Sushi has got to get better for me to rate higher and ""earn"" my business."
0,"I went for family birthday on a Friday night. Only a few people in dining room eating. (1st clue to leave.) Ordered a margarita. It's extra to have it shaken... But I ordered that way. It was mostly sour mix. An it was awful (How do you mess up a margarita?(2nd clue to leave) Server is surprised we wanted to order dinner! (3rd clue to run!) Very disappointing. I got the chicken fajitas, they had sauce all over them. Shrimp appetizer consists of 3 shrimp $8. Salsa was good. I will never go back. Good luck Salty. I love your decor. Why don't you care you could be so cool!"
1,"It had been a few years since I last gave this place a try. It hadn't blown me away as I had remembered, but I was still up to giving it another shot. I must say that this place is much better than I had remembered. I stopped in for lunch and there were several people eating in there at the time. I ordered the Luncheon Special #3 (Cashew Chicken served with an egg roll, fried wonton, fried rice, and a fortune cookie) for myself and a #1 special (Qwik special chicken which also came with all the additional stuff mentioned above) for a friend to go. Each dish was only $6.25 a piece and were both ready in about 7 minutes. I guess the Qwik part wasn't just a clever name, they actually do cook stuff up pretty fast there. I brought the food back to the office and tried my lunch. Yes, I also made sure to give my friend his lunch as well. It was a dark meat chicken, white meat can be substituted, in your typical brown sauce with veggies and cashews. However it was done well. No one ingredient dominated the dish and there wasn't a ton of sauce. The egg roll was crispy and flaky and filled with veggie goodness as well. I like the fact that they will deliver as far south as Camelback, north to Cactus, east to 60th street, and west to 96th. They are open until 9:30 pm seven days a week which is nice as well. I went back to try some of the soups and the dumplings and I have to say that while the soup was good, the dumplings may just be in the top 3 that I have had in Arizona. They don't have that ""just unfrozen"" taste that many restaurants have. I think I would have given them that fifth star had they had both scallion pancakes and noodles w/ sesame sauce on their menu, but alas they do not. I look forward to going back and trying many of their other dishes."
1,Kick @$$ The Best of the bertos & they will make anything you want_!! Carne Asada with Sausage & Ham........Wow..
1,"I had the pleasure of going to the grand opening of Total wine and more! They had penny wine tasting, they card you at the door and you put your penny into the hurricane jug. The place is Disneyland for adults, they have every imaginable wine, liquor, or beer that you would be searching for. Since I recently went to Sonoma, California in August, I was looking for a few of my fave wines that I liked, but they did not have some of the smaller wineries and plus they are limited releases. I did find one from Ferrari-Carano, Fumé Blanc, for $10.97. Ferrari told me that you can find some of their wines in a grocery stores, but not the Fume Blanc, so they lied. I also purchased a Kokopelli Cab for $13.99 and Kokopelli is local to Arizona made in Wilcox. This place has excellent deals and glad to see this kind of store in San Tan Village Mall."
1,"6.30 on a Sunday and there was a line snaking through the small shop. We took turns sneaking peaks at the day's options and by the time we got up front we were ready to order. We got the salted caramel and chocolate marshmallow. The 1st was so good, the 2nd kinda boring. Can't wait to try more."
0,"We went here for Mother's Day based on the positive reviews and had a pleasant experience. Good food, good service, good ambiance. We came back here for Father's Day and had a very unpleasant experience; the worst display of management I have ever encountered! Apparently our order was never put in from the server or there was some sort of ""computer malfunction' they claimed, but we waited at the table for 45 minutes after ordering, no food, nothing. The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait, (did I mention the restaurant was half empty, I wonder why!) and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks. But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait, she came over to our table, did not properly introduce herself, sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes. Really?!? You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting??? It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!! It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager. I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake. She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation, but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that! Needless to say, unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members, or hires a new manager, we will NOT be coming back here again."
1,"The place is nothing special, you can even think there is nothing going on there as it is almost hidden. Once you are in, you still won't believe there is something worthy. Sit and try one of their gyros, hummus or the vegetarian combo! All tasty and well served. After that you can check and buy some interesting to impress your friends next time!"
1,"This ice has the abilty to make you feel COLD on a 100+ degree day - I am hooked on the Key Lime, Alex's Lemonade, and Florida Orange. Very nice staff, friendly and free samples ...."
1,"No frills. Nothing fancy. Just some honest burritos and tacos. Voted ""best taco"" by New Times a few years back (in the 90's). Not sure I agree, but they consistently satisfy. They make a hearty breakfast burrito too. If you're looking for Sonoran or Tex-Mex or anything beyond what you might find at Filiberto's, try somewhere else. The red burro combo is my personal favorite. It's saucy (enchilada style) and just spicy enough. Bottled beer available."
1,"My family comes here for cases of citrus every year. The navels and tangerines are delicious, and very reasonably priced. They also have lots of other interesting local products like a variety of honeys."
1,"Cool atmosphere and good service. The food is good but seems they are still working on their recipes. The complimentary bread was cold (a small but important detail) and the ""salsa verde"" was mediocre. I had the Orange and Fennel Prawns and there was too much orange and barely any fennel. My boyfriend had the Lobster Mac n' Cheese. Said the lobster didn't taste fresh and the sauce was too rich. Ernie, the manager came over and introduced himself. He explained the remodel from the previous concept. We'll definitely come back to support a local place at CityScape. I just hope to see some improvements in the food."
1,"Had to update because we've now tried the pizza! For all the times we have visited we've never tried a pizza (too many other really good options to choose I guess...) We ordered the Italian Classic (veggies & meat). We ordered it a little well done/crispy and were not disappointed! It was hot, fresh and cooked perfectly! Service was great as usual even though they were completely SLAMMED with customers the day before Thanksgiving filing numerous growlers of their pumpkin beer which sold out in less than record time! We were there again last weekend for the football games and made it in time to order our favorite breakfast items - eggs benedict and the braised pork dish with beans, potatoes, two eggs and fresh warm tortillas. It was fantastic! This dish, just like many others (possibly ALL others) is plenty for 2 to share. Service was exceptional and the crowd fun and rowdy rooting for their teams and AZ won - so there were a lot of happy customers that day!"
1,"It's a beautiful day. Clear sky and around 65 degrees in the late morning! What to do? My little guy had been riding his bike without training wheels. Woo-hoo! Is he ready to go on a dirt trail? We're gearing him up to go mountain biking up North. Hubby suggested Riparian Preserve. It was an excellent choice. ""This is awesome!"" my little one exclaimed, as he bounced up and down on the trail. Then, he'll just stop right in front of me without warning. Five year olds get distracted so easily. ""Is that a wasp? Look at that hover fly! What kind of ant is that? What kind of beetles live here!"" asks my little future entomologist. We'll be taking some tours and classes the Riparian offers soon! My little one did bite the dust several times due to some excessively gravelly paths. He learned to either walk his bike over or slow down a bit. Such a sport! ""Let's come back here again., That was fun!"" It was fun for us too! We're so lucky we live not far from here. It is a very well maintained park. As it gets hotter, we would walk and feed the ducks in the morning and spend the rest of the time in the Regional Library. I highly recommend you check this place out."
1,I seriously can't get enough of this spicy goodness! All I ever wanna go is SIAM and nowhere else. I've been to so many Thai restaurants in AZ the past month and NOTHING compares to Siam! BEEF MA SA MAN curry is so addictingly amazing and the pad thai is always cooked to perfection. I'm actually craving it as I type this.
1,"I'm giving this Urban a perfect rating, for it never fails that when I walk through its doors, I always find something I want (or could) buy - even if it's a gift for somebody else, like my younger sister or best bud in Detroit. I even found one of my favorite sweaters here on clearance for $20. I think this Urban has a better selection for women than the one in Tempe, so if I had my choice, I'd come here to browse and buy. Plus, it's within walking distance of Scottsdale Fashion Park, Borders and Olive & Ivy (the perfect spot for brunch/lunch)."
0,"So i thought with all the controversy surrounding this place, I would support the first amendment with my wallet. Unfortunately our experience here was subpar to say the least. We came in on a 3pm on Saturday and there was only one other couple inside. We were literally outnumbered by the people working there. I say this because somehow, despite this fact, the service was HORRENDOUS. I mean we got our order out fine, but our waitress dissappeared after that. At one point I had to almost get refills for us myself. The sushi itself was so overpriced for what it was. The Philadelphia roll was decent, but the California roll was really bad. When it came to paying, I put my credit card in the sleeve and waited for awhile. Despite there being no one else in the restaurant at this point except one other table, the waitress didn't return. If it wasn't for the cash I had on me I'd be waisting away there at this moment because she had no intention of returning and I have no intention of ingesting there food ever again!"
1,"So far, I have been to Lola twice (a Saturday night and Monday morning). Saturday night was very quiet compared to the super busy Monday morning. Free Wi-Fi, coffee, baked goods, and awesome location...you can't beat it. The morning we went, we had a Monterrey Jack scone that was really good. I laughed when I got my latte in a ""So I Married an Axe Murder""-esque cup. We sat along the high tables facing Central Ave and I really enjoyed surfing the internet and looking out towards Central. There are various types of seating as well as some outdoor tables. I really loved this place but worry that it will be one of those places that will be so popular, you'll never get to sit there. That is why I stopped going to Lux because it eventually got so crowded all of the time. My favorite part of Lola coffee is being right on Central and watching traffic and the light rail go past. Love it, love it."
1,"This is one of my favorite little gems in Phoenix. I've never had better pho than here. I usually order the ""spicy beef sate"" pho, which is miles above the rare beef pho. My family and I also order the pork ""spicy treats"" which is a roll-your-own spring roll. It's delicious and fun! One order feeds all five of us. The owner is also extremely nice. They also offer discounts to ASU students! Have to love that."
1,"As a mom of two, Jason's Deli is awesome. The ingredients are fresh and healthy, and the kid's meals are huge and priced right. For my young kids (4 and 2), one meal is enough for them to share. For bigger kids, it seems they could be eating off the kid's meal longer than at some places. Add speedy delivery of food and free self-serve ice cream at the end, and this is one happy mom!"
0,"Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta. It's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food. When they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure it's nice, but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. It's just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package. Far from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, it's all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something."
1,"Their happy hour is crazy cheap!!! The scene though is like a poor mans Rehab/Wet Republic, but I'm not mad! It gets really crackin there especially on the weekends (suffice to say, I was only there for a weekend hahaha). This is definitely a spot to checkout while in Scottsdale!"
1,"Celebrated my anniversary here. Everything was amazing. Enjoyed the filet mignon and the lobster with prawns. Luis was our server and made our experience truly amazing. He made everything perfect. He gave us our space, but at the same time entertained us when appropriate. He recommended a great wine to pair with the lobster, and made sure we were well taken care. We capped our meal off with creme brulee and a dessert wine. We will definitely come back here and ask for Luis again."
1,Fairly typical Walgreens. Sell beer and wine now. Photo and pharmacy. Redbox movies.
0,"2.5, just not enough to give it three. Food was just OK and they ran out of ahi tuna by 9pm! They have happy hour all night (pretty good specials too) but they close SO early (10pm last call on Sunday)!"
0,"I want to give the Cornish Pasty Company another star, but I can't quite do it... The pasties I order are REALLY good... They have a fine beer selection (including Mickey's Big-Mouths) and a few cocktail options... Most of the sides and desserts are pretty solid. I tend to stick with and very much enjoy the more traditional pasties like The Oggie, and the Cottage Pie (OK, OK... I love the Royale with Cheese, too). However, some of the ""premium"" pasties like the Pesto Chicken and the Salmon pasty are a bit funky to me. Even that, I can write off to personal preference. What really keeps the CPC from getting another star or two is the restaurant itself. It's a long, narrow space, 75% of which is divided by a bar. Seating is along the wall or at the bar, with a few larger tables in the back. On the other side of the bar from the customers is where ALL of the restaurant operations take place; cooking, cleaning, prep, and bar. If one is sitting at the bar, this intersection of consumption with infrastructure is often a bit too much like watching sausage being made. I don't really expect a fine dining experience at a place like the Cornish Pasty, but I really don't need to hear the dishes crashing into the sink and i don't need to see all the potential for cross-contamination (food preparation right next to the dirty dishes and raw meat right next to the beer glasses). My worst experience was arriving late and sitting at the bar while they were cleaning the ""kitchen"" area and still serving food. It was really noisy, the refrigerator light kept blinding me, and the smell of cleaning chemicals was so strong that it made it impossible for me to even think about enjoying the pasty. I walked out after about 4 bites... I've wanted to go back several times, because I do enjoy the food and beer options, and finally went back last Friday. The food was as good as it's ever been but the environment will still make me think 2 or 3 times before heading back. Maybe I'll just have to take advantage of their take-out and stop at Tops liquor on my way home for the Hoegaarden..."
1,"I absolutely love the food here! The sushi and Walnut Shrimp are cravings that I must give in to. This is a nice, small restaurant that is exceptionally clean and comfortable. Good for a casual date, lunch any day (their specials are a great deal), and the owner managers are on site most hours they are open. You have to try the Walnut Shrimp!"
1,"I have been to this place twice and I have had both extremes. The Good: Shannon, California Sea Bass, Michelle (Manager's) Customer Service The Bad: Fried Calamari, Our last waiter's breath The first visit to this establishment was our encounter with Shannon. Shannon was a pure delight as our waitress. She made our first visit absolutely fun. My wife had a tilapia dish that she was less than enamored with but I had the California Sea Bass and that tasted very good. In fact, it was so good that I regretted not getting a glass of Chardonnay to go with it. The fish had a very nice texture and taste. Our second visit was our first encounter with the fried calamari. As our guest so eloquently said, ""If this was my first impression of fried calamari, I would not have liked it."" The calamari was overcooked and there was so much oil running on the plate. We called this issue to Michelle's attention and she agreed 100% that the dish was not prepared properly. She gave us a coupon to come back there and eat at any time. However, our waiter's breath was another story. Whenever he spoke, I could smell his pungent (trust me, a lot better than what I really wanted to say) breath to the point I almost donned a gas mask. There are very few things that would cause me to lose my appetite. His malodorous breath and the calamari with more grease than a Jiffy Lube accomplished the feat."
1,"Unlike Cassandra, I love kids and brought 4 of my own to Joe's. We all loved it. Fresh tasty food, great outdoor seating and lost of room for the kids to play with all of those dogs etc. The ahi tuna was cooked right and the slaw on it was amazing. The french fries might be the best I have ever had. The Chocolate shake was good but a little too rich for my taste. My wife said that the Buffalo chicken sandwich she ate was the best chicken sandwich ever. Her ice tea was amazing. My eldest daughter had the grilled peanut butter and banana split which had chocolate chips, pineapple, strawberries and of course peanut butter that was very different but great! The only drawbacks were the sweet potato fires ( not bad but I have had much better) there was only one condiment and drink area and that was clear on the other side of the fairly large area of land and the lone garbage can was also quite far. The pluses obviously are the tasty fresh food and of course plenty of room for kids to play and bother Cassandra."
1,"I've been twice now. When it first opened and then went a long time before going back. I was impressed both times. They're busy but not too busy that you can't get a table. This las time was for lunch. We sat outside by the fireplace. That made for nice ambiance cause it was a bit nippy outside. The server was pleasant and attentive. The food was so, so good. We had 2 cheeses for an appetizer and split a large salad. It was plenty of food for 2 and only spen $20.00. The salad was not just ""a salad"". It was special :) Roasted sweetened pecans, chicken, PEARS!!! It was delish."
1,"So much better that 5 Dorks, I mean guys. They have salads and great chicken selections!"
1,"Amazing quesadillas !!!! I had the steak, mushroom, and cheese as recommended by our server and man was I impressed! They are not the standard kind that I am used to. Fried and covered in lettuce and green sauce. The al pastor burrito was so hot and tasty as well. This is now my new favorite cheap delicious mexican joint! I wish the salsas were better and didnt all light my mouth on fire but hey, the food is awesome anyway and didnt need the salsas."
1,"this place is awesome. GO. & soon - already decent wait times. OH, pitches of pbr for 7 bucks. yeah, yeah. shut up. GO GO GO."
1,"I love a place that lets me do whatever I want. I can go to this place and scarf down a whole bunch of pretty good tasting frozen yogurt for 160 some-odd calories. I can pig out on Thrifty Brand Ice Cream - oh joy! I can pretend I am in Hawaii and have shave-ice (snow cones to mainlanders). I can get a puppy cup of frozen yogurt for my dog. How COOL is THAT??? I can get quarts of stuff to bring home. AND - here's the big one....the people are actually really, really nice! Okay - I've read the other reviews - the frozen yogurt is good - nothing that will drive you to ecstacy - but good enough to hit that ""I need something cold and frozen"" spot. My dog loves the lo-cal treat. So, depending on the Length of my hike, it is yogurt, ice cream, sometimes both......you get double punches on Wednesday and the puppy cup is free if you bring your puppy."
1,"i like the ooey gooey cupcake! the chocolate cake is soooo moist and cooked evenly in perfection. only it's served chilled? it's weird. their cookies are good, too. I bought a tub of their easter sugar cookies and they are so stinking cute! they're very sweet though so it's impossible to eat more than 2 per day but soo good. anymore than that you'd need insulin. :)"
1,"Wow. If you're into owner-driven, husband-and-wife run, casual and unpretentious yet upper-class/comfortable ""fine"" environs, food, service, wine, and music (acoustic live music 3x/wk (with no cover!)), the kind of place where everyone talks to/welcomes everyone yet no one is nosy or cliquish, where the whole place cheerfully claps when Mrs Owner breaks a glass (and someone calls out ""it's earlier than that normally happens,""), free wi-fi, where you have a nice patio with heaters and a front-row Fountain view, wine by the bottle from their extensive retail collection or yours -- with just a $5 corkage (as well as a decent (7-9 reds and 7-9 whites selection by the glass for $7-$10), a great craft beer selection (Union Jack IPA!), couches, nice hightops, an l-shaped bar, great local artwork (also for sale), this will be your new favorite place. If you like stuffy, over-priced, boring, see-to-be-seen places with angry (or no) music, this place isn't for you. Second time here and Mr Owner greets me by name. Are you kidding?! Does that happen anymore? And when I say to him ""that's cool,"" someone else in the bar comments about how I must be new because that's just how they do it here. You can order anything off the menu from next door (Euro Pizza Cafe) for no up-charge. Amazing. Get the ""Dr Oz Sautéed Veggies."". Trust me. This place has a great vibe and one part of me hopes these positive reviews don't result in oppressive crowds, but on the other hand, something tells me they'd handle it with a smile and 5 star service. Get here. Just get here."
1,"Once again Wildflower proves why it's my favorite breakfast hangout! Jeff the Manager on staff today rocks! Some of us hangout at a restaurant to make it a working meal...and sometimes, during that time Nature calls...so I asked the busboy to not clear my table as I needed to step away for a moment and he cheerfully agreed. I came back to find my table cleared by new patrons who had taken it upon themselves to steal my table (I guess the fact that the food was only half eaten, and the water and coffee were still half filled were no clue). The busboy was upset that he'd turned his back for just a moment and Jeff came to the rescue...after apologizing to me and finding the perfect way to make it right, he vowed to let the new people know that they were rather um 'overly proactive' in clearing the table themselves and that he had some people who regularly relaxed and worked in the restaurant and do step away. He handled the situation with me just right and I am sure that those people that took my table were made to gently understand that they need to ask before taking an uncleared table. Kudos to Jeff and the staff for making me so happy I had to tell everyone here...and to the couple who took my table, if you are reading this...did you REALLY need that booth? I mean, when I came out of the can there were like, I dunno, 5 empty tables...seriously? Like, did you propose there or something????"
1,"OK, being from Wisconsin (the land of the ""great lakes"") I was COMPLETELY surprised to be told that, yes, there are lakes here in the desert of Arizona. The Lake, Saguaro Lake, is a man made lake originally built as Stewart Mountain Dam...even so, its beauty is equal to those you would see in the glacier regions of the Midwest. I was amazed, frankly, at how beautiful this tour was. Sold for $18 for 90 minutes, you get your money's worth. But that is probably not what you want to hear... The ""event"" is a combination of 1) the scenery, and also 2) the charm of the paddle boat itself. The boat is quite large with seating for probably close to 75 people! It's an event that you could share with family, but I happened to be there with friends. Currently, it's a pretty mellow type of event (great for Mother's Day!), although I am told that they are hoping to exploit its benefits to include comedy shows, Jazz ensembles, stargazing, and a variety of other events. P.S. They also advertise that you can rent the paddle boat for company picnics, weddings, and the like."
1,"This is my first review on Yelp so here you go... I love Yasu!! This is by far the best sushi and authentic japanese restaurant in Phoenix. I have been there numerous times and it never disappoints. You have to try their Sumibiyaki which are items cooked over Japanese charcoal, last time I was there I had the beef tongue..sounds weird but its so good Nigiri/sashimi are a must. They always have the best selection and daily special, most important...its always fresh...this is definately important!! The sweet shrimp is my personal favorite and anything else you order, you will find the fish is sliced with great execution. Request fresh chopped wasabi, you will never eat sushi with out it again! Love this place!!"
1,"I love this place! Been to a few different locations and the pizza is always excellent. Yesterday, my boyfriend stopped by the Camelback and 10th St. location and picked up pizzas to take home (he called in advance, as the pan pizza takes at least 30 min). I had a veggie, tomato, basil, garlic, and he had a meat combo-pepp and sausage. So delicious. The only complaint he had was the parking situation there. It is kind of tough, but well worth it. I absolutely recommend Oregano's!"
1,"Luckily, I didn't have to travel far to make my connecting flight. And for this, I thank you, Phoenix. My brief layover was pleasant as the employees were kind and the flight was on time. Hopefully, next time I can grace Phoenix with my presence for a little while longer."
1,"We get a date night rarely throughout the year, so I try and find something new when ever we get that chance. Once we made it into the restaurant we were both quite pleased with the decor and the atmosphere, little did we realize that this was just the beginning! The wait staff here is beyond friendly and knowledgeable, our server Sam was what you would consider first class in every aspect. His attention and knowledge started our evening off in such a way that I feel indebted to him!! Then comes the food....! We had a four course meal that not only included a wine pairing for two of the courses, but also a pre-dinner cocktail. The food was exquisite, the pork chop with the kale and pickled onion main course was grand, and the paired wine could not have been better."
1,"I work next door, and I love her ! She has done an excellent job of slim fitting my baggy shirts !! Well she did ask me if I was gay but then hey, given how animated I get about clothes I dont blame her for askin ! My SO found this rather amusing and laughed her head off... oh well getting back to my review. I love nadya cuz she does a wonderful job, each time. She knows when the darts will give the slimming effect and when the sides are to be taken in. Its never too tight and never too lose, and she always always delivers on time. I have been here atleast 10 times !! Trust me my metrosexuality wouldnt let me let me go back if it wasnt a five star service!!"
1,It's Pei Wei. The service and food are always satisfactory.
1,"A hand-job with gardening gloves..... I went looking for Scottsdale Auto Salon to get a hand wash tint quote on my new Mini today. Finding it out of business, I whipped out my handy-dandy Yelp iPhone app looking for a nearby alternate to at least get the wash done and found Classic Car Spa. Expecting to pay a bit more for a traditional hand wash I was surprised to find a machine assisted process. I'd spent way to long trying to locate the place (thank you Google maps) so I just opted for their supreme wash, which includes both interior and exterior detail. My son and I watched the car move through the process and saw that at least the 'wash part' was done by hand, but they used the same mitts from the filthy truck that had gone through previously. -1 star After seeing this, I should have watched their 'interior detail' more closely. When I got the car back there were lines of dirt in my white roof, and water spots on the accent chrome. When we got in the car there still bits of chip on the seat and floor mat from my sons spill the day, and it was obvious that the dash and interior hadn't been detailed. (Unless they refrain from using any product what so ever on the interior of the car. The dash and steering wheel were bone dry and dusty.) - 1 star I should have brought it up to someone, but my husbands' and sons' hunger won over and we just left. Thankfully all of their other locations are to far out of the way to bother detouring to again. The staff was friendly, and their waiting area was pleasant with lots of drink choices, although I'm not sure their waiting area was comfy enough for anything longer than a wash."
1,All around great food. True Texas brisket experience. Meat has great flavor and tasty sides add variety to the offerings. Don't forget about the sheet cake for dessert!! I'll be back. ***Read another review on here talking about wings. They don't have wings here!! Get your reviews right people.
0,"Ate here at lunch today for the first time. ""eh"" is all I can say. I came in around 12:45 and even though no one was behind me in line the twerp at the counter made me feel very rushed. I ordered a Turkey Tom. This was basically a big white dried out sandwich roll with a couple of slices of turkey, a butt-load of shredded lettuce, a couple of sliced tomatoes and some mayo (I requested no sprouts which are normally also included). What is supposed to be gourmet about that? The sprouts? I also grabbed a chocolate chunk cookie. Not even worth eating the whole cookie. Really. I see no reason to return and don't understand how they can call themselves gourmet..."
1,"I can't add much to what has already been said....BUT I'll try, haha! Um, don't come here without a map, or some sort of gps device (NOTE: some spots in the mountain do not get good reception, so a map on your phone may not always fully come in). It is VERY easy to get lost! There are many trails, I look forward to getting to know them better. So far, all I have really done is Mormon Trail and the Hidden Valley Loop.....Fat Man's pass is probably my most favorite spot...OH! AND there are some really cool rock formations on the way there (including a natural tunnel) look for the rock that looks like a big mushroom! This is a good area to do a hike in the dark....but don't do it until you've done the trail a couple times in daylight. You can see what seems like the whole valley from up there! If you do the night hike, make sure the moon is full.....you can actually see pretty well with that and the city lights. Plus, it's GORGEOUS! (if you did mormon trail at night, you could start about an hour before sunset, then head back as the sun goes down) Don't forget water, it is a moderate level hike.....and flashlights would be a good idea too, just in case :)"
1,"Possibly the best burger I've ever had--definitely the best I've had in Phoenix. I get the classic, which comes on brioche with a choice of cheese. It's the only thing I've ever ordered there, because it's so damn good I can't pass it up. AND they get their beef from humanely raised, grass-fed cows. And beer selection, and the fries with aioli... Well, others here have told you how good they are. Pro tip? Throw a little of that aioli on your burger, too. Oh, and come hungry--it's a generously sized burger. It's a little pricey, but Delux is a really delicious treat."
1,"Decent menu which includes the traditional satay, tom yum koong, curries, pad thai etc. What threw me off was teriyaki, sweet and sour chicken, kung pao, chow mein. Food is good with great portions! Careful on the heat scale. 10 is blazin... Weird thing....I was really thirsty after the meal. Usually that's the result of using the other type of SaLt. Overall the place is clean, modern, and staff are attentive. Curries are 10 bones, Fried rice at 9, and most entrees at 9 bones! Price is a buck plus more than our So Cal places. Give it a try, food is good, and service is fast. Damm..I need to drink another bottle of soda!!! ."
1,I love Dr. Scott!! He is the funniest doctor I've ever met and he makes me feel good too! Dr. Scott is always willing to bend over backwards to make sure you are provided the best service and treatment possible. The massage therapists rock too! I will be a lifelong patient of Integrated Chiropractic.
0,"I've always said if the guacamole, chips and salsa aren't good, the food is not likely to be good either. I was right, Guacamole was not very good at all, same with the salsa. Rest of the food was just okay but for a restaurant in the Biltmore I expected so much better. Just as a note, when it comes to Mexican food, I'm super critical. This place will probably get a higher ratings from people of the Midwest."
1,"I now have a sixth Sens for delicious Asian tapas- a genre I never knew existed. I always assumed the best tapas disappeared when Aaron May sauteed Sol Y Sombra's last batch of butter-marinated brussels sprouts! Well, I was proven wrong when I hit up the ultra-cool Sens Asian Tapas & Sake on a Thursday night. Guests are greeted by electric blue lights, neon pink lotus blossom light fixtures and fresh beats courtesy of a hipster DJ, which transport the hungry to an intoxicating, fluorescent experiens filled with sauces, sakes, and spicy flavors they probably don't even know about yet. I tried three top-notch items: Wasabi Tofu- Hot, in every Sens of the word. Wasabi and 300-degree tempura crusties have the ability to burn you to your soul if you aren't careful. Don't skip it, just poke it with a chopstick or blow on it first. White Peach Juice and Vodka- Just like Japanese candy exchange students brought home in high school, it's one of those miraculous flavors most Americans will never have the opportunity to try. Light and sweet, but not overly so, it's a perfect blend you can sip all.night.long. (I did!) The best, by far, is the Hot & Sour Soup. It's nothing like the kind you get for .99 at Chinese restaurants as an appetizer. A Bilbo Baggins-ey cauldron arrives with a wooden ladle- among the various veggies and disc-shaped noodles is your choice of meat- I chose clams. I've always heard you can truly tell how talented a chef is by how tasty his soup is, and would have to agree. There's nothing to hide behind, and you're confronted by pure flavor. It was complex, different and mouthwatering. The whole Sens-ation was so genius, I even got past the embarrassment of Chef Johnny Chu snorting in my face for taking pics of my meal on my iPhone."
1,"When I'm looking for the more mature, laid back version of Lux, I come to Copper Star. Coffee is not as good but service is great and place is inviting. Great neighborhood favorite."
1,"The place isn't have bad. I got a sweet and sour lunch combo, and it came out fine. Their menus pretty thurough, and prices are really fair. Its chinese food, and if your in the area, it should get you where you need to go. Place is clean, staff is friendly. Would return for lunch here again soon."
1,This place shouldn't even be reviewed - because it is the kind of place I want to keep for myself... =)
1,"Decent Chinese food. I go often for take out. It is easy and convenient for those in central phoenix. I have had times where some of the food is great and other times it was bad. Support local restaurants, this beats panda express!"
0,"Sorry Banana Leaf... I'm usually not picky at all but the Thai Curry Tofu and Vegetable dish I picked up last night was awful. Really... it was almost not edible. The packaging was not great, so it kind of spilled a bit in the bag - not a good start. Perhaps the curry is the 'yellow curry' that Jenny R refers to in her review - maybe the chef should taste it before serving it - it was nasty! Seriously, I've had better Asian food from the food court at the mall before! I will say, you did listen to my request to add eggplant to the dish - thank you... but if someone requests eggplant, perhaps you should make sure it's cooked fully next time. I had a bite that was barely cooked - it was crunchy. So, needless to say - I don't think I'll be giving you another shot. First impressions sometimes last a lifetime. Sorry Banana Leaf!"
0,"Empty tables. Told 15 minute wait. Ok. 5 minutes into wait (by the door, bumping elbows with counter patrons), 2 people at the counter complained they had been there 20 minutes. We left at that point"
0,"This was my first time visiting Tandoori Times. After seeing it advertised on Groupon, I thought I'd give it a try. My friend and I decided to go for lunch to celebrate her birthday. It was very busy, which was promising. The waitress was on her second day working there and was unfamiliar with the menu, but she was friendly. The house salad was mediocre, the entree (Algoo Gobi) was delicious, but the desserts were AWFUL. The ""mango"" ice cream was a neon orange and tasted nothing like mango, or any flavor of ice cream Id ever tasted actually (kinda vanilla, kinda puke). YUCK. The rice pudding was not worth eating either. The worst part of the experience was being followed out into the parking lot, after leaving the Groupon and cash tip, to be told that we needed to come speak with management about not ordering at least $40 worth of food! Really? I told the waiter that we had spent just over $30, and we obviously didn't expect any cash back from the $40 Groupon. He said his manager was ""fussy"" and wouldn't like it. I basically told him that was too damn bad, and that I wasn't ordering $10 more in food; I was actually kinda saving them $10! He finally figured out what I was saying and left us alone. I did end up calling the manager though, who was not pleased to hear about our experience with the dumb waiter. I don't foresee returning there."
1,"Went here for lunch on a weekday and thought it'd be busier. The slower setting allowed for more personal attention though. The chef even came out to talk to us and gave us free samples of some of the desserts. The food was good, but didn't blow me away. I think it's a nice option for a snazzier (it's a little pricey) lunch with friends."
1,"So much food for so little money, and they have kids meals that the kids will actually eat. If you do not like what they offer in the cafeteria you can get food downstairs like Pizza and hotdogs...what kid does not like Pizza or a hotdog? I had the meatballs and mashed potatoes and they were so good. I wish there was something bad to say about eating in a furniture store cafeteria, but there really is not - it was great food, great service and fun for the kids (there is a play area with a TV that they can eat at too (so the parents can enjoy their food too) My wife had the herb chicken and it looked great too, and she said it was really tasty too. She loved it. The desserts were amazing too, and very filling --- SO MUCH FOOD for SO LITTLE THE MONEY! I wish it was not so far away from Queen Creek, or I would hit it up so much more often!"
0,"I finally saved up the amount I am willing to spend to make my backyard not look like tent city. mind you, i have never been to tent city but i have a feeling they look similar. minus the pool. my backard is set up where the pool takes up the entire yard and then a maximum of 5 feet surrounding rock space around the entire pool. welcome to my backyard. this makes planting difficult. my original dream was to plant oleanders along every wall, let them grow super tall to block all of my neighbors and give me the privacy i've always wanted to skinny dip all summer long. don't judge. I wanted oleanders because they sounded like a match made in heaven for my lack of green thumb. they're cheap, they flower, they grow fast and they're impossible to kill. well, i found out oleanders roots are too aggressive to be that close to my pool so sadly, no go. (i only have 5 ft, they need 10-15ft) I called moon valley to get some ideas so I could do research root systems. the guy on the phone just wanted to get me there. i told him i was looking for suggestions before heading there on this rainy day and he just kept saying in the cheesiest voice known to man 'oh ya, come on down, we have hundreds'. you have hundreds of plants that are identical to oleanders minus the roots and resemble in price? really??? please list them so i can find out if you're a big fat liar. nope, not listing them. only wanted to get me there. i decided not to go because 1. it's raining, 2. he lied and said oleanders are ok. i just have to have the drip system on 24/7. thanks for your freakin help. 3. he's a liar so even if i went they would lie to me. 4. i hate liars 5. i went in before in the past and told them what i wanted, they gave me a free backyard design and they completely didn't listen to me and created a backyard that cost 2k. who do they think i am? i live in mesa for crying out loud. not paradise valley. i wasn't going to let them waste my time like that again. if you're wondering why i could give them a 2nd chance after that- it's bc this time *I* was going to wear the pants in the relationship. you could have had my entire (low) budget moon valley, but the unwillingness to help or be honest means i will be going elsewhere. someplace that will straight up say 'i can fulfill your skinny dipping in privacy dreams, while making your backyard look pretty as cheaply as possible and i won't destroy your pool while i'm at it'"
1,"How can you go wrong with tortillas and pastries in one location? I honestly don't understand how this little Mexican bakery stays in business given everything is practically free. My hubby and I bought two empanadas for me (like a little pie or turnover), flan for him, a dozen tortillas, and 2 red burritos. I guess you need to get there early because they were out of red tamales at 2 pm on a Friday. The empanadas were baked just to golden brown and the crust was so flaky and delicious words cannot describe it. I had lemon and cherry, but I wanted to try one of everything. The red chili in the burritos was mild but very flavorful. Luckily they are wrapped in foil because I couldn't wait to get home to devour mine. They could double their prices and I would still come back! I forgot to mention the bakery is spotless, so clean I would eat off the floor if I had to."
1,"I had never heard of this place until some friends from out of town brought us a bottle of the olive oil. So when I had out of town company visiting, we made a trip to the Olive Mill and signed up for the tour. The tour is not really much of a tour, but more of a 20-25 minute lesson on growing and harvesting olives, and then a look at the equipment used to press the oil. Our tour guide was very entertaining and funny. While there was a long period of standing, there is very little walking so really anyone can get their $5 worth. While waiting for the tour to start, we wandered around the store and then enjoyed the wine and cider tasting outside. They also have live music every Saturday. After the tour we filled several sample cups with a variety of olive oil flavors, and bought a loaf of bread, and enjoyed figuring out what was in each cup. The line to order food was too long, so we didn't stick around for a meal, but everything looked wonderful. The only less than positive thing I have to say is that they really promoted the Pork Shop down the road, so we went there hoping to load up on ready made food (since we had opted not to wait in line for Olive Mill food). It's actually a butcher shop that also sells a few cooked items. There were BBQ pork burritos, green chili burritos, and spare ribs. The pork burrito was alright, but the sauce overwhelmed the meat so that's all you could really taste. The ribs were really a disappointment. They are around $6-7 a pound, and although they were meaty, it took way too much work to get the meat off of the bones. Perhaps a few more hours in the oven, and they would have been better - but I don't recommend going out of your way to check this place out."
1,"Arizona definitely lack cool spots, but luckily they have The Vig. The venue has a nice patio area--perfect for warmer nights, but the inside tables are fine too. My friends brought me on a Sunday night where all their bottle wines are 50%off... which is pretty awesome. The service was friendly and the food was legit. Try the ""Good ol' Steak Salad"" and Crabmeat Artichoke dip! btw the valet is $3."
1,"Being that not many places were open on New Years Day, I decided to cruise around and see what was open. Being that the bookstore wasnt quite open yet and had a horrendous line, I drove around a little bit to see if I could grab a cup of coffee to kill some time. I pulled into the parking lot because theres several stores located in this strip mall, and have shopped at a few stores here before. I found this coffee shop smashed inbetween other stores. Its a very small shop, with extremely limited seating. I will say I liked it here, and I enjoyed my experience for a lot of reasons. Thier prices are cheap as all get out, which is great! I got a 12 ounce Mocha for $3.24. Awesome! Service here was amazing and friendly, and I will gladly return in the future. So why 3 stars? there were a whopping 2 tables to sit at inside, and thats kind of a problem. I also asked the girl about the internet, and she said the signal was in and out, and should be fixed in a few days after the holiday. For me, a coffee shop is a place that I like to park at for an hour, plug in my computer, surf the net, and drink coffee. I dont like sitting outside because A) I have no plug and my battery dies after an hour, and B) in the summer Im not sitting in the heat. So, even though I would return for the prices and service, I wouldnt recomend this place for anyone who plans on staying for more then 5 minutes."
1,"Burritos and Bodybuilders There's not usually much decor in Chiptole. They keep their decorations and their food simple and to the point. But if you're in the age range of 15-40, there's plenty of male eye candy. I think I saw 3 men who's muscles were 5 times the size of mine. In fact, most of the people in the restaurant were men. I'm not sure why or how, but it made my tacos a little tastier. ;) Enjoy! No five starts because I watched them put sugar in the rice. There's already so much sugar in everything, we don't need more in the rice please."
1,"Four days and maybe seven hours ago, our hunger brought us forth to eat cheesesteak, to try a new restaurant, conceived in Philly, but dedicated to the proposition that not all cheesesteaks are created equal. We shared a large chicken cheesesteak with everything (onions, bell peppers), and cheese wiz, along with some sweet potato fries. The chicken cheesesteak came with a good amount of tender chicken, with a lot of flavor. There is a free-range mini fridge that is stocked with sweet , hot peppers, and fry sauce which is nice so you can customize your order with as many or as little peppers as you want. While the ingredients were good quality, the cheesesteak as a whole naturally doesn't really compare to any I've had in Philly, but it's good for Arizona! The sweet potato fries were my favorite part of the meal. They tasted freshly cut, and were excellently cooked with just the right amount of crunch while still tender and sweet inside. So would our forefathers be impressed by Forefathers? They probably wouldn't know what a cheesesteak would be, but if they tasted one, I would say they would be!"
1,"It has been awhile since I have visited the Dubliner. The only reason I haven't frequented the place lately is because I don't live near them anymore so I can't just either walk home or call a cab for 5 min ride. However there drinks are strong and cheap! Either that or the bartender was being very friendly on the few times I have visited :) The food is not to shabby either. I mean you can't possibly mess up fish and chips. Hmm fish and chips. So go, check it out, but remember if you have too many, call a cab. Did I mention that their drinks are strong and cheap! #winwin!"
0,"I've been to Buffalo Wild Wings before, but my first visit at this location was during UFC 117. If you come here to watch fighting events like UFC I would recommend arriving 2 hours before the main card starts if you want a seat inside. I arrived an hour before the PPV portion of the fight started and didn't get a seat until half an hour in and it was outside. I ordered 12 regular wings and I was very underwhelmed. I felt the wings were overpriced because they are smaller than average. The main reason why I went here was that they weren't charging a cover or bill minimum for the fight. Also, the atmosphere for a UFC fight was really good compared to the other BWW I went to in Tucson. If you want a place with a good atmosphere for a sporting event, you should come to BWW. But your food expectations should be lowered a lot."
1,"This is the ONLY place my wife and I will buy furniture from, absolutely fantastic! My wife and I spent a better part of a month looking for a TV stand for our living room. Everything we came across was cheap and prefabricated. We stumbled on Sweet Potatoes while on our way home from another local store. The owner was extremely friendly and helpful. We found a couple things we liked but not the size we needed. The owner told us the pieces we were looking at are locally made and offered to call and see if they could custom make one. Not only did they agree but the price we were given was 200 dollars less than anything else we were looking at. We have since received the piece and could not be happier!"
1,"Had lunch here today with Lynn W. and Rand H. Well the the place is new and the decor is well done and comfy . They have enough food selections to classify them as a super buffet. As far as the food goes it was all pretty good with most of your typical Chinese buffet selections . Some of the extra items were steamed clams , double baked potatoes ,fresh strawberries and Vienna sausage. The macaroni salad I had was very good and i went back for more as was the stuffed shrimp. There is also a sushi bar but I did not try any on this trip. The food here makes them a 4 star eatery and as far as the staff goes they need to be a lot more happier with a name like happy buffet."
1,This is a very interesting place. Don't go here thinking it will be classy.
1,"What a joy to discover Thai Lahna with my friend Keith Galbut who has been going here for over 10 years. I can see why. Family owned and operated - and everyone is very friendly and helpful. Of course all that matters is the food, right - and it's marvelous. We tried several dishes and all were well spiced and wonderful. Highly recommended."
1,"After shopping all over town and visiting every single shop in the phx area I stumbled into this little gem. Store was clean and only stocked with desirable items and lacked the items that just arent used by the majority, but I am sure could be ordered if needed. This planning I found easy to make my purchases in a quicker manner since I dont always have the time to sort through typical store junk, there just isnt any here! Only quality sought after items. Management is second to none and the business is family owned and operated. When you walk in your greeted and after a few visits by name even. This is a huge plus and isnt found anywhere else in town that I have seen. There is a prefered customer program and most livestock is local grown and special items are taken in a wish list and you can get called once available. After my month long search for the perfect store to set up my custom order that could also fulfill my stocking needs I couldnt get my order in fast enough for a complete custom setup installed and delivered. Pricing was fantastic and cheaper than anywhere in town and the ability to come in anytime and get advice no matter what the need is makes this shop feel like home when you walk in. If your looking for a one stop shop that is friendly, knowledgeable, and isnt out to empty your wallet in a bad way this is your place. Thanks again Reef Monsters for the help in sorting out what was an overwhelming amount of information into a custom tailoring to what I could handle and needed to continue in this hobby."
1,"This place is always a hit. Even when you don't know what you want, they will help you decide. The baristas always have great recommendations. Often times I tell them what I am in the mood for, often times I let them know I love Nutella, and they give me suggestions. They also will make just about anything on the menu and mix it up for ya! This past time they mixed up a mocha freezeacino with nutella. Pretty darn good, tasted less watered down than sbux. I have gotten a S'mores coffee (not that great) but you know what? Its the thought that counts, what other coffee shop has a drive thru, local bakery items, friendly and helpful baristas that dont rush you in ordering, and unique drink ideas? HMM 32 Shea does. Come here, check out the variety, and the local flavors. You wont be upset that you did. Located over on the Northwest Plaza on Shea and 32nd just past the 51 freeway. Go there. Tomorrow morning.."
1,"I like the review of the whacked waiter... i think he may be still at work at 'Cantina Laredo' cuz i think he served us....... Called ahead after a Cardinals game to make sure there was room enough for our party of 10- "" No problem "" we were told , come on down. arrived 9:00 ish on a beautiful 80F evening in Scottsdale -stepped across a half empty patio into the spacious Cantina - chilled to an ungodly 60F- Note to the great state of Arizona : (the reason that y'all are booming and experiencing sustained in-migration is because people are like lizards--- ( in more ways than one)---they like the sun , they like the heat ... they flee from northern climes to get away from the chill - Don't AC your premises such that it reminds us of Duluth in winter.... we just escaped Duluth in winter and fled south to thaw ) . we asked for a spot on the patio and our man immediately declined stating that "" he had already set a table for us inside""- upon my wife's insistence that he reevaluatethe patio he disappeared for a moment or two and then reappeared - affirming that the half empty patio was indeed full. this puzzled my wife who then surmised that : A) he wanted our large party in his section -not the patio B) there would likely be a built in minimum gratuity on the final bill ( there was) after taking our drink order ,(competently), he returned with salsa and chips. The salsa he described as being of two types ""hot "" or ""regular""- there were indeed two temperatures -but they appeared to be seperated thermally rather than chemically -?? the same salsa one served at room temperature , one served chilled...??? when asked about the best dishes for people who wanted a little kick to their food he replied: "" I wouldn't really know , I don't like spicy food"" ????????????????? Dude , can you not at least fake something.... it is after all a Mexican restaurant. If people want spice they go Mexican - if they want bland they seek out a Saskatchewan restaurant - non? The meal was salvaged - ( not saved), by a compatriot of our man who hailed from Durango- he spoke knowledgeably about the menu , filled our empty margarita glasses and retreated into the kitchen to assemble , on our behalf , a pepper mole sauce that was truely outstanding. The food was uninspired -( there was a Baja Grill of some sort across the parking lot and we wondered if they shared a kitchen...) , the service was poor ( excepting our hombre from Mejico ), and the casa freakishly cold-- Two stars tops over all but boosted up to three by our amigo from Victoria de Durango"
1,"Some buddies and I went to Scottsdale for a golfing boondoggle last week and a couple of guys in the know directed us to The Mission. DANG! We let our server, Jonathan, drive the car so to speak. He quizzed us on our likes and dislikes and brought us our orders (we didn't specifically order). We had 7 people in our group and every plate was spot on. We started with the chicken (thigh) tostadas and the crispy cola pork belly tostadas. They were great; particularly the pork belly ones. MAN were those good. My dinner was the Chorizo Porchetta which brought a big hunk of slow cooked pork that shredded beautifully. Along side this hunka hunka porky love was a salt block carrying 10 small corn tortillas to build little tacos from. Some tasty accompaniments: sauce, onion, & cilantro, finished the presentation. It was a fantastic dish. The other 6 dishes were just as great. To note: the honey chipotle grits that my buddy got were super tasty. Especially when you dumped some of their ghost chili sauce (forget what it was called). Desert was the Pumpkin bread pudding (YUM!) and fried bananas. All in all, a fantastic place. Really good."
0,"So I am an occasional shopper here at this market.. for a few reasons: we love their in-house made corn tortillas; they have a good selection of mexican treats (Bimbo breads and coconut bars) and if I'm buying conventional produce, their prices can't be beat. Also, their pan Bolillo is really good and cheap and their cakes (3 Leches) are pretty damn good. OK, so here is where the minus comes in.. the BIG minus. My husband and I used to go occasionally for breakfast (I'd usually order simple, straightforward things like carne asada tacos.. don't get much simpler than meat in a corn tortilla).. well, the last time we did this, I found my meat... ready?... wait for it... to be the color blue and purple. I had brown meat, but I had pieces of it that were blue and purple... no effin' joke. I thought it was a trick of the eye, but I closely examined it and ... sho'nuff, that shit was blue and purple. I immediately threw away my dish and never have I since ordered meat from their kitchen side. That being said, I've also become more cautious in buying meats here... not to sound like a snob, but you bet I'm not buying my next cut of beef here! I'm cool with their breads and their cakes and tortillas and such, but if it comes to meat, I'm out the door. I much prefer Pro's Ranch Market - the REAL Ranch Market."
1,"I LOVE LIFE TIME!! It's always clean plenty of machines to work out on that are in working order! HUGH VARIETY of classes to take and keep you from getting bored. My kids LOVE it too and ask when we are going to the gym. They also have the rock climbing wall, basketball and Squash courts and outdoor and indoor pool with life guard and a water slide at both. The out doors and indoors have a lap pool as well . The inside has 2 extra large jacuzzi and of course your steam room and saunas. I personally love the locker rooms they are so nice to shower and get ready in they provide everything you could think of ( just like a 5 star hotel!! ) This place keeps me motivated You Gotta try the Zumba class and Strictly strength class!!!"
1,Great hh prices. Like to go and unwind. Definetly give it a try
1,"I can only vouch for the chicken salad, as it's the only thing I've ever tried in the 20 years I've been coming here. It's THAT good. I always think about trying something else, but why mess with perfection? Walking inside gives you the sense that you've stepped into a time machine and arrived in the late 70's. I, personally, find it to be awesome. Most of Scottsdale is lacking in historic flare. And yes, the late 70s is historic by Scottsdale standards. Besides, whatever money they're not spending on updating the decor is clearly going right into their magically delicious chicken salad."
1,"I love the Madagascar coconut white tea! The prices and very reasonable, only downfall for me is they don't list the caffeine content;("
1,"I recently visited Olive and Ivy for business last week, and after 3 visits, I am convinced that Fox Restaurants has some of the best establishments in the valley. Olive and Ivy is the Fox Restaurant of choice for consistently good food, great drinks, and most of all, outstanding service. I spend a lot of time in various restaurants across the valley and am always amazed at how bad service can be at some of the more popular valley restaurants. Not Olive and Ivy. From the first phone call for reservations, to the greeting upon walking in the door to the smiles and warm reception you receive from every server you cross, this restaurant knows how to make you feel special. Many of the reviews here will focus on the food and I could spend hours talking about my experiences but I will sum it up in a couple of my favorites. I hate dates and prunes, but the bacon wrapped dates are crazy good! The shrimp and risotto main course is one of the best dishes I have tasted since arriving in Phoenix 3 years ago. And hands down, their short rib entree is best in the valley. The only catch is the cost. Olive and Ivy is not cheap and definitely not for brothers looking to execute the cheap date. With wine, apps, and main course, you will easy break the century mark, and if you are really being generous, $200 is obtainable. But, it's worth every dollar and who knows, you may even get breakfast out of the deal!"
1,"On top of how good the food is, their customer service is excellent. I went to eat there on Thursday (the 16th), and had the best server ever. He was the bartender as well, and still payed tons of attention to my table. He was very nice, and very helpful. He had extensive knowledge of the menu. He was also very personable. He laid out samples of their various barbeque sauces while giving some details about each one. He squirted them out onto an extra plate he brought to the table, and he made the shape of a smiley face with all the sauces. He made that dining experience so good that I wish I could write a review about him personally and suggest to his managers that he get a raise! I couldn't hear him when he stated his name over a large group that had just come in and was moving tables, but he was wonderful. Also, one of the people with me is from the east coast, and likes vinegar-based barbeque sauce. They didn't have any of that kind in their current rotation of sauces, and he actually went back to the kitchen and explained the situation. A lady from the kitchen made a vinegar-based barbeque sauce from scratch just because one of us had mentioned how much we loved it. I've never experienced service like that, and really can't say enough about how great this guy, and all other staff I came into contact with, was! Great job to whoever hired him. The food was delicious, I love their fries! Unlike anything you can get anywhere else. I got the country roasted chicken- great seasoning, super moist and tender, while still having that chargrilled/roasted skin (my favorite). All of their sauces are so good; it's hard to choose just one! (And no matter how many times I go there, I always sample each one again). All positive things to say about this Famous Daves! Oh- and I forgot to mention the corn muffins...beyond words! Seriously, you have to try them. Now I'm craving one, and I'm pretty sure they're not open at 3:00 a.m. I wish I could order them by the dozen haha"

1,"We took our grandson (Sebastian) to the park for a thoroughly enjoyable visit. Sebastian wasn't too sure about the carousel, but the train ride put a smile all over his face. The visit to the Presidential railroad car was fun and educational for the adults. Sebastian liked it too."
0,"Two stars for bad service and, damn, I have to the tell the truth, a lousy appetizer. Had the braised leeks to start, which appeared to have been made less of leeks and more of a white cheese that I can only assume had been allowed to congeal into a rubbery mat beneath a heat lamp. It was literally impossible to cut into bite-sized pieces, and was tasteless besides. Then, after at least a half an hour wait, pasta with chanterelles. The shrooms were great, and I have to say I enjoyed fennel for the first time in my life, but the pasta was enormous in size and there was an awful lot of it. But one of my friends had the fried green tomatoes, which were wonderful, and another had the brussell sprouts, also wonderful, and the butterscotch pudding dessert with the nutmeg whipped cream was simply divine. They were very busy (our reserved table was 20 minutes late and the seats were still warm when we sat down), so I'm thinking they were just run off their feet. I'd give them another chance. Oh, and a delightful Arizona sauvignon blanc. I'm told they serve only Arizona wines, which is kinda cool.."
1,"I have concerns about Heirloom. Not about the food, which is fantastic (not quite 5 star fantastic, but 4.5 star fantastic). Nor the service, which is friendly and helpful. Nor about the atmosphere (well, somewhat about the atmosphere...it's quite lackluster). My concern is that Heirloom claims to be fine dining for our current economic times, when $50 entrees seem obscene. But what they've done is create a menu of less expensive small plates where you need to order at least 3 per person to be totally full, so you end up spending as much if not more as you would at other high-end establishments. On my visit, the place was practically dead. Granted, it was a weeknight, but I can't see how a place can survive with only 3 of its probably 15+ tables occupied. Especially not in such a high rent location, where restaurants have dropped out like flies. The menu changes weekly, which is really nice if you go to a place often, but who could possibly afford to come here often?! If you do go, they have a $25 off coupon on their website. Not 25 percent...25 DOLLARS! I would love to return to Heirloom every month to try chef Michael DeMaria's latest culinary creations, but that's certainly not within my budget. I'm afraid others have the same problem and that this place won't be around for long. Therein lie my concerns, because I really did love my meal!"
0,"a little greasy for my skin but the presentation is organic and fun! glitter, rubber ducks, bath fizzies and tons of soap make for a great one stop shop when you're shopping for those girlfriends you have who like everything. the style is unique making it a fabulous place to take a peek in but just not for me."
1,"Excellent service!!!! I had to find a spa different from lavenders after they got rid of yet another excellent staff member, so I tried this place! I was SO HAPPY!! clean, pleasant, warm, comforting. The manager is actually on site and aware of the things going on in their spa! The staff is friendly and efficient! Lavenders day spa can learn from this place. Send the owner from lavenders to sanity and TAKE NOTES. I HIGHLY recommend it here!!!!!! Go and enjoy!!!"
1,We love Niro's! The hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches are dynamite! The Greek salad is big and fresh. The gyros are also excellent. I'm a French fry junkie and these are my favorite in Phoenix! Service is fast and prices are good. The owners are almost always there and make us feel so welcome!
1,"Scary things to me: Paris Hilton has a career. Sarah Palin. Really. She's like the new Anita Bryant. My fathers' overgrown eyebrows. Trim, daddy, trim! Droves of high schoolers leaving school just as I'm trying to find Barrio Cafe. Seriously. Like thousands of them. And I couldn't find the damn restaurant. What was I gonna do? Roll down the window (well, not roll down, seriously, who rolls down windows anymore?) and holler out in my best lispy voice, ""Hey, squeeze me fellas, I'm going to a wine tasting at the Barrio Cafe. Y'all know where that is?"" Since all teenagers carry guns, yes, that scared me. Finally. I found it. And entered. Cute. Cozy. Middle of the day, so empty. Great, vibrant art. And a very attentive and friendly staff. Often times at this time of day, restaurants really drop the ball. No ball dropping here. I had La Paloma margarita which is made with a grapefruit soda. Think Squirt and Patron! And after a couple of these babies I was in el bano squirting out that Patron. Dee lish however. I ordered the Enchiladas Del Mar. Enchiladas of the Sea for my non Spanish speaking peeps. You know what? It was good. Not great. And the presentation was somewhat messy. I couldn't find the crab or the scallops (which were the size of the ends of q-tips by the way). They were lost in the sauce and the cheese. But I devoured it as the blue corn tortillas sang to me. My friend had a chickent torta. Big and rustic. Like Janet Reno. She loved it! I will most definitely be back. Hopefully I will not have to navigate through the plethora of pubescent people and hopefullyl I will pick that Barrio menu item that will blow my calcentinas off. Oh. That's blow my socks off. BTW. Adios for now mi yelpitas!"
0,"marginal sushi meets uncomfotable seating. we used restaurant.com coupon and got stuck wtih an 18% tip...with no service, seriously??? felt scammed...think we actually spent more based on that tip than had we just paid full price. avoid this one, just not worth it."
1,Best gyro in town! We go for the lunch special during the work week quite often. I havent been for dinner but if its half as good as their lunch gyro then you wont be disappointed. Service is great and they always take good care of us.
0,"I went here with Friends last Friday. All my friends and I use Yelp, at the end of the meal taking cost into perspective we all came to this is a 1 star place. It was a huge disappointment after looking at the positive reviews. Our 1st disappointment came because they had a ""limited"" beer list. My good buddy just wanted an IPA and all they had was the normal domestic beers and a few other quality ones. Then, the Spanish ham was not very good and once you take into account the price it was terrible. We had a sausage plate where the sausage was dry. The Calamari was extremely oily. The only positive thing was the lamb chops but once you factor in price that was poor too. We all came to the conclusion we would never go back."
1,"I'm in (puppy) love with the new Wag N'Wash in Scottsdale... I'd been to the Phoenix location years ago and remember wishing they were closer to my home, and my wish was granted... this new location is less than a mile from where I live! Minnie and I popped in a few weeks back for a self-serve bath. I initially called to see if a groomer was in, but they were booked out for weeks. Doing it myself was actually not only cheaper, but it was fun... and a good bonding experience for me and Min as well. Sara helped us out and explained our options. We decided on the ultimate wash which included an extremely efficient shampoo and conditioner, brushes, towels, cologne, etc... It was easy and quick - bonus! Minnie was clean and fresh within 20 minutes or so! Of course we spent a tad bit more time at the store doing some shopping and I was impressed with the dog food selection, homemade treats, eco-friendly collars and leashes, etc... I'll definitely head back to Wag N' Wash again really soon... so psyched that they moved to my 'hood!"
1,"What started out as a simple attempt to find a perfect birthday present turned into a life-long relationship with a fantastic jeweler. I wanted to get my fiancé (girlfriend at that time) a simple diamond pendant necklace for her birthday and could not find anything that even came close to matching her style. I searched the internet for days and reluctantly went into a few jewelry stores hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. I, like most people [guys] out there, had a bad feeling in a few stores I went to. Pushy sales people looking for the upsale, and sky high prices. I was getting very discouraged about the process, but that all changed when I came to Hyde Park. The super friendly staff made everything easy for me. There was no pushy sales process or anyone trying to upsell me something I didn't want. They immediately offered me a bottle of water and started to talk to me like a real person. After a few minutes of speaking with a very lovely woman in the store she suggested we think about something custom. At first I was thinking ""here we go; this is where I am going to get stuck!"", but I was all wrong!!! We looked a few loose stones and I got a great education about diamonds. I went home later that night and did some research on the internet and found that the prices we as good, or better than any of the big online retailers. I could never get my head wrapped around buying a diamond online, sight unseen, and I am so glad that I found Hyde Park. In the end I have used Hyde Park to create a custom pendant diamond necklace that my fiancé absolutely loves (it is perfect on her), and I also used Hyde Park to get the diamond for the engagement ring, as well as everything else to follow. Want to know what service is all about in the jewelry business, check out what Hyde Park did for me. I picked out an amazing diamond for the engagement ring (chose the loose stone again) but had no idea what kind of a ring my fiancé would want. So Hyde Park said ""how about we just put it in a classic Tiffany solitaire setting as a temporary setting and then after you give it to her, you can come back in together and pick out the perfect setting and wedding band set"". I was like, seriously?!! You can just do that??? In the end Hyde Park will be my jeweler for life. They helped me create the perfect simple birthday present, and took that service all the way through doing a custom engagement ring and matching wedding band set. This is the jewelry store for any guy who wants great service, great prices, and like me, doesn't have the first clue about how to make the perfect decision. Just let Hyde Park take the stress out of it like they did for me!"
1,"Fast service, attentive waiter, food cooked as I ordered, clean restrooms...What more could I ask for? I was on my way to a meeting at the Marriott so I stopped in to grab lunch beforehand. I was in an out in less than 45 minutes. Perfect. I'll be back the next time I am at the Desert Ridge mall looking for a place to grab a quickbite to eat without ordering fast food."
1,"This is one of my absolute favorite bars in Old Town. It is casual with really good food but plays loud top 40 music with great drinks. What more could you ask for? Service is great and the bathrooms are clean. The restaurant has outdoor seating which is great for people watching and right in the heart of Old Town nightlife. You're within walking distance to The Mint, Dollhouse, Smashboxx, and the Pussycat Lounge. If I didn't live a $40 cab ride away (one-way) I'd come here way more often. Lots of huge flat panel tvs and plenty of seating. It gets packed on weekends but the place is pretty big so it never feels overwhelmingly crowded. This is not a good place to dance. There is actually no dance floor. But maybe that won't stop you or I after a few drinks..."
1,"Visited recently for the first time. Enjoyed happy hour appetizers on the patio. Cool place for outdoor dining, the waterfall added a nice background. They offer smoking and non-smoking on separate sides of the patio. Of course you know that if anyone is smoking, the entire area gets to ""enjoy"" the smoke. Being a non-smoker, I would appreciate an true non-smoking area but being outdoors was too compelling to pass on this beautiful day. Another small observation - the tables were too low for the chairs causing you to lean over to eat and the chairs were not comfortable at all. We ordered chicken quesadilla & crab cake appetizer. The quesadilla was made w/ green chiles and cheese, served w/ green & red salsa. Didn't care for the red salsa but the green was pretty good, rather mild. A side of sour cream was all that was missing here. Crab cakes were ok, nothing special. Served w/ a nice side salad it made a very good small meal. A side of some kind of orange sauce (chipotle?) for the crab cakes that seemed really HOT to me - skip this next time please. Just based on the outdoor atmosphere alone, I would definitely come back again."
1,"This is a GREAT place to eat! One of my favorite lunch stops as you can see if you follow my facebook photos ""Lunch With Stew"". My favorite thing there is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. mmmmm, mmm. Kevin O'Donnell is from the Texas Hold'em family of final tables and occasionally will play the tour. Super great guy and he also has a super great restaurant and sports bar."
0,"For some reason, these people seem to think it's OK to price a tank top, that probably has less thread count than my thong and cost about 17cents of labor to make, at $50. They also seem to think that dressing up their mannequins like paraplegic color and pattern blind grandmas gives them business. Oh wait...it does! Because this is Tempe. And Tempe, as I can't over-repeat, is the devil."
1,Sooo...if they ask you if you want to sit in the 'lounge'...just say no! Trust me... Artichoke brushetta is good but garlicky which I like
0,"Summary: not impressed. Arrived early afternoon, ironically maybe that was the problem - there wasn't enough going on, place was dead. I would have hoped that a restaurant manager would realize that the few customers they may have at a slow time are just as important as those on a Friday night rush - standards are standards, you either have them or you don't. Waitress was pleasant but not attentive - with a total of 3 occupied tables had to get up and get her attention for more chips. Chips though were very good; needed hotter salsa. My friend had the steak fajitas; tasted OK but just luke warm. Fajitas are supposed to be sizzling hot; duh. I had a so-so tamale and chicken enchilada. Enchilada was just warm, mostly a flat layer of cheese. Tamale filling was tasty shredded meat (as it should be) but corn meal was barely warm and almost tasted only partially cooked. Refried beans weren't warm enough to even melt the grated cheese sprinkled on top, which consequently then pulled off in a single congealed mass when I took a bite. Finally, the Cadillac margaritas were just average at best. $50 plus tip for two meals plus two margaritas; not worth it. The place looked promising and has a cute patio area but we won't be back - someone's not watching the store. I'm trying to be generous with the two stars as some other Yelpers seem to like this place; maybe things can get better."
1,"Went here for our anniversary. Pretty much what you would expect from an upper end steak house. Yes, it's pricey. Steaks were good and service was attentive. A good place to celebrate."
1,Pricey!! Not my fave place to shop for vintage wares but decent to peak through.
1,"While throwing a small get together, we were able to have a back patio with a buffet style table set up with some pretty tasty appetizers. The chicken sqewers were delicious and smoked salmon was also tasty but something seemed to lack. At the end of the day it was good and I wouldn't hesitate to go back, but nothing to make me a raving fan."
1,"*cut to scene* Friday night, lounging around discussing the lameness of the evening, ready to indulge in a new adventure. six pack of Newcastle sits untouched in fridge and bellys aching for fulfillment. yelp.com search reveals a local japanese eatery nearby. enter, Hana. first off, pre-game excitement for this BYOB, local, fresh sushi spot. Newcastle in hand, my friend and I strutted in here at around 8pm on a mildly warm Friday night. the place is jammed, and a couple parties stand around waiting for tables. great, a long wait. nope, two seats open at the bar. sat down, and our beer was immediately taken and put in a fridge to ensure it wouldn't lose any of it's remarkably smooth quality. first beer is poured, and the excitement ensues. friendly and welcoming server devluges us in the specials, and unfortunately they were out of most of their fish as they have been for three weeks. toro and salmon were our options, so we went with a special for the night, the spider roll, and the vegas roll. also, edamame to start. the food was superb. the edamame came spicy with a side of chili flakes and siracha for our never ending quest to burn the shit out of our mouths. a second round of newcastle was brought upon when our first was finished, and the sushi came shortly thereafter, looking like little pieces of art. both sets of rolls were enormous and came about 6 to a plate. the vegas roll was packed with cream cheese, avocado, and salmon. the special roll, the spider roll, was full of crispy soft shell crab and just enough spicy-ness for a much needed kick in the mouth. one dip in my wasabi/soy sauce concoction was more than enough. our third and final beer was poured by an overly-anxious and over-stimulated, presumably newbie, bus boy. I had about 4 inches of head on my beer and my friend got hers spilled and nearly twice as much head. he excellent waitress we had made up for this guys slips during the meal. the staff wished us a nice farewell on our way out, and I felt as though I had just left a very close friend's house. I will definitely be back with more six packs and good friends to share this little diamond in the rough with."
1,"This place does not disappoint. I've been here quite a few times with coworkers and it's always a good choice. Cute place - I especially like sitting on their cozy, covered patio. I hate mushrooms but somehow LOVE their fungi pizza. I think it's the truffle oil that makes it amazing. I've had a few of their other pizzas too, which are quite good as well. All of their salads are delish - you can't go wrong with any of them. If there's just one other person with you, you can't go wrong sharing a pizza and a salad. This place is WAY better than Pizzeria Bianco. Will continue to come back here!"
1,"Humongous flat screen TV!!!! That is the first thing I noticed about the room! Pretty awesome! The room is cozy, and a decent size. The king size bed was comfy with fluffy pillows. The living room had plenty of seats that faced the flat screen TV. The room has a mini-fridge and a microwave. The only gripe about this place is a very small closet and bathroom. There is barely enough room to close the door for the bathroom. The closet also had one sliding door. The continental breakfast was average. No hot food. Guests can choose either cold cereal, instant oatmeal, juice and milk, fruit, yogurt, toasts or bagels. The seating area in the kitchen was convenient for guests to enjoy their meal. If you need access to computers, they are located next to the kitchen. There is a printer as well."
0,"I was so excited to find this place, less than a minute down the street from home! Because I'm not a big panda express fan, but I love Chinese food. Sadly, I was disappointed. The orange chicken was very stringy and tasteless. The sweet and sour sauce was runny and mostly sour. The wontons were the only decent thing we ate there. If you want good, cheap chinese avoid this place and try Li's Bowl on 35th ave."
1,"I still have no idea what this place is. I only know that my dog needed some pills to treat his valley fever and for some reason the vet didn't carry them so I was sent here. The whole process is pretty painless and I think their drugs are priced reasonably. They will also hand deliver the medication the same day if you ask nicely. Pro Tip: When you call, don't hang up right away when you get the recorded message. When you stay on the line it will begin to ring again and someone may answer. I thought the recorded message was an answering machine and hung up prematurely a few times. Also, sometimes the line just rings and rings and rings. Be patient and someone will probably pick up."
1,"Intimate ambiance with good farm to table fare. Good presentation and wine pairings. Outdoor area is nice, though as others have pointed out, there's basically no lighting back to the parking lot after dark."
1,This place is great. It is very clean and the staff is very nice and accommodating. Every time I walk out I am completely satisfied with the work.
1,"I want the Garage to do well. It is still a work in progress, though. Three of us visited two weeks ago. We were sat right next to a group of 40 - 55 year old ladies out for a surprise birthday. What's with that anyways. Do you really need to go to a somewhat small restaurant with your pack of ""girls,"" and occupy a large swath of the dining area? Do you need all the paraphernalia (collages, centerpieces, hats)? I was seriously waiting to see a youngish birthday girl. Nope, she was the oldest. 60, easy. Act your age. While you're at it, you are not a size six anymore. Needless to say, it was loud. At least one of the revelers apologized right when we sat. As if that's any conciliation for the volume 11 cackling. First off, the Garage has good brewskis. Not a huge supply, but what they have is quality. We had wings and truffle oil deviled eggs. Both were great. I had Schriner's Sausage Flat bread, and it was great. Wife had something, I forget, and said it was good. Friend had some large salad and said it was good, too. Overall, food was better than most. So, why the three stars you ask? Service. Why do some cool places slip up on this? Is it because they hire ""cool people"" or friends that don't really want to work? First off, a server (we were seated at the entrance/ exit to the kitchen) dropped a glass bottle of ketchup five feet from my foot. My wife and I had splatter on our jeans and glass near our sandal clad feet. Hardly a response. We were handed a rag. Our server not so sympathetically wondered, ""Oh, they almost dropped a bottle of ketchup on you."" The rest of the night just seemed a little disorganized and not relaxing? Every server seemed in the weeds or confused. Empty beer and water glasses. Entrees arrived and empty app plates sat there. $60 for three for apps, dinner and beers."
1,Since the Gilbert location has closed. The Tempe location has had more things to offer. The staff has really stepped it up on customer service. They do there best on helping you find whatever it is your looking for.
1,"I have lived by Wally's for years and I finally hit it up the other day ravenous for some yummy food. I expect great things from a restaurant near AJ's and the Arcadia crowd was definitely representing but I was still a tad skeptical. We started with the calamari which was lightly battered and not like chewing on a tire. So far - I was pleased. I then ordered the pesto caprese pasta which was soooo good. I'm not big on Italian food but I've always raved about it to like five people since I went two days ago. I'll go back and order the same thing - I'm so boring. Lots of other yummy dishes are served at Wally's such as burgers, other pasta dishes, salads that looked so good, soups, and they have daily specials like pork chops which that night came with a salad, some sides and dessert. They also have a good happy hour. I believe she said all apps were $6 and beers were $4. Wally - I'm not keen on your restaurant name but I dig your food so I will be back! The staff is really attentive (not in a 5 sec filling up water way either) and really nice like we've all been pub buddies once upon a time. Perhaps we were... cheers!"
1,Enjoyed date night here with the hubby. Try the gluten free pizza. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Mmmmmmm
1,Just tried this place this afternoon. Very friendly staff & great rates with no commitments. You don't need to worry about paying some $25-$40 co pay like at a regular Chiropractic's office each time you visit. It's $49 a month and you get four visits a month. It's not like massage envy where you have to sign a contract for a year and its hard to quit. This goes month to month. Try it out once for $19 if you want. This company is really growing. So stop by and see for yourself!!
1,"Five of us enjoyed a casual and wonderful dinner at Blue Adobe. The fresh chips and dark salsa were very good - it took a lot of willpower to stop munching the chips and salsa before our meals arrived. I ordered the chicken chorizo which was accompanied by twice-baked potatoes served in a jalapeno pepper half - unique and zesty - as well as grilled vegetable strips. All five of us truly enjoyed our meals. The atmosphere was comfortable and casual. Our server, Ashley, was excellent. I would definitely recommend Blue Adobe if you are in the Scottsdale area."
1,"I really like this place! Plenty of room, very organized. And is willing to help you out. Price is very acceptable @ $7.00 a day. They have ear plugs, targets and beverages to purchase at a reasonable price. If it's your first time there is a 10 min video they want you to watch. It's diffidently a great place to go, just have to watch out for dumb A$$ like myself. I tend to have a major brain freeze. But the workers there are nice enough to let me know what I did wrong in a polite way. Give me time! I promise I won't shoot anyone! I'll get better."
1,"I am a G-Spot addict! Had to limit myself from going every week though. Took the hubby there after a date night the other weekend. It was his first time to try gelato. He's a ColdStone guy 100% and he really enjoyed the Tiramisu gelato! The focaccia flatbread is awesome!!! And I would post a photo of the Focaccia Flatbread I got earlier to eat along with my homemade salad, but (in the words of LOLCat) ""I eated it"" and forgot to take a photo first. :) My favorite salad dressing is the champagne vinegarette! The mintchip gelato is freaking awesome! The stracciatella gelato mixed with mint - even better!!! G-Spot is so awesome, that I just walked back over and got my Mint / Stracciatella combo. Baby C wanted something sweet! :D"
1,"I have been here for breakfast twice. Both times the food was very good (love the biscuits and gravy!). It is a bit of an older building and everything looks a bit run down. Service has not been phenomenal. Last time we arrived the host person had just left to seat the couple that walked in before us. The manager and FOUR additional servers were standing at the cash register chatting. As the entry way is small..I could hear their conversation. It was just chit chat...not a meeting, nothing important....but apparently not one of them could see fit to either acknowledge our existence or walk us to one of the many open tables. After a few minutes the host came back and took us to our table. I assumed the manager just felt that taking a group to their table (or asking one of the wait staff to do it) was beneath her. But then as soon as we were taken away, she promptly seated the family that walked in behind us. Grrrrr... I enjoy the food, the portions are large. The food is very heavy comfort food. Service is so-so and the manager does not seem to care about her customers. If not for the service I would give them a 4."
1,"When I moved away, these were the tacos that I missed! I stopped back today, and must say - it was exactly how I remembered! The lunch specials are very reasonably priced at $5.99 and come with two items and rice and beans. I always get the hard taco - seasoned shredded beef, lettuce, and cheese in a deep fried corn tortilla - and the cheese enchilada. I could eat the rice and beans alone, both are so well seasoned and they definitely don't skimp on the cheese! The only thing to watch is that the red hot sauce can vary from visit to visit - some days it's super hot, others - not so much. The wait staff is exceptionally friendly and always try to help me because my Spanish is so limited. The interior is large but very modest, there aren't a lot of fancy decorations - this is a place to come for the food and service and not th ambiance. Still, one of my faves!"
1,"Probably the best mall I've ever been to. Anchored by five mega stores - Nordstrom, Nieman Marcus, Macy's, Dillards and Barneys New York. It's so big, it took a couple of hours just to walk it. My wife called it the best mall she's ever been too. Nuff said."
1,"Both of the previous reviewers are correct, actually. Yes, there can be a line to the door at times, and not everyone working there is 100% nice 100% of the time. But who is? And, once you get to know them -- and are courageous enough to give them the benefit of the doubt -- everyone working there is very cool to deal with. Because this Post Office is tucked way back in the Foothills, it's not staffed as heavily as I've seen some others. But the remoteness of the location also means you get to breeze in and out on rare occasions too (seeing as this is too far out of the way for any non-Foothills residents). So, do like me: never go here in a hurry; be polite; be patient (it's not all about you). And you'll see this is really no worse than any other Post Office...and maybe even a little bit better."
0,"I went here on a pub crawl after being turned away from an overcrowed Majerles during one of the Cardinal's game. I was surprised to find the place nearly empty when just down the road Majerles had people falling out the door, but after ordering a few round of drinks I soon found out why the place was empty. The bar tender and manager were annoyed by the size of our group. When most empty bars would probably embrace 25 people walking in the door wanting to order drinks, the Stoudemire's staff seemed overwhelmed and annoyed. The restaurant is nice and clean, and the drinks were good yet overpriced. I would defnitely not reccomend it for large groups. For people looking for a good sports bar downtown head to Majerles because the patrons there seemed to be enjoying themselves and the staff seemed to enjoy having business."
1,"True Food Kitchen claims to not be a health-food restaurant, rather a place for great food that just so happens to be healthy. Whatever you want to call it, when you sit down, you'll be handed a card explaining nutrition guru Dr. Andrew Weil's food philosophies and explaining their ingredients and food items until you no longer have an appetite. However, give this place a chance - it's not all about health at the sacrifice of flavor. The decor perfectly highlights the culinary concept, with clean, modern lines, big open windows, and LOTS of green. Andrew's Elixir, one of their refresher drinks, was delightful. The best food item we had was the caramelized onion tart appetizer, with gorgonzola cheese, black figs, and caramelized onions on a crispy flat crust. It was the perfect balance of the sweet mild onions and sweet figs with savory cheese and light, crispy crust. Our server said this is the same crust as their pizzas, so next time I'd like to try those. Next, we had the edamame dumplings, which is basically steamed won tons filled with pureed edamame in a light miso broth. These were good, not great. For our entree, we ordered the black cod, but we had to send it back because it was so fishy (and undercooked). When I asked the server if the fish is fresh or fresh-frozen, he said, ""Well, they're all fresh-frozen."" Their fish entrees are $22, which seems inexpensive, but they're fairly small portions. For that kind of price in this type of restaurant, I would expect fresh fish. Perhaps the fresh-frozen fish is a cost-cutting measure in what seems to be the increasingly corporate Sam Fox empire. We went with the salmon instead, which was also undercooked but far less fishy. The roasted apples and pureed celery root were lovely, but the dish as a whole was a little overpowered by the mustard sauce, and the accompanying vegetables were weird. Prices overall are very reasonable, especially if you stick with appetizers, salads, pizzas, and sandwiches. True Food aims for the lofty goal of making great cuisine that just so happens to be extremely healthy, and occasionally misses the mark, but I give them credit for bringing Dr. Andrew Weil's philosophies on the importance of nutrition for the body and mind to the mainstream."
0,"This is one of the franchise store of Ritz Camera in Chandler. The store's staffs are nice, however, their photo lab is miss leading. They make the price in very small fonts and hanging on the ceiling. For the first time user to print photos in the lab, I was charged for $45 for just few 4x6 and 8x10 print without sign-in as member. I asked for canceling order prior they print the photos. I was told ""Too late"" even it's still in one of their store pc for ordering prints. Since they are franchise, I should be able to return or exchange the accessories I bought for my Nikon D70S camera in different store. I was told ""No"". I can only exchange or return to the stores I purchase them. I will not buy anything from them again."
1,"Not super impressed. The food was just ok. My friends said the French toast was good, but my Goat cheese, tomato and mushroom omelette had maybe had an oz. of goat cheese. At 9$ it was a rip off. The potatoes were good,but nothing special. The mimosa was excellent, but made from Andre, so after consuming it I had a headache. The service was slow, but they were good about refilling my coffee and water. Just an ok experience."
1,"The sign also bills itself as 'Santa Fe style' food. Having lived many years in New Mexico, with a family - generations of which are from New Mexico - the cuisine was decidely not New Mexican. It was standard Sonoran. With that said, the meal was quite enjoyable. The enchilada sauce had a nice flavor. The dulce de leche was fantastic. The service was very good. The decor was a little non-descript, but that's OK, All in all, a nice addition to the meager choices for Mexican food in Surprise. We would probably come back. I had to give it 3-stars because of what it is not. If you are looking for Spanish food - there is none here. If you are looking for New Mexican style-cuisine, you won't find it either. However, if you are looking for a decent, enjoyable meal at a local family-owned establishment, this is a good choice."
0,This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the service went way down hill. The new owners hire lots of college students with tattoos everywhere as well as lots of piercings. Seems like tattoos and too many piercings are a job requirement along with disrespect and a lack of desire. The staff is what made this place the worst restaurant ever and doesnt seem to matter how often you let management know I just dont think they care. Also in the past few years there is a growing number of homeless that sit out front begging for money. They sit so close to the outside patio that you have them dining with you or at least it feels that way making you incredibly uncomfortable. Our last visit we sat on the patio which was next to a bench just outside the restaurant where a few homeless were stationed. One girl had a huge rat on her shoulder and it was beyond disgusting. Management obviously doesnt care and does nothing to improve anything so we go way out of our way now to eat at the other Greek in Chandler at Chandler Mall.
1,R.T. O'Sullivan's really hit the spot! The service and the atmosphere were outstanding. We were put into the back room which was perfect for our large group of 45 plus. The server kept track of everything even as people moved around and socialized. The food was wonderful. We will be going back!
0,"So when you walk in, walk to the right and have the machine scan your card. I'm telling you this because I looked like a douchebag because I assumed that the Bally worker would scan my card. Oh yeah, you'll smell urine. Like, did someone just go crazy and piss all over the place? Seriously, how does a smell get so horrendous like that? What is that? There are a lot of treadmills and they're recent...not new...they look overused...but yeah. I'm sensitive to smell... I couldn't even exercise."
1,"My partner and I went on a Living Social coupon, and we really enjoyed it. She had the Fish Tacos and I had the Chicken Tacos. Both of us felt that the salsa on the table was too spicy. With so many reviews here and other places about the ""too hot"" salsa, you'd think they'd cut it back a bit. Anyway, that was the only thing we didn't like. The homemade chips were fantastic. The service was on the ball and the food was fresh. As an aside,I don't know why they opened at Esplanade. Management there is supposed to be terrible and there are rumors that the theater will be closing. Houstons has already moved out, Pizza Picazzo closed. But Fuego Tacos is a great addition to the neighborhood. Let's hope that this merchant and others who remain at Esplanade can convince management to take care of the evil smells coming out of the septic and fix the elevators when they break every week. This restaurant deserves a community that will support and nourish it. Good job Fuego Tacos."
1,"The food is EXCELLENT! We have been 5 times now, and everything we have had has been delicious! We will continue to dine w Bill and IL Bosco! The Caprese is AWESOME!"
1,"Bar Smith has potential to be a chic hot spot in the heart of downtown; just a few steps away from the symphony hall, Chase Field, and the US airways Arena. However, this place, despite it's pseudo-hipness fails to deliver in the cocktail department, which, with it's continuously crappy music, would be the only real reason you'd come to this bar. It's really a 2.5 star place-- bartenders are nice,but don't really get the job done. When you're paying over $8/drink, you'd at least expect them to do that. The roof is cool though so an extra .5 stars for that."
1,"Pretty good food. Super friendly service. Very clean. First time I have had duck at a buffet and it was pretty good, just not the crispy skin. Lot of seafood items. They kept things well stocked and didn't just dump the new stuff into the old (a health code violation) They pulled the old pan out and put the new one in. We will definitely be back."
1,Some hits and some misses. Hits : bruschetta and salads Misses: Pizzas other then the margherita (luckily though I got the scrumptious tomato and mozzarella pizza) Great service and pretty good food.
1,"I stop here every Monday night and negate two hours of spinning and yoga by indulging in Mexican comfort food. My wife swears by the carne asado tacos; the cheese enchiladas ring my bell. Although I phone in my order, the parking lot is always an adventure. However, the one night a young Hispanic girl celebrating her birthday in the restaurant's limited outdoor sitting area insisted I come over for a glass of milk and slice of her cake negated all the encounters with strange transients."
1,"Good salad options. It is definitely tough to mess up lettuce and veggies. As for the rest of the selection, we must have just come on a bad night. The pasta was overcooked and mushy, not even close to al dente. Fresh fruit selection consisted of only 3 fruits, not exactly a vast selection. If you want a good salad, definitely the place to go."
1,"This place was unique for me because everyone seemed like they were inside smoking but it was an indoor outdoorish place. There were heated lights and it was the only place that I found pretty crowded where if you walked the streets there weren't a lot of people. The food was good, I had the steak fajita, which you can't go wrong because its just steak. But I also had a fish taco which was pretty good. My boyfriend had the pick three meal, so he picked tacos, chimichanga, and enchilada. His choice was good and the chimichanga was delish. The bathrooms were very rustic looking but it seemed to look that way, decent for a funky place like that. They had live music Friday night, where a guy was doing bad covers on a few good songs. The waitstaff was overall nice and they checked back at us here and there. Overall I'd go back if I was in around Scottsdale again!"
1,"I enjoyed seeing the Cezanne collection. It's just like pictured in the book. I spent time reading about his works and his influence on composition and form. As in other museum I've visited, one really can't take pictures of their best display. It's really a place to walk around for a couple of hours when one doesn't feel rush. I wanted to be surprise to see Classical sculptures and hand made works of art and I didn't see any here as, I'm very particular about the historical eras and movement of interest . Leave that to the big city museums. The fact that they have high end borrowed art and a place like this in Phoenix makes it a must for resident to see once in a while what the civic offering provides. This place is half a block off the light rail makes it convenient."
1,"This is definitely the best place for breakfast in Wickenburg. Loved all the cowboy decorations, photos of actors from the early Westerns days, and the ""cuckoo"" clock which didn't cuckoo but instead whinnied like a horse. Clean premises, very friendly staff, excellent service, and breakfast for the group came out in due time. Call ahead for groups of more than 4, as most of the booths are small."
1,"Had lunch here today after hearing all the colossal raves about it. However, once I walked in, I realized that any semblance of having an authentic Chinese meal went out the window (no offense, my hungry white friends!). I decided to try it out anyway, was seated by a friendly waiter and ordered the hot & sour soup (they were able to sub in chicken instead of pork - bonus) and the waiter recommended the house chicken to me. I asked for it to be made really spicy, knowing full well it wasn't going to be (no one EVER listens to me when I demand the food be spicy - listen, dammit, I'm brown, people). Anyway, that's my issue. The hot & sour soup arrived, and it was excellent. I was happy. Nothing mars a Chinese meal more than beginning it with a bowl of shiteous soup. Then came the house chicken (with string beans added for $1). Steamed rice costs another extra buck - I get annoyed when Chinese restaurants don't make it complimentary, but again, my issue. Anyway, the chicken was just ok. Nothing amazing and it still ended up feeling pretty heavy. So that dish I'm more willing to give it 2.5 stars. So why did I bump up the star wattage? I guess the service. The waiter: * noticed I wasn't devouring my dish and offered to switch it for any other dish of my choice, no extra charge. Who does this nowadays - in a Chinese restaurant no less? Extra star. * is from the SF Bay Area like myself, so he gave me the lowdown for good Asian food in Phoenix (for dimsum he recommended Golden Buddha first, Great Wall second, C-Fu third - then for Vietnamese he recommended some place on 19th Ave between Indian School & Camelback.) He agreed that Thai, Korean, and sushi in Phoenix is kind of a letdown compared to California, but almost all the Asian restaurants (he admitted, including China Chili) cater to their core customers, who by sheer demographics are pretty much not Asian. That said, he told me that China Chili is THE place people go to for Chinese food, including Chris Bianco (of Pizzeria Bianco), the mayor, folks from Channel 10 news, the owner of the Diamondbacks, etc. etc. So take that for what you will. * When I asked if this China Chili was affiliated with...""oh, the one in Fremont? No. But people say that place is good and fancy and has an electric piano."" Bonus points for knowing that. Anyway, he recommended I come back and get the Mongolian beef next time, which I'll definitely do, plus the hot & sour soup. I didn't mind the big open seating area - many Chinese restaurants in SF are like this, loud and raucous. All in all, China Chili is a case where service overcame the food (again, how often does that happen?) to come back and give it another shot. And there you have it."
1,"A most unexpected gem! If you are a wine drinker, fabulous flights! Great selection! I can't say much more other than... AWESOME!"
0,After moving back to the area from Cali I needed somewhere to get my acrylics done. I usually like to get some kind of design or unique tips. After walking in I saw some tips I liked so I decided to try out this place. The first visit was bad the nail tech would not listen to the length of nails I was requesting and did a terrible job at shaping them. I always give people more than one chance so I went back and this time I got a pedicure first then the nail tech left the salon and I sat near the dryer for 45 min before approaching the manager about the length of time I had been waiting for a fill. He replied unapologetically that the tech had to leave to pick up her son from school... I sat another 15 min before I was seen by someone else. They also did a poor job. I will not spend my money somewhere that they do not value their customers. Not to mention they did a crap job and were overpriced when it came to designs and tips with prints on them. Don't waste your time here.
1,"Been going to Pita since they were a take out only in Tempe. Fast forward 15 + years. They are getting too big for their britches. They started franchising, hired some corporate goons and that is where it started to fall off. The chicken has always been great but is faltering. There was never any better hummus on on the planet until they added all the red oil? Be very careful of seafood. I love the seafood dishes here, absolutely fantastic, but they have made me ill on more than one occasion. I was even hospitalized once from the shell fish. I have some good friends that are still managers so I go back occasionally to see them. They are not as thrilled either. Too bad. All good things come to an end. This was the best unknown gem in Arizona for years. UPDATE. No more red oil! Pretty solid but not what it used to be. Lentil salad still kicks butt."
1,"Great place for all your favorite kinds of Asian food. Wonderful service...it's a big place and they were busy, but since someone in our group was in a hurry to get to a flight they still managed to hurry things along. Overall good food and huge portions. The Happy Hour specials are great, too, so be sure to come during that time."
1,"part of a social event, we only had app's here. quite delicious crab cakes and a shrimp fritters with mango sauce. the portions were gigantic and actually big enough for a meal. i was slightly full afterwards. part of the roaring fork, wildfish franchise, they also offer a great happy hour. seems a bit high priced but our bill was taken care of, so i'd save this (for the middle class foodie) for a special event."
1,Pasand is under new ownership and the changes already seem good. I went there today expecting the same old stuff. What I got was some truely excellent tasting food. The food was leaps and bounds above the previous food. The spices were much more distinct and flavorful and especially fresh. In talking with the owners they were going to rennovate the run downinside and add some more buffet places. Overall I approve of what has been down to the place especially the food.
1,"This place is what Desert Ridge wishes it was! Its great for groceries (Wal-Mart), bargain hunting (TJ Maxx), fast food or dining in (tons of places!), catching a movie (Harkins), stocking up the wine shelf (BevMo), new panties (Vicky's Secret) and a zillion other things. I love that this is close to my house! The only thing that would make it better is a Costco or Sam's Club."
1,"Had a team dinner here 2 weeks ago. The food was decent and since it's the closest Thai restaurant to me, very convenient. Appetizers: Angel wings-- fried chicken drumsticks stuffed with noodles and spices. Fried tofu -- just exactly like it sounds, crispy fried tofu served with a sweet fish sauce dip. Tom kha soup-- spicy lemongrass broth with mushrooms, chicken, and carrots. Mains: eggplant dish with chicken-- okay, served with a basic brown sauce. Pad thai-- too sweet and saucy for my taste. Panang curry-- I enjoyed this but we ordered this with chicken and I personally think it tastes better with beef."
1,"I love the story time program here! I started coming this summer after having a baby and wanting to get my toddler out of the house while beating the heat. The staff here is amazing! It is a 30 minute session of singing, dancing, stories and bubbles. We look forward to this every week now. My daughter loves the take home cut out and coloring sheet. The first thing she does is come home and color it. I am so thankful for this free program."
1,"omg... I love this place the food is great, the selection is great, the staff is very helpful. This is a great place to go have a few drinks and great stir fry."
1,As much as you don't want to like Wally World...it is what it is...crazy!!
0,"I really like this concept for a quick breakfast/brunch spot, but the execution wasn't too delicious. If you know me well enough, you'll know my first thought when we walked in was ""is there booze???"" The answer is yes. I recall seeing your typical breakfast bevies such as mimosas, bellinis, bloody mary's, etc. So you go in, scope out the menu, order at the counter, and they bring you your meal and beverages. I ordered a simple eggs, potatoes, toast and sausage breakfast, and my friend had an omelette. We had just had brunch at Maizie's the day prior and our first impression was disappointment in the portions of the food, considering the prices were also comparable. Oddly, my sausage, potatoes and sunny side eggs had the same consistency, so that was off for me. They were all a bit soft and soggy. We, of course, enjoyed the mimosa and bellini, but $5 each is a bit high considering they're $3 @ at other places, and Cafe Boa down the block offers unlimited mimosas for a fixed fee with food. I thought the location was great, and the Sunday brunch crowd was nice. I'm not sure what it will be like when the students come back, but I don't think I would be back to find out."
1,"This is our favorite breakfast place. The food is good. They have the best biscuits & gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at. The wait staff is friendly. The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed, so there can be a wait to be seated."
1,"Thai food is one of my favorite types of cuisines. I have been going to Thai Rama for over 5 years now, and they are always consistent! this place is a little, hole in the wall type. (those are usually the best) Whenever I am having a thai fix I usually order the same items. Sometimes different... But not always. OK.. 1. Thai tea... the best in the valley! 2. Pad thai with chicken... level 5 - 5 is usually med spice but to some ppl its very spicy... you can always lower the number to a 1 or 2 and it'll still be just as good. 3. Yellow pork or chicken coconut curry with potatoes, onions, carrots, & pineapple.... level 5 again.... my fave 4. There's one more beef dish that is absolutely delish! But, I forgot the name. Basically all it is, is thick rice noodles and thinly sliced beef stir fried.. Kind of like a chow fun but better! Oh and I would also like to add that they have a very friendly waitstaff and pretty good service. If you like Thai, check this place out!!!"
1,"I got the chicken burger today, it is pretty good. Grilled, juicy, and cooked just right. The fries are always hot and crispy. The wait for the food took a little longer than normal, but I know they are very busy. Bummer our service this time was a totally miss. At first she was great, check came took our drink order and food at the same time (we were ready). She checked on us after our food arrived and we ever saw her again until the bill. We both were so thirsty, NO REFILLS. She offered us later that she can bring our refills in a to go cup. That is great, but I would have liked a drink with my food instead of choking it down."
1,"I don't know why I waited so long to visit Yogurtology; it's located conveniently next to my Safeway. Why did i wait so long?! Yogurtology has perfected self-serve froyo. The flavors are spot-on...lemon meringue, birthday cake, NSA coffee, peach mango tart, cheesecake, mango, rootbeer...the list goes on...I always end up getting oatmeal cookie. It's made in-house with real oatmeal cookies. We're talking oatmeal cookie literally IN the froyo, none of that artificial flavor crap. It is incredible. Instead of having little placards for the flavors, there are digital Sony TV screens that describe each flavor and a brief nutritional run-down. Very high-tech! The selection of toppings is unparalleled--baklava, three different kinds of twix and milky way, brownie, chocolate chip cookie bar, chocolate covered waffle cone, premium fruit and nuts...anything you can imagine, Yogurtology has it. Not only that, but the shop is impeccably clean, and the staff are consistently cheerful. This place blows Yogurtland and Yogurtopia AND all other Yogurtology locations out of the water!!! This is where you want to go."
1,"If I could there would be two reviews here. The golf course its self would be an easy 4 star based on price and condition. Customer service would be a 1 star. Don't bother trying to be friendly with the pro shop staff, these folks are just going to through the motions of taking your money and doing the least possible to get their paycheck. But since the golf is such a great value and people will continue to flock to this place in droves I don't see them needing to hire people with personalities any time in the near future. The front 9 cart girl is friendly as is the lady working the snack shack on the back. Another thing that didn't impress me was being a walk on, renting a cart and being told that they already had 2 carts in that group. I am used to being able to have my own cart instead of riding with a person I don' t know and being subjected to their cart skills or lack there of. Turned out okay but just struck me as odd. I will continue to go back for the great value but I hate to reward bad behavior."
1,"Oh god. It's like GOD'S VERY OWN HOT POCKET. Fresh, delicious, and cooked perfectly, though I have trouble bringing myself to get anything but The Pilgrim (served with turkey, cubed sweet potatoes, onions, and deliciousness). Cornish Pasty is great, though you'll likely want to consider takeout: it's TINY and finding a table can be a real pain. The staff is fun and helpful, even though they're quite harried, and the oven-roasted potatoes are fantastic, as are nearly all of the pasty options, all priced damn well, to boot. If you've never been, they'll almost certainly have something you like. My only problem is that nothing is customizable: they're all served as is, which I understand from a production standpoint, but which frustrates for the number of menu items with just one dealbreaking ingredient for me. Overall, it's exceedingly easy to be a regular, and to feel VERY full, careful not to eat the crimped part of the pasty, just like the tin miners of yore so as to avoid the traces of arsenic from their dirty hands."
1,"Dammit - I have been here a dozen times and it's been so ""mixed""... The best of times, and the worst of times... though the last two times (for late night drinking with friends) have been pretty fun... Drinks are cheap and the crowd is ""lively"". So, for now, I will suggest Dos Gringos to the college drunkard and/or professional drinker after 9pm. Bring some friends!"
1,"This is one of Scottsdale's new hot spots. If you like the 'Scottsdale' scene, this place is a must. Sunday the music goes off as Thomas James spins sic house beats and the bar serves up $2 tacos. On the weekends, it is still the hot new local spot so it is always busy. Fun place to go and usually there is great eye candy."
1,"By far the best poker room in the state and I have played in every casino poker room in the valley. The action is always there-lots of dead money to be picked up if you know where to look. Good promotions, amazing food served table side and all the sports games you can watch. I wish they would bring back 6-12 limit but 8-16 will have to do =) such an improvement over the tents, though they will always hold a place in my heart. It sucks cause I work right next to the casino and every night after work I have a tough decision..go home to my family or go to my favorite card room and tear it up. If you havent been there-MUST GO."
1,"If you own a car that is older and you want it to look and smell new - this is the place. Our 3 year old truck looks brand spanking new after these guys got done with it. We also had them tint it and it turned out amazing ... again ... I say again because this is the second vehicle I have taken to them. That is the main reason I went back - I could not believe how good both my vehicles turned out. I had the window tint on the other one for about 3 years before I sold it and still to the day I sold it ... the tint was perfect. They use only the top quality film, and do quality work. I will keep going back and sing their praises all day long! If you are looking for a detail job, or window tint, this is the ONLY place you should be looking! Check out some pictures I took of my vehicles after they got done.."
1,"Not much to write here. I always park on the Sears (upper level) side when I visit Chandler mall. My last visit to the mall, I ended up buying a luggage set on sale at Sears. The cashier was helpful and even checked to see if all four pieces were present (I didn't even think to, LOL). Four stars. No negative feedback to report."
1,"Brought my car here b/c of the reviews I read on yelp. My fan was running excessively. The mechanic came and looked at my car. The coolant was low. He grabbed a can and filled it up. No charge. I then told him I needed new struts. He quoted me a price that was cheaper than the one quoted to me in CO a few months ago. I honestly didn't shop around for a cheaper price here in Phoenix, which is unlike me. The reviews here, and fixing my fan problem at no charge had me sold. It seems so rare to find an honest mechanic now-a-days, especially in this economy. Made an appt. Car was finished super quick, in the time frame that was promised. The mechanic went out of his way to show me the damage struts he replaced, then told me my new struts came with a lifetime warranty. Dang, did I time warp back into the 50s? Hopefully I won't have a need to go back, but if I do, I'd gladly drive out of my way one hour round trip for their honesty again."
1,"They have the friendliest staff at this Whole Foods. They know me by name and always have samples ready for the little boy I nanny before we even walk up to the Deli counter. Maureen the checker, Kathy in vitamins, and Daniel & Paula in the Deli are all exceptional- go see them if you need anything they will be happy to help."
1,"It was a little expensive. $65.80 for two apps, one drink, two sodas, two entrees, and one shared dessert. Highlights: The Grilled Wings were very good. Nice and crisp, charred but not burned, and not too fatty. I could have eaten two dozen of them. The Cheddar Potatoes were a hit at the table, liked by all. The Creme Brulee was excellent, and about twice the size that Torched Goodness offers, for 5 cents less than TG charges. Lowlights: The hummus was just plain, and there was something else they put on top of it, something a little bitter - ?? Not sure what it was, but it was not impressive. The ""half rack"" of ribs were pretty tiny for $14.95. Not a lot of meat. The Flatiron Steak was also tiny, and overcooked. Not very tasty at all. Mashed potatoes and Mac-N-Cheese were very pedestrian. All in all, I might go back, have 2 orders of the wings app, and finish with Creme Brulee. But I won't go with the kids again, not for $75 with tip. We could have eaten 3 times at Los Taquitos for that price."
0,"Our fearless Critical Mass organizer arranged with Cycle for us to end our May ride at that establishment. I was excited, because Cycle purports to be a pro-bicycle bar/restaurant. We rolled up, all excited. There were ample bike racks for our nearly 100 riders. However, when we entered the hotel, we were brusquely directed to the bar entrance. Having been to the restaurant before, I wandered out to check the dining room. I was immediately turned back at the entrance and told the dining room was ""reservations only."" Well, the bar has maybe 5 tables, and there were nearly 100 riders. People who have just completed a 10-mile+ bike ride want to eat, drink, and be seated, not stand 5 deep in a bar line and then stand around holding their drinks. We were not even sure we'd be able to order food. We left almost immediately and went across the street to Portlands. Right after we'd ordered, we saw another group of bikers headed to Carly's. It's not like Cycle didn't know we were coming. If you know 100 people are coming to your venue, don't you think you'd prepare to welcome them and encourage them to spend freely? Lame."
1,Sometimes you just gotta have a burger. I was in the Scottsdale Rd/Grayhawk area and noticed this place where Nick's used to be. I tasted their burger at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival's Burger Battle and thought it was really good. The CB&CB burger with tater tots really hit the spot for lunch. The burger and carmelized onions worked together really well. The tater tots were delicious. Overall it was a satisfying meal and I'll be back soon.
1,"Thanks to Amy D. for also introducing me to this quaint joint. The smell of home cooking lured me in, Great menu selections with sandwiches salads and hot dishes too, along with the daily specials which I think is one of each (sandwich , salad, hot meal). Sandwiches come with fresh potato chips and a pickle spear, I decided to try the Tuna since they don't put onions in it ,Hallelujah!(see pics) You know what it was pretty tasty, I even ate all my chips and the pickle! My only complaint was the bread was a tad dry, but hey it happens. Tucked into a commercial business park I never would have found this on my own, but I have fantasized about going back next time I'm in the area, Maybe Amy D. will take me out to lunch again :)"
1,"DECEMBER 2012:They still have the ANGRY WHOPPER!!!!! Best whopper EVER. Mine goes no lettuce, heavy onion, heavy tomato, and BBQ sauce on the bottom bun. It's THICK. 55 year anniversary --- second whopper 55 cents! DEAL!!! Really, have you ever had a BAD whopper? :)"
0,"I just moved to the area so use Yelp but was very sad that the experience here was not worth making a return visit. The only reason I am posting is because it has not been reviewed in so long. I did not like how the spa pedicure was one price and then things you would expect in a spa pedicure was ""upgrades"". I want to ask for a pedicure and then lay back enjoy the chair and some reading. After the pedicure, the woman left me in the chair for my nails to dry and think she completely forgot about me! I would have left if she had put my flip flops on before painting my nails. Their child was cute, but I do not go to get a pedicure to play games with other peoples children. Then to top it off, when I paid she asked for my pin as she was walking away (again)....no pin, it was a credit card....usually this would not bother me but I was already frustrated at this point."
1,"It's rare that I have a date with my husband on a Monday afternoon/evening, but this past Memorial Day, we did just that. After a quick visit to the Science Center (the Van Gogh alive exhibit is a must-see by the way), we were hungry so we headed over to Rice Paper. Neither of us had ever been before, and we were pleased with our experience. It was a tad bit too hot to sit outside, although they do have a covered patio with misters. We walked in and were seated and greeted promptly by Al, our server. He's quite the character. He made us laugh quite a bit in addition to being attentive and making some recommendations. We enjoyed the stylish renovated house / hip colorful atmosphere as well. We ended up ordering a few things and sharing. Highlights included the firecracker shrimp. a spider roll, a shrimp roll, and a zen salad. Everything was light and tasted fresh. We really enjoyed the dipping sauces that came with the spring rolls. They've got such a huge selection of the spring rolls, that I can't wait to return to try some of the others. They don't have a huge selection of Vietnamese entrees, but it appears that they will custom create a bit upon request. I highly recommend going for the ""food happy hour."" It's from 3pm - 6:30pm and includes $6 appetizers & $1 off all spring rolls. Such a deal! We didn't take advantage of it, but the ""drinks happy hour"" is actually 11am - 6:30pm and specialty drinks are $6, house wine by the glass is $5, well drinks are $4, and draft beer is just $2.75. If only Rice Paper was a tad bit closer to home, I could see myself being a regular... Instead, I'll keep it high on my list of spots to return to when I find myself heading downtown!"
1,"Dilemma: where the heck to find a nice place to eat near AZ Fairgrounds/Grand? (Shiverrrrrrrrrrrrr) Promblem solved! Found the answer @ Fez! Candace was super speedy, always had a smile, and returned to our table about a dzn times in the 90 mins we were here. Gazpacheo & Grilled Crustini was OMG good! (problem was it only came with 3 tiny pieces of bread, had to ask for more, got few pieces of pita, still had 1/2 left bowl of gazpacheo, asked for more bread - cuz like what the heck are you going to do with a bowl of dip otherwise? and they charged us for the extra bread? x 2 ? not cool). Cheese & Garlic Fondue was pretty good. So was the Chicken Strips. Really good drink specials (unfortunately, had none as their specialties are mostly tequila based - not for me! nor am I a beer drinker, and I did not like their house wine). But I did have a nice bottle of Sav. Blanc from New Zealand. Anyhow, this fit the bill at having fabby Nom~Noms before heading over to the Coliseum (~ick~) at the Fairgrounds to see the Roller Derby Girls - Whoop~ Whoop!"
1,"I love this store! very underwhelming, which i love being able to get in/ get out... their produce prices, and chili prices are amazing! The staff is funny and awesome. the music makes me dance in the isles LOL. literally. they also give you free marinade with any meat purchase which is way cool. I don't like their prices on bread, cake mixes, and things like that, but their produce more than makes up for that, prices are awesome, and its absolutely fabulous and fresh. Ronney"
0,Not only was the music the worst I have ever heard the wait staff was as annoying as ever! Like a wanna be swanky place in a strip mall that smells like fish and plays horrible music. Food was so so but over priced for what it was.
1,"O.K. , I actually like this theatre, why ? well because it is usually never crowded. Things are a little old and outdated, but I hate waiting in line, so this works well for me ."
1,"Pretty nice for an airport bar. Just had a bloody mary, but the food looked good."
1,"Cozy place, great amounts of food for little money, they serve koolaide!!!! Its all great I loved it both times so far, once in 2003 when I went to review it for the school newspaper, and again 8 years later when I drove by it and the nostalgia made me try it again with the fiance"
1,"Open 24 hours on week-ends, ample seating area (good for studying or hanging out and chatting), very welcoming clientele, and broad selection of coffee drinks, non-coffee drinks, and desserts, fruits, and random snacks. The coffee isn't great but not terrible either. The Wi-Fi, while free, is fickle. One of my two favourite coffee places in Tempe (other is Cartel off University & Ash)."
1,best. grilled. cheese. and. tomato. soup. ever.
1,"I like F&E. There are some good things in there, but it's kind of like you have to play by its own rules. If you walk in with one specific item on your list, (Examples: pico de gallo. Not that uncommon, right? How about good hamburger buns? Only one kind? Really?) chances are you might not find it. But, you will be tempted by the premade meals and delightful snacks. Fresh chicken salad? I didn't know I wanted that when I walked in, but now I have it. Don't come here if you have a strict list that you need to shop for or if you're seeking hard-to-find items. Come here with a friend late on a sunday night when you need ideas to make meals for the rest of the week. The store is indeed freezing cold and kind of has that sterile hospital feeling. Lots of really bright lights and WHITE everywhere. The 50% off stuff is great. I got a big package of fettuccine for a dollar. Their prices are a bit odd, though. $0.99 for a pack of four bratwurst, and $2.50 for a can of generic tuna? Well, alright. I'll be back! But now I know under what circumstances to shop here. Highlight: This location seems to be run by a rather sassy nun."
1,"This Dunkin Donuts is hit or miss. When i run in here for just coffee, the service is usually very fast and prompt. When i run in there to order coffee and food, that usually becomes a circus. There have been times when i've waited over 20 minutes for my food. Usually it's not a problem, but when you have a business meeting that you have to attend to, it is. Fast food, pffft. Bring a sleeping bag."
1,"I love Pizza-A-Metro and so does Joe Arpaio. I am quite certain it is the only thing we have in common. This is where I take my foodie friends because they are usually so busy eating they shut up for a while. (I kid, I kid...) I have never had anything here that I don't find super delicious and crave-worthy. The first time I went here my party was personally doted on by Maurizio, who was over-the-top gracious and seemed to truly love what he was doing. While I don't see him every time I am here, the service never suffers. The calamari is crisp and light, which is a nice change from heavy, fried calamari that is so ubiquitous in too many Italian joints. Hands down my favorite item on the menu is the Frescolina. The combination of the arugula and prosciutto makes my mouth water even thinking about it! So next time you are at Pizza-A-Metro, my advice is don't loudly discuss if the portly man next to you is Joe Arpaio. Don't look him up on your Blackberry and pass the photo around to get the opinion of your fellow diners. Don't bring up that his mother died in childbirth, and how that potentially explains a great deal of the man's 'politics.' No matter how much wine you have had, do not forget how small this restaurant is. Because in the end, after he and his bodyguards leave, the server will tell you- Yeah. That was him."
1,"Clean, comfortable, smoke-free, fast service, nice staff. Also, their complimentary breakfast had a nice variety of food items. There is juice and coffee; bagels, yogurts, waffles and cereals. The hotel was a lot nicer than I expected, and I would definitely stay here again."
1,"As a vegetarian and sporadic health nut, I just love TJ's. They have a nice array of inexpensive fresh produce, including my beloved broccolini, for 40% of what Safeway charges. Huge selection of frozen veggie-friendly dinners, good for my on-the-go household. Greek yogurt, cheap. Nice beer selection with lots of cheapo wine. I try to buy all my supplements here too, as they seem to be a lot less expensive. Yes, I'm all about saving cash on groceries and whatnot. The downside? It's not one-stop-shopping; a trip always requires supplementation with another trip to a ""regular"" grocery store. This particular TJ's is teeny-tiny-small, and always chock-full of obnoxious and/or oblivious people who wield carts like weapons. My favorite is the woman who thinks it's an awesome time to teach little Jimmy how to push his own wee cart and comparison shop, and lets the little bastard cruise all over the store willy-nilly. I'm all for giving your kid responsibility, but a) you still have to, you know, keep an eye on the kid and b) a super-crowded claustrophobic nightmare like this place after work is not, repeat, NOT the time to do so."
1,"Got to give them four stars, Above the crowed, cooked to order food here is simply great. Yes butter burger is a fun time but the real mean is their entrees Fried Chicken and Fried Cod, they keep their fries clean and use a great breading recipe, try it you'll be back for more. The beef is ok, sometimes a little salty. mixers, not the biggest fan but they hit the spot when you need to. be creative and make your own mixer. Service, well its ok, they do bring it to your table and when you do a drive thru don't expect this to be Wendy's, it will take some time depending on what you order. Your given a number and a nice high school student will bring some food to you. The service seems to be young here, they just like hiring someone looking for their 1st job or so. No this does not create the best service but creates, our local future. giving a younger kid a job is not easy to do and these kids will move onto another job and keep working this is good karma for Culver's Phoenix and shows an investment in the town. I choose to review this location because it has been around. I used to go out of my way to find a Culver's. now they are popping up around town. As a Midwest person this is great to see. This is mid west food, comforting a little greasy but dedicated to a great meal. kevin"
1,"I adore all of Joe's restaurants. That being said, I think this one is my least favorite..(which means it's still better than most of the restaurants I've had the pleasure of dining at in the greater Phoenix area.) I got the chicken sandwich and it was okay. I think I could have found something on the menu that I would have enjoyed more, but for some reason I wanted to try it. I think I'll have to try the pizza next time, because it looked amazing. The service and atmosphere were great, as per all the Joe's establishments. I wasn't completely fond of standing in line for awhile to get a table and order my food. Sometimes I just want to sit down at a table and have the server come to me after a long day. That being said, I would love to try this place again...especially for breakfast!"
1,"I have been to this restaurant a couple of times and I always leave happy and satisfied. I love coming here for the view as it reminds me of home. We came here once again for a special occasion which was a farewell dinner for my mom who was visiting from South Africa. I had made a reservation using Opentable and asked for a nice view as a treat to my mom on her final night. The hostess reserved us a table with a splendid an unrestricted view. We had a very attentive waiter - Luis - who treated us with colorful and informative descriptions of the menu. He also took care of us with an exquisite after dinner treat seeing as how mom was leaving. The dinner was exceptional - as always, so was the atmosphere, the company and the wine. Do go here! I suggest arriving a little before the dinner reservation to enjoy drinks on the patio while watching the sunset...always a treat! Call ahead of time to find out whether the patio will be open - it has happened to me twice that it was reserved for private functions. (Which was totally my bad - but maybe someone else can benefit from it.)"
1,"I had not planned on being a Mac owner. My family - oh so very sick of me constantly complaining of Vista - on first an HP, then a Dell, packed me off to the Apple store a month ago and well, now I have a MacBook. The sales associate helping me pick out the perfect Mac was good enough, even with two perfectly good (except for the Vista) PCs at home, to convince me I needed this computer. Do I love it? Not yet. I like it, like it a lot. I'm especially loving not having Vista issues that I had been having. I'm enjoying taking the one on one classes to teach me how to use my Mac. Each time I take a class - I've had 4 now, I have a different teacher and each one bringing a different spin to my classes. They are nice, friendly, patient, highly knowledgeable. They are teaching me so many cool features and applications that I can do on my Mac. My fave so far is the translator. I do some business in Mexico - my Spanish is limited - so in just one short month the translator has just been a god send. The store here at the Biltmore is consistently packed with people, visiting the genius bar, taking group classes or the one on one class and making expensive purchases. I am amazed in this economy just how very busy the store is. I'm not totally convinced a Mac is the only way to go (almost though) but this store has some of the best customer service I've ever experienced."
1,"We tried this last night for our date night. We were impressed. The waitress was amazing in explaining the menu and making suggestions. This is a great place to relax and talk. The food was great. I had the Tartiflette...WOW it was so good. My husband had the La Potence, which is their speciality. He thought it was great...We will be back..."
1,"YC's is a pretty cool place to go. Here's how it works: you get a bowl and you fill it up with anything you want, including sprouts, broccoli, carrots, onions, peppers, scary dehydrated meat and much more. After all your ingredients are in your bowl, you then get to choose the sauces you want to put in it. They have suggestions and recipes for you to follow, from sweet to super spicy. Or you can always make up your own. Then the chef's wok it up for you and pour it all back into your bowl. You can add some rice to it, sesame seeds or any other toppings that you want and choose a table to sit at. My only warning is to vegetarians- you must ask the cook to clean off the grill before cooking yours because if you don't, you will get little pieces of meat in your bowl that have been left on the grill from someone else's meal!"
1,"I'm no regular here, but on occasion I get a craving for an Iced Mocha that tastes like chocolate milk. Tully's has that down. That's the only thing I've ever ordered here (I go elsewhere for my usual espresso needs), so I can't speak on the rest of their drinks. But, I don't imagine the rest of their drinks being bad; their Iced Mochas are very enjoyable. The service can be spotty. There are a couple ladies that work there that are sweet and take good care of the customers. But I've also encountered a couple of employees that aren't friendly and/or are super slow. Whatever; Tully's isn't my usual haunt. But it's good for what it is: fast-food-coffee."
1,"This is the old Rigatony's on Brown Rd- If you've never been, it has a Buca di Bepo-ish, before Buca was cool, sort of feel. They even serve their house chianti in a small water glass, instead of a wine goblet- adding to an authentic ""Joisey"" kind of feel. This is traditional Italian-American fare, rich and flavorful- with big portions. The Chicken Piccata is crack-good. It's served in what I've come to learn is a Sicilian style, with a n awesome relish of tomatoes, capers, and green olives and a side of addictive Fett Alfredo. It never gets old. Another great authentic dish is their Cecca- you can get it as a ""Pie"" (Pizza, that is) or over pasta. You just have try it. It's rich, refreshing, and explosively flavorful all at once. The house salad is a variation on a traditional AntiPasto theme- and is a meal, and event, in and of its self. The best thing about Mardeneley's is that EVERYTHING on the menu is good! It only gets Four stars because it could use a bit more snob appeal (and a better beer selection)."
1,"I hate ordering flowers sight unseen, but needed a local florist for a sympathy arrangement. Rachel immediately alleviated any concern when we discussed what I wanted in detail, and she even emailed me a photo of the final arrangement. Gorgeous flowers, same day delivery and reasonable pricing - can't beat that."
1,"This place is super cute lunch joint. I had the sloppy joe special and it reminded me of a home cooked meal back in the day. I ended my meal with a classic vanilla milkshake which was superb. Oh yeah! if you're in a hurry for a quick good sit down lunch, this place is it. our food came out SO fast. I will be returning shortly. You also MUST check out the vintage clothing/ furniture in the room next door before you leave !"
0,"I can't even believe I actually went to this restaurant. My feeling was that if the Tommy Bahama clothing and its wearers were any indication of the dining experience, it was going to be unoriginal and in poor taste. Alas my friend wanted to go there was his birthday lunch so.... Let me be clear that I'm not a food snob at all. Just last week I enjoyed a lunch of Nachos Bell Grande and a bean and cheese burrito at Taco Bell very, very much. That was far superior to this lunch at Tommy Bahama. The decor was comfortable and breezy. Everything else - not so much. 1st it's nice that they bring you bread and butter, but a sweetly flavored butter? Why mess with the pure goodness of butter? The glass of lemonade I ordered was sickeningly sweet, and I am a notorious for my sweet tooth. It was undrinkable until I cut it with water. The coconut shrimp also had an overly sweet sauce. So much so that we could each only eat 1 of 6 shrimp. I got the crab bisque which was crazy salty, and in my opinion, contained previously frozen hence rubbery crab meat. As it was my friend's birthday, they brought him a complimentary dessert. Very nice. He got the newest one which was some sort of chocolate/caramel-filled cake with oreo crust, chocolate mousse topping, sprinkled with crushed Heath bar. Sounds good, right? Vile, absolutely vile. Overly sweet except for the oreo crust that was saturated in butter. On an update note - it was not the nasty sweet butter they serve with the bread though. My final issue was with our young, highly attentive server. He was very sweet and well-intentioned. However I feel that every server in the world needs to stop speaking to customers in the collective. Don't say ""are we enjoying our coconut shrimp?"" or ""are we ready for dessert?"" Unless I've badly misinterpreted our relationship, ""we"" aren't doing anything together. Just a pet peeve - I still tipped him 22% and kept my mouth shut about this odd little quirk. oh and the bill for coconut shrimp appy, quesadilla, cup of crab bisque, lemonade and glass of white wine? $52. for lunch. Tommy Bahama and I just didn't work out at all."
1,"I'm not a huge sushi person (I know, I know...) but I ordered the tuna with lotus chips and it was very yummy. The server was friendly and the chefs were efficient. The atmosphere is dark and modern though a bit squashed and overwhelming."
1,"I will have to admit that I was not a huge fan of the Keg, as I have been to the Chandler Mall location and I was not impressed. I was hesitant to try the new location at the San Tan Mall, but I tried it anyway. I have been there 3 times in the last 3 months, and I am glad that I did. I thought the waitstaff was excellent and very helpful every time I went there, and their menu has some really great choices. The bar was very nice and clean and the outside patio is pretty awesome. If you go during the cooler months, they have a nice fireplace and comfortable seating. The prices are similar to Outback, but the food is far better. I will be returning."
1,"Five stars is truly deserved For Yasu. This is truly the best sushi in town and some of the best I ever had! I am a big seafood lover and there a lot of ""chain sushi"" places in Arizona that are decent and good for rolls, but if you want quality and authentic Japanese style fish and incredible Sashimi, you need to go to Yasu. There is really no way to describe it till you go, but once you do, you will become an instatnt fan! Best thing to do is sit at the sushi bar and ask Yasu to make whatever he wants! You won't be disappointed. The area and building are misleading... However, if you are the kind of person that thinks RA is the best thing since sliced bread and nothing can beat it, this is probably not for you. This is real sushi... Go try and enjoy!"
1,"I am at work today, talking to my co-worker, letting her know that I was going to Taco Bell for lunch. She looked at me disappointed, and said ""I never want to hear that you are gaining weight again...stop eating that!"" She then told me about Sacks....I decided that I would give it a shot. (not that is was any healthier....) I wasn't real impressed with the layout of the place, even where it was located. It was getting busy when I walked in...and had no idea what to order. I ended up with the Van Gogh, which was roast beef, dill, alfalfa sprouts, cheese and I subsituted the marble rye for a tomato basil bread. The girl at the counter was really sweet and helpful at helping me pick out what I wanted. My sandwich was really good, and it wasn't just a normal sandwich. I also liked the little cookie that they snuck into my bag. And the fact that they have Stewart's root beer was a nice bonus. The only thing that I could say that was negative is that I left there still smelling the kitchen on my coat. And it wasn't pleasant."
1,"Haji-Baba is unique by being both a restaurant and a store! As such, the restaurant is fairly small- so if you're up for some delicious middle-eastern food on a Friday afternoon, make sure you arrive early! The prices are good, the selection is better and the food is great! I ordered the falafel plate which came with 4 falafels, a side of hummus, and I subbed the tabooli out for a salad. The portion size was pretty big, so I left quite full, and it was all delicous! I'll definitely be going back soon!"
1,"Awesome. So much better than parking on site. Safe and good prices keep me coming back. Flying during a busy time, go to their website to make a reservation...that's right a reservation! Also print out a coupon for a couple bux off per day."
1,"Probably not the best pizza I've ever had, but definitely in the top 5! Had the groupon deal of 50% off, so that made it even a better experience. Not exactly the atmosphere for a ""date night"", but the quality of bread/sauce/toppings is fantastic. If you like specialty beer and pizza, there is no reason not to try this place. Will be returning for sure!"
1,"This restaurant is in my TOP-5 favorite restaurants of all-time! ...The only reason I am not giving it 5-stars is because it is a real splurge, and it takes a pretty special occasion (and experience) to justify such an expensive meal. While in my personal experience at Posh, the quality (and ""deliciousness"") of the food I had definitely justifies the price-tag, it should - if the quality wasn't extraordinary, it wouldn't rank at all. You really do have to be an open-minded, mostly omnivorous eater to fully appreciate it though. If there are ingredients or flavors that you don't much care for, it might be more challenging to assume that you will like everything you get. It can be daunting, because you may get something that you don't like, but that is also part of the excitement (and the adventure of trying new things!) You also may get something that you've never had done well before and find that you are a newly converted fan. Also, though the wine parings are wonderful, if you are on a budget, skipping the wine is a good way to trim the bill. For the best experience, don't go when you are famished, and don't bring picky eaters with you - both will interfere with you having a completely satisfying experience."
0,"HA HAHAHAHAHA! ""Pit"" is right.... man, this place would have been a terrible idea if i wasn't already expecting lameness. now occupying the space that has seen the death of not one, but two dance club (411 and Level), Peach Pit Afterdark.... I mean Cherry Lounge and Pit is beyond ghetto. opened by the same people who do sugar daddy's and dos gringos, this place has all the sexiness and allure of a Trails commercial. You know? I was half expecting to turn a corner to see a neon colored bikini-clad bleached blonde on top of a motor boat. well, they've updated the look of the cage-trapped go-go dancers to mini panties with knee-high dragon rider boots with fuzzy muppet skins adorning them. the vids of drunken lounge-goers (a la daddy's and now dos) playing in tiny screens on the walls in hallways and behind bars in tact, interspersed with footage of seriously hagard looking chics doing ""sexy"" things like sucking on lollipops, cherries, winking (yes, she was winking right at you, wasn't she? inviting you in to her red-drenched lair to bask in the glow of a alcohol doused club circa 1992). i'm not sure what the DRESS CODE we were so violently and largely reminded of in line, but the girl in front of me had on an oversized T-shirt, baggy jeans and flip flops (?) and they took her $5 and let her in no problem. i also saw a girl dressed exactly like peggy bundy...no joke, spandex black calf leggings, long spandwex shirt in orange, heels and a giant boob belt. it was so incredible i took a picture. she was not impressed with my observation, so i had to sneak the photo. anyway.... take it for what it is, a club owned by dos gringos guys on mill ave."
1,"This is a great place to go for a glass of wine and appetizers with your girlfriends. My girlfriends and I went there to celebrate one of our birthdays. We sat on the patio by the fireplace. Our waitress was awesome she let us try as many samples of wines that wanted to. The wines are very good and pretty inexpensive. As for the appetizers they were just ok. The bruschetta is good, but the spinach artichoke dip was tasteless. This place stands out for its ambiance, great tasting wine and good service!"
1,"Troy, the owner, is a brilliant businessman! Being a pharmacist myself, I am familiar with the quality of his products and his facility. Trust me when I say his sterile compounding areas are more advanced than many hospitals in the Valley. After spending a day at his old facility when I was still training, I felt comfortable enough to send my mother to Troy so that he could help her with hormone replacement therapy. The docs around town trust him enough to let him dictate what a patient needs; they simply sign off on his recommendations. My mom has had a huge increase in her quality of life since seeing Troy, and I feel the compounded HRT is safer than the Prempro she used to take. Do not hesitate to consult a compounding pharmacist if you're having health issues that aren't being adequately addressed. Troy is one of the best in the Valley. It's worth the drive to consult with him, and further prescriptions can be mailed to your home."
1,"Here last night with friends. We had to wait a little longer to be seated than I would have liked but we were a party of five so I understand. Once we were seated service was quick and pleasant. We shared a couple of the flatbreads to start, so by the time we ordered entrees I was already pretty full and went with a salad, the strawberry balsamic, which was delicious and just made me feel all ready for summer. We were there quite a while talking and enjoying our meal, and the staff never made us feel hurried although it was a pretty busy night. We tipped well enough that I don't feel bad about taking up space for that long, that's something I always make sure to do in that situation."
1,"I visited this location a few months ago for the first time, and returned for my second visit the very next day. I got their standard chicken and waffle plate on my first visit, and just chicken and macaroni the next day. Both visits were pleasant and the food was delicious. My only criticism is that the waffles I got were a bit on the thin side. I've had chicken and waffles from many different soul food places all over the US and in comparison LoLo's waffles were just okay. The chicken on the other hand was A+. It was tender and juicy and well fried. I see myself coming back here again."
1,I really enjoy this place for a relaxing dinner. They really know how to do a great salad and it's defiantly a plus when it's half off bottles of wine night.
0,"Had a couple of happy hour apps here, all flavorless. Bacon wrapped scallops: bacon undercooked, scallop overcooked. Seared Ahi Tuna: flavorless. Pork sliders: Not bad, but not memorable. Service was good. Go to Tutti Santi in the same mall instead."
1,"This is a very special medical practice with customer service and attention to detail that you hardly ever see in a doctor's office anymore. I started seeing Dr. Ross for Osteopathic Manipulation after having a few back surgeries. He has given me tremendous relief and I highly recommend OMT rather than chiropractic treatment since it works with the tissue and muscles as well as the bones. Anyways, He listens and takes time to treat your WHOLE body unlike most doctors that have one hand on the door knob as they speak to you. I saw a Naturopath in the past and saw Cheryl the P.A. for the first time the other day. She took a lot of time with me, going through my blood work line by line. I was so please that she suggested supplements and knew about things that I learned from the Naturopath...but actually, she knew about more supplements than the Naturopath! So I was really pleased. This is a great office and everyone is like family....they also treat you like you are a part of their family. They make your children feel comfortable too. There are tons of Mickey Mouse figures and videos for them to watch. The nurses have always loved on my daughter since she was a baby. They make sure that all of us have a productive appointment! I highly recommend this office."
1,"Whatza Culvers? I drove by this place as it was being built; didn't know what it was, but ""butterburger"" and ""frozen yogurt"" caught my eye..... so I decided to visit it on 2011-05-30 (dine-in). Looks like it just opened, and it was busy. Turns out this place is a fast-food chain based out of Wisconsin that I had never heard of before... kind of like a cross between an In-and-Out and a Dairy Queen. Menu is a bit daunting the first time - a burger or a sandwich? what side? smoothies, or regular drinks? You walk up to the counter, place your order, take your number to your table, and they deliver your order to your table when it's ready. The burger patties are different... they're about 1/8"" thick and seem pressed/fried. The buns are nice and soft... ingredients are fresh or properly cooked. Flavors are there... but it is a different style burger than what we're used to seeing. I tried the cheese curds; just wish they hadn't breaded/deep-fried them. I like my curds natural. A fountain drink completes the ""value basket"" deal. Their frozen yogurt or ""concrete mix"" sealed the deal.... we tried the banana split (nice) and their ""brownie cookie dough"". Kinda hard to screw up frozen yogurt! yum! Okay, so I now know what a Culvers is. It's a good change-of-pace from the other fast food chains. Not sure I'd go out of my way just to come here (unless I'm really in the mood for it). I'll have to try other items, but for now, its a 3 star rating."
1,"If you want a good neighborhood bar, Ernie's is exactly that. This is the place I go when I'm not looking to get all dolled up but I still want to go out. There is nothing unique about it, it is just a bar that is good at being a bar. It also has all of the best activities for drinking. I LOVE shuffleboard and a dive-bar is not a dive-bar without it. Great thing about theirs is it is in the patio area so you can smoke while playing (I smoke when I drink, yes filthy, disgusting habit I'm aware) ...sometimes they charge like five bucks for the pucks other times not, depends on the bartender I think. They also have two pool tables, and I think golden tee. Their is a room that has karaoke. I am a singer and enjoy karaoke from time to time, the night I participated there were some amazing singers and it was really fun to listen to everyone. The karaoke DJ. has a really good selection of songs, lots to choose from you will probably find what you are looking for. I tend to get hit on every time I'm there which I guess is an ego boost but I would prefer to be left alone at a place like this. I'm usually in the mood to do my own thing with my own friends at a place like this and don't feel like making new friends but that's just me. Not sure about their drink selection, I always just get Michelob Ultra (lame I know) or cranberry/vodka...the mixed drinks are strong, their well is gross though but to be expected. Always a good laid back time at Ernies. They can count on me as a regular."
1,"Growing up near this little hole in the wall, this place was a constant stop for my family. It's really good, greasy chinese food that basically tastes like you would expect it to. Now that I live farther away I still have cravings for their delicious orange chicken and chicken fried rice. If you're nearby during lunch try out a lunch special, really great prices!"
1,"Same great Lolo's fried chicken and waffles without the risk of getting stabbed or shot... and it WAS worth the risk to visit their South Phoenix location on occasion. The food is that good, it might even be the ultimate in comfort food! Lucky for us they have a new Scottsdale location where the most dangerous situation you could encounter might be a hungover Scottsdale ""clubber"" (who could scratch you with their Ed Hardy bling). The only suggestion I have for them is to drop the prices about 25%"
1,"I love this restaurant. Very cheap, very clean, the food is sooo good. My mom and I eat there once every couple of weeks, sometimes twice once a week. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The environment is very comforting. I recommend this place to anyone who loves cheap but tasty Mexican food."
0,"Liked the theme, didn't care for the execution. Portions were scant, prices not commensurate with value. All three diners were disappointed. Left still hungry."
1,"I've always wanted a family friendly jeweler. Esp. if my at the time boyfriend was going to buy me an engagement ring. It means so much to me to have the true customer service when buying fine Jewelry, someone I can trust. And when I found this place one day while I was at CVS I knew I had found a Gem (pun intended)! Peggy really made me and my now finance feel like we were family. She helped him pick out my fabulous ring and answer every single one of his questions. I'm so proud to tell everyone where we got the ring from because I think everyone should know about this place! If your looking for great jewelry with a warm smile, head on over. They are so excited to help you!"
1,The employees here are really nice and I like the island feel. The food is pretty good and I like it because there aren't many other places in town with Hawaiian food. I also like that you can get beer here.
1,My food was delicious and the waitress were nice! They didn't bother me every 5 minutes and I was able to enjoy my meal. Spicy does mean spicy here though!
1,"We really liked this place. I got the grande burrito with zuchinni & peppers i it which was really good. Loved their carne asada and the prices were great. I wish they ha more on their dessert menu. Would love home made churros! Staff was friendly. Would for sure go here again. Much better than baja fresh, rubios, tace bell & most other mexican places around PHX that we've been to."
1,I think Mr Goodcents has the best subs in town. I have no idea why people go to Subway. Goodcents slices the meat and cheese when you order your sandwich and their bread is baked fresh - you can't beat it. Get oil and vinegar on your sandwich and the taste is to die for. The staff was very friendly and oftentimes the owners are there working. $5 footlongs are there too - only they taste 20x's better! They're all over the city if this one isn't in your neck of the woods.
1,"Another wonderful little counter joint. It's extremely basic, no frills, and cheap. The baklava isn't fabulous, but everything else is worthy of a special trip. Once again, the chicken shawarma draws me in, though I'll occasionally force myself into breaking out of that far too predictable mold (for falafel since I truly am stuck in a rut). The hummus is great. As mentioned, the salads mainly consist of iceburg lettuce, but they are not stingy with the feta and the dressing is amazing. There is night, semi-scrubby outdoor seating and the drinks are bottled or canned. Last year I went with a group of friends for Valentine's Day and there was a musician who was slightly too loud for the environment. When something special is going on, the owner comes around and checks with the patrons to verify quality and whether or not the activity is enjoyable. This is always a nice classy touch for a little dive. It's a rarer occasion that I find my way down there. Let's be honest: I only go that direction for SMoCA, the Venue of Scottsdale, and EZ Tattoo. It's not generally ""my scene"" and it's definitely out of my way. Any time I find myself doing something in downtown Scottsdale, however, dinner at Pita House prior to the main event is an absolute must."
1,"Closed? Really? It seems this place just randomly shut down, after much less than a year of being open. Only went there once - we enjoyed the food, the ambiance, and the beer. We recommended it to others as well. Showed up on a Tuesday night for dinner and everything was packed up....? A little searching on the web (Facebook, specifically) shows that they're done. What a shame."
1,"I was only here for one night on 9/7, but I was very pleased with my stay. The place is beautiful, the rooms are big, and the people at the front desk were pleasant and efficient. The only down side to my stay was that I lost water pressure in the shower Friday night. Fortunately, it was only brief. Other than that, I enjoyed my stay. This will be my base of operations for my next visit. As for others' comments that there isn't anything nearby - That's what cars are for. Last I heard you can rent them here and there."
1,"Alison B. sums up all the great things about this unique store - and I would return if I was looking for a unique gift for any female friends of mine. However, when I went in on a Sunday I was 1 of 4 women in the store. The man working was chatting it up with the 3 other women who turned out to be together, and once they left he had a seat and didn't say a word to me as I browsed. I walked out after several minutes of silence."
1,"This has always been our favorite local Chinese take out - and especially on Chinese New Year, the special menu. OMG its good. We always call for takeout, one or two items and we are so close that by the time I get in the car and drive there, its done...less than five minutes. This place gets very busy, and if you get a chance, try out their Peking Duck, Hong Kong style. Soooo delicious! Another favorite is the snow pea leaves (not on the menu!!! cost extra), and the Seafood Bean Curd Soup. I love the soup here, so many delicious morsels, you can't go wrong with it ever."
1,"OMG, oh so good. Gives me gas and makes me tired after lunch, but it's well worth it."
1,I loved it. The salad bar is not so great but everything else is excellent!
1,"My wife and I love to visit Sushi places to celebrate our anniversaries and hallmark holidays. Originally, we dined at Akai-Hana a couple years back, and didn't have that great of an experience. We felt the food, service, and price just didn't add up. We then started to visit the Ah-So place right up the street because of their happy hour specials. We decided to give the Akai-Hana grill another chance after a terrible dining experience one night at Ah-So. It's the only place we've been to lately. We've discovered their happy hour and reverse happy hour menus and they are great. The service has greatly improved and they have 2 sushi chef's behind the bar finally. If you haven't been there in a year because of a bad experience, give it a try again. The staff has improved as has the quality of food."
1,"I've been a fan of La Bocca for a long time because it served the needs of an underserved demographic on Mill Avenue. Canteen offers many things that La Bocca does...and more. What is that demographic exactly? ...Late twenties, looking for something chic and classy without paying a ridiculous premium for those qualities. Mill has plenty to offer for the ASU kids and the older adults, but for those of us who lie somewhere in between, places like La Bocca and Canteen are just right. Canteen one ups La Bocca, in fact, because there are menu items included in happy hour (50% off most drinks and select food items). Here are the highlights: The margarita. It's a real margarita! (It's not a lime daiquiri masquerading as margarita. Loads of sour mix does not a margarita make.) The chips and salsa. Both fresh and delicious. The pico de gallo is particularly fresh and delicious. The ribs. Sweet and spicy...the level of heat from the habenero is perfect and the meat literally falls right off the bones. The ambiance. It's chic but not pretentious. My friends and I really enjoyed the Latin music. Our suggestion would be to emphasize that music and minimize the clubby stuff (it verges on Scottsdale). To contextualize some of the other yelper's comments. I was glad to hear that one yelper didn't find Canteen suited to his beer and Jaeger shot needs. There's a bar (or ten) down the street for that. For the yelpers that found the portions to be too small, I suspect they didn't understand the Mexican take on tapas that the taco menu is going for (in fact, the whole valley suffers from a lack of tapas locations). Finally, the service complains...my service has been cordial and attentive, even when super-busy. Folks, this place is new, let's let it go through it's growing pains before issuing such harsh judgments that might jeopardize the success of a really wonderful place."
0,"I was so disappointed in this place. I just moved out here and was craving filipino food and found this place based on reviews. Although the reviews were average, I was hoping to catch this place on one of its good days. Nope, not the case. The place is not much to look at and the food did not look good. I was hesitant to eat here but was so hungry and saw that they had my fav dishes, sinigang and diniguan. They were both ok, I've def had better. I ordered the pancit for my husband and it was terrible! He had maybe two bites and threw the rest away. Oh well, won't be coming back here. There's another filipino place in Phoenix so we'll be trying that next. Gingeroot, also in Chandler, is way better but expensive. Guess it's worth the price when you have your cravings!"
1,"The single best ribs I've ever had at any restaurant. This place is brand new and off to a great start. The mac and cheese was delicious, the bone marrow was great (as usual) and the staff and chef were friendly and helpful. I'll be back here!"
1,very wonderful and romantic place to take your loved one :)
0,"The doctors are great, especially Dr Mouaikel but the set up to communicate is not patient oriented at all . When the office is closed for lunch 12-2PM you cannot even leave a message . You need to call back again and listen to the lenghtly preamble about directions , office hours, emergency numbers etc. You still have to press the correct number and leave a phone number for a return call. The return call is late that day or even the next day. The recording suggests yiu use the website yet you have to be signed up for the website and I cannot find out on the website how you get signed up. I would rather go to the DMV rather than have to call the AIA office for other than an appointment.."
1,"Friendly staff and clean office. From what I have seen, somewhat frequent turnover with the Dr.'s I've had. Right now I have Dr. Susman, she's concise, to the point, compassionate, easy to understand. Oral surgeon Dr. Lillien does his job well, I got my wisdom teeth out without complications or infections later. Healed up pretty well. Scheduled out pretty far so difficult to get an appointment in if you have specific avail abilities. Certain staff could use more training on procedure and techniques to expedite the process and minimize x-ray radiation time. Julie is doing a breast cancer walk, so donate (personal check) and get teeth whitening kit for 99 dollars. About staff: Kendall is very friendly and professional. Noreen seems like she could use more training (quite a few x-ray retakes with bite tabs), but she was friendly overall. The process took a bit longer than I anticipated. Suggestions: Train the staff thoroughly, with technique and procedure so it can speed up customer service. especially with bite tab as well as the other kind (the red circular one). Customers like to minimize their radiation exposure time : ) Clean office and helpful reception staff. Dr. Susman was to the point and very clear about wahts going on and what to do next. downfall: Scheduling can be somewhat difficult if ppl have specific avail abilities but in general, reception staff is very helpful"
1,This weekend was my first time back since they have done the huge remodel and under new ownership. This place still has the same comfort feel to it and is cozy. Havent tried the food yet but enjoyed the drinks and the ambience in the bar. Hopefully the food is better than what it used to be.
1,Fabulous service tonight and it was crowded!
1,"We got the Wiseguy with Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, and Fennel Sausage. I was very underwhelmed. The pizza was really greasy and just not all that great-tasting. Also the crust was burnt in several places, making it taste even worse."
0,"Service was slow and horrible. Got the steak and eggs. Steak was half fat. Waiters response was ""Oh! We have a new supplier"". He didnt take it back and charged us any way. Eggs were cold. Stay away from this place for eating. Bar looked happening."
1,"Never busy when I go there at night. Very nice staff, good solid food, you got to love Filiberto's. I just wish they had a Drive-Thru! 2 Thumbs up for being very clean and friendly."
1,"I was very satisfied with the food here. We had wings (half bbq and half buffalo) and a BBQ sandwich. The BBQ sauce was amazing, the buffalo sauce was not super special but perfectly acceptable. The wings are made to order and SO worth the wait. Portions were very good, and the coleslaw was also good. The service was very friendly, she was funny and charming and a good server, too. We will definitely be going back. OH! I almost forgot to mention that they have all-you-can-eat days for wings and fish, AND they let you leave and come back for more (additional drink purchase required)!!!!"
0,"Oh god.. I use to love this place its the closest store to me, and I have my safeway card so I'm good to go.. place is a mess. First the parking lot.. too small for the amount of things going on at this complex, I am shocked that there isn't a daily accident in the parking lot. People are impatient, driving down the middle of the rows instead of one sides.. I just got back from there and I was making my exit and three cars tried to go for my parking spot created a jumble mess, so much so I had to pull back in the spot so they could move.. ugh. Inside the story, they seem to always always be stocking and never seem to be stocked.. When I go I can never fully complete my shopping list, there is always something not stocked so I have to come back or just go with out it.. But today took the cake.. Its just after one in the afternoon, every single row there was at least one person stock, blocking half of the row.. its 1pm! Usually by 1, stores are stocked up, maybe one or two things to go.. There was also a cockroach.. and not to sound snobby but the type of people that tend to go to this on, I feel I need to carry mace or have a buddy.. So I may go back for quick in and out shopping, but for big shopping trips I'll drive out of my to somewhere else.. even with the gas prices.."
1,"Durant's has that old, musty, dark, Mafia feel. Love the atmosphere and allure. We mainly sit at the bar, but have dined in. The happy hour specials are good, and we have tossed a few back here having great talks and enjoying the ambiance. Now for the bad: The food is overpriced for it's quality. The steaks look fatty, the salads wilted, and flavor pretty bland. It would probably be okay if we weren't looking at 20 plus dollars per entree. Back in the day, Durant's was very high end and elite, so I could see the pricing from that perspective. However, if they want to stay in the game, they need to keep the food up to par as well. 5 stars plus for ambiance, relaxation, a throw back feel, and great drinks! 1 star for food and food prices. However, a major landmark in Phoenix, so please check it out! We never know how long these staples will be around. I would just recommend going for drinks and maybe split an appetizer. It does ignite the ""romantic mood"" and will leave you reflecting on those ""good old days""."
1,"Another disappointed visit. I am starting to think this isn't a fluke and PB has lost it's magic touch. We went for my wife's birthday around 4pm on a Wednesday. We actually walked right in and sat down. We were both shocked as the least amount of time we have ever waited was well over 3 hours. The staff was more attentive on where we sat than giving us a genuine greeting even though the place was empty except two other tables. We put in our order for a margherita with prosciutto, a wise guy, and a caprese salad. The bread came out cold with some oil to dip it in. I can't remember if it was always cold but it would be nice if they threw it in the oven for 30 seconds before they serve it to you. Next our pizzas came out and the margherita was missing the prosciutto. Not a big deal. Maybe he didn't hear me, maybe the cook didn't hear him? My wife confirms I did request it and I'm not losing my mind. The pizzas were good but lacking the usual special touch. The crust was the best part which is not unusual but what was unusual was the rest was very lack luster. Even though the shop was dead our waiter never came back to us and was back behind the bar laughing and chatting with other staff members. Finally a blonde woman asks if we would like our bill. She brings it to us and when I give her my card I gently advise her they forgot my prosciutto and it's on the bill. Another guy brings the bill back for me to sign. The 6 dollar prosciutto is still on it. I inform him that there was no prosciutto and I told the other woman but it's still here. I don't know if she thought I was just making small talk or what but I sure am not paying 6 bones for some sliced ham that wasn't even on my pizza. He took care of it. Here's the deal. I don't know if it's because I didn't wait 3-5 hours to eat or if it's just falling apart without Chef Bianco but PB has definitely lost it's way and is quickly losing the legacy he created whether they want to acknowledge it or not. I used to think the staff was short and slightly rude because of how busy it was and dealing with upset starving customers brings them down but now I know that is not the case. They are just not good at what they do and have been there getting away with it for too long. Just because PB is famous and Chef Bianco is world renown doesn't mean you are. The dough is good enough to come back for but there is simply no way I would ever wait in line to eat here again. If you read my previous review you will see I am not a PB hater and actually was a huge advocate. I guess all good things really do come to an end."
0,"Slow, unorganized and filled to the brim with crazy people. I prefer to do everything through the service arizona website but recently got a letter that I needed to get a new license because my picture was going to expire. It makes total sense that my license is valid until I'm 65 but the picture expires after 11 years. Of course, the state charges a nominal fee of $12 to replace it. If the state of AZ was in need of my money I'd gladly just give it to them if it means avoiding this nightmare. Oh, and the camera is set to fat..."
0,"Let's put it this way... I ordered two topping-heavy small pizzas from Naked Pizza. I had a Groupon for $20 that only cost me $10. So, keep in mind I am rating this on my entire experience that cost me merely $10 out of pocket. The good? The garlic topping is delicious. The employees were friendly. They were generous with their toppings. The bad? Daiya cheese is disgusting on this pizza and tasted like raw dough. If you're off dairy, get the pizza sans cheese. It will probably be a lot better! The just okay? The crust was okay-tasting, if not a little plain and dry. The sauce was pretty good for one of us and just okay for the other. This is one of the two times in my life that I have ordered pizza and not kept the leftovers. Of two adults and three kids eating the two small pizzas, we were left with one and a half 10"" pizzas, which we promptly tossed in the bin. My daughter disliked this pizza so much, she picked off a few of her toppings and then told me she was full (when she said earlier how famished she was). I am only rating this pizza two stars versus one because I can see that it would be ""better"" without the Daiya cheese that I chose to have on the pizza instead of mozzarella."
1,"I decided to give this place another shot. This time around I was sober, and thus have actual memories. After grabbing a drink my friend and I decided to head out to the patio. A group of 3 guys graciously let us share their table since the place was packed. A short period later one of the guys pours his drink into the candle holder and storms off. I made a comment about it being his time of the month and I'm not so sure they appreciated it because they all left. Although, the most sober of the bunch seemed embarrassed. Whatever, free table, woohoo! Next table starts having a beer fight. I'm not kidding. I then started feeling really old. And overdressed. An employee comes by to clean up the empty bottles from my table and notices the candle holder full of liquid. I told him about the guy with PMDD. He made a little joke about the the guy being upset over my rejection of him. Final analysis- Patron has some cool employees and some not so cool customers."
1,"Oooh, this is my favorite lunch place by my office. Super nice staff, delicious bagels. Go for the lox special thing, it's amazing."
1,"Canal has been a stop on many a ""bar tour"" through the Waterfront / Old Town area. The bar always has a good crowd in the evenings and the patio is fantastic on warm nights. With summer finally clearing out and it now being possible to sit outside during the daylight hours, we made our way to Canal for some late lunch / day drinking on a recent Sunday. First off, what a great place to sit and people watch! This was the first time we had ever ordered food at Canal, so we were interested to see if the cuisine lived up to the hip decor and vibe of the restaurant. The baby burgers (3 of them) were served up on an ""English High Tea"" tray. Great presentation, and the actual taste of those little guys didn't disappoint.....ahi tuna / fillet mignon / ground chicken. The fillet was my favorite. What can I say? I like red meat! We also had the fish tacos.....delicious! A great experience, all around. We're definitely looking forward to getting back here for dinner soon."
1,"Today I was ready to be beside myself with glee as I took my daughters out for lunch. I've been here several times for breakfast and lunch, and have never been disappointed. They have the BEST eggs! I also love the layout and of course, the free wifi. August is their ""Burger Daze"", a different burger every day for the entire month. Today's burger was the wasabi burger, and being a fan of foods with kick, I was thinking about this burger since yesterday. It almost makes me cry to say I was underwhelmed by it. It was a burger with a creamy horseradishy sauce on it, and you got a little wasabi flavor, but it lacked that kick you get from eating wasabi. It also had an Asian salad mixture on the burger as well. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but when I think that I paid $11 for that and a side of potato chips, I feel a little slighted. If you eat ten of their burgers over the course of the month you can get a $25 gift card (save your receipts). The burger just wasn't good enough to get me to come back 9 more times this month. I'll definitely return to Liberty Market again- as I said I do love the restaurant and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to eat. However I think I'll stick to their breakfasts and other sandwiches. The three stars is for today only- next time I hope to come back here and give them a 5!"
1,"The fitness part of this place is great: machines are new and plentiful. Good classes on the schedule, and plenty of cold water and fresh towels. Now, the spa, on the other hand, is mediocre at best. The pool is a bit of a walk and available to anyone at the hotel; same with the jacuzzi, which also means the jacuzzi is outside! Why no jacuzzi inside? The steam room is small and there is no sauna. There are only 3 shower stalls, with shampoo and shower gel, but no conditioner. The lounge area is also small and not at all relaxing. And the robes are super thin (with a chilly room; that's not even nice!) and not very big. I had to sit very carefully so as to not expose myself to everyone. Hello! haha. The massage itself was very nice, but the spa is not relaxing, especially for the prices. I wouldn't return to the spa, although the gym is good."

1,"OK ok ok. I'll have to agree with some of the below reviewers that this place isn't dead-on authentic Mexican food. That being said, I love it! The place is huge, sporting a bakery (said many times before) with unbelievably dirt cheap pastries (not said as many times before), a little carniceria (not as good as Carniceria Sonora) and a huge dining area. The dining area with all its painted mural glory is so goddamn cool that I find myself wanting to just hang out there for hours watching La Primera Division de Mexico on TV and enjoying a nice $2 Dos Equis. The food - that's probably the only tougher part. Keep in mind it's still pretty good, but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise. The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork. I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K, rolling taquitos. They are literally just smaller tacos, but they were damn good. I guess when it comes down to it, I'm an atmosphere buff. There were so many cool things to check out in this multi-plex, and the atmosphere was so warm that I'd love to head back again soon."
0,"This place was horrible! I will never go back it was over priced and the best thing I ate was the corn bread you get before the meal. I had the chorizo stuffed tenderlion it was like chewing on a piece of rubber stuffed with soy. My girl freind had flavorless tacos with stale corn tortillas. three words it sucked, sucked, sucked!"
0,"Are you serious? $4.50 for domestic beers during the usual ""happy hour"" time? That includes Old Style (we were there for the Cub game)!! At grocery stores you can get a 6-pack of Old Style for $4.50! And charging $5.50 for a Corona?! Cra-zy! ""World Famous Sliders""? These were the worst sliders ever, I think Jack and the Box sliders are better. Almost $10 for six southwestern sliders with a patty the size of a half dollar that got lost in the bun, one jalapeno, a small square of cheese, and salsa to make the bun soggy. I know they have a prime location being right outside of the ballpark and all, but does that really give them the right to charge whatever they want? They are going to make money regardless, they don't have to be greedy about it!"
1,"Really like this place, wound up there one night by accident, as my friend and I got disgusted with the lousy service at the ""other"" bar in the same shopping center as Tony's. The place had a good vibe, jukebox playing, people shooting darts, we felt totally comfortable, and found a table, to sit and catch up. Service was really good, The bartender, while waiting on another customer, made eye contact, to acknowledge me, and said she'd be right with me. I like that in a place, ---nothing worse than standing at a bar waiting to order drinks and feeling invisiable. My beer was good and cold, my friend ordered a vodka and orange juice, and commented that it was a nice ""stiff drink"" - We both said we were glad we stumbled upon Tony's and will be back."
1,"The food and cocktails at this place are amazing - beyond comparison. I have not eaten one bad thing off of their menu. I am not a margarita person AT ALL but my friend insisted I try their primarita (essentially a skinny margarita) and it was amazing. Probably what all margaritas are supposed to taste like. I crave them. Their guacamole is phenomenal - fresh and made right in front of you to your taste. You really can't get any better without going to Mexico and eating at at a mom and pop restaurant. The pork shoulder is great and the skirt steak is to die for. This is also a great brunch spot - the green chile chilaquiles are outstanding. They are on the pricey end but their entrees are shareable. I love the dark, candlelit ambience. Perfect for pretty much any occasion: date night or bachelorette party. Cautions: it seems next to impossible to get a weekend dinner reservation between 6pm and 9:30pm. I don't know if these are blocked out by default on Open Table. Your best bet is to make your reservation well in advance and call them directly. I have never been to this place as a walk-in for dinner. Service has also been hit or miss. I seem to get an excellent server or a really bad one."
1,"I enjoyed my nights here. The facilities are clean and very well maintained. Housekeeping staff is fantastic also. They were not intrusive and they were hospitable. However, the ONE thing that bothered me was the reception staff. I was mistreated. I say this because I asked the reception staff a question about the pool hours and the response I received was ""Are you a guest here?"" Followed by ""because we get a lot of people around here..."" While that response is completely understandable, I must point out that I checked in an hour earlier with the SAME staff at the desk. This may be me sounding like a self-centered, remember me-type of person, but no. I felt that the receptionist was categorizing me because of my age and because of my look. I guess I just look like the type that would crash into a hotel pool? Mind you, this Residence Inn is adjacent to the Mayo Clinic and desert land. Yes, the only two things around walking distance are this hotel and the hospital. So apparently, this hotel pool must be the hot spot for pool crashers. Must be all the sickly patients that want to take a dip in the pool. Then on the same occasion, the same reception staff told me that they did not have a bottle opener at the desk. There is a small convenient store next to the reception desk that sells wine, beer, water, soda, snacks, etc. I purchased a beer and asked them if they had a bottle opener so I could drink my beer by the fire pits and they said no. It had been misplaced. Some time later, the nice gentleman that helped me open my beer got beers at the reception desk and somehow, they magically had a bottle opener. Strange how they had one for him, but not for me. Regardless, I was a bit bummed that the reception staff was childish and rude to me. I felt like I was individually singled out to be discriminated against. It's a shame too because I love my Marriott Rewards card. The rooms are large here. The elevator takes forever! I suggest that the hotel adopt elevator music to distract the sluggish speed of that elevator."
1,"Spring Rolls - Great! Singapore Noodles - Great! Hot & Sour Soup - not so great - I have never had a hot and sour soup so dark! Although the hot was hot and the sour, was sour - a little bit goes a very long way! Definitely going back again, just skipping the hot & sour soup next time."
1,"Food- Amazing nachos! Best i've ever had. Plenty of toppings, well worth the 9 dollars Service-The guy behind the counter is very nice and makes excellent suggestions and remembers me every time I come in and asks how his suggestion panned out! Ambiance-Nice little spot, nothing fancy"
1,Food was good. Service was not good. Only one waitress for entire restaurant.
0,"It's so promising. Great specials. Awesome space. TV's everywhere. Full bar. Good food. Great place to grab some beers before and after a spring training game. But service sucks. I don't understand why I have to be carded at the door, carded at the table, then carded at the bar. There were 3 groups in the entire place, and we still got slow and crappy service. I wish I had better things to say. But really.... the experience completely sours the good things about this place."
1,"Another fox restaurant concept-- healthy and simple. I liked going here, the service was great but the portions were kinda small and most of the patrons were really ugly. I did have something pretty amazing there-- a marscapone creamed corn-- it was awesome!"
1,"Love it. Last night I dropped into Romanelli's for the first time after driving past a time or two. Glad I did. It's a bakery and deli that offers a fine selections of meats, cheeses and breads. They also sell all things culinary Italia. When I stopped in it was 30-40 minutes to close. I went directly to the deli counter for a sub and was met with a challenge as I decided which to try. I opted for George's Special (ham, capicolla, salami, mortadella, pepperoni, provolone and hot peppers). Given the close proximity to closing time I was expecting a sub on older bread that had been sitting around all day but it was still soft and very fresh. The sub is easily the best I've had. Amazing. I also purchased a cannoli. I'm picky about these things. Too many places fill 'em and stock 'em and the filling makes the shell soggy. Romanelli's fills them upon order just like the Italian bakery near a friends house in Newark, NJ (until last night the best cannoli I've had). The cannoli was top notch. Simply the best. Right here in Phoenix, on one night, I had one of the best meals ever. I cannot wait to return. I only open they were open past 6pm."
1,"So Weekends are usually hubbys choice and he decided on Rock Bottom. I don't mind coming here, I really like their Mac and Cheese. You can get it with or without chicken.........years ago the chicken was this really thin shaved peppered chicken and I thought it was awful so I have since always ordered without chicken. However today Hubby chose the mac and chicken and I was surprised that now they use real chunks of shredded chicken breast!! YAY! What and improvement!! It was really good! (see pics) . I got the Turkey Bacon Cobb sandwich minus bacon =Layers of juicy oven-roasted turkey breast on grilled sourdough bread with sweet peppered bacon, sliced avocado, roasted tomatoes, sprouts and mixed greens. Topped with rosemary dressing and Bleu cheese crumbles (see pics) It was better than I expected, they forgot to put avocado on it though and the bread was really really good and for being grilled it wasnt over saturated with grease. The onion rings could have been crispier but were OK. Lame waitress today she was new but whatever...she sucked!!"
0,"OK, I am new in town so I was unaware that they are trying to change the name of this event to The Great Arizona Picnic, or something of the like. Well, thank God because when I hear ""culinary,"" my mind certainly does not think of Dos Gringos...or any of the other Vendors represented at this event. And why the hell, after paying to enter, would I pay again to enter the fenced areas!? WTF!? I come from a town where festivals are managed better than most corporations so I believe that I am spoiled, but there is no excuse for the long lines encountered here. I counted over 60 people in line waiting for pizza...pizza! Lines to enter, lines to use the ATM, lines to purchase tickets, lines to eat, lines to pee...... Obviously I feel passionate about this particular review, and for those that love this festival, I apologize. I will say that many people with whom I had spoken who had been coming to this festival for years said that it is no longer what it once was. On a positive note, the people watching is tremendous. I have never seen so many beautiful people in one location in my life. And I would agree that it all depends on the company. Great friends make this a fun event."
1,Foodie from Cali here on business. Nicely done dishes with authentic flavor. Ling Shrimp to die for - at ridiculous bargain prices. 5 stars if they expand menu. Very nice family setting.
1,"Blue Saguaro has been doing the same menu of breakfast sandwiches (seriously delicious - toasted sourdough drenched in salty butter, egg over medium, crispy bacon and melty American but not Kraft cheese) and lunch sandwiches & salads for over 10 years. There's a reason that it hasn't really changed: It works. The lunch menu has specialty vs regular sandwiches. Most of the specialty are loaded up with sandwich fixings you're not going to get in a chain shop - cream cheese, sprouts, avocado that wasn't spread on thinner than mustard. The bread is bakery quality and there's a decent selection. The ambience is non existent, but when you're grabbing lunch on the run it really doesn't matter. They are super fast, but that may be because I always tip a buck. :)"
1,"This place is great if you are looking for something sweet and are in Scottsdale. I had the tin roof sundae and it was out of this world. I love sweet and salty together. Sugar Bowl is also open late so its a great place to go if you are hungry or drunk or have the muchies and need something good to eat. The service, however, is a little slow and I would never dream of going during normal hours (I have been late at night) with the amount of kids that are probably there!"
0,If you like the stuck up Scottsdale vibe this is a good place for you. The food isn't impressive. Nice outdoor seating.
1,"Sportsman's is on top of the game when it comes to wine! The staff is more knowledgeable and helpful than any other place that I have bought wine at before. I didn't feel like I was being judged for trying to find a cheaper bottle and there was no pretentiousness in the air. While I was inquiring about dry resling, one of the vino gurus offered to get me a taste of one from their bar - and came back with TWO samples for me to try! Sportsman's also has a very intriguing liquor section - I enjoy wandering around and looking at all the fabulous bottles I have never seen nor heard of. Several times a month, they offer complimentary wine tastings and special discounts on most of the bottles being sampled. They also have a full service restaurant/bar off to the side where they have a huge ""by the glass"" list - you are also welcome to pick out any bottle from their store, they cork it free of charge, and you can enjoy your retail priced bottle with dinner! The portabello sliders that I had for dinner were amazing and I am still having dreams about them! My one complaint is petty: their website. Its overrun with text and finding important information is difficult, it also needs to be better updated with their amazing tasting events!"
1,"I really like eating here. I have only been for lunch, and I have found that the service is competent and friendly, and the food comes out FAST. I've probably eaten at MBFGR five or seven times, and the only time I had a problem was on my last visit, where they served me a plate with cold fries. This was a mistake, as I had a slight hangover and really, really wanted my gyros pita and fries that day, so I asked for fresh fries. Well, whether it was to apologize or to be sassy I can't say, but either way, I ended up receiving the biggest fattest plate of fresh, hot fries I've ever seen. They definitely made up for their faux-pas. I'm a huge fan and will be back many, many times. Opa!"
1,"My daughter began taking classes at Encore 6 years ago. At the time she had a bit of an attitude and didn't do too well with other girls. She instantly fell in love with Regina and took numerous classes from hip hop (her first choice) to ballet, jazz, and lyrical. I watched my daughter blossom into an amazing young woman as well as an amazing dancer. Regina involves the girls and boys in the competition experience so that they have more opportunity to learn confidence and self esteem. My daughter has had the opportunity to travel to California and Las Vegas with the studio to participate in Nationals and Master Classes. Encore is not JUST family owned, it is a family environment. I checked other studios but found a less than friendly welcome to new participants. I couldn't recommend anything more than Encore and the skills that your child learns. My daughter now works at the studio as well as dancing and my youngest daughter is taking her first classes now. I am looking forward to another 6 years or more with the Encore family."
1,"Stumbled into this place while vacationing in Scottsdale for Spring Training. I was suffering from one of those hangovers that makes you feel your pulse in your dome. My buddy(who was campaigning for breakfast at Taco Bell..who does that?) was driving like a kamikaze pilot and responded to the vehicle full of people pointing towards Paradise and grunting uggghhh. While walking up to the door an odd brown dribble stain was pointing us towards the entrance. Didn't know what to make of this. Also wasn't sure if it was from my friends who had plodded in ahead of me. Once entering this fine establishment my not-so-working-correct brain couldn't comprehend the two different counters. Also confusing was the two menus. Being told what was going on by a nice gal behind the counter didn't help much since English was definitely my second language at this point in time. After just pointing at what I needed I was ushered along to the cash register. I got my number sat with my group and waited.....and waited......and waited. As more time passed I began to ponder what the actual construction and building time for a croissant sandwich was. Also helping was my wife reminding me of every person that got there food ahead of me. We were asked how are food was a couple of times so I figure they could sense my frustration as to not having it. Then my glorious croissant sandwich was brought to me. It tasted absolutely magnificent. I could have died right then and been happy. To make up for this delay the manager brought us THREE boxes of cookies. I didn't catch her name, but damn if she didn't pass customer relations 101. Tossing me a free OJ would've been sufficient, but to give this wild pack of drunken animals munchies for the weekend went above and beyond. I will definitely crawl back in the next time I visit Scottsdale."
1,"I enjoyed our night at Suede. My husband I got there early and grabbed a few drinks ($4 Trump Vodka drinks- sa-weet!) and headed out to the patio. I really liked the design of the place, especially the huge outdoor area. Since we got there early in the night there wasn't a DJ playing yet and the only other patrons were two other young men. As the night went on the crowd grew ever more interesting- from the undergrads that shared a table with us to the large group of 30/40 something men at the next table to what I would call here in Boston ""fashionably challenged"" girls and meathead boys. The DJ started around 10 and man, it brought me right back to my sophomore year in college. (Circa 2000-2001) He was spinning all the hits from 7 years ago! Not that I didn't enjoy my sophomore year, it was awesome, it was just not expected. Once again, it was another place in Scottsdale where we only spent about $50 or so on drinks for the night. All in all though I did enjoy Suede and my husband and I will definitely be returning."
1,"Shame on me for not writing a review sooner. Dined here with three other friends during our Spring Training trip at the end of March. We had to make reservations about 2 months prior as well. We arrived for our 6:30pm reservations and the place was packed! The bar was flowing, both dining areas were filled with people and the entry area was bustling. As we waited for our table, Muhammed Ali walked in with his wife and family members. That was a huge highlight. This place is rich with sports memorbillia and players often eat here after a game. Only odd thing was our waitress told us after that the Brewers Manager was also dining in the next room and that we could walk over there if wanted to. I am a super fan of baseball, but even I know the limits of someone's personal space. We each ordered a few appetizers, bottle of wine and some salads before our entrees. I ordered the 10 oz ribeye and it was delicous. We ordered a side of mac and cheese and it had lots of flavor. This place is fun because of the sporting atmosphere, fans, players, coaches, etc. and it's walkable from Downtown Scottsdale. I'd definitely go back here again next year. For all the ladies, this place is a must visit for some great eye candy."
1,"Great down and dirty Mexican. Chips 1st quality: substantial. Salsas tasty and spicy. Chicken Victoria tender. Didn't have, but the Sopapillas look awesome. Fun colorful atmosphere, good mex music."
1,I am a Regus member and could get wait here since I could use my membership card. Its a great place situated on 3rd floor with awesome city view. Complimentary menu is refreshing. Cordial staff. Quiet and relaxed environment. Many TV screens and seatings to get comfortable with.
1,"I've been here a couple of times. The first time was on first fridays. I expected it to be packed, but I was able to walk right in and be seated. They had a table reserved and they must not have shown, so we lucked out. I got the Sante Fe, a roast beef panini, and it was great. They had some good beers on tap too. Its a cool little funky place to grab a good sandwhich. The second time I came here it was after a concert. There was some horrible band playing that I wish would have shut up so I could hear the people in front of me without having to feel sharp pains in my ear, but the meal was still good and I liked it. Any place that is open late close to downtown is perfect, especially since the kitchen doesn't close until 12:30"
1,My pants get tight when I think about Pho Thanh. There is little else that I can say that would more accurately convey my love for this restaurant.
1,"A group of us were there for drinks late Saturday night, the bar is really cool, well thought out and decorated. Drink menu, cocktails and draft beers are all exceptional. Only challenge was it was almost impossible to get the attention of the bar staff, I am not sure that since we were a large group and had a tab running that only one batman could serve us but it was really frustrating having bar staff just ignore us! Other wise the place is great........"
1,"MMMMM. Let me break it down for you...when you can hear staff in the kitchen saying ""oh wow, that looks amazing"" as plates are coming up in the window, you're in for a treat. I mean the fact that they see these dishes time and time again and are still excited by them....! Then flash forward to the next day and if you're heating up second lunch (I like to eat) in the office micro and employees comment on the delicious smells, yeah you're doing a-ok! I was solo this time because Gabi M was home with baby Mess and I didn't think to call Jarred (sorry bud!). Eating alone certainly wasn't as much fun but it was delicious. Eggplant is a must. You just HAVE TO get it, done. In addition I also had a really yummy chicken dish with wide noodles, veggies, basil, and a spicy/sweet sauce. SO tasty. The portions are enormous, so don't balk at the prices. Grab two entrees, share with the group, take home leftovers...that simple ;). Know Before You Go: I'm only in Scottsdale one every other month and Tottie still remembers me when I come in, and that rocks! Big fan."
1,"I have to say I was pretty disappointed with our brunch experience here. Ok class, let's have a lesson. What makes a good, traditional, Eggs Benedict? Easy question, you say? Answer: Nice crispy, toasted English muffin, meat of your choosing (let's go with Canadian Bacon), creamy delicious Hollandaise. What am I missing, class? Ah yes, a beautiful poached egg, which bursts when pierced, spilling it's silky, golden yolk. Ok so now that we've had our lesson, let's put it into practice. My eggs Benedict was served with three quartered tomatoes, very very very crunchy potatoes with no seasoning and two eggs Benedict. One was completely missing a yolk! Bummer. When our server came over, I told him and he brought out a new one, but the yolk was overcooked. Bummer, times two. My friend also had an overcooked egg on his plate. For the prices they're charging, we should have had four perfectly cooked eggs and well seasoned potatoes. It's brunch, not brain surgery. The space is beautiful, and the server was pleasant, but I won't come back. Too many other places to try for brunch."
1,"Fabulous! This was my son- in -laws Restaurant Week choice and an excellent one. Lots of menu choices, a drink included and excellent service from the moment we arrived until we left. We will return soon and often."
1,"I have been through plenty of airports around the world and I have to say that this one is on the better end. It is easy to navigate, clean (from what I have experienced), and makes getting to and returning rental cars a breeze. As in most airports, those who are not used to recent travel REALLY hold up the security check line. I would think they would want to be prepared and get through that check as quickly as possible and I held my breath when one young lady came back out in search of a 1 quart zip lock bag, fearing that we would have to evacuate the terminal for her breech, but we were all able to make our flights. A word to pet lovers who insist on traveling with their four-legged friends: allergies and asthma plague a large number of people and difficulty breathing caused by YOUR pet presents an unexpected glitch in their travel day. PLEASE CONSIDER LEAVING YOUR PETS AT HOME. An unplanned trip to the ER as a result of YOUR inconsideration should be YOUR responsibility. What do you say about that, health care providers??? In all my travels, this has been the only time I have been stuck behind the hairiest cat I have ever seen in my life because its owners had more baggage than humanly possible to manage. Clueless to others distress as the owners, their pet left wheezing, sneezing, itching, gasping travelers in its wake. Are you from Naperville?"
1,"Went here tonight with a friend and we had a wonderful experience! We decided to start with the calamari which was just ok but I am more partial to the fried versions so that could have been part of the problem it was a little on the rubbery side and wasn't packed full of flavor. The bread that came with it though was absolutely amazing, hands down one of the best breads I have ever had. It also had a mini salad with it that had a wonderful dressing so we focused more on the bread and salad as opposed to the calamari. For dinner I decided to go with the lamb and potatoes which was 3.5/5 stars. It had decent flavor but I definitely have had better. The potatoes were very delicious though :) My friend had the duck and potatoes and it wasn't gamey and fell right off the bone which was great. It had good flavor but once again I have had better. For desert I got the pear/almond pastry(tart? can't remember) and it was absolutely amazing!! Soooo delicious and had a great balance of sweetness and was the perfect size. My friend got the blueberry and lavender desert with red cake and white chocolate which was very good as well and you could taste the lavender which was delicious but overall I don't think I would have been able to eat the entire thing myself as the sweetness level was very high. This was a very cute restaurant and the staff was wonderful and very helpful. We had a great experience here and are looking forward to returning! I definitely recommend people try this!"
1,"As a vegetarian with a fairly adventurous palate, I love Ethiopian food. And now that I work in northern Tempe, I'm here all the time. It's filling, flavorful and inexpensive. I can have a pretty big dinner for less than $10. If you, like me, think spiced (though not particularly spicy) vegetables are the greatest things on Earth, definitely pay a visit to Blue Nile."
1,"I was introduced to SanTan Brewery two years ago on a very cold, winter evening. My cousin knew I would instantly fall in love with this place, simply because I just love fine craft beer. He was surely right because I visit SanTan three times a week because I simply cannot get enough of their beer selection. It's like an adventure every time I go. The staff is fantastic not because they're very nice and friendly, but they have the same passion and enthusiasm for fine craft as I do, so relating to them in that respect makes the experience fantastic. I normally do not engage in writing reviews on websites like this, simply because I personally tell the management team my best regards but I will for this because people really do need to experience the joys this brewery has to offer. SanTan is the new level of drinking and dining experience. It's relaxed, fun mature environment and you can start a conversation with anyone there. Enough reading this review, go try it out yourself."
1,"This is my favorite Pho place in Arizona. The menu is diverse, an the staff is friendly. They will answer any and all questions. I've heard them giving ""lessons"" on how to eat pho several times. The food is great, and the keep the drinks filled. I've never had a complaint, and I've been there numerous times. You will not be disappointed."
1,The pizza's very good! Unusual in that you have to order and pay first but they different combo pizzas are good. My favorite so far is the spicy chicken.
1,"i dont know why i didn't fall in love with pita jungle sooner. i work right next to the mall so the food court is super convenient for us. let me tell you a story of how i ate here everyday for lunch for a week. i ordered a standard gyro with no pickles (they put pickles on their gyros and i find that disgusting) my coworker, jen, ordered the pasta salad with chicken on top. mine was delicious and i tasted hers. hers was so good! i was like, that's what i'm ordering tomorrow. the next day we went again and i ordered the chicken pasta. while waiting for the food to come out someone in front of me picked up their order of a hummus trio with chicken on top and a side of pita. the next day jen asked where i wanted to go to lunch. i said pita jungle and i got my hummus trio. and the trend continued. their food is so good!!!! and its like $8!! and since i work nearby i get a discount! today i had a side of chicken breast with super fresh mushrooms. i watched them steam them, then put them in a pan with w tons of garlic, red wine, and seasoning. some of the best mushrooms i've ever had and it was a HUGE order of mushrooms. i love this place!"
1,"In town for our 5 year wedding anniversary. Sushi is one of our favs, so, after doing some reading on Yelp, off we went to Sakana. I must agree with many other Yelpers...the nigiri is fantastic! Huge, tasty pieces of super fresh fish. I'm craving it now as I'm writing this! I'm so glad I read the reviews and ordered several items from the nigiri menu...it was fantastic. The rolls, while well priced, were a little disappointing. Maybe it was just our selections, but nothing really jumped out at us...everything was pretty bland. We asked our server for recommendations and everything was a California roll plus this or that. Pretty blah. Even the Mexican Caliente Roll was rather uneventful. The service was awesome. Everyone was friendly, efficient, well organized. The atmosphere was rather mainstream, which was fine with me. I did have to laugh, as the first song we heard when we sat down was a Pitbull song, which another reviewer bemoaned. The volume wasn't offensive, so it really only served to make me laugh. The customer appreciation menu and Kirin beer special is genius. So many customer appreciation menus are pretty sparse, but theirs is well fleshed out and offers a lot of options. We each ordered Kirins while we waited for our table (we were told it would be 15-20 minutes, but it was maybe 5 minutes) and got 2 appetizers for 50 cents each. Pretty cool. (The scallop poppers were yummy. The edemame was, well, edamame. Not a huge serving, but what do you want for .50?) All in all, a good dinner. We know when we go for sushi that it's probably going to be a pricy night. Not at Sakana...it was probably the best meal we had in Scottsdale at the very best price. If we're back in town, we will definitely return. I'll just get more creative in my roll selection...or maybe just stick with the nigiri :) Yum!"
1,We live by and love this place! Happy hour is most def the biggest bang for your buck! Try the shrimp boil but only if you like your shrimp a little spicy!
1,"I met up with a friend for dinner here the other night. It's a little far from me, unfortunately; if this was within a few miles of me, I'd be here a -lot-. For starters, the place is easy to miss. It's a hole in the wall. It's very small inside, only a few tables; definitely consider takeout. That said, if it's not busy, don't be afraid to stay. We ate in; when there was a significant lull in the crowd, the girl behind the counter came both to clear our tables and to deliver a second item I ordered a bit later in the evening. I wish I'd been carrying cash, there is a tip jar by the register, and I would have loved to have left something for that. The food...ah, the food. Great bang for the buck. Have I had better tacos? Yes. Once, handmade by a Mexican immigrant my mother was good friends with, as we joined her for a family dinner. In restaurants? No. This is good Mexican street food, small hand made corn tortillas with flavorful, moist meat on them, and some warm salsa on top. Lovely. They even offer lengua, for those that like it, a very nice touch. As others have said, the rice is very good; I wasn't actually that fond of the beans though. Is this place worth going 20 minutes out of your way? Unfortunately, no, hence the 4 star. But is it worth going to if you're already nearby? Yes, very much yes."
0,"I received a buy one entree, get one free coupon for joining their fan club membership so my son and I went this morning for breakfast. Got there around 9am. Greeted and seated immediately in a nice booth. Waitress was quite knowledgeable and took our order after giving us time to peruse the menu. I ordered the Country fried steak and eggs which comes with OJ, country potatoes and toast as did my sons breakfast which he ordered the standard bacon and eggs with an extra egg. We both agreed that the breakfast was OK, both our potato sides were cold. I had a small thick dollop of gravy on my country fried steak, which was quite good but had to ask for extra gravy. Put in a serving bowl it was so thick it wouldn't pour so I used a spoon. I spread it on my Country fried steak with a butter knife much like you would a piece of toast. Weird! Watch out for the coffee. If you are offered flavored coffee it is extra. Hidden charges for everything. In other words, even with the coupon the total came to almost $20.00. for 2 average breakfasts. (tip, cancer donation, etc.) I had to do a double take on the check to see if they included the coupon. Nothing really bad but nothing really good either. I should have known better! Probably not coming back. My son seconds the motion."
1,"Mole sauce was amazing! Chicken was a little dry, but searously the mole sauce was good enough to eat with a spoon. Skip the fundido. The waiter could not explain some of the items on the menu, which was funny. The hicima tostado was great! so was the mango crab salad."
1,"How this place has less than four stars is a mystery to me. I have been 5 times and have taken out of towners here 2 out of the 5 and they all left saying it was yummy too. The El Presidential Especiale is a MUST - i order 86 the onions and add machaca/shredded beef. They are a simple yummy combination with their rice and beans. This is just straight up classic mexican food - not for the snobby. So if you want a more classy joint that's less authentic - hit up Z'Tejas cause this place is not for you. The hot salsa in the ketchup bottles is always a sign of a great mexican joint (and it's hot AND tastey - a combination not many get correct). I will say their chips can be a little on the less crunchy, more oily side but they are more than happy to replace that with some that are a little more to your liking. And their margs are delish as well. This place deserves a 4 because of consistency, friendly and accomodating atmosphere and just downright solid take on enchiladas - red sauce is spot on. Thanks Tee Pee for being our go-to for Mexican food in the Valley of the Sun!"
1,"I usually hate chains, especially Italian ones like Olive Garden and Romanos. But I was pleasantly surprised my Maggianos. We went because we got a gift card for Christmas but we are probably going back. The bread and the dipping oil they start you out with is pretty good. I wish the dipping oil was just a little more seasoned though. My husband ordered the linguine and clams which he said was just ok. My stepson had the crab and shrimp cannelloni which he enjoyed. I really liked my eggplant Parmesan. It is the best egg parm I have had at a chain. The sauce is fresh tasting which huge chunks of garlic. One nice surprise is that our server said that my dish qualified for a free take home dish of the same category. So I ordered the gnocchi and had a nice dinner the next day."
1,"This review is for the take-out window at the original Red Devil restaurant. I grew up in this neighborhood and have come here since I was a wee lass. I remember begging my mom to get out of the car so I could stand in front of the pick-up window and ""help"" her carry the pizza to the car. I still come here because the pizza is amazing, they always have a large cheese & wings combo on special, they make their own super-chunkily-creamy-delicious bleu cheese dressing and the guys who work at the pick-up window are super-sweet (even when it's blazing hot outside, and inside, near the ovens). Sure, you have to remember a random number they give you at a moment where you'll never be able to find a pen or something to write with in order to pick up your order (like Carolina's), but it's still my favorite pizza complete with a chewy, delicious crust. Enjoy."
1,"Absolute greatness!!! Service: friendly Food: TRY the faux chicken wings (I crave this) Kung pao noodles Vegan chilli fries Ambiance - A+ Tip: don't order the faux chicken wings Togo. Soggy experience plus they add the carrots, cucumber, celery in the box and close it. Equals the case of raw cooked veggies. Go next door to nami for dessert!!"
0,"No way am I coming back here! The shoes seem to be made poorly, but I haven't actually kept a pair of shoes and I never will because I'm never coming back. I bought one pair because I thought they were cute, but quickly changed my mind so I returned them. Do you know how many people asked my WHY I'm returning them? In a very rude manner, literally all the people who were working there. Not only did it make me uncomfortable but they lost a customer because of it as well."
1,"Fantastic place! we went tonight for my friends birthday-they were able to seat 15 of us without a problem. Our waiter, Tim, was fantastic-he split the checks for everyone before we even asked. They gave the birthday girl two pieces of delicious dessert on the house. The food was great-we were all surprised by how large the portions were for the price. Everyone was very polite and accommodating I look forward to going back!"
1,"I've done the Shabu Fondue more times than I can count! Usually, I order a cheese fondu for myself, and my main man gets a Shabu dish. They both apply the same concepts... dip something fresh into something very hot and cook it yourself with long sticks. Mm! I've tried all the cheese fondues, and the Swiss is my favorite. That smell is unforgettable. I've tried all the Shabu sauces too, and they're all pretty strong, so they season those boring vegetables right up. The cocktail menu should not be over-looked. The caramel apple martini is the best!!! Now the chocolate fondue.... Oh it's so good! They serve it with marshmallows, fruit and even a slice of cheesecake to dip in! For a very small price, you can also add a shot of liquor. (I personally always add a shot of Bailey's to add some flavor.) This is a PERFECT date restaurant, and it's not bad for groups either. The dcor is pretty rad too. The portions are healthy, but it only works if you end the dinner with the chocolate..."
1,"Bike cabs beware! You've got nothing on this rig! Tour de Tavern is a tribute to tipsy teamwork and a perfect way to host a unique group event. As ""pedalers"" on their inaugural tour, we enjoyed the celebrity treatment of cruising down the winding streets of Old Town Scottsdale as onlookers snapped photos and cheered us on! We rocked out to top 40 hits and, by special request, our Lonely Island favorites on their awesome sound system. Our guides were flexible and let our party run the show. If we needed more time for let's say...... an impromptu horseback ride in front of Shotgun Betty's, they were more than happy to wait. As an added bonus everyone gets to burn off some of those unwanted cocktail calories in between your favorite watering holes. If you are concerned that after a few stops (and a few shots) your legs might lose some of that forward momentum, there are a few coveted ""non pedaling"" seats in the back of the bike. We all compromised with a friendly and fair rotation system. Our tour guides were helpful, accommodating, and entertaining. They even proved to be exceedingly patient upon discovering that we did in facts have ""that guy"" in our group. If you're saying to yourself, ""Such a marvelous experience could only cost an arm and least the majority of a leg"" then you would be wrong! With the cost of gas being substituted for sheer earth friendly man power, our group of fifteen people spent less than $30 bucks each for the experience. But wait, there's more! Included in this price are all the amazing special deals that Tour de Tavern exclusively brings you at select bars along the route. On our tour we were offered drinks specials ranging from $3 to ONE PENNY! I say this in all caps because it's ONE PENNY! So next time you are planning an event, I recommend Tour de Tavern 100%! ""Look Ma! No hands!"""
1,"Half of Bottles of Wine! Open 7A to 12A 7 Days a Week. My Florist displays one of the Valley's largest sings and salad menus. The story of name comes from an old flower shop and the current owners of My Florist continued to use the sign and name. The fresh products, from the bread to the veggies and fruits equals four stars to me. The service is friendly and the servers know their stuff but I have never been blown away by the service operations. Dessert, Amazing, This is a place that I will drive to just to have a dessert and perhaps some wine to go along with it. The place takes reservations late so don't be afraid to stop in late. LIve music Tuesday - Sunday. Nicole Pesce plays the piano W-S ((Please Send me a message if you know of any other restaurants with live music)) The relaxed atmosphere is created by a very open dinning area. And don't forget to go next door during the day to visit Willio Grocery. I'm amazed how different the reviews are for the restaurant. Please see for your self and see why so many people yelp (good or bad) about the place."
1,"I recommend this to everyone. I have never had a bad meal here. Inexpensive, great service, off the beaten path. Love this place."
1,"I can only add my gushing praise to the other reviews. Not only is the food outstanding (pork osso bucco, green chile stew and pecan/fig pie), but the ambiance and service really help make this place a standout. So many places have arrogant, stuffy service, so Scottsdale. Not so here. Also, the waitstaff had opinions about the food - which dishes are his favorite and why. Elegant but comfortable atmosphere, reasonable prices, and a real enthusiasm from the staff (and a chef, who came to visit with folks that he knew who were sitting near us). The food is rich, but did not seem unhealthily so - not bathed in salt and heavy cream sauce. Perfect portion size, with a balance - meat, grains and veggies. So happy that Beckett's is in the neighborhood! (Oh - and no valet! I hate valet parking when there is an ample adjacent parking lot, and spots are only limited because the valets put their cones in the available spots.)"
1,These guys have some yummy donuts and the prices are great. Their donuts seems to be more authentic... they feel more hand made than machine made. I'll be back.
0,such a confusing airport
1,"So I finally got a chance to go here for the first time, and YUMMY is the word to describe this joint. My advice get the challah French toast. My Wife got an omelet it was really delicious too. I need to come back and try the Amanda Burrito."
1,"Stop everything you're doing and go get one of their brownies, warmed up, with an ice cold glass of milk. I'll never be the same."
1,The veg burger is fantastic - make sure you ask to try all the different aioli sauces especially with the tots!
1,"Are you looking to get a cat? if so, check out PetSmart. My wife and I adopted a kitten here and she's awesome. There are always several cats (occasionally dogs) looking for a good home, some older cats (a few years old and some kittens.) There is an adoption fee, but the cats will come with their shots and are neutered/spayed. We also use this store to get both wet and dry food and toys on occasion. There are many sizes and brands to choose from at good prices. The food is cheaper at PetSmart than Petco, unless the item is on sale. I would recommend to get a PetSmart card to save a few bucks. The store is always clean and staff very friendly and helpful."
1,"Love my Chick-fil-a! Wow, they have a system and it is super fast in the drive thur. Amazed and they are always super friendly! They always get the order right!!! ++++"
1,"I have only gotten the cafe sua da (iced coffee) here but it's the best I have had yet. When you walk in there is always fresh coffee lined up in cups on the counter ready to be mixed with sweetened condensed milk. I don't get to Mesa often but when I do I go here for the wonderful, rich, dark and creamy coffee. This is strong stuff; that first sip is so good. The richness, full flavor, creamy caramel flavors are heavenly. And as the ice melts, it mellows out the flavor a little and it's still great. I can't say I have had all the cafe sua da in the valley, but what I have had; this is my favorite. Next time I come to Mesa for work I will need to come at lunch time so I can try the pho."
1,Love it!!! Wish we still lived in Arizona as Chino is the one thing we miss. Every time I think about Chino Bandido my mouth starts watering. If I am ever in the state again I will drive out of my way just to go to it again. YUMMY!
1,"We've been in the market looking for a church for the family to start attending. Chandler Christian seemed to be a nice offering since they are located fairly close to the house and have a decent size to offer something for each group (parents & children). I've gotten some good reviews from a family that I know that attends. I LOVE that they have a service on Saturday, as that is ALWAYS a plus for me. The sermon for today was an interesting one, and it seemed to be relevant and on topic for today. The pastor took an updated slant to the story to make it a bit more relevant to today's time. My husband was even laughing at the pastor's jokes. My mother-in-law even commented on how she liked the music. I did notice that the verses that they pulled up were not the verses that I remember. I believe it's due to them using a different version. All of this being said, the service seemed to be a good one. The signage indicated that this was non-denomination; however, the service reminded me one Baptist services from childhood."
1,"Narcisse couldn't be more appropriately named...another Scottsdale scene club with a lively but predictable crowd of scantily dressed cougars, Middle Eastern royalty and upscale business folk. The music is hoppin and thumpin late and leans toward House, which is why I added two stars. We actually entered by taking an elevator up and walking through a kitchen in rather cinematic style, emerging right onto the dance floor, which was packed. I guess it pays to know someone. The champagne selection is outrageous here and packed though it was, our drinks arrived in seconds. The sky-high patio is a nice place to chill and check out the little skyline, but it's all about getting your dance on here. I would like to check it out for happy hour when fewer people are bumping into you and stepping on your feet. The Russian mobster-channeling bouncers are a little intimidating, but treated us well. An uber enthusiastic dancer knocked into my friend and shattered her Veuve glass, and all was whisked and mopped in seconds. The music sure beats the tired 90s cover bands that seem to be epidemic in this area."
1,"Yumm! Thai tea, spicy Thai beef salad, number 23a and a 32, all of it was delicious! I recommend this place. Just don't go in a hurry because you will be there a while"
1,"If there was a Cantina Laredo in my home (Los Angeles) I would dine here regularly despite the multitude and variety of Mexican dining options. Needless to say, when I'm in Scottsdale, I often find myself drawn to Cantina Laredo. From the moment you're in, to the moment you're out, Cantina Laredo takes excellent care of your tastebuds. The chips are salsa aren't filler but a real treat. Their homemade salsas are worthy of bringing in your own jars to export back home -- some of my favorite salsa anywhere. I believe they have three different kinds. Their tequila options are wonderful allowing for creative margaritas or a fine neat glass of 100% pure agave goodness. (I promise to never use that phrase again, sorry Readers.) The entrees aren't just your common taco/burrito fare. Using juicy meats, creative homemade sauces, and interesting pairings, Cantina Laredo professes its love for Mexican food and culture -- reminding diners how lovable these things are. The decor and various areas are all quite nice as well. An excellent complement to what always proves to be an excellent meal. _C$"
0,Worst enchiladas EVER and decor from a 1980's attempt at a mexican restaurant. Taco Bell is a step up! But if you like soupy enchiladas drowning in cheez wiz this is the place for you.
0,"One star would be giving it a holiday gift! For me Copper Star Coffee Shop has been a place where consistency and pride is taken in their food and presentation. Unfortunately, Circle H BBQ is nothing like the prior statement. My first visit to Circle H BBQ centered on ordering a half slap of ribs. They were extremely over-cooked. There was more charcoal on the top, back and ends that was just not editable. Once you scraped away the charcoal, on the tops, ends and the center ribs, there was one that was eatable. The company offered me a second chance to try their food, by giving me a complementary full slap. Nothing had improved. They say they smoke the ribs, but there was no odor to that effect. In face the ribs I ordered the second time spend over 20 minutes on the grill after the order was placed. Btw...the waitress at the front counter couldn't even tell be the type of rub on the ribs and the type of cut they were. When I asked if they were smoked (cooked) daily, she said some are if you get here early - others were from the refrigerator from last night. The so called ""dry-rub"" seasoning was tasteless. The BBQ sauce is major strange! The bottom line is the ribs were not worth the cost they were charging. ($14/Half for 6 bones and $26/Whole 12-13 bones both with sides) I have high hopes for the brisket, but it might be a while untill I try that endeavor. Overall if they don't change the way they 'burn"" the ribs, run, run or drive real fast to another place. The charcoal is not good for you and there is lots of it! Honey Bears, My Mothers or even driving to Famous Dave's is well worth the trip. Sorry to burst your bubble, I too, had high hops for a centrally located rib place. I'm still waiting."
0,"What. The. Heck. ?? Be prepared for sticker shock! I walked in, through the store, and made a hasty straight line back to exit. And over and across the road to Crate & Barrel - Ahhhhhh - much better! Whew!"
1,"Great food, clean a bit old but nice"
1,"I was surprised at how good the food was at this tiny place. I normally avoid the ""hole-in-the-wall"" type places, but I decided to give this one a try and SO happy I did. The food was well priced and not too greasy. The ingredients taste fresh and it has that family owned feeling."
1,"Pretty good food. The location is kind of scary, for a famous place. i was a little disappointed in their lunch menu. i am not a fan of paying $12 for a lunch plate. i don't need 10 lbs of food at lunch time, but a nice $4-5 plate of food at lunch would be great. I might return by myself, because the food is very spicy, and most people i hang out with don't like that. it was even spicy for me and i don't mind that too much."
1,"If you're willing to run out for lunch a little early, enjoy the lively patio atmosphere will dining on yummy vittles. A When-Harry-Met-Sally picky eater, I, um, grilled the waiter on seafood's sustainability and ingredient origin, and he was good-natured and knowledgeable. A perfect eatery for a casual date or girls' day out. Yay!"
1,I was very happy with the food and service. The service was wonderful and quick too.
1,"Tried this place for the first time tonight, and was impressed with absolutely everything. Well-lit building in a decent location in the Arcadia area. I drove here from the Garfield neighborhood and it was well worth it. Juicy chicken and awesome cafeteria throwback crinkle fries, along with one of the best slices of toast I've ever had. All three of these foods were still crispy when I got home, which almost never happens with fast food. I wish I had gotten the girl's name who took care of me. She was cute as a button- very enthusiastic and happy to answer my questions. I'll be back here soon!"
0,"While the menu looked promising, have no idea if the food is any good since the hostess failed to even acknowledge our presence when we walked in the door. We patiently stood there for several minutes while she walked around us to greet and seat two other parties. Since we were still unable to get her attention, we left and went to Tommy Bahama across the street."
1,"Addicted to duck fat fries! Curry mayo is a perfect complement to duck fat fries. Did I mention how awesomely delicious duck fat fries are? You know what, forget that I said anything about duck fat fries. They only make a limited amount and I don't want you to go. Nope. Don't go. I guess I should mention the rest of the menu. Everything is awesome. Nutella rules! Seriously."
1,"Who woulda thunkkkk Scottsdale, AZ would have such amazing soul food??! They surprised the hell outta me! Coming from someone who regulars Roscoes chicken &waffles... believe me when I say LOLO's is BOMB!!! I got the 3chicken combo... w greens, mac&cheese &cornbread. Cornbread.. hands down Roscoes! Greens... Roscoes Mac&cheese... LOLOs for suuuree! Chicken... tied.. they're both really good! the staff is super friendly!! can't wait to go back when i visit AZ. (="
1,"This place is so cool i was startled to find that Tempe has something like this It reminded me of the C.A.T. in Eugene. There are soo many bike parts, and tools, frames of all kinds from what i've learned is that you can pay a small sum and build your own bicycle here, or offer to volunteer and have your bike for free by working off the debt i came here a while back to see if they had anything of interest, and wouldnt you know it that on my way a nut and bolt fell off of my stirrup so i thought perfect, now i can get another the dude running the operation didnt charge me a thing so i left like a $1 in the tip jar it's such a priveledge to have something like this for the community, i just hope enough ppl reinvest their time into it so it can exist for generations of cyclists to come."
1,Love this place. Great Happy Hour.
1,"Being a stranger to town, it took a while to find it, but well worth the search. I was hungry for cajun food and thought I would give it a try, and am glad I did. I tried both the gumbo and jambalaya and both were excellent. I sat at the bar, and the service was friendly and attentive. Although it is a long drive, I will be going back as soon as I have another craving for cajun food."
1,Had lunch here with Robyn N. and Rand H. the food here was ok and I liked it better before they did the so called renovation.All they did was add a mongolian BBQ and wash the windows. Some of my favorite things on the buffet were gone so I am dropping them down to 3 stars but still it was a good lunch.
1,"Food is good. Service is pretty good. Its a restaurant that definitely reminds you of LA, as it is very loud in there. Definitely will go back."
1,Pretty tasty dogs. Pretty long wait for a hot dog.
1,"what is it with me and pricey phoenix hotels? i swear i don't just give out fives willy nilly or do i have any particular adoration for phoenix. (sorry phx.) I went to the Valley Ho on an amazing business trip that involved rock stars and the Oakland Athletics, which happen to be my favorite team. it was downright magical. the decor was fantastic, the rooms were huge, with huge tubs, a poolside patio and a comfy chaise lounge. the flatscreen TV had an iPod doc! yaaaaay! (why don't more hotels do this?) the pool was phenomenal. i sat around for days on couches drinking bloody mary's and frozen drinks. the lobby bar had a deadly but wonderful drink called the stardust. The trader vic's attached isn't so hot, but i generally liked all the food i got from the pool bar and the restaurant ZuZus. (room service too- they make their own english muffins!!!) If i'm comparing it to the royal palms, the other phoenix resort i raved about, it's tough. Royal Palms is better for chilling and families; Valley Ho is better for singles. Royal Palms is your wedding; Valley Ho the bachelorette party. Valley Ho had better food and more style, but Royal Palms had a bit more to it and better service. Really, you can't go wrong with either. What is it about Phoenix hotels??? all i know is i am no longer groaning when i'm sent on a business trip there!"
1,"I finally made it out to the Rokerij's infamous happy hour and it didn't disappoint. My girlfriend and I had a couple of the small plates, the mushroom toast and stuffed mushrooms (both amazing! but I REALLY loved the mushroom toast) and some wine. The inside is really unique to Arizona and completely relaxing. Our server Eric was super nice and chatted with us a lot about the restaurant and the menu. We will definitely be back for half priced bottles of wine and happy hour very soon!"
1,"I had lunch here the other day. It was a bit before the noon lunch rush so it wasn't too crowded. You could tell they were gearing up for it so I can tell they get pretty busy. So come early to avoid waiting with throngs of school kids that undoubtedly come from the high school next door. I like that their menu isn't huge with zillions of burger combos and other options. It was pretty straight forward. I had the standard burger, fries and a drink. Everything looks like it is pretty much cooked to order so it took a few minutes to get my food which was ok. The cashier guy who looked suspiciously like Ray Liotta was very friendly and working like crazy so I'm pretty sure he was the manager if not the owner. The burger was thick, juicy and cooked perfectly. It was a tad bit greasy but that made it that much more delicious. The fries were also pretty good. They are crinkle cut with just the right amount of crispiness on the outside and fluffiness on the inside. I wasn't exactly sure what to do with the little cup of sauce they give you so I used it for my fries and my burger. I think it was some chipotle mayo stuff. It was pretty good but an odd thing to put on burgers and/or fries. This place isn't exactly cheap but it is worth it. I can't think of a better fast food burger/fries in the area. I would return to get the burger but I really want to try their Italian beef as well."
1,"The customer sevice and ambiance here are always great. The managers have always taken care of any issue we've ever had. The prime rib is really, really good! So is the Steak Au Poivre! That said, I have to admit that the rest of the food can be pretty hit and miss. I've never had awful food here, but several disappointments. The managers and staff are so polite and work so hard to make things right that we keep coming back. The pricing is a bit high for the inconsistent quality, but well worth the early bird and happy hour pricing."
1,"The Pho was delicious, the place was cute, and the prices were decent. Also, the service was amazing! The waiter offered to warm up my son's bottle. Good service goes a long way, so we will definitely be back!"
1,"This is was, WAY out of the way for me. But when I heard about That's Amore, I just had to try it. What can I say, I love gelato! Anyway, one afternoon I talked the kids into a Sunday drive with cool gelato as the reward. While That's Amore gelateria is located in a strip mall (what in Arizona isn't?), the taste and style are pure Italian. Credit the fact that it is owned and operated by two sisters and their husbands who emigrated to Scottsdale from Italy. The murals of Italian cities on the back wall were even painted by their father, who they brought to the valley for just that purpose. How cool is that? It might not make the gelato taste better, but it almost made a ride to Pinnacle Peak feel like a trip to Napoli instead."
1,"I don't actually hunt or fish, but after visiting this place, I'd like to take up those activities. This place is like a giant outdoors amusement park. Everything you could possibly want for outdoor activities is included in this store. I could spend hours in this store just looking at everything they have available. Plus, now I know where to buy the furniture if I ever get a hunting lodge."
0,"No credit, weird layout, not much fresh food"
1,Beer heaven! What don't they have? The staff has a taste for heavy body beer so if that isn't your ONLY criteria for great beer. I would just go with your gut. Their staff does know their stuff.
1,"Creative Healing Solutions is a fantastic naturopathic doctors office. I'm so grateful that I found this place and met Dr. Roxie Strand and her wonderful assistant, Melissa. My life has changed so much for the better since April 2012 when I walked into her office super frustrated with many previously unsuccessful weight loss attempts. Dr. Roxie was attentive and thorough, and suggested I consider HCG. I had never heard of it before then, so I went home and did my research. I was a little nervous, but never felt any pressure and when I decided to give it a try, I felt very at ease being under her supervision. Now, I'm 85 lbs lighter and feel better than I have in years. I could go on and on and speak to how wonderful the program, office and Dr. Strand are, but I simply suggest that you consider visiting Dr. Roxie yourself if you are seeking to address medical issues that you haven't been able to solve before. She does a free consultation and is genuinely interested in helping find a holistic health solution for you. I never thought I could totally change my lifestyle, but Dr. Roxie definitely helped me find a way to do it and has been a major supporter in my journey, which I appreciate so much! Whether you are in need of a weight loss solution or need someone to help with other medical matters, I fully recommend Dr. Strand."
1,"Pleasantly surprised about the cleaniness of the location, the friendliness of the baristas and just the overall atmosphere. Reminds me of a small town cafe with the general coffee condiments centered for easy access. Drinks were made to order and have never failed to keep satisfied! Just need to get a drive through and all will be perfecto!"
1,"Nooooooooo! Curse the the gods of all that is delicious, for Huauchinango is now CLOSED. Replaced by some generic grill that offered us some nachos and quesadillas, thanks for that. So not only did you replace a great eatery, but you also had to throw in a little bit of extra salt in the wound. So, I don't think I'll be giving my business to the devil grill anytime soon. Huauchinango, you shall now only be a distant whiff of habanero al pastor memory. You shall be missed."
1,This location has closed. Went by today and found an empty restaurant.
1,"So, if I rated The Grind based solely on the Sweet and Spicy Burger, I would give it a Woohoo, five star rating, but, I'm not , just thought you should know, you need to get that burger if you come here. I was a little surprised to see how small this restaurant is when my mom and I decided to come here for lunch (she was wanting burgers). This place reminds me of a narrow cave that happens to have a long bar with about 18 stools, six larger booths that can fit five patrons comfortably, four table tops, and three double occupancy booths. The bar is pretty cool, its lined with red lights and has eight rather large flat screen TVs you can see from the stools and the larger booths that we were seated at. I opted for the Sweet and Spicy burger ($12), thanks to Yelp, and my mom went with a plain ole cheeseburger ($11). Knowing that the burgers do not come with anything, we decided to order the sweet potato fries ($5) and both got iced teas ($2.5 each). My burger was delicious and was everything the title said it would be...sweet and spicy thanks to the sweet glazed jalapenos. I also enjoyed the crunchy, deep fried ratatouille, yum. My mom wasn't impressed with her simple cheeseburger and said she would order mine if she were to come back and we both enjoyed sharing the sweet potato fries. Brent, our server, did a great job with suggestions and service. As lunch time got more busy and he got more tables he was always checking in with us and even put our iced teas in to-go cups. This place was, as the default Yelp display states, a-ok. I'm glad I tried The Grind, but probably wouldn't suggest this place for lunch, but wouldn't hesitate to come back here if it is suggested by friends. Breakdown: one star for being a narrow cave one star for the Sweet and Spicy Burger -and- one star for Brent, our awesome waiter."
1,Back in high school I used to work in metrocenter and this place still has the best lemonade I have ever had. I have not eaten the food from here so I have no idea on the quality.
0,"After several hundred professional massages over the past 20 years, I encountered today a first -- a massage therapist who explained that she could not do a massage involving any but mild pressure using her hands. It was an issue of ""protecting the thumbs."" When I told her I didn't like forearms and elbows, she explained that she'd never worked without using her forearms (and, I assume, her elbows, too). After just five minutes, when I asked for more pressure, she suggested we stop the massage -- that she wasn't the ""therapist for [me]."" She was right. What are they teaching these people these days, and why doesn't an excellent outfit like LifeTime Fitness insist on better skills among its massage staff? I won't offer her name, but, if considering a massage at this establishment, I suggest Casie as the only therapist here worth the money."
1,"This was my go to Vietnamese restaurant for pho and rice plates not because it's my favorite but because of convenience. Pho Avina is closer to me but that place is terrible so I end up going to this place. It also helps that LeeLee Supermarket is one street over so I get a Viet fix and my Asian needs shopping in one trip. The pho and com tam is average. The service is fast and friendly enough. I do find it a big stingy that they don't bring out the bowl of broth/soup before you get your rice plate unless you ask for it. All in all this place is fine if you just want an average meal; nothing to rave about here. If I felt like driving farther, I'd definitely hit up Pho Van in Chandler for pho or Com Tam Thuan Kieu in Mesa for com tam."
1,My favorite sushi restaurant ever! I love their ama ebi nigiri (sweet shrimp) and always craving for more. For this visit I tried their dynamite scallop roll and salmon roll (with asparagus inside) and it was so delicious makes me craving for more. The pork ribs were very delicate and it was melting in your mouth! What makes this restaurant to be my number one spot of Japanese restaurant in the valley was the sushi chef service is superb! They ran out ama ebi and I told the waitress that one of the reason I came there is for that ama ebi. The chef suddenly came back to me one hour later and said he saved one ama ebi for me!!! What a service!!!! I'm so thankful of this wonderful dining experience and will definitely become one of their regular customer!! Love this place so much!!
1,"We got passes for the preview of Mission Impossible (Ghost Protocol). We enjoyed the movie a lot. The theater itself is fine. The chairs don't move, and you can't raise the arm rests. No rocking, no reclining (granted most theater seats don't move a lot, but these don't move at all). Otherwise the seats were reasonably comfortable. The screen is IMAX (i.e. huge), and the sound was reasonably good. They could have put a little more slope into the auditorium seating. In other IMAX theaters I've been in it seemed the heads of people in front of you NEVER block any portion of the screen. But I found a few were just slightly into the bottom of the screen. It wasn't bad, but given my other IMAX experiences I did notice it."
1,Similar to Joe's Farm grill we make sure this is one of our regularly yearly places to hit whenever we can. Piles of BBQ'd meat? Yes please Free birthday meal? Hell yeah Homemade rootbeer? I'm moving in We've had consistently great food and service every visit and to top it off on my birthday they gave my friend a free meal too because he was in the military. You can't beat that kind of hospitality
1,This is the best Cajun place in Arizona. The portions are great and the people behind the counter are really nice. I love gumbo and I have tried several kinds here and all of them were excellent. Yes the decor isn't 5 stars but seriously if you're more worried about mood lighting and soft cushions you can go to Pappadeaux's and get charged an arm and a leg for lower quality food. the drive and the price are definitely worth it for this place.
1,"This place is fantastic. About the restaurant itself. It's right by downtown Phoenix, and in fact right next to a Light Rail stop--so keep this in mind, parking is metered and sometimes hard to come by easily, if you live by a light rail this may be the smarter option. The place is seriously tiny, only about 6-8 groups of people can be seated at one time. A slight drawback is that there is limited outdoor seating, which, given the predictably large lines even on weekdays, is a problem. The Phoenix sun will make a 45 minute wait seem like an hour and a half wait. Now about the service. I've always had a good experience with the people who work here. The first time I came here, apparently one of the owners saw that I looked lost, because she came out and very kindly explained how people are seated, where I can go to get coffee in the meantime. She even suggested I leave my cell phone number and she'll call me when my seat is ready, in case I'm shopping for example. The waitresses always serve us quickly and never leave us hanging, and they're always smiling, which for some reason makes the experience so much better. Now for the best part. I swear, they put crack in their food, because although their breakfast options are simple, they are out of this world. The first time I came here I got the waffles. Perhaps it's because they use REAL maple syrup, or all of the ingredients are organic and locally grown, but they make the best waffles I've ever had. I don't even know how one makes a good waffle really, it seems pretty formulaic, but it's stellar. I ordered it with bacon, which was also wonderful--the bacon used was the good stuff, not the excessively fatty bacon you buy at the supermarket. Every bite is spectacular, and when you're done, you're full, but not the kind of full you'll often get at breakfast joints where you think you're going to explode or take a nap--full, but refreshed. The second time I came I got the pancakes. Not the best pancake I've ever had, but still, superb and the real maple syrup just sends it through the roof. The third time I went I got the waffle again (see above). Before I came here, I was excited about leaving Phoenix for New York due to the incredible array of dining options you get in that city. Now I'm worried there won't be anything as good!"
1,"Not the best burger I've ever had, but a fun place to try with the coworkers on a Friday afternoon. I had the quadruple bypass and a few helpings from the all-you-can-eat fry station. Better than BK/McD's, but nothing to write home about. The waitresses were hot and they happily wheeled me out to my car in a wheelchair! But it's more of an attraction than anything else."
1,"I just re-visited Cheese 'N Stuff this weekend after a while. I guess just eat during their limited hours very often. They close very early (4pm). I love their liverwurst sandwiches and the Bismark but this time I decided to try the Doughboy people speak of minus mayo as I do not enjoy warm sandwich lubrication. As ever the place is tiny, homey and spotlessly clean. I had some of the hot German Potato salad as a side and a ginger ale. All were yummy, delicious and satisfying! As I was eating I had a yen for a Celery Soda to go with this classic sandwich but I've only been able to get them at Chompie's in the valley. There are loads of interesting European cookies to get packages of as dessert so grab a couple of friends when you go but carpool as the lot is smallish. I guess they stopped giving pickles with sandwiches, bummer."
1,Best Thai food!!! Order the dry garlic chicken.
1,"Great staff without an attitude (which is rare in Scottsdale). As I was waiting for my party to arrive, I was sitting outside drinking my beer and eating my food. Without ANY questions and/or hassle, my bill was transferred inside when my party arrived. Not only that, but our waiter remember exactly what I had and was able to split it without me even asking him to do so. OK, how great is that? I am totally sold on the service there an I will definitely come back. Very nice unpretentious place."
1,"Very nice, classy decor all around, cleaner than most places I've seen. Seems like a place you'd wanna dress up for. Drinks could be a little cheaper ($9 a shot), but I figure it's Scottsdale, so whatevs.. Music ranges anywhere from old school hip hop to top 40's music you hear straight from the radio. No cover, so that's always a plus."
1,I've been going to Orange theory for awhile and I can't believe how much I've toned up and slimmed down!!! I haven't bulked up and now I'm on my way to getting my bikini body back!! I highly recommend this work out!! It's so awesome and I can't believe I can get my full work out in an hour!!!
1,"Just OK. But like pizza and sex, there really is no bad BBQ. I think there is something lost in translation from its Texas roots to AZ. Gone is the appeal of the gas station dive. Atmosphere feels a little phony in a pretty, new building. The biggest problems I have with the food is the overpowering mesquite flavor and mediocre sauces. The Texas roots explains the loyalty to mesquite, which is understandable and you cant fault them for staying true... but a little hickory or less creosote-tasting smoke would be nice for a non-Texas palette. The sauces seem a little amateur. I know Rudy's is no amateur in the business, but I think they settled too soon on their signature sauces - they taste like the first ones I made in my backyard. If a true amateur (me) can evolve into better sauces, so can Rudys. Now I need to stop at the new BBQ joint next door to see which one will get my BBQ dollars... stay tuned."
1,"These guys are great!I Even though they specialize in Mercedes, they never have a problem with my BMW X5. The owner, Charles, knows what he is doing and never tries to up-sell you on unnecessary work. Mary (Charles' wife) is a really sweet lady who always gives me a ride home and picks me up when the car is ready. While Aurohaus doesn't have loaner cars like the dealership, they are extremely competent, trustworthy, and charge reasonable prices for their services."
1,"Sliders, cheese firies, burgers and dogs are great! Makes us feel like we are back in Chicago without all the snow!"
0,"It's ok, quality . Service was below par, although they were really busy. Fries were good and endless I guess that's good.. But, I was looking for a good burger, too bad I didn't find it here."
1,The grilled yellow tail salmon here is out of this world! I have eaten here twice in last 8 weeks and the sushi is fresh. The miso soup is great. Everything I have tried has been delicious. The staff is fairly friendly. Looking forward to happy hour here in the near future.
1,"Didn't get to sit outside so a little disappointed. We saw the ""big assed burgers"" and all decided to get one. They were great but a bit messy. Food and service were excellent. Will try and get back for happy hour"
1,"Update: They now have Coors and Miller Lite on draft. Yay! They're a real bar again. I don't know the drama, but apparently the management has been ""let go"" and the owner is now managing the place."
1,"Teresa S. and I were one of the lucky ones to win tickets to see Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci last night at the Symphony Hall, and we were impressed with the acoustics. The overall sound quality of the live act was fantastic, so overall I'd say that the gig was pretty amazing. It's a fabulous hub of culture, but the food concessions need some urgent attention. The only munchies they have are desserts like cookies or pies, so be sure to have dinner first. One of the great things they offer is you can now pre-reserve your intermission drinks. You can pre-order your favorite libation before the show, and they will have them ready on the refreshment table. That would save you time in case you need to whiz to the loo, and not have to wait in line again to buy your drinks. Thank you again to Yelp and Arizona Opera. The show was wonderful."
1,"Some might say that Phoenix is a city without much culture. That may be true in some aspect, however we have to remember that Phoenix is a young large city compared to other cities that lie within the United States. So you can say that this city is a work in progress on catching up with everyone's culture expectations. The Japanese Friendship Garden in downtown Phoenix is only seven years old. Very new to the park scene for this metro, I have to say that it looks great and will only keep getting better in time. That will happen if people stop saying there is no culture in Phoenix and become a part of the evolving city by visiting places such as this. The admission and or donations will fund a more desired park for all. The grounds of the garden are very beautiful with a nice flowing stream, several waterfalls, coy fish, and many species of plants. I can't wait to go back in the next several years to see it become a wonderful masterpiece."
0,"Eh -- no. I stopped here for quick take-out one day while at work. They had no sushi at all (even though it's on the menu), and the menu itself isn't laid out very well for understanding what they have/what's included. I wasn't there to eat onsite, but good thing -- very little inside seating. The food wasn't all that good, and if the customer says ""to go"", then you should put utensils and napkins in the bag for me. The place didn't seem very clean either. Just not a good experience. Go somewhere else."
1,"I saw the review below and just thought it was ridiculous. RIDICULOUS. Elderly people work here or volunteer. You expect customer service that you'd receive at a high-end store. No. People die and their things that are usually in good condition are donated and are resold at really cheap prices. No, the people there will not be making sure you're finding everything okay, you're on your own... and that's how it should be when you're thrifting. I usually find great things. Glasswares, books, shoes, purses. They have amazing furniture that is so cheap. They have many half off days and various sales throughout the week. Just make sure you go on a weekday or Saturday and before 2pm.. all the stores in this plaza close at 4 and are closed Sundays."
0,"We just stopped here as Slices no longer exits at TMP :( For JUST cold meat sandwiches...they are over priced. Short variety and more than $3 for some salame, cheese in average white bread.....no thank you."
1,"Great food and service. Normally a wait on the weekend, but what would you expect."
1,"I can't help but feel the same sentiment as Nathan S. - I sort of feel bad giving this place only 3 stars with all the other rave reviews. Let me start with the positives - I love love that the place is so small and intimate. Especially in comparison to most Valley restaurants that are just cavernous. And with the European-style seating you have to get friendly with your neighbors. Both of these things make this feel like a good NY restaurant. I also love the atmosphere and decor in general. Very authentic Spanish, very laid back, not all hip and modern like most restaurants try to be these days. The service was extremely friendly, from the hostess to all of the waiters and waitresses and bus boys that came by. My husband really liked the Sangria (Tinto) - he said it wasn't very strong but tasted great. Indeed, all of the food tasted very good. Our two favorite dishes happened to be the daily specials - the Eggplant Barcelona and the Turkish Custard dessert. But the Tortilla Patatas and the Gambas and the Spinach with Garbanzos were all great as well. Now to the negatives - Firstly, selection was dreadful all around. The wine list was very minimal, and the very limited bar didn't help. And there were only about 8 dishes to choose from. When I go for Tapas, the whole point is having a wide variety of small plates to choose from! Every dish was DROWNED in oil. Literally, bowls of oil. The food just sat in my stomach afterwards, and I felt like I needed to take a shower to rid myself of all the grease. The sizes of the dishes were very inconsistent. I know it's tapas, and I love me some tapas, but generally at tapas places I find you could likely split each dish three ways. The Gambas and the Spinach were both huge piles that could have been split up to 4 ways. But then the Tortilla Patatas was barely large enough to split two ways, and then our two favorite dishes - the Eggplant Barcelona and the Turkish Custard - were both smaller than a deck of cards and splitting them just two ways left us each with a single forkful of food. There was a party of 4 next to us that put in 1 order of the Pork Tenderloin and the waitress said, ""You should really get 2 or 3 orders of that so everyone can try some."" 3 orders for 4 people to try it?! Then, right along with the food size is the price. $90 (incl tip) for the 4 tapas mentioned above, plus a glass of sangria, 2 glasses of wine, the dessert, and an espresso. 2 of the tapas were one bite per person. Yikes. The food, while good, was nothing outstanding. There was no dish that made me stop and say ""wow, now that is well done."" They were solid but not amazing. (As opposed to the Lomo Embuchado at Cobras y Matadors in LA that I was ready to marry and make babies with). So all in all, I'd say a 3.5 star experience, rounded down because it just wasn't a 4 for me. I can't help but compare this place to my favorite tapas place in the valley, Sol y Sombra in the DC Ranch, where they have a huge selection of fantastic wine (and a full bar) and a huge selection of delicious and much larger portioned tapas for the same price."
1,I rented bikes here for the first time today and took them for a ride on the green belt. It was so fun and the husband and wife working the shop were so friendly and helpful! I will definitely be a returning customer and recommend this to people who are looking for a fun outdoor activity.
1,"This place is awesome! Where else can you hear incredible live jazz music for free on a Monday night with reasonably priced drinks? Any other major city (like, say, New York), the cover would be at least $15, and they would make you pay for the second set, as well, and a place to sit or stand with a decent view of the musicians would be hard to come by, and by the end of the night you would end up feeling ripped off. Granted, this place can get crowded on the weekends, but no wonder. The beer (no draft) and wine selection is good, the vibe is laid-back, and the music I've heard has been great (I've only see one group here--Jiggle--and they play jazz.) Tip for music-lovers: Sit or stand in the room where the music is. Sitting any farther back and you may be tempted to take a swing at the people who just come to chat and fail to understand what makes the Lost Leaf so unique. But do give them a bit of a break. They are, after all, probably ""paying"" for your cover charge with all their imbibing of alcohol."
1,"Better than rubio's or filaberto's by a long shot open late and has a drive through. When i walked in it was packed and i noticed how cheap the beer and Margarita's were. Wait... I don't remember having ever seen a hole-in-the wall Mexican spot serving booze before (wonder if they sell it via drive through). The menu is like a Jewish Torah being that it has a 100,000 words and is very hard to read. The tacos and burritos also come w/ a side of toquitos that is buried under chiuaua cheese and guacamole. Shrimp and fish taco's are made on tortilla's are made in house. Food is super cheap and tasty. Its too bad that all their locations are in the middle of nowhere."
1,Amazing thrift store! The owner was extremely kind and polite to me so I'm not too sure why one reviewer was saying he was rude. They had baskets of clothes out front that were free for homeless or needy people which I thought was great considering places like goodwill often overcharge for clothing that should be donated to those in need. Great find on a Robert cavalli jacket and J.crew pants that were literally like new. Prices were completely reasonable for quality second hand clothing. For sure will go back!!!
1,Was craving something different tried this place recommended by a friend. Was impressed with the lasagna. 30 min wait well worth it. Service was ok food pretty good
1,"I have been coming to Lux for years ever since I started graduate school here in AZ. What is there to say that hasn't already been said other than hands down it is my go-to coffee spot in Arizona. Such a warm and diverse group of people, rotating artwork, the perfect study music playing in the background (although it is played a bit loud), espresso roasted on-site and baked goods made on-site. Always find an excuse to end up there for a café au lait or a velvet if I have a sweet tooth!"
1,"Okay ya wanna know a little secret? I LONG for Green. Ever since moving back to New Orleans I'm surrounded by an embarrassment of culinary riches but our one vegetarian restaurant can never hold its own against Green. I passed through Scottsdale a few weeks ago to visit the Grand Canyon and the second I stepped off the plane at the Phoenix airport and secured the rental car we drove straight to the restaurant. Everything was just like I remembered it and slightly better. The staff was warmer and the food just as good. I'm still thinking about the ""crab"" puffs and the eggless rolls."
1,"Oh Mojo you won my heart from day one... I always thought I was a gelato spot kinda guy but no apparently I can swing both ways. But if Mojo and Gelato Spot were in a heavyweight championship of how to retain best customers, Mojo has won round one. Why? Simply because of the awesomest event that runs every week on a Tuesday of which I love and that is Twitter Tuesdays! On this day and as an avid Mojo twitter follower, I am rewarded *that's what I think* for my fan-ship and loyalty with a fun secret word of which I made aware of the day of, and upon learning the secret word, drive after work to the Mill Ave location and get myself some Mojo fro-yo goodness for half-off! Score!! =) =) I just love that at this location there are 14 flavors available to sample, and mix and create the best combinations ever! Oh, and the many toppings and mix-ins make the experience enjoyable! Love getting myself a cup of lemon fro-yo with a tinge of strawberry fro-yo topped off with blueberries -delish- on and birthday cake with choc fro yo mixed in with almonds, peanuts, and choco pebbles... OMG! Yes... I love you Mojo... I am a fan!"
1,"Hot Bagels. To a random passerby, it's like any bagel place really. To locals and Midwestern students, it's a holy temple. And to me, well it's a highly overrated bagel place. But hey, it's still delicious! Especially if you're in the mood for a bagel. But it's kinda pricey. I ultimately paid like $8 for a bagel with lox, cream cheese, and a bag of chips. Seriously?? I mean, yes, it was one of the best bagels I've ever had but I could've gone next door to Senor Taco and gotten a burrito for $3 less and have enough for a dry-cleaning job at the $2.25 cleaners adjacent! And that's what brings this place down. While bagels are delicious and it's hard to mess up bagels, it's still just a bagel. So if you're feeling like having a bagel, definitely check this place out. It's on par with or better than Einstein Bros. Just don't be overhyped by all the love the locals have for this place because in the end, you're just having a bagel. =)"
1,"This place has a top notch tuna tataki app! Great rolls out quick regardless of how busy they are. Excellent service all the way around and very reasonable on price. Green tea ice cream for after dinner treat, I think so!!!! I forgot to mention I was in and out during lunch time spending 20 dollars."
1,"Stay in the courtyard recently and have no complaints at all!! RIght when I entered the place , the staff greeted us and they were all very nice and helpful with everything. Although i only stayed there for 1 night , i thought the rooms were very well kept and the bed was amazing! The first thing i do when i check into the room is look at the bed and sample how if feels and this bed was amazing! The rooms are about normal size and has a tv , desk , chair , etc..... Wifi is also a must whenever i travel and no complaints here. Wifi was fast and easily available. Did not have a chance to see the gym or the pool but they do have one. Overall , i would stay here again if i come by Phoenix!!"
0,"Lazy Q CLOSED in 2010. New Owners cleaned up the place and its called JESTERS BILLIARDS. Tons of beer, AC smoking patio with pool tables. Re-did tables and got new cues. Its rockin now."
1,"This place is such a delightful treat. Not only is the Barrio Cafe in what some Phoenicians would called the actual barrio, but it's non-descript on the outside and purely magical within. Not terribly difficult you keep your eyes peeled, Barrio Cafe is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona and is a must try for any Phoenix local. You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu, although their seafood offerings are my least favorites. I am in love with their conchita pibil, which is their slow-roasted pork and they have the best made-at-the-table guacamole in all of Phoenix. Their food is the kind of special occasion dinner that you and all your guests will be savoring every morsel, but save room for one of their delectable desserts! I'm a fan of their flan, in particular. Service is spot on and it's usually pretty packed, so come as early as you can or face a semi-long wait at the bar. Don't worry though, they've got great margaritas. This is the place Tempe's Mucho Gusto wished it could be some day. But it probably won't."
1,"I love the girls there. I get my eyebrows done every two weeks and I get my nails done there as often as I can. Recently, I just did the gel nails (just the gel polish not like the fake nail stuff) and I LOVE it. I can't tell you how happy I am that I did it. I always just did my toes because I'd always manage to goof up my fingernails in the first hour after I get them done- but with gels, you can't do that because after they're put under the UV Light, they dry immediately. No goof ups! Plus, they don't chip. The lady said they'd last around two weeks. I'm so happy with them. It's been a week and they still look pretty good. :)"
0,Went here about two months ago and am only now getting around to reviewing it. I think that should stand for something in terms of my experience there. The service was ridiculous. If one is going to charge the prices they charge for regular Americanized asian food... at LEAST make sure the menus you hand people are clean. Or your plates for that matter. Or silverware. Seriously! Did EVERYTHING have to be covered in grit or a mysterious sticky substance? Next up... the menu. Not everyone eats meat. How about a little more choices for us who prefer tofu over dead animal? I ordered the Coconut Curry Vegetables. Bland bland bland. I've had more flavor out of an unseasoned packet of ramen. And would it kill them to actually put some tofu on the plate? I guess I just don't understand the hype. The prices are ridiculous for the quality received. You're better off going to some little hole in the wall place where the food actually tastes like food and not reheated leftovers.
1,"Ye Olde Pipe has a great selection of cigars and a very big walk-in humidor, almost too big. I say that because as I walked around I came across a few boxes of cigars that were way too dry. With that said, I still found SEVERAL cigars that were fresh and moist. What I liked best about Ye Olde was the variety, they had several cigars at all price points, so if you can't afford to smoke an Opus X, they had plenty of cigars for less than $10. If you aren't an avid smoker, I don't know if you will get any help because the staff did not seem very friendly or welcoming, but if you know what you want, there is a good chance they have it."
1,"Meaty, beaty, big and bouncy! Add ""beefy"" and you've pretty much summed up your 5GB&F experience! After detoxing this morning, I was really hungry...after all, I'm a pretty big and bouncy boy and when you lug this kind of tonnage up and down the canal, you're going to need some retoxing! And since it's Taco Tuesday, I thought a burger fest sounded about right! I needed to be up north anyway, so I texted my order (what a time and vexation saver that is!...two stars for 5GB&F right there) and it was ready, hot and juicy when I rolled in. The burgers and fries remind me of nothing so much as Wendy's of about 30 years ago...you know, when Wendy's was actually pretty good (not like now when, they consistently screw up your order and figuratively, literally throw your bag-o-food into your car as you idle by the pickup window). The burgers are OK, the fries are fresh and peanutty (no, really...fresh peanut oil...the fries taste peanutty!), and the Coke is, well, Cokey. The atmosphere is nice enough, all red and white checked and tons of ""look at me"" crap on the walls (""Best Fries in Hoboken!"") The music was also reasonably pleasant (Men at Work...""I come from a land down under""...I shuddered a little bit at the part ""and men chunder""...please, no chundering while I'm eating!). Anyway... I was able to purchase this little repast for a mere $11.83 (I saved a little by having the small fries). I know, Grind or Delux prices for a retro Wendy's burger! I'm no spendthrift, but I could feed a family of 6 at In-n-Out for $12...and with better burgers. But, 5GB&F filled me up, they had my burger ready to roll and they very nicely didn't mess up my order (but then again, how could they screw it up...they were ordered to prepare my burger by a computer...we know what happens when you don't do what a computer tells you...you ""accidentally"" ride over a cliff on your Segway, that's what happens!) And, in a nostalgic sort of way, they reminded me of how Wendy's used to be (complete with 70's music), and for that, a reasonable 3.25 stars."
1,"Came here last night with the girlies to satisfy our craving for Indian food. We've talked about this place for a while, and I'll be damned if I was leaving AZ before stopping by this place! So luckily, I was able to convince one of the girls that finals are not as important as saying goodbye to me over a plate of curries. We got their around 8 and the place had a good crowd. We were the only white girls, so we know we were in for a good meal. Going over the menu took us a while, because one of the girls had no clue what she wanted, and the server was polite enough to let us take our time. Before we figured out what we wanted for dinner, of course we had to figure out drinks. So we all order and still continue to peruse the menu. Then our drinks came out...huge plus for this place right here, they were huge! My gin and tonic was in an oversized cocktail glass and my friend's Chardonnay was filled to the brim. No skimping on alcohol here! The waiter advised us the drinks were strong, which I was fine with but my girlfriend needed 3 more limes to take hers down. We finally end up decided on dinner, with the shahih paneer, chicken saag, and vegetable korma, and an order of garlic naan. I was a little unsure about the paneer, but my girlfriends swore by it. When the food arrived, we were excited! Everything smelled so flavorful and the naan was huge, good thing we only got one order. I loved every single bite I had at dinner, and the feeling was mutual across the table. All of us ate beyond the point of feeling full, but we couldn't help ourselves! This food was too good! Luckily, we were able to stop ourselves and save some food to take home. I got the chicken saag and I am so excited to have some for my own brunch. Mmmmm...I'm getting hungry thinking about it now. Overall, $20 a person including tip, with strong drinks, good food, and extras to take home we were satisfied."
0,"I went here a couple weeks ago and got the sesame chicken. I was disappointed when I saw that it wasn't chunks of chicken, but a boneless piece of chicken that was breaded, fried, and then sliced into strips. The sauce wasn't that good anyway. I won't be back."
1,"I am a shoe addict. I also appreciate a good bargain. Whenever I am bored and have a little time on my hands, I like to take a walk through DSW. I think it is kind of like playing ""dress up"". You can try on anything and everything. Such fun! This location is one of the better ones I have visited. It is well-organized, and the stock turns over regularly. It is one of those hit or miss places - I will either leave with nothing or with an obnoxious amount of new footwear. You just never know. It has a fairly large clearance section as well - if you have the patience to look, bargains can often be found. Definitely sign up for their rewards program - you will receive coupons regularly - yay! Happy hunting!"
1,"I wrote a review of this place back in mid-September and gave it only 3 stars... what the fuck was I thinking? The food here is fucking brilliant... especially for a chain. Amazing burgers. Their Diablo Chicken pasta dish is to die for. The cornbread is actually good - I fucking hate cornbread and yet I'll scarf this shit down like it's crack. Their chips and salsas aren't that great - they'll do the job, but I'm still not convinced about them. I'm also unimpressed with the sides that come with the mains, but I don't come to this place to eat the sides. As I've said before, their margaritas are awesome. They'll fuck you up though, so make sure you have a ride home or else go see a movie to sober up. The atmosphere is low-end upscale and pretty nice and cozy - kinda dark inside and a bit generic, but generic is better than flashy, ugly and distracting. Service is upscale as well and I'm usually pretty pleased with it. They offer free valet parking for customers too which is perfect now that they charge an arm and a leg for the parking structure. Here's my old review for reference: Great margaritas to be had here... really strong and tasty. This location isn't very busy ever it seems... perhaps with Fat Tuesdays around the corner, it's just too much competition. It's a good place to grab a strong margarita before heading over to the movies or something. Their food doesn't inspire me to eat there, so all I've had are appetizers so far... mainly chips and salsa. Salsa sucks. It's also got some competition from Macayos down the street which doesn't help. I don't know if this place can stay in business much longer unless it gets busier. It could just be the times I was there though."
1,"I recently went to my first First Friday (and my first trip to downtown Phoenix). After a few hours at the Phoenix Art Museum, friends and I hopped on the light rail and tried a new restaurant. Enter The Breadfruit. Easy to find (sign on the street corner) on a charming and quiet little street sits The Breadfruit with a hostess standing out front greeting guests. You can see the very intimate seating area from the street and it was packed (a good thing for 8:30pm on a Friday night). We sat and waited outside at the cute little tables (way too hot to eat a full meal outside). We were offered menus to peruse while we waited about 10 minutes for a table. Inside, we ordered two mixed drinks (a mojito vanilla for me). They were strong and very good. The mojito was very minty and refreshing and my mojito-loving friend said he should have ordered a mojito. (Read: Get a mojito.) The Food: We split a tilapia patty (very spicy!) for an appetizer. (Patties are Jamaican empanadas.) I had the coconut curried tofu with rice and peas, ripe plantains, and veggies. This is the one of the best tofu dishes I have ever had. My only complaint is that Breadfruit needs to have more plantains per plate. They are so good! One friend had the curried chicken and dumpling with a green banana, veggies, plantains, and a side order of rice and peas. Although he didn't like the whole wheat dumpling, he loved the curry sauce and the green banana. He called the sauce ""delectable."" Overall, this is a great place. Small, but great. The drinks are strong, the food is great, and the serve is prompt. Our only regrets are 1) not enough plantains and 2) we should have gotten dessert."
1,"Okay, eating Thai food in what seems to be an old diner is kinda weird. But after getting off of long flights, my mother and I needed some kind of Asian food and quick. The GPS was taking us to a sushi joint when we drove by this place and we immediately switched gears. I give these guys major kudos for the portion size. Seriously, I felt like I was still in Texas with such an enormous plate full of pad thai sitting in front of me. And it was delicious--plenty of peanuts, the noodles were perfectly cooked, and they didn't skimp on the meat. My mom's soup had to be improvised since they'd run out of octopus. They asked her if she wanted to change her order or just double up on the shrimp and she chose the latter. Sure, it was tasty, but she was really disappointed. The fried spring rolls were okay, but they were tiny and not piping hot. This was a nice way for us to start our trip and the food hit the spot. It came out quickly and the service was quite friendly (though not quite professional). I'm all about supporting the mom-and-pop shops and when the kids are working for the parents, I feel for them even more (been there, done that). With a better parking lot and some remodeling to get rid of the weird diner feel, this place will continue to attract more and more clients."
1,"I've been to this Dick's location a bunch of times and I've got to say that I've gotten more help from the employees in this one that I've ever gotten from any other location. I've spent some major time with the guys in the gun dept and they're always more that helpful regardless of how busy and how many people they have waiting for them. Major props to those guys for good knowledge and patience. Another time I was there I wanted some new shorts for softball and they didn't have and L's left but jokingly I checked the Under Armour manikin as he was wearing the same shorts, and what do ya know... L. It was near closing time and the associates were getting their stuff done so they could go home (I've worked retail and I know at closing time you just want everybody to bail so you can clean and go home). I asked a girl around the corner I was able to rob the manikin of his clothes and she laughed and had no problem taking him apart and yankin the shorts right off! I was so happy as I had a game the next day and didn't want to be running around looking for these shorts. Think I'm joking? lol - http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryno/4113416766/ Anyways - good store, always clean and everybody seems very nice and knowledgable in their area. Never had an issue there."
0,"The pizza here is very good, but i would warn anyone who is thinking to have it delivered, to think twice. Their system seems to be manual and we were actually asked ""are you in our delivery zone?"" After 12 minutes on the phone i gave up and decided to save the $5.50 delivery charge and pick it up myself. They are one of the best pizza's in the tukee area, but if you are going to go to a place that charges the max for their pie ($85 for 4 pizzas) , i would suggest Florencia in this area. This is our second time trying them, first was eat in, and now pick up, i would rate the overall customer service very low, enough to bring a 4-5 star place down to a 2."
1,"We tried this place after reading most of the reviews. I had rice noodle soup w/ fishballs, squid, shrimp & veggies and hubby had shredded pork sandwich. Both were good and plenty of food. The pork sandwich was so cheap, it was hard to believe it wasn't a typo. Beats a Subway anyday! The neighborhood is a bit shady but if you don't mind that, it is fine. Service was quick and we will definitely revisit this place. People kept pouring in during the dinner hours. Can't beat the price!"
1,"So last Monday the hubs and I got invited out to join some friends for $3 burgers at Maizies ($4 if you add cheese) For 4 burgers (All with cheese on them) and 4 beers our total bill was only $30!!!!!!!! That is a smoking deal if I ever did see one! Our burgers came out fast and hot. They serve them on chibata bread! They give you a little side of chipotle mayo that is delicious, but not enough to cover a burger. Our waiter was super fast and friendly! We will for sure be going back"
1,First time impressions are the most important and Culinary Dropout made an ever lasting one. Everything from the service to the food was spot on perfect. The whole experience was so good that it's hard to believe it will be the same when I go back. I hope it is............
1,"I went to Peter Piper Pizza tonight to celebrate my daughter's 5th birthday! It is a great place for kids to have fun. Being a former employee of PPP I know that we could have had reservations for her birthday and had a party representative help with everything. Unfortunately, this was just a small family celebration. So I ordered the big family meal deal which consisted of two large pizzas and an order of wings. The pizza is always delicious to me, it is not greasy like some of the pizza places out there. We forgot to bring a lighter for the birthday candle so they had one on hand for us to borrow. Needless to say this is a place that the kids love. They can eat great pizza & play which is all kids worry about."
0,"I'm sorry to be what seems to be the lone one star review. Either I got there on the worst day in their history, or everyone drank the Koolaid, or I just have different expectations and taste buds. It seems like a great idea. It's a build your own burger joint, $7.00 gets you a cooked to order burger with one cheese, up to 4 toppings, and 2 sauces with fries or onion rings-or some other choices. They also claim that the beef is local, hormone free, etcetera.... I chose a rare burger with American, grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms. tomato and lettuce, with mayo and mustard on a potato bun. I added bacon for a dollar. First, let me point out that if you are in a hurry, DON'T GO HERE TO EAT. I waited exactly 39 minutes for my food. This would not be a big deal if: 1. I had been warned before they ran my credit card--what if I only had 30 minutes for lunch?? 2. They had places to sit but it's tiny and full. 3. They had magazines, a jukebox, ANYTHING to entertain you for 39 minutes. You can't even get your drink early to sip on that. At the 30 minute mark, I'm ready to eat cardboard with a little ketchup on it, so maybe they make you wait so everything tastes even better? Anyway, before my burger comes up, I notice that the lady behind the counter is saying that the orders overwhelmed the kitchen. I look in the kitchen---they have ONE GUY TRYING TO DO ALL THIS?????? He'd better be getting a share of the profits!!!!! Now I'm jsut feeling really bad for this guy back there. I finally get my burger! YAY!! I'm SO excited! All those 4 and 5 star reviews! I take a bite and....the patty shoots out the other side of the bun like it had been shot out of a cannon. WTH? I look at the patty. It's clean as a whistle. I mean there is no mayo or mustard or cheese smeared on the patty. I turn it over and it slides out of my fingers back into the basket. The other side is clean too. The freakin' burger was so greasy, it slid all over the place! Then a greasy glop of what must have been the mushrooms and onions slid out. Still not seeing any cheese, mayo, or mustard anywhere. Just oil. Tons and tons of oil. I open the bun, On one side is a heavily oiled slick of lettuce glued to the bun by (I am guessing) a slice of cheese. The other side of the bun has some mayo and mustard residue--and more oil. I'm grossed out, but hungry. I take a bite. It's not rare, It's well done and oddly, tastes very faintly of liver. BTW, remember the bacon I paid a dollar for? Not there. I'm really puzzled that instead of cheese. or beef, or SOMETHING, I just taste that faint livery taste. So I take another bite.There isn't even any salt or pepper, or anything on the burger patty. This is perhaps, the worst grade of meat available for human consumption. I take a third bite because that second bite brought back a memory of when I worked for a meat company here in town. Now I recognize the flavor. I'm not saying that what I ate that day at Two Hippies was old dairy cow, but that's EXACTLY what it tasted like. At this point, I turn to the fries. The are shriveled and DARK and taste like they've been fried and then microwaved. I couldn't get out of there fast enough! Forget my danged dollar! just get me in the car! Exactly one hour and 20 minutes later, I had vicious diarrhea I haven't had that trouble even with eating junk food at the fair! No. NO. A thousand times NO! Red Robin is my next burger stop. Period"
1,"Love the buffet, the folks that work there are great, we usually hit this at least once a weekend and our table is always ready and he knows what sort of naan we want. Small but worth it."
1,"I saw this place on a Food Network series in November. When my family went to Phoenix in March for spring training, I knew we had to stop here. It was the first stop after getting off the plane and getting the rental car. It was in a sketchy area in the town, and far enough from the freeway. When we were there, the workers gave us samples of the different foods. I got the chicken fried rice combo with jade red chicken and the pollo diablo. The pollo diablo had a nice spicy flavor, and the jade red chicken was also very good. The snickerdoodle was very soft and chewy, which was a good thing for me. This will be a permanent stop in Phoenix for Spring Training trips."
1,My wife and I went here and sat on the patio near the canal. The temperature was perfect for being outside and the view of Camelback was sublime. My only complaint about the seating was it was difficult to read our menus when we were there in the evening. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. The chicken salad sandwich I had was very good and my wife loved the burger she ordered. All in all a very nice and relaxing Sunday evening dinner.
1,"Every sports town should have a bar like this (just outside the arena). It's the first stop for conventioneers wandering into town (for a drink, post show). This ain't the place if you're looking for a quiet spot.. However, if you're looking for a lively and well furnished sports-bar, with attractive waitstaff, this place is great. The back room has huge leather booths. The outdoor seating is nice too--it can get a little wild after the events let loose."
1,"if a hipster bar met a dive bar, this would be their offspring! good music and lots of kinds of friendly people!"
0,"I'm really getting ready to give up on this place......or boycott it a while. What's up!? It feels like it's a confused sushi restaurant. WHY THE HECK is the music always blarring?! You can 't even hear the person sitting next to you. Are you a restaurant or a club? Do you have servers or 'visual fluffers'? And if you go at Happy Hour, expect to wait 45min to even get your food. *Are there authentic sushi makers there?????"
1,"I really like this little dive bar and was quite taken back by the fact they were shut down yesterday. I'm a frequent visitor, and they have a decent selection on the jukebox (touchtunes). The food is typical bar fare, but decent.. got a kickin' deal on chicken wings on a Monday night. I hope they recover because they are the best thing for a dive bar fan in Gilbert!"
1,"Recently ""discovered"" Rosati's in Ahh-wuh-too-key. A friend (a former New Yorker no less) ordered us some thin crust, and I was surprised to find good ol' squares instead of slices. I was even more surprised to find that it's the best Chicago style thin crust I've had in my 6+ years in the valley. How have I not run across this place sooner? I wish they had a ""junk"" or ""garbage"" pizza special, but the Classic Sausage will do. Nice spicy hunks of sausage in almost every bite Avoid the wings though! Horrible. Wings should be deep fried or grilled . . . maybe I got a bad batch, but I think they actually BOILED them? Is that possible? Irregardless, they were terrible. It's a huge kitchen with a small counter area for takeout, so don't plan on eating there. It's in the strip mall with CK's . . . I wonder if CK's would let us bring in Rosati's pizza while we drink and watch the games . . . ? Wings aside, it's my new Go To for pizza"
1,"Checked in last night with a large group of people and gotta say: the staff is super professional and very nice. Clean, quiet rooms. Amenities are quite as nice as the Marriott (small pool), but there is free WiFi (connection is good and consistent) and breakfast and dinner snacks come with your room. So, good value."
1,"Love it! The food is VERY spicy though. Luckily, I have burned off all of my taste buds so far from all my mexican food endeavors, however, the wussies out there should take note :) Just realize that this place is VERY small and can get VERY crowded. I was there once and George W Bush came in to eat there. Evidently he loves the food."
1,"oh my, these are huge gyros. somewhat scary looking at first. not pressed in their cellar but good enough to find on a food cart in nyc. simply can not beat the value if you are hungry for lunch. they do need some greek coffee though. with all the i heart chicago wallpaper, you'd think they would have a plasma TV with my big fat greek wedding on repeat play,"
1,"When a man falls in love, it's a special thing. Not because his calloused hands and heart are finally softening. Not even because he has found something that completes his very living soul. It's special because he is simply, and utterly....happy. Ladies and Gentleman of Yelp....I have found the pizza that makes me happy. I heard all the hype...""best pizza in the country"", ""Oprah says it's the best"", ""The Food Network hypes it up"", ""Chris Bianco learned how to make pizza from Jesus"". Ok, I made up the last one. My friend and pizza aficionado, Lance has been known to drive in from Los Angeles...just for this pizza, and then he would drive home. Sometimes, he'd even fly in. It had to be good, right? Tonight, I chose Pizzeria Bianco for my birthday dinner because of the hype. I had made a pathetic attempt to dine here once, but myself and the individual I was with, we both were intimidated by the 3 hour wait. Is any pizza worth three hours? That's a personal judgment call. That night, I ended up dining at Nobuo, across the path....and it was a nice meal. I digress. I've been preparing for this trip. I read up on various press articles, and discovered that as of last week, they are open for lunch AND Mondays! Perfect. Tonight, I dined with my parents. My favorite dining companions. We sat down in the very intimate dining space. No wait at all. Perhaps, people don't know that they are open on Mondays. Fine by me. The decor is nice. Simple, with a classic cucina feel. The brick oven is the star of this place. Clearly. We ordered some bread to get started. It came with a little cup of high end olive oil. Fantastic! The crust was crisp, and the bread was chewy to the point where you can't help but smile when you eat this. The pizza is phenomenal. We ordered two pizzas (for three people). One was half Rosa and half Margherita, the other was the Biancoverde. This way we were able to try three different kinds of pizza . All three styles were phenomenal. The winner of the three was the Margherita. The tomato sauce doesn't overpower, the mozzarella melts like a dream, and a hint of basil. The Rosa was unique, and also delicious. The Arizona pistachios take some getting used to, but pairs well with the red onion. The Biancoverde was much more complex. Definitely a hearty pizza because of the ricotta cheese. Very tasty. It's topped with arugala, so you will get a nice earthy, and loud flavor. Usually when I eat pizza, I take a bite of the crust, and then I leave the rest. Not here. I went through the entire pizza slice because it's perfect. Chewy, crispy, and full of happy! Take it from me....this place is worth the hype. Look at the reviews from other Yelpers. Even the picky ones love this place. Maybe it's true. Maybe Chris Bianco did learn how to make pizza from Jesus. Sure as hell tastes like it. Now if you are wondering about the other stuff, it was also a five star experience: staff friendly and attentive, and the bathrooms are spotless. Worth the 3 hour wait? YES. Bring all your friends here? YES. Will I guarantee the awesome? YES. #300"
1,"What a find during my ongoing Vietnamese food trip - a Vietnamese restaurant which, unlike the others I've been to, is located in a charming converted little home rather than in a run down strip mall. But the food is just as good or better, and with run-down-strip-mall-eatery prices. Their banh xeo (crispy rice crepes stuffed with beansprouts and shrimp) is awesome, and the generous seafood soup with white asparagus is something I'd order even on a hot day. One of my favorite Vietnamese dishes is rice vermicelli with shrimp and pork or beef, and while their version is not as bold in flavor as Dong A's, it is definitely quite tasty. The courteous service complements the brevity of the wait between placing your order and receiving your food."
1,"Excellent food, top-notch service, exorbitantly priced. Not for budget minded diners..."
1,"Still loving Sunflower after a year and a half. I actually moved houses to be closer to this grocery store. The staff have never complained about going an extra mile, the prices have stayed better than any store I've been to lately and they have been having great beer specials. Special note: They have a large selection of homeopathic and environmentally sound products for your everyday corporal adjustments. Tons of specialty soaps, herbal supplements and vitamins. Check for the solution here before going to chain pharmacies!"
1,"I've been Dr. Castilla's office for 7 years. Her office has relocated and her practice has grown over the years and for good reason. She is a Dr. that treats you as a person and takes her time to honestly answer your questions. She makes eye contact with you and I couldn't ask for anything more. Just remember, it is a large practice and the staff is sometimes questionable. But, she's worth the wait! Now that we've relocated, I hate to give up Dr. Castilla. She's irreplaceable!"
1,"Well it's about time that I yelped about something already, it's been forever since I have! Got here on my lunch break, and find it surprisingly similar to the mongolian grills that I've tried back in CA.. piling on the meats, veggies, sauces and such. I'm a little surprised to hear people review on this place that placing the ingredients in the bowl grosses them out, that's what a mongolian grill is, right? Oh well.. If you like to customize your food, this is the right place for you, but if you don't like getting messy with your hands, this is definitely not the place for you. Definitely liked the amount of choices in ingredients and sauces, the soup and drink that's included in the meal.. but the 50 cent charge per to-go box is pretty stupid. Staff is really friendly, bathrooms are clean, pretty spacious.... Overall it's decent, but will only come here if I am in the mood for lots of leftovers or willing to fork over $9 for lunch.."
1,"The best tacos in the city, amazing veggies, and indescribably great salsas. The tacos are like tapas, so you need to order two or three, but they are reasonably priced. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff with great art to view while waiting for your order."
0,"The organization is grand with a ton of selection but the employees could care less about costumer service. It is very amazing with the amount of unemployed people in the city they have to hire the most incompetent individuals.... I'm not going to be ignorant and say they are ALL bad, but a few in the bunch seem to make it difficult to be a repeat costumer. Try talking to a manager at this location and you will be routed around the store till you finally get some one that states ""the manager is off till next week."" i will stay a website purchaser until they change their policy at this location and hire individuals with a better standard"
1,"I've only been to the MIC 4 times but so far so good. At this time I have taken only the spin classes and I must say the room is amazing. The lights are awesome, the mirrored doors that open to the outdoors are very cool. Last week Todd opened the doors and we did spinning in the rain. It was so much fun. I also have to agree with the reviewer, Emily, that Todd's class is fantastic. It is filled with energy, great music, and is a very challenging ride. The one complaint I have is that the class is only 45 minutes, I would prefer it be an hour especially given the cost. I cannot comment on the yoga as I have not tried it but the yoga room also looks amazing. The cafe is a nice addition and the menu items that I have tried have all been great. I will definitely continue to do Todd's class when I can and hope to try out a couple of other instructors in the future."
0,"Its was just OK! Liked the fresh jalapenos option, fries hardly had seasoning, was a bit pricey, but filling. Free peanuts, but wasn't sure if it was ok to throw on the floor. They use the same color scheme as In N Out which I thought was humerous. I'll still give it another try in a few months."
1,"Very pleasant hip restaurant. Try as many Bruchetta options as you can; each order comes with 4 pieces (potentially 4 different toppings), and all the ones I got were delicious: Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, and Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil."
1,"Totally sufficient for a few rounds of pool or darts while keeping an eye on the 67 tv screens they have mounted on the walls. Just stick to the cheap pitchers of domestic beer. I ordered a rum and coke and it tasted like cleaning products. I would come back, but only if I didn't feel like driving all the way to Lucky Break in Tempe."
1,"I will continue to give this place five stars for so many reasons. First, the menu is very creative, and offers a great variety of healthy food, with an Asian twist. This time I had the shrimp curry, which had lots of fresh vegetables, and instead of a heavy cream curry, it was a much healthier broth curry. We had the edamame dumplings again, which were as good as I remembered. It was kind of cool to see Dr. Weil eating there last night. It's good to know that he likes the place enough to dine there."
1,"The best street taco's i've had. As authentic and cheap as it gets... If you do take out, pick up a bombaros burrito for lunch for the next day as well, its really hot, but tasty. Don't tell me ATF or any other spot is better, they dont come close unless you like your ""street tacos"" with sour cream, cheese and lettuce LOL."
0,"What ever you do don't waste your money here. I am not the person who likes to send food back, in fact I hate to do it. I had no choice here, this was by far the worst mexican food I have eaten. The food has such a horrible after taste. I not only hated my meal but tried my boyfriends as well and it was still terrible. The service compares to the food, we waited forvever just for a server to come over and greet us. I wouldn't even recommend this place to my enemies."
1,"Went for drinks and appetizers to help benefit Friends of Animal Control and Care and was not disappointed! I am not a big fan of alcoholic beverages but this place made them fantastically. Got the Dr. Funk while my companions got Zombie and Hurricane. All were very tasty especially the Dr. Funk. MmmMMm. The appetizers were well portioned, I got the sweet potato fries and the others got calamri and other fishy foods that I don't eat. No complaints from them so definitely a good sign. Service was great, even though we were doing the special we still received plenty of attention. I will be back but this time to try some food!"
1,"Food wise, this is my favorite Lenny's location. They make the perfect jalapeno cheese burger. The fries are really good too. The location kind of sucks. Its surrounded by a greyhound station, a liquor store and some kind of AA hall. Need I say more?"
0,"It's a supermarket. I just go in buy what I need and get out. It's convenient that there's a wells fargo in there, but there's one across the street as well. To the negative experience..... My sister was speaking to my niece, but not in english. Some caucasian lady walks by and rudely says, ""Can't you speak english?"" WTF?!? Is this taking SB 1070 in your own hands? It's like you're trying to make every race hate you even more. I will run into this arrogance wherever I go. I'm not done yet. Keep on reading.... My niece had a dollar in her hand and was pointing at the lottery scratcher machine. We know you have to be of a certain age to play it. One of the employees there rushes over and in a loud voice tells me niece she can't play it. Calm down. Kids are just innocent and don't need this extra verbal abuse in their lives. Don't you have something better to do like restock the shelves? Swear... Racial profiling."
1,"This airport is the most confusing airport I've ever been to. Obviously it was meant to be small and was originally probably very efficient, but since they have added terminals it makes no sense and you will see the sign you need as you are passing it, instead of having a sign a mile or so ahead telling you were to go."
0,"No offense to locals, because Glendale ""Glitters"" with ""Chocolate"" downtown, but this mall hastily developed around the silver Jiffy Popcorn pan that is University of Phoenix Stadium (misnomer, it is for the professional football team, the Arizona Cardinals, named after the omnipresent UofP distance learning and professional college, ala National University) and the Jobing.com (local based employment dot com) Arena (home to the NHL Coyotes) is really just a North Snobsdale (aka Scottsdale, Snotsdale, She'sGotTail) Kierland Commons Wannabee Mall! It is 4 stories high, shaped like a football and stadium, with huge billboards facing into the 2 water fountains, its only redeeming value. It is populated with typical Scottsdale type restaurants....Big on decor, small on taste, with chain restaurants peddling Chef/Designer highly stacked fusion flavors masking average casual food for a larger tab per serving. Even the hords of young, large bossomed hostesses, bartenders and waitresses in black t-shirts are the attractions that were first ubiquitous in Scottsdale, then downtown Phoenix around the Diamondback Stadium, has now moved to the west side of the Valley! Margarittaville, Johnny Rockets, Fox Sports Grill, Kabuki Japanese...all formula chains for the average masses who think they are getting something special, but aren't. Meanwhile, the Superbowl early this year, the reason why this complex was completed (and for the new football Stadium) has come and gone, the housing boom has collapsed, and the westside house prices have dropped 30 - 40%. Consequently, within a couple of blocks, the luxury condos are being auctioned off, the Westgate Offices atop the stores are empty, and so are the new office buildings. The anchor Hotel the Renassaince, also a Westin of Kierland poser, is nicely lit but largely empty. There is a conference center attached, so it might get some occupancy other than Football season weekends, but the Homewood Suites nearby has got to be a summer bargain hotel. This is classic Valley gaudiness at its worst. And it is set conveniently off the Loop 101 at Glendale Road near the Agua Fria riverbed, but otherwise it is a vast open field of former farm land. Still, it is the only decent mall within miles, so it is a beacon for the young and bored westsiders looking for something besides their quiet bedroom communities of strip malls and convenience stores."
0,"Food was pretty good but my biggest issue was with the service. We made a reservation and still had to wait an hour. Isn't the whole point of a reservation...so you don't have to wait an hour? One of the three hostess, tried to help at the end of the wait but by then all we waited was to eat/drink. All in all, I enjoyed my chicken and bbq ribs but would not go back."
1,"Best noodles in Phoenix. This place is hands down the best chinese food in Phoenix. PF Changes has nothing on these guys, they are fast, friendly and food is hot. Its also excellent for leftovers too."
1,"Now accepts plastic! Now accepts plastic! Did you hear me? Harvey's now accepts plastic! I've lived around the corner from Harvey's for a little over 4 years now. I had lunch there once in the mid 1990's, and went in to watch a Suns playoff game a few years back when my friend was decked out in Spurs gear and we were nearly lynched at Half Moon. Quick lunch with a girlfriend who was in the mood for a burger about a year ago. While I love, and I do mean LOVE a good dive bar, this place scared the crap out of me. I'm young, not hideous, female, and not of the meth-head variety - so not only did I not blend, but I felt targeted. Sad, really. The ONE bar within easy drunk stumbling distance from my house, and I wasn't happy going there. During a weekday for lunch was more or less okay. But evenings are when the freaks come out. And I don't mean the freaks like me. I mean the dangerous crazy ones - not just the fun crazy ones. There's a difference! Well, enter the new roommate. He was disinclined to believe my review, and insisted we go. I resisted until late Saturday night, when he came home at 1am and insisted I get dressed so we could go there for an hour. Maybe I was tired. Maybe I needed a change of pace. Whatever the reason, I gave in, got dressed and we walked over to Harvey's. YAY! According to Echo, the bartender (yes, it's her real name. her parents are hippies like mine), the owner has been working hard to improve the place (read: clientele) for over a year. It shows! Echo is three shades of awesome - the perfect gal to be running the bar! Easy smile, quick wit, great sense of humor and the talent to mix a great drink while cooking any of the grub from the menu. She is a one woman show and pulls it off like a champ! June drink specials included $2.00 Beam 5 Star bourbon, Yukon Jack, and I don't remember what else. I asked for a bourbon and coke, the roommate asked for his bourbon neat. (Brave - cheap bourbon *needs* to be cut with something!). The pour is solid and consistent Oh, and did I mention you can get a mixed drink, anytime day or night for just two bucks? For $2!! Two drinks for me, two shots for him, a beer chaser for him and a cheese wineburger split between us. Under $14!! Holy hell, it's cheaper to drink here than it is at home! And at home - we don't have the entertainment of the other patrons. Like Cowboy who would do the splits on demand. And suggest my roommate go through the needed steps for a game of ""rodeo"" with his girlfriend. You just can't make this up! Oh - and he bestowed slightly drunk me with a new nickname. Apparently, I am a ""prick ass bitch."" I don't know how he meant it, but I am taking it as a compliment and will wear it with pride! Oh, yes. I will certainly be back! A LOT."
1,"Staying at the Royal Palms has been on my bucket list for a while now, because I've stayed at just about every other resort in town that I've really wanted to check out. Oddly enough, this also happens to be the closest one to where I actually live, so it seems strange to drop a load of cash to stay in a hotel four miles away from home. No matter, last month was my golden birthday and this is where my lovely girlfriend decided we were going to stay. Score. We had my party (a surprise, nicely pulled off) and we invited a bunch of people back to our room afterwards to continue the festivities. It was a pretty standard room, a bed, fireplace, a couple of chairs, big bathroom, a table and chairs on the patio (I believe they call it a valencia suite). Life was grand. Until the morning. *bang bang* WTF is that noise? *bang bang* There was pounding and various noises coming from the room next to us, and it wasn't happening on the bed. Are they really doing construction at 8:15am? It continued. My girlfriend called down to the front desk. The noise stopped. Then it continued. *bang bang* We were about to lose it. They called our room, ""do you mind if they continue working?"". Actually, we had just fallen back asleep... So this is not how the Royal Palms treats their guests. No, any resort with a Director of Romance is serious about making their guests stay enjoyable, so I knew this was not normal. A conversation took place, and profanity and yelling wasn't even necessary. Essentially, they were going to comp our room, but they offered that we stay another night in the presidential villa for the same price...how could we say no? I hung out at the resort all day because I was feeling miserable. They comped lunch, and about 4pm, they moved us to our new room. Nice place, the presidential villa. It's actually only one bedroom, but has a huge living room, dining room, kitchen, two fireplaces, three patios with fireplaces and water feature, old-school tub, double-shower with outdoor shower, a bidet, you know...typical amenities. I was still feeling terrible (yay, the flu!) , so we opted to order room service from T. Cooks. Naturally, if they hadn't done enough, they comped dinner as well. We had an extremely atypical experience at the Royal Palms our first night, I have no question about that. But they more than made up for it. They were gracious, they smiled, they apologized, and they made it right immediately. I can't ask for anything more from that from a place that prides itself in its customer service. I would not hesitate to stay here again."
1,I was very impressed with the service and food. St Francis provided a delicious meal and beautiful ambiance that was just right for a group of clients after work.
0,"Pretty lame subs and sandwiches. Worked close by so tried a few times. Hate to say it, but Subway is much better. Quality and quantity of ingredients in the so so bread left a lot to be desired. Service was okay but nothing to Yelp positively about."
1,"4-5 locations.. all 4.5 star average.. I think Arizona really has some fantastic Pizza options, and Spinatos is at the top of my pizza fix list.. the semi sweet sauce is addictive, great service, fresh ingredients, The Spicy Italian is my favorite... The chocolate chips cookies are laced with mind altering drugs, that make your body parts""romantic"" when you think of their cookies.. BTW 5:30pm, on a Tuesday, when we left, a 30 minute wait.. Its on the List.."
1,"I'm in love. Bacon you have my heart and my stomach. After all- where else does everything come with one of my favorite foods attached to it? Even my Bloody Mary had a slice of crisp bacon in it along with a celery spear, olives and onions. Probably one of the best Bloody Mary's I have had in awhile. The location is a little off the beaten path which is why, I think, people are lined up to get in the Breakfast Club a couple of blocks away for mediocre food, and here at Bacon- the food and service is better and there was no line on the Sunday I was there. I was seated in what they call ""the nook"" located on the side where I had full view of the restaurant. The menu was well organized and entrees come with toast and breakfast potatoes and your choice of a side of bacon or ham. You can also substitute fresh tomatoes if that is your wish. The food came up quickly and was delicious! My ham and cheese omelet was perfectly done (all melted cheese and ham inside and firm eggs on the outside) and the side of bacon was crisp and tasty. Given the size, this easily was a 4 egg omelet. Breakfast with drinks ran about $20 which was cheap for all the food I got. But I would be remiss if I didn't talk about what really blew me away about this place. It's the fantastic service! Everyone seems to be part of a larger team. I was greeted by one person, seated by another and had at least three servers taking care of me. And countless people stopped by to ask how things were, if I needed more water for my tea, or if I wanted more preserves for my toast. It was unbelievable! While they have been open for 9 months- they had the staff of a place that has been open much longer. The ambiance is contemporary but is warmed up by the blue booths, checkered table cloths, and some mismatched dining tables in the center that can be expanded for larger groups. There are also antique food cases lining the walls filled with tins of chocolate, and other food ""cues"". I also liked that they have those ""roll up"" doors on the one side that bring the outdoors in and seats outside on those perfect days. If I lived in Scottsdale- this would be my ""go to"" brunch place. What I don't get is why people are waiting in line at a place around the corner that left me a little cold. C'mon people. If you haven't checked Bacon out- you should. After all- what's not to like about, Bacon?"
1,"I went to Saba's feeling a little scared. Fast food Greek in a strip mall? This could go one of two ways...surprisingly good or health code violation bad. I am very glad to say it didn't end being the latter. In fact, the food here was pretty damn good. I did expect Saba's to be an order at the counter joint, so I was a little disappointed to see it was actually a tiny restaurant. I like my Greek fast and cheap, okay? But I got over it, got a table and began the interminable wait for our server to stop chatting with other diners and take our order. The menu has all the normal Greek items, including falafel- little fried balls of joy I might add- gyros, vegetarian platters, spanakopita and dolmas. Prices for the sandwiches and gyros are pretty cheap, but when you venture into the platter territory, you're going to pay for it. Platters start around $10 and go up. I ordered the falafel, of course, and so did my boyfriend. The pita sandwiches don't come with any sides, so we ordered a basket of fries to go along with our meal. The dcor was pretty cool with big pictures of Greece all over the walls and the classic Greek music piped in. Unfortunately, not even the Greek music could mask the hideous, loud tool of a diner that was sitting at the table in front of me. He was one of those idiots that has to talk so loud, even the half-deaf cook in the kitchen can hear him. He was so loud I felt like I should respond to his questions. Hey moron- saying things like ""I like it loose, like my women,"" is just not funny. Anyways, when we finally got our food, it was really good. The falafel pita and the fries were tasty, but our server sucked. He obviously knew the loud tool, and kept chatting with him while we waited for our check. That was a little annoying, but overall, Saba's is a good choice for a quick Greek meal."
1,"Went back with some veggie friends of mine and wasn't disappointed. One of them ordered the regular flour quesadilla, and they loved it. It had veggie stuff on the inside and I tasted a bite which was delicious. I will probably order this next time I go. Also, the grilled onion which came on the side was a big hit. The other friend ordered the mushroom corn quesadilla. She liked it but didn't love it. I had the shrimp tacos and, wow, were they good. I don't know why, with all the tortas on the menu, but I just seem to prefer the other menu items. As always, the service was great, and it was very, very busy. We had to wait to be seated. Love this place!"
0,Horrible service.
1,Okay so lets clear one thing up.. this place is a dump. But for under $20 a night it is a-okay for me. With all the money we saved I've got some extra cash to hit the strip club that sits directly in front. All kidding aside this place has impeccable location and is pretty much only a couple miles away from anything you can think to do. Of course the rooms are a little outdated and boring but its only a place to rest your head. And you can do that in peace. This has to be one of the quietest hotels I've been too. Almost seems like everyone is scared away from Christie's out front..
1,"Blue Martini hosts ""Take The Stage And Be The Lead Singer Of The Band"" on Monday Nights. Usually there is a band that sings top 40 but on Monday nights anyone can go up there and sing. My friend loves karaoke and was dying to get up on stage and have her moment so I went for moral support. BTW she rocked! Most bars are dead on a Monday so I was surprised that there was a decent crowd here. No cougars in sight the whole night! The drinks specials aren't that great but you can get $7 specialty martini's or if you go with a group of people you can split a bottle of vodka for $100."
1,We had brunch at El Chorro today and it was wonderful. The patio was comfortable with the umbrellas and heaters. The service was outstanding. The food was delicious. I had the creme brulee french toast - it was carb/sugar heaven. Everyone else enjoyed their food. The eggs benedict came out perfect. The BLT looked awesome. The fries were delicious. We will definitely be back.
1,"This is my kind of place. Had i not known of the Lost Leaf I would have never found it. Its a house in the historic district. after hesitantly walking in, I find it to be a cozy dimly lit 'house' it reminded me of hanging out at a friends place in college (well replace the blacklight posters with art work). The beer selection is top notch as well as the music. i dont go out to bars much, seeing as I am on a drinking hiatus, but this is a place I would go to... just for the atmosphere, music and folks."
0,"I have two thoughts on what to write for a review so here are both and you can take your pick. Dear Mr. and Mrs. Postinto, We regret to inform you that we would like our menu back. Sincerely, 2007 or Stale bread - YES Please!"
1,"I've eaten breakfast here a few times and always thought the food and service were good. I think the prices are reasonable. My only complaint is the place is too small. there have been many times the hubby and I go there and there is simply nowhere to sit, so we end up leaving. I wish they would expand the dining area as I would love to eat here more. I hate chain restaurants, but when this place is too crowded I end up at a crappy chain."
1,The best food I have found the area and the price is right. You get so much food you have to take home. Get there early to get a good seat fills up for lunch. Priced just right.
1,"Love this little frozen yogurt paradise!! I like Golden Spoon, but this place is definitely a notch above. The toppings bar alone is a reason to check it out.....can you say Fruity Pebbles anyone? How awesome is that??? I like the fact that you choose how much or little you want in whatever combos you crave. The flavors are also really yummy, and they always have a good variety. It's a great place to take kids, as they tend to like anything interactive like this. I'm so happy I live close & plan on coming lots as the weather heats up."
1,"I really like Maizie's, but unfortunately will not get to go as often anymore. I hate to report that after our last visit, my husband received a bad bout of food poisoning. It was, in fact, his first time puking in approximately 10 years. It was not pleasant for him and it was not pleasant for me. For that reason, I guess I'm going to have to drop one star from my previous review. The thing is, I really love Maizie's. I love their menu and I love their atmosphere. Unfortunately, the portobello sandwich...or maybe it was the cottage cheese...just doesn't love my husband and that means I don't get to visit quite as often. :("
1,"They get five stars now. You know why? Three little words I long to hear: Gluten-Free Buns! (OK, technically that's two words, but I love them nonetheless!) The buns are a dollar extra, but if you are like me and are tired of eating a burger with a lettuce wrap, or worse, with cutlery, just for the illusion of a sense of normalcy, they are worth it. And, frankly, quite tasty. I don't know if all RR are serving them now, or from the same bakeries/distributors, but I for one am glad for it!"
0,"Drinking + Arcade Games. This should be an obvious winner, right? Wrong. Oh, how wrong. Eating here is like eating in a casino, only less classy and with worse food. Beers are overpriced but absolutely necessary to make it through the event. Those combo deals that include beers and a game card seem like a good idea, until it's 45 minutes later, you're out of points, you're nowhere near drunk and you've already spent $40. If you go late, try not to get syphilis when you walk by San Felipe's."
1,"We went to the game against the Milwaukee Brewers on 3/25/10 and had a great time (and not just because the Dodgers won). We arrived early enough to walk around outside the whole stadium and see the practice fields. We even saw Tommy Lasorda, himself, outside at a table giving autographs! Parking was free (sort of; it was included in the price of the tickets), and we were able to park close because we were early. Traffic leaving was ""typical Frank McCourt"" style, meaning that it could have been better. Exiting traffic was set up to force us out in the wrong direction, so it was good to have the car's GPS guide us back to the freeway. We were surprised to see that not all of the food/drink stands were open, but I think they had only sold about 60-70% tickets for that game (Thursday 1:00 game). There was plenty of berm (grass) seating. We had splurged for premium seats ($42 each) for the game, and were almost right behind home plate in the seats that had seat cushions and cup holders. My BF was very pleased with the beer selections (Full Sail and Deschutes, not just the typical Miller and Bud offerings). They finally brought in Dodger dogs this year - boiled with short buns, nothing special. I still prefer them grilled. Stadium staff was all very friendly, esp the beer guy in our section who said my BF looked like some movie star. On behalf of the concession staff... FRANK, GIVE THEM SOME SHADE! The beer/food stands outside of the actual buildings only had slatted roofs, so no sun protection at all, and no misters. The poor people were totally roasting, and that was annoying to see. One odd thing about the Stadium is that it faces SE, which puts every single seat in the sun during day games. Wear a hat and bring your sunblock. Lots of sunblock. All in all, it was a very nice experience, and we're glad we went to the game and to Camelback Ranch. Only a 5.5 hour drive from home, we'll probably do it again."
1,"Man, do I LOVE a restaurant with REALLY GOOD food and friendly service! Liberty Market is definitely that! Funny thing is that I was originally going to eat at Joe's Farm Grill, but ended up here (after a search here on YELP). Nice laid back decor too. You wait in line to place your order, pay, and they give you a stand with a number on it (like at Sizzler), then someone brings your order. I like places that spend the time to make their own salad dressings and take care with creating a delicious salad. The Italia was DELICIOUS and a perfect size! The homemade Minestrone soup was loaded with fresh ingredients and was REALLY fantastic too! I forgot to try one of their desserts...the last Red Velvet cupcake was ALMOST snatched up by another customer, but the Food Server was so kind to offer to get it to me (maybe I had a look of panic on my face??)...WOW!! This service is rare to find! The restrooms are quite amusing! Saw a similar set-up in NYC. Each toilet/water-closet is individual...no stalls. They were VERY CLEAN too (ok, I was seriously apprehensive that it might smell like a men's restroom, since it was all unisex...no worries!!!!) I can't wait to visit here again...but, after I check out their other place across the street: Joe's Real BBQ. YUM!"
1,"Amazing work! My dentist referred me to this place just down the street from her. I was super scared, as I always am at the dentist, but the staff made me feel very comfortable. They treated me like a patient at the hospital. They were my angel nurses. When Dr Amin came in, the ""nurse"" was holding my hand and telling me when to breathe. I was, of course, shaking like a leaf. The Dr ""popped"" me three times in the cheek, and I was all numb. When I say ""popped"", I mean it was an electric shock wave pop flowing through my face to my freaking eyeball that made me tear up a little. (this was done by the needle of course going into my cheek) It was the craziest feeling, but relieving at the same time. I just breathed through it, and it helped. After about a min, the Dr was working his magic. In about 45 mins, he was all done, and I had like 4 canals. And I didn't feel a thing!! :) I was very pleased with the staff, Dr Amin, and the work they did. I highly recommend this place if you need a root canal done. Plus if you're a scardy cat like me, this place makes you feel comfortable."
1,"Welcome to the funkiest place in Goodyear. If you've been craving sheet-metal winged pigs but regretting that Cave Creek is practically a day trip from the west valley, you may feel tempted to lie on the floor and weep tears of joy. This Armadillo provides fine circuit training for working off breakfast at the Black Bear Diner, including a loft with moderately steep stairs. Like its cousin up toward Metro Center, it's an ""antique mall"" in the sense of focusing mostly on vintage items and less uncommon antiques, plus a smattering of ""collectibles."" This is the kind of antique mall I prefer, since it really functions as a sort of fantasy department store for shoppers who have a middle-of-the-road budget but whimsical or retro tastes. Like the other Armadillo, stock here runs somewhat more to the frilly and ornate than to the mid-century modern, but it's not a total lock-out of swellness in favor of sweetness. Unlike the other one, there's a larger variety of dealers who aren't typical antique-mall fare: things like reproduction hardware, the aforementioned sheet-metal winged-pigs, repro tin signs, garden ornaments made from vintage dishes. This isn't my cuppa, but in context, it provides useful variety, and it fills booths (there are more empty booths here, but it's still fairly new). A number of dealers seem to actually be replicated here, including the scrapbook store. Also replicated is the cheery professionalism of the operation: clean restrooms, occasional seating areas, efficient check-out, and available snacks. When you're hiking a layout this big, these things come to matter."
1,Best place in Arcadia to get a coffee or a tea. Lots of friendly locals and great place to sit outside to people watch and read the paper in the morning early lunchtime.
1,"I'd read about this place before (on blogs written by people from Utah) so when I was driving down Baseline and hungry and saw it I decided to try it out. It is set up a lot like Chipotle, however the process of ordering is somehow not quite as clear. Additionally I wasn't sure what went with my meal and what cost extra. That aside the salmon tacos I got were really tasty. I don't think I've had salmon as the fish in fish tacos at a restaurant before and I enjoyed the change. The price seemed a little high, but not so high that I won't visit again if I'm in Gilbert and looking for a quick meal."
1,"Toasted subs at their best.. The worst part of eating here is trying to choose one sandwich out of my four or five favorite picks. And in the fall when they bring out the soups, I can hardly resist ordering the cream corn soup with my meal."
1,"Bizarre location with good food. Don't expect an ""environment"". It's poorly decorated but looks as if there is a rockin karaoke setup there. Still, I liked it."
1,"There're times when you eat something and you want more. Then there are times when you eat something and you instantly know you will never have anything quite like it. For me, I experienced both of those at Pizzeria Bianco. My buddy and I drove almost 500 miles from Santa Barbara for a Giants-Diamondbacks game and thought we'd try this place I had heard about. We arrived fairly late so there was about a one hour wait but man, was it worth it. We ordered a Biancoverde and a Wiseguy. I was a bit skeptical at first because they each didn't have tomato sauce like I was used to, but I realized I dont care much for tomato sauce in the first place and I'm always up for trying new things. BEST DECISION OF THE DAY. The Biancoverde was my favorite. It was so simple (3 cheeses, arugula, and olive oil) yet so amazing. It has left me wanting more to this day. The staff was nice and friendly, not to mention a few cuties. I will definitely drive 500 miles for it again. In fact, I'll be making my way to Phoenix in a few weeks, JUST for the pizza!"
1,"Dr Brodkin is one of the greatest doctor out there. She was voted two years in a row for arizona foothill top doctor and it shows!!! She is caring, and overall great doctor. She moved her office last year and wow did she change for the best. The staff is great her new nurses i love love love....i recommend Dr Brodkin to anyone who need a GYN...."
0,"There really isn't much I like about Michael's to begin with - I especially dislike them for using my name and putting on such an inferior showing - but this location was a particular disaster. Clean up your aisles for goodness sake, I feel claustrophobic with all the crap hanging around - its like the clothing section at K-Mart, but possibly worse."
0,"I used to go all the time when I was in HS and last trip I noticed some change over of the stores from what I remember. The food court has okay variety, but not a whole lot. I think that the management company neglected this place for too long, it definitely needs its facelift. It's great for its convenience if you need to pick something up real quick but I wouldn't be spending all day there."
1,Ok..seriously just ok. Green salsa was horribly sweet and gel like. It had no taste of tomatillo in it. The tacos were stuffed to the gills but average. The chimis tasted reheated in the microwave and oddly like sopapillas. Over all ok food but a bit pricy for ok food.
1,Very friendly but need to work on the bathroom
1,"Satori to Kaigen! (Enlightenment and Spiritual Awakening!) 1st review. Nervous and working on an empty stomach, with the only exception being the half loaf of French bread and herb-butter I had consumed prior to dinner. Thinking Asian all day and being an incapable decision maker, I rely on Yelp and the assistance of a small list and a single 6 sided cube with dots on it. I jotted down 6 prominent businesses, held my breath and flicked a wrist. A ""2"" brought me to La's Thai Cuisine! Peeped the website and open til 9:30, score! My eye spotted closing time was at 9:00 though! Arriving on the scene at 8:49, poorly reverse parking my Honda in two spots because I was worried that they were closed. They weren't, I was met by a Thai beauty introducing herself as Lisa. I humbly asked for takeout, my adventure begins with the opening door... Smells are incredible. Having thought they were closed, I had forgotten what I was going to order! I rifled through the menu, feeling as if the whole kitchen was watching (they weren't) but she instructed me to take my time; So I ordered a soup, a salad, an entree, a dessert and a side of brown rice. They kindly ask me for my preference on the degree of heat, on each item, I asked for not the hottest but close to the top. #17 Mixed Vegetable Soup: Stellar Culinary Thought: Clear, piping, spicy and vegetable packed. Ninja Eating Plan: Gently lay over white and brown rice, alternately. # 9 Papaya Salad (Som-Tum): Phenomenal Culinary Thought: I got shrimp on the side, due to allergies. This was probably the most awesome experience of the evening. They even ""fenced in"" the shrimp within a Masai-esqe cage of cabbage, to prevent their oceanic brine from invading the delicate papaya, sprout and carrot forest. Spice and crunch with every munch. Beautiful. Ninja Eating Plan: Try not to be seen scarfing this down in front of a date, it's that awesome. Fortunately, my sister was only present and she knows I can eat like a pig and sound like one, too. # 53 Peanut Curry (Panang curry style, comes with rice!): Umami Culinary Thought: I don't like coconut. I do now. The lemon and coconut milk rises through the savory peanut curry. Tofu was my protein option, it was done perfectly. Green beans provided great consistency in this masterful crescendo. Ninja Eating Plan: Laid over rice, alternately brown and white rice, interrupted by the occasional, gorgeous, curry-only spoonful. Coconut Ice Cream: Yum Culinary Thought: I was reeling at this point but I wanted to continue this experience. As I stated earlier, coconut is not my thing but I believe in giving things a fair try, so I did. Coconut ice cream is delicious. Coconut pulp, or meat, I still have a texture issue with, but the honey swirl throughout the ice cream made this delectable. Ninja Eating Plan: Use the cooling ice cream energy to return your body back to normalcy. Perfect coda for the culinary symphony. I will be back. I plan to have every dish vegetarian style. Family-run places are truly number 1. Overall experience of the Culinary Ninja: PAVLOV Do you hear the sound of a bell chiming?"
1,"I love this PHO and spring rolls, and for the friendly and fast service plus it's cheap! Oh it's truly a must try place."
1,"I agree with Ebony that sometimes Red Lobster does get a bad rap....but this location is a very good one......as long as you get here early (LOL). This locale is always busy.....but the food.....customer service....and the overall ambience of the place really shines. Molly was our server when the wife and I visited this locale for dinner this past Friday night. Right now they have a 15 dollar 4 course meal promotion.....and I am telling you it was the best 15 bucks I have ever spent. I started with the New England Clam chowder.....this is my favorite soup in the whole world BAR NONE. Then I had the Caesar Salad with the Cheddar Bay biscuits which I always have two baskets of ....because those Biscuits will really make you hurt someone they are so good......(LOL). I had the Shrimp and Grilled Chicken in a great garlic and butter sauce with garlic mashed potatoes.....OMG.....the chicken was so juicy and the potatoes just melted in my mouth. Dessert was a very rich and delicious Key Lime Pie......ALL THIS FOR 15 BUCKS......WOW. I felt like I was stealing in a way (LOL) but again if there is a better deal in the valley for a dinner this good.....please let me know. So run don't walk to you nearest neighborhood Red Lobster and try this deal before it's gone. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"
1,"charlestons is one of the few chains i actually enjoy. I love their croissants and their staff is always awesome. their chicken strips are awesome. i love their grilled chicken and veggies, too. They have an awesome blackened grilled chicken, they don't use oil to cook either which is a plus! they no longer have it on the menu but have never given me a problem ordering it! yay for charlestons!"
1,"Love, love, LOVE this place! Eugenia is a genius! Macarons = amazing. Croissants = soft, buttery, flaky, delicious goodness. Iced mocha is one of the best I have ever had. My only complaint is that this place is not closer to my house or work, but that's probably a good thing because I would weigh 1000 lbs if it was."
1,"This place is a good go to when you're looking for a mexican infused panda express. Haha. Yum! I got the combo meal with the Jade Red chicken made into a quesadilla and the diablo chicken. Really good! I also got jerk fried rice. The beans were also very good. Yummy in my tummy. I really enjoyed Chino Bandido's, but don't think I could go more than once during a trip to Phoenix (I'd get very large from eating like this!). :D Oh yeah, if you want something more than a snack, don't just get a quesadilla by itself. My poor brother thought the quesadilla would be huge and good enough for his dinner (thinking taqueria size), but it was pretty sad and small. Luckily, my combo wasn't that small and I had extra food to share."
1,"DVAP.... You have to go at least once in your life. It really is a neat place with alot of history. The service is great, it appears to be family run. The food is good. Better then Dennys but not as good as Mimi's. I had the all u can eat of beef ribs, lasagna, meat loaf, cat fish, chicken, mashed and diced potatoes, stuffing, rice, homemade apple pie, etc and salad bar. I know I am missing a bunch of stuff they had but you get the drift. They run specials on Prime rib and stuff so you might want to call to see what they are serving the night you go."
1,"I've eaten at quite a few Yogis Grills since they started opening up in Arizona a handful of years ago. Their teriyaki chicken is pretty good and you get quite a bit for your dollar. However!!! Two things. 1. No matter which location I go to the service always seems sub-par. It seems everyone that works at Yogis Grill just seems uninterested and lacks the ability to be friendly. *shrug* Its not overly bothersome to me but it would be nice to have friendlier service. 2. Their sushi, is not that good and they are ridiculously over priced. I can go to Kona Grill which is a nice restaurant and get much better tasting sushi for nearly $2.00 cheaper! I just can't get past how expensive their rolls are AND it doesn't taste much better then grocery store sushi. I'll still go there for teriyaki but not for sushi, its just not worth it."
1,Cary is one of the most honest and knowledgeable mechanics I've ever been to. He is caring to all of his customer's and his shop takes the utmost care with the cars they work on. I cannot recommend him strongly enough!
0,"Would normally give this place 4 stars as I have been a regular here for about a year. Cheap drinks, great crowd and great music. Except I had my first bad experience here the other sunday. Granted, me and all the other people from my work were pretty loud after a sunday afternoon spring training game. Maybe it was the girls being a little too giggly or us just having too much fun for a dive bar...but I think none of that warrants the bartender calling us cheap and rude. Come on now, we are all servers and we all tipped you well. Whats with the attitude? Will still continue to come to this place once I stave off the embarrassment of telling people from work I know about this cool bar only to be so rudely treated by a way too snobby for a sunday afternoon bartender."
1,In from out of town ..... Really glad we stopped here.... Excellent food nice atmosphere if I was planning to be in AZ more often I would bookmark this place.
1,"Union is a nice cozy place set on the fringe of Old Town Scottsdale. The inside has a nice homey feel with booths that have extra throw pillows (love that) and soft lighting and desert scape paintings. A big drawback is that while half of the seats face the lovely paintings the other half face the kitchen. The wine flights are good but the pours are inconsistent and not as hearty as in some places. The bulk of their wine menu comes in bottle form. They do offer 8 oz pours of wine for about $15 a glass. Be careful when you order, as we were given 8oz pours and had no idea we were getting them. The food was quite good, they actually had real grilled focaccia and this garlic cream butter that was delicious. Its tapas style and we ordered three and it was more than enough for the two of us. All of the tapas we ordered were well prepared. We also ordered dessert which was very mediocre. I would come back again but probably for a happy hour. As far as food goes it wasn't my favorite at a wine bar. They do have a patio out front that looks like it would be very cozy on a cool evening."
1,"I was impressed with their menu and drink selection. 3 different sized cups, all kinds of flavors. They also have these ""bowls"" which look so enticing! Consists of fruit, granola, acai, honey etc. they have a few different kinds but they look so good for being healthy for ypu :). Honestly, i think they have maybe more to offer than Jamba does. I had the Pina-cool-ada, and i feel in love with it. They break down the calories of each drink depending which size cup you get also. I'm all about information at my fingertips and they had everything I needed/wanted to know laid out nicely. You get a free boost as well.. fat burner, energy etc. They also serve different kinds of pretzels as well. It was my first visit here so forgive me because i know i am leaving some things off...but this goes to show you the menu is extensive cause I damn sure cannot remember all of it. Next time you're in the mood to get your juice on.. Check out Juice it up... see if it titillates your senses as it did mine. :0"
1,"Great concept my nephews requested I take them there when I was visiting from out of town. We really had a wonderful time, I just wish the staff was a tad bit more friendly for the amount of money we paid for being there. I get it, its annoying explaining how the process works for each person that walks through the door but, I never done this before so I was asking questions.. seemed the employee was a little frustrated which was annoying. But, I stuck it through because that's what my nephews wanted. Other then that this place was fun for adults and the kids. Very therapeutic, quiet and allowed your inner creative side to shine through. Great amount of colors to work with and supply. I would do it again with them but, hopefully the person at the front desk could smile more often!"
1,"In my effort to live and love local, I try to show Bashas some love since they are a locally owned chain. Everything about this Bashas is just OK. The produce, inventory and service are all par but nothing stands out. I recently bought several baked goods from this Bashas for an event. I was on the hunt for sugar cookies that Santa's little elves could decorate during a shopping crawl. They didn't have any out, so I asked the lady behind the counter. She told me they had cookies in the back for a dollar a piece. This was too high for my budget so I politely declined. Then a couple minutes later, she came back and told me they were actually on sale and only $.50, so I decided to buy them. Coincidence that I said no to cookies for a $1 and then they became 50 cents, or just oversight by the employee? Who knows.... During my visit, I also purchased some donuts. I need two dozen donuts and unfortunately they don't have donuts by the dozen pre-made so I ended up making my own. While this is good because you can choose your own, I think it would also be helpful to have pre-made dozens for those in a huge hurry (like I was that day). In summary, this Bashas is just OK, but I love supporting local so I will continue to shop here!"
0,"""Fake"" (or rather condescending) service from the ""Service Manager""...and he didn't even acknowledge me when I asked the status of my car (uh, more like IGNORE). Ended every sentence with an impolite ""No ma'am"" or ""Yes, ma'am""... ya get the scenario. Basically, the guy was a real JERK. They couldn't even figure out HOW to fix my car, even when I TOLD them what was wrong with it ( had been diagnosed at the Dealership). Two guys were sitting there staring at the computer (as if it was going to magically speak to them). At least they didn't charge me, but what a waste of time waiting for 90 minutes...."
1,"I'm not a fan of ice cream, I just don't find it appealing and it's too high in calories/saturated fat. However I do love frozen yogurt, and ironically it's much less fattening, yet more satisfying. At 25 calories an ounce, Golden Spoon's is the best around. There have a large array of flavors to choose from and they rotate flavors each month, they also have seasonal flavors such as pumpkin pie and egg nog. You also can get more than one flavor combined. They also have a wide variety of toppings to choose from, from gummy bears to low-fat brownies. Even though their yogurt is non-fat and low calorie, adding toppings can quickly add a lot more calories, I suggest going with chocolate or rainbow sprinkles (adds less than 50 calories), or if you like fruit, go with that."
1,"Whenever I start leaning toward being a vegetarian like my daughter is, I remember the smell and taste of that scrumptious, melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon at Durant's. And the hot fudge sundae for dessert? Dang, just can't beat it. The bartenders are old school--not too aloof, not fawning, just professional and classy. The best."
1,"Cheese Curds! They have been so hard to find in AZ. Like the Jalepeno ones too. Really good fresh milk. Worth the stop. Bring cash, not credit or debit cards"
1,"This place is a gem. It's a bit tucked away. It kinda felt like I was going on a bit of adventure. The restaurant was very small and oh so cozy. Just they way I likem. We had the Rock Shrimp breaded in coconut accompanied by a Thai Chili Dipping Sauce it was delicious. My main course was the Chicken breast stuffed with goat cheese, apricot, basil, spinach, shrimp and crimini mushrooms finished in a balsamic reduction glaze it was yummy. Service was on Point. I would so go again."
1,"The boy and I finally check this place out last night. It was everything I imagined it to be. Great view from the semi-outdoors bar area, lots of beers on tap, and nice patio area. It was a Monday night so they weren't very busy, which was nice, I wasn't in the mood for a crowed. When checking out their menu online I saw they have my favorite beer on tap, SeaDog Wild Blueberry. It was delicious! Completely different on draft, but yummy all the same. They also had an Apple Cider on draft, my pick over a pear cider any day, that I could have in my Black Velvet (cider and Guinness). I was a happy camper. Only downer was that they closed a bit earlier than we would have liked, but no worries we will just have to come back again soon to try some more beers. The bartender was great, she let us try anything we wanted before committing to a full on pint. I tried to get the boy to be adventurous, but he stuck with the Stella, not bad at all, just a little boring. Oh well ;-) I am looking forward to checking out Stand-Up Live soon as well, and the live bands they have at Copper Blue. I also hear they ahve a pretty awesome Ladies night on Thursdays, saweet! Menty menty more trips in my future, I can just see it. :-)"
1,"Visited the restaurant tonight and was very pleased. I found the decor charming and elegant. The atmosphere is amazing sans the hustle and bustle of most of the local chain like restaurants. The place was devoid of the stereotypical Scottsdale element we prefer to avoid. I found the prices easily justifiable in fact I though them quite reasonable. We had the three onion tart appetizer, which was spectacular. For entrees we had salmon, filet, and a pair of lamb shanks. Everything was wonderful. The presentation was clean and the freshness and quality of the proteins, produce and accoutrement's was immediately evident. Everything was cooked skillfully. Had three of the four desserts on the menu. The chocolate raspberry tart definitely stood out followed closely by the berry tart. Delicately prepared and presented these were really an unexpected treat. The environment is wonderful for Dining and chatting with people you actually like. The interior is intimate and it lends itself well to the cuisine. I found the staff courteous, knowledgeable and professional. We will be frequenting often and I encourage others to visit."
1,"Let me preface this review by saying that for the past 2 years I have lived in Boston, which has some decent Chinese restaurants, great food, but rude/curt/abrupt service. I had learned to keep my head down, not make eye contact and not ask any questions. Eat as fast as possible and get the hell out before someone starts yelling at you! So understandably my guard was up when I entered Mu Shu Asian Grill. However, complete opposite here. Mr Mu Shu welcomed me to his establishment, asked me if I had ever been here before and took the time to explain the stir fry/salad bar station. I was in the mood for Mu Shu, and a place named Mu Shu must have great Mu Shu, right? Mr MS described to me his version of MS, I heard him say something about a burrito, but I really wasn't paying too much attention as I smugly thought I knew everything there was to know about Mu Shu! Boy was I wrong! When I get it, it's bigger than my forearm. It's packed full of shrimp, veggies and fried rice. Wow, what a great flavour! You've heard of Asian fusion? This is Mexasian!"
1,"It is a cute little restaurant, has a nice wine list. I ordered the Linguine with clam Sauce, and a glass of pino. Personally i think the food is actually pretty good, nice northern italian. But the service was just ok."
1,"we thtumbled into thiths playth a few monthths ago and it waths aMAYYYYZthing!!! totally gay but the decor waths awethsome and retro, like for therial. they had tonths of gaymths and it waths thso good! if you voted yeth on prop 8, you're stho thupid."
1,"i adore this place! cute little shop, sweet owners, delish cookies - what more could you want?!?!? the urban was made for me. dark chocolate, coconut, and some nuts. uhhhhhh, hello, did i just wake up in heaven? their ice cream sandwiches are good - but i really wish they would make them on the spot, so you could get whatever cookies you wanted - right now it's all just standard chocolate cookies. a bit toooo sweet sometimes. i also had a special chocolate mint cookie sandwich, which was pretty good, but i had some serious chocolate overdose afterwards. not a huuuge fan of the cupcakes; i tried the brown velvet (i think that's what they called it). doesn't taste like red velvet, even though it's supposed to. but i mean, the place IS called urban COOKIES. yes, they are pricey, but what organic thing isn't?"
1,"So we finally decided to give Cibo another chance and I'm so glad we did! I love love love their patio. It's very cute and romantic especially with all the lights wrapped around the trees. The heaters keep you warm on a chilly night and it's much quieter than their indoor space. This place is a great date spot. We both had the Prosciutto Cruda pizza and had wanted to try the burrata, but unfortunately they'd been out of it for the last week so we ordered the bruschetta instead. Our waiter also recommended the Valpolicella Ripasso, which was ok, but it was a little light for our tastes. The pizza was really good (the fresh ingredients really come through), but we weren't the biggest fans of the crust. I like something more substantial and airy. But for a thin crust pizza it wasn't soggy at all. A big plus! The bruschetta was also ok (don't get me wrong I still ate all of it and would order it again), but each bite just needs a little more of a punch. Service was great and we met Karen, the owner, before we left and she is a doll. We had a much better experience this time around and we will certainly be back."
1,"Always fresh and friendly. Food is priced just a skosh above the actual value but, the place is clean, people are nice. Worth trying? Yes! Lunchtime sushi is great. Teriyaki bowl is good. Brown rice extra...booo. Overall worth the very close the the $9.00 you will spend on lunch at Yogis"
1,"Been here twice now and wish I could say more. The food is delicious, the set up is really relaxing and service is great. A great place to take an out of town guest. Happy hour menu has these amazing tofu tacos that I highly recommend. My boyfriend had the Pork tacos which he said were also delish. Definitely check this place out!!"
1,"Ok, this is coming from sombody that is not a fan of the Cheesecake factory. My cousin, her friend, and I walk into the the restaurant and decided to eat in the bar area. We had a very sweet waitperson, Summer. She rocked with suggestions and her personality was great. I had one of their smoothies, just like the one at Cheesecake Factory. It was good, but I have had better at Jumba Juice. I ended up having their angel hair pasta, my cousin had a chicken salad, and friend #3 decided that he would just mooch off our plates. The reason why I hate these types of places is that they give you WAY TOO MUCH FOOD! Why do they do that? Especially with people, like me, that learned that they better clean off their whole plate? I just gained 10 pounds. Food was nothing spectacular. My cousin then ordered the Splenda Cheesecake, that she said tastes horrible. (She had the one at Cheesecake Factory, which she thinks is awesome) 5 stars to the lovely Summer (or was it Winter...I can't remember now...crap!) My cousin actually left her money on the booth. She called the restaurant and Summer actually said she found it and was holding it for her just in case she came back for it. Extra plus for honesty that I didn't even think existed in the world anymore. 2 stars for the mediocre food. And 3 stars to the host stand...a story that I don't have enough energy to even type here."
1,"Ok, so I've just come to the conclusion that it's not me....... it's YOU. I just don't like other peoples used, worn, busted up shit. That said, I really like My Sisters Closet. I've only been in a couple of times but I know potential when I see it in the form of a $400 Louis Vuitton bag. ( I wouldn't purchase it but I liked that it was there) I did pick up a pair of designer (not sure which one, don't really care) sunglasses for $14. Sure, they are probably *gasp* ""last season's"" or whatever but I don't care. They look hot and they cover almost my entire face which is something I look for in shades. I will be back soon to see what other goodies I can find. That $400 Louis really made me nervous though. Who has so much dough that they can just drop a perfectly good $1200 bag at consignment??........ and are they interested in adopting or marrying me..."
1,"If you are looking for a great location for bulk specialty flours and grains, beans, Freeze Dried fruits, vegetables, meats and dairy...they have a wonderful selection. They also have water storage and emergency supplies like solar ovens. I'm a big fan!"
1,"Stopped in here on a Sunday afternoon for a milkshake when my sister was visiting from out of town. We browsed the racks of vintage clothing and costume jewelry before sitting down at the bar. It was difficult to choose our milkshake flavor, given the dizzying array of syrups and ice cream combos, but after settling on chocolate and wild cherry, we were very pleased. Plus it was a cheerful looking thing, topped with whipped cream, colorful sprinkles, and a cherry. I was not as pleased with the service... it wasn't busy until after we sat down, but no one took our order or even gave us a menu or a ""hello"" until we'd been sitting for about 10 minutes. A party of 8 or so, including a bunch of indecisive kids, sat down AFTER us, and were served before my sister and I... and no acknowledgement of the wait. While we waited, I did enjoy looking at all the cool decor from the past, though I think the whole place could be a little bit cleaner."
1,"I enjoy ""the BOP"" as my friend calls it on the same level that I enjoy pizza. It's good, but it's not my desert island bar. I go here to meet up with friends. I've never been there on my own because let's face it. I'm not likely to be caught dead trolling Scottsdale (even non-Scottsdale Scottsdale) by my lonesome. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting. Which kinda turns me off. I like my bars a bit seedier. But if that's your thing then I'm cool with it. I hear the food is pretty good for English fare, but hey who wants to waste time eating when you could be drinking?"
1,"I love burgers and really wanted to love The Grind, but it wasn't meant to be. Unfortunately I had problems with the temperatures, both the restaurant and the food. I was here with my girlfriend on a Tuesday night. The restaurant itself is nicely appointed, with a sleek, modern look and feel. It was pretty close to full, but staff were still friendly and efficient. The $5/glass wine special they were running was very nice. I has the peppercorn burger with sweet potato fritters. The fritters were very nice, crunch without being greasy, and not overly sweet. The burger was nicely composed with great toppings and flavors - the watercress in particular stood out. Unfortunately, the burger was also well, well done, and I had ordered medium. I should have sent it back, but was hungry and didn't want to wait. For a burger joint missing a temperature on a burger is pretty disappointing and it killed a lot of the goodwill the rest of the ingredients had built up. The bread pudding for desert wasn't the best I've ever had, but was nice and the bourbon sauce it came with was a nice touch. The other issue I had with The Grind is the temp inside the restaurant. I'll grant that these are the dog days of summer right now, and I'm sure it's hard to keep the place cool with the half open kitchen, but was pretty warm in there. With the wine special it was ok value for the money I guess. But on a normal night with $10-12/glass for wine and $10 for a burger with another $4 for fries it's too pricey for my tastes, especially if they aren't hitting proper temps on the burgers every time."
1,"I went there last night with bf to celebrate our anniversary. After pre-yelp, we knew what to expect as to prices, so it wasn't so much of a shocker. To the food, we concur with almost everyone here. It was impeccable! We ordered the ice tower for 2 and thought that it was very well presented. Ours came with 3 appetizers (raw oysters, crab claws and dungeness crab) so it wasn't too high. They are all fresh. Growing up I used to go to the beach quite often just to have fresh crabs, so I know what those taste like. And for 6 years living in the desert, Mastro's is the first and only one in AZ to deliver that. For main course, I got Ivory Salmon ""Oreganata"", bf got Swordfish blackened. I am quite picky when it comes to fish, and bf isn't exactly a fish person, but both of our dishes ""surpassed expectation."" I couldn't say much about swordfish except it was fresh. We had the same dish 2 weeks before at somewhere else, it was nowhere near as sweet and fresh as the one at Mastro's. It was my first having Ivory Salmon, it was sweeter, and white (hence the name) than normal salmon we get around here. Mine was good size portion, firm to the touch, but melted in the mouth. The flavor was subtle enough to enjoy by itself, or you can add one of the sauces provided. One of my favorite sauces of the night I think was made of minced tomatoes and olives, came with the main course. Sides were Lobster Mash and Snap peas. I didn't really care for snap peas as I can make them at home. But lobster mash is a MUST for those who go there. I'm not sure how they prepared it, but it felt like mash potatoes made with lobster bisque (instead of water and milk) and added lobster chunks. It was much more flavorful and creamy than a normal mash potatoes. It was big enough to share and take home. One thing though, it hardened up after sitting out for awhile, so I'm not sure if microwave could make it all fluffy again after 1 night in the fridge. Drinks there are amazing, from the presentation, to the taste, and definitely the amount of alcohol in each drink. We decided to go with cocktail drinks rather than wines because of other yelpers' reviews. Total worth it!!! The service was amazing. We had Robert. We pretty much asked him for recommendations for everything, yet he was nice about it and very knowledgeable. Next time we go back, I would definitely ask for him again. We didn't order dessert since they gave us a dark-chocolate ""Happy Anniversary"" cake with the letters written, also, in chocolate. The overall experience was 4 3/4, just because it was a bit difficult talking to each other. The acoustic of the room wasn't very good and it got loud. Didn't see much of cougar/manther scene as we were in the dining room. And maybe it was during weekdays, we saw lots of ""expense account"" people though"
1,"It was a rainy Saturday, yes, that's right, it was raining and hot and muggy! UGH! But when it rains I just want to go sit in a coffee shop and people watch or just relax a little. And I don't have a coffee pot at home right now. Yes, I know, it's somewhat sacriligious for someone such as myself who is a caffine addict. Sad, but true. I just needed my fix and it's that time of year people.....the Pumpkin Spice Latte is BACK!!! HOORAY!!! It is my all time favorite!! This is the closest Starbucks to where I live. Just a few blocks away. When my friend took me here the first time she told me it was the ""gay"" Starbucks. Yup, I think that is safe to say. I'm straight but if I were gay, dang, I'd probably be here more often. I like this location though. It never seems to be super busy and there is always a place to sit weather it's inside or out. It's clean and the staff are friendly. It also helped that I was cleaning out my wallet and found a Starbucks gift card. Score! There is not much else located near this Starbucks. The Good Egg, which looks like somewhere I might try, and Jamba Juice but sadly, it looks like just about everything else has closed up in this little strip mall. Too bad because it must have been a hoppin place a few years back. I may have to go back soon......like, today, maybe....I'm getting another craving for my fave PSL!!! YUM!! And now they have a PSL Frap! I have not tried it yet but I will. Sounds like pumpkin pie through a straw! Yum-O!"
1,"I'm from New York, so you can bet the firs thing I asked everyone when I moved to Phoenix was ""where should I get some good pizza?"" Everyone responded ""Pizzeria Bianco!,"" but a few wise ones told me to avoid the crazy wait and check out Cibo. Still haven't made it to Bianco, but why bother? I've been to Cibo 3 times in the past few months and wouldn't have it any other way. The service has always been spectacular. There's a good selection of beer and wine, and an almost impossible-to-choose-from selection of pizzas. We're not talking New York thin-slice sauce-and-cheese, we're talking locally sourced ingredients and artful combination. Perfect crust topped with the perfect combination of delicious meats, cheeses, and veggies galore. Your least favorite part of the meal will definitely be trying to pronounce the names of the pizzas. Your favorite part of the meal might be the pizza, or it might be the ambiance (hard to decide between the cozy outside with live music and fire pit or the quaint inside that boasts everything downtown Phoenix is good at). Go with a group of friends and stay a while."
0,"Well what can i say, if you like a club atmosphere and girls have naked walking around at night this is your type of place. It felt to me like this hotel was trying to be a hotel that you would find in vegas. the rooms are overpriced, there is no storage in them and they give you like 5 hangers total. The water here is awful so dont drink it. The pool area is nice, and the room service is very quick. So those aspects of this hotel are nice. I am not sure i would spend 300 buks to stay here though again. I am not really into the party scene but if you are this might be your kind of place. Id rather be at a pub bar or sports bar personally but to each their own!"
0,"I've been here four or five times and never been too impressed. The atmosphere, art installations and eclectic seating gave me high hopes. The location is also unbeatable, walking distance from my place. But the service has always been sub-par, like it's a bother to take my order and converse with me. Everyone here, including most of the clientele, seem way too cool for school. The iced tea, my usual, is good; the iced coffee is great-tons of flavor and plenty of body. Espresso drinks are pretty standard for your indie coffee shop. I've asked for their vegan pastry (which changes daily) three times only to be told that they ran out for the day. I know that this happens, and I love that they freshly bake their goodies everyday and have a rotating menu, but I would also like to try the vegan scone sometime please. Today, I ordered a strawberry-raspberry-cranberry smoothie ($5 for a small!) and confirmed with the boy behind the counter that the smoothies are vegan/non-dairy. He said yes then informed me that they use Naked juices for the base then just add fruit and ice. (Naked juice! So that's where the $5 price tag comes from!) Three minutes later, I was handed a delicious looking smoothie topped with...whipped cream...? Really?!"
1,"It was as good as everyone says! And sooo inexpensive...appetizers, entrees, and drinks for 3 people...about 30 bones. Not to mention the mountain of leftovers we brought home."
0,"This place is a must go if you are some beer starved party animal ASU student but as an adult who is one step beyond the let's get blottoed for the sake of getting drunk this place isn't really worth visiting. The beers really aren't that good compared to Four Peaks/Papago/Sun Up/San Tan, or any of the other brew pubs around. Really wasn't that impressed with the food either. The only reason I gave it an extra star than one because the service was good, of course there were only one other group in the place at the time."

1,Went to Cracker Barrel twice while vacationing at our home in Litchfield Park. All the food we ordered were very good and the service was good also. I highly recommend their pancakes.
1,"Top notch. He is now my go to barber. Charged only $16 for cut and beard trim, but I throw him a tip on top of that for an exceptional cut. He will ask you questions throughout the cut to make sure you end up with the cut you came for. Can't go wrong with this guy. And what a cool place!"
1,"Awesome place!! EXCELLENT food/apps(try the bleu cheese figs)! Ask for Dizzy Dre, he's AWSOME and listens to your likes and customizes drinks for you!! Very patient with women!! ;)"
1,"This is the best restaurant in Phoenix. My wife and I have been eating out here for years, Their servers are great and the food is always delicious. The entire menu is very good and the specials are always unique. Check out their website at http://www.phoenixcitygrille.com"
1,"Tried Rock Bottom tonight before a movie and I thought it was ok. I had the Lemon Grilled Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus. Everything was very yumm, but Rock Bottom just didn't make enough of an impression on me. If I was obsessed with beer maybe it would have gone over better. Restaurant ambiance and menu were very typical and neither were impressive. However my crazy friend Megan ordered Buffalo Fajitas, yes real buffalo steak, so that was a cool menu option. Now I can add Buffalo to the list of crazy things Ann Marie has eaten. p.s Buffalo tastes a lot like steak."
1,No matter what I order I know it will be tasty. Maizie's have a lot to choose from which can be a little overwhelming for me. I love their wait staff everyone is always friendly. When I am in Maizie's I feel like I am in a neighborhood hang out.
1,"best coffee in phoenix (so far). experienced and friendly baristas, a large sitting area inside, nice decorations, community conscious, promotes local art and artists, outdoor sitting area, easily accessible location from the light rail and from the portland park neighborhood. i had a short vanilla cappuccino and the thing that made it the best insofar to my search for phoenix's best espresso was definitely the milk. it was properly steamed microfoam. the shots were right on, too. the milk i've had elsewhere in phoenix doesn't compare. thumbs up to fair trade."
1,"I love to come here from time to time when I'm in the area and I am always highly satisfied with the food and service. The menu is great and there's a variety of dishes for every taste. The service is great, everyone is always really nice and the atmosphere is quiet and relaxed. Definitely a great place to have dinner/lunch with friends. I read some other reviews from people who complained about the food, mostly these were meat eaters, I'm assuming, so of course they were not satisfied. This is a %100 vegan restaurant, note it."
1,"I went in yesterday for happy hour to have a birthday drink. I had the house margarita for $5.75. Actually I had two! They were good. I think I disappointed the bartender when I question him why his $7.25 Margarita he was pushing was supposedly so awesome. He claimed Cruz a local Tequila was the reason. I argued just because it's local doesn't make it good. LOL. The house Rita stands up alone, as a good traditional Rita on the rocks. Don't buy the hype, as I saw half the crowd not question it and accept the pricier one on special as the way to go. The place was busy. They were also hosting a MBA networking mixer just off the main bar. In addition to discounted beer at happy hour they also offered free food! I thought those days were gone but they kept a steady supply of warm chips, salsa, veggie tray, cold pinwheel wraps and one or two hot Mexican items (mini chimis, and bean & cheese nachos) coming. I was going to order a half price appetizer as part of my happy hour, but heck I went for the free food and was just fine. My sampling of the appetizers makes me wonder how good the menu was, so I peeked at it. It looks pretty basic but tasty. I think everything was $12 or less on the dinner menu. According to the sign outside lunch starts at $5.99. It may be commercialized Mexican food but it's a step up from some places like Taco Bell and Baja Express for certain. The staff seemed competent and to work rather well together. Even though it was busy the staff was calm and quick to serve, which is a good thing. They seem to recognize some customers as regular patrons which was also nice. The woman's room off the bar was fresh and clean in this madness as was the bar and all areas I could see. I think I will be back. I think I could even become a fan of the place over time. It seems to have a good mix of people and an impressive straight male clientele, worth another look."
1,"Yogi's is a great place to grab a quick, fairly-cheap meal. I love the Arizona bowl - it's a great alternative for you sushi craving if you don't feel like spending a lot of money. The quality of the food isn't bad. The sushi rolls are alright. The staff is moderate - they've never done anything to impress me, but haven't done anything to disappoint either."
1,"Came here on a Thursday night and it was quite busy! Maybe all the snow birds are still in town. I made rezs and we arrived early,yet they had no plan as to where we sit. We ended up sitting on the Patio. Which would be nice in the summer or spring but , a bit chilly for Jan. They had 2 heaters outside. However, we were just a little to far away to feel them. We ordered a pitcher of the red Sangria wine, which they said they were out, but alass when they saw how dissappointed we were they made more! We were very happy about that so that gives them extra points. However, the Sangria was loaded with ice and there was ice in the wine glasses as well which made us even more cold. Skip the ice when it is in the 40's outside. We had the large Capresse salad which was excellant...The basil and cheese were huge and very tasty. Pizza was absolutly divine! Great crust ,wonderful mushrooms , and excellant Italian Sausage. Bathrooms were clean and parking can be a bit of a challenge. Lacks a bit of atmosphere. The busboys were very attentive i give them extra points as well they were really working hard."
1,"Every time I go in this place it's always a great experience. My wife and I have been going to Lucille's pretty much every other Sunday for the last couple months. Her favorite is the pulled pork mine is the Kansas City ribs, but we always have to start our meal off with the fried pickles. If you're on a tight budget even buying one meal and sharing it is a definite option. Sometimes I get full on the biscuits and spread the provide in the beginning. The bar area is a great place to have a meal and watch a game. I would highly recommend this establishment to any of my friends. But make sure you get the fried pickles... you will not be disappointed. Oh yeah.....please please please order the Mac 'N Cheese as your side. You will thank me later. Q"
0,"I like spicy. I mean I like to sweat from the bridge of my nose when I eat. When they asked how hot I wanted my green curry chicken, I did a double take. ""Isn't green curry spicy by definition?"" They told me they make it in varying degrees of spiciness for the ASU crowd. While I disagree with diluting the authenticity of the traditional preparation, I get it - they have a business to run. What I really don't like is how they do it. They make a mild green curry...er, no, green sauce. Then, upon ordering, they add a certain amount of red chili flakes depending on how spicy you want it. This is not only upsetting philosophically, but chili flakes need time to cook in a curry - you don't just drop in, stir and serve. I get the sense that this problem is rampant in Arizona; hope to find a solution soon."
1,"This dairy sells fresh milk, straight from the cow. That's what they're licensed to sell. They use organic feed (dried grasses), hydrogen peroxide for cleaning certain things, and iodine to clean the cows' teats (just like many dairies used to). They want the cows to be out on pasture, but they need a bigger piece of land to do so. If you know of a piece of land in the area, please suggest it to Jackie Calamos. I love their milk. As of this date, milk is $10/gallon, the true cost of the milk (or maybe even a little low). Most of the milk you buy in the store isn't worth the price. Forcing more production out of cows with hormones comes at the cost of quality (and your health). SYD's has all the good stuff (the proof is in the taste). It's never made us sick, and we've been drinking it for 2 years. It's a miracle that this metro area actually has a dairy willing to sell fresh milk to the public! Thank you, Save Your Dairy!"
0,"Went last night to Whore Foods to get basics to make pizza with, most clutch to the process was a three pack of yeast. Low and behold, the dirty hippie kids they have working there again didn't put something in the bag. And this time it was the yeast. I love the food there, but the employees are nothing more than entitled hippie kids from Scottsdale who can't be bothered to do their goddamn jobs! I am so sick of this crap with this corporation. Maybe its a Phoenix thing, or maybe its the hiring and firing processes of Whore Foods, but I am done shopping at any Whore Foods. In a place like Phoenix, where you have alternatives such as Sprouts, you'd think Whore Foods would smarten up. Or when you try to ask someone who works here where something is, and they just walk by with their nose high in the air. I understand its important to show your fellow dirt merchants that you're a super star, but I don't work with you, I contribute to your salary and over inflated set of benefits for a grocery clerk, so do your goddamn job. Useless little girl in need of a shower and orthodontist. But alas, Whore Foods and its dirty hippie employees have alienated yet another person with a job and a degree into hating everything that place stands for. Oh yea, one other thing, take the concealed firearm prohibition off of your stores. It didn't stop Jared Loughner from doing something horrid, and all it does is alienate law abiding citizens from their Constitutional rights. I understand you think that only parts of the Constitution should apply, but honestly I think you need to pull your collective heads out of your ass and take a shower. Useless motherf*&#$@s!"
1,"Pats is predictable. In the retarded amount of times that I have eaten there, i've never been served pizza i'm unhappy with. Best pizza slices in Arizona with good prices. Generally stopping by for slices is the easiest way to find good service with little to no wait. Not always the friendliest workers, but that doesn't make my pizza take longer or taste any different!"
1,"Great food, bad service. Does anyone speak english in here?"
1,"Good place to meet a group, watch a game or grab a quick bite. We found this place on St. Patrick's Day after a long, frustrating day of apartment searching. No wait, quick/good/friendly service, good food and lots of good beer. I like the segmented areas and because it is so big, even when there is a huge crowd, you never feel like you have lost your personal space. Have walked over many times since and will definitely continue to."
0,"If I'm rating strictly on getting what I wanted out of the visit, this doctor is fine. He checked my eyes, did all of the tests and I walked out with my prescription. Here is why I can't give him a good review (and this is solely based on my personality and preferences while dealing with the service industry- others may think he's wonderful...) 1) I purposely chose an early morning (7:30 a.m.) appointment so that I would get to work by 9. My office is less than a mile from his office and I was still running into work at 9:05 a.m. This is due to the very long-winded soap-box like speech that Dr. Greene gave me. I am a get-in, get-out type of person who hates small talk and hates self-promotion even more and if I heard him tell me how often he visits the gym or works out one more time, I probably would have gauged my eyes out right there to never need an optometrist again. I also learned all about his wife, friend's boat...you name it...he told me about it (completely unsolicited). 2) I am an educated individual who does not need an hour-long explanation- filled with graphical references and cutesy anecdotes- about why I now need progressive lenses. 3) The fear-inducing sales pitch by the staff and the doctor was a bit much. I realize that all optometrists and dentists are going this route now- ""buy this test (not covered by insurance) and be free from worry that you'll instantly go blind""; however, if I want something, I'll ask for it...just like any other retailer. Like I said...I got what I needed, a solid eye exam and prescription. However, I purposely did not buy glasses there due to the doctor's cheesy personality and the ""hard-sell"" environment. Again, there are obviously (based on the other posters) people who are attracted to this type of personality...I am not one of them. Hence, why I do most of my shopping online."
1,"I would suggest that anyone who lives here and has not been come, and if you're in town and looking for a great local non-chain restaurant that has quality food prepared the way it should, then try Cibo! I took my man here for ""mystery date night"" as a surprise since he had never been. No wait at 8:45 on a Friday night (yes! take that Pizzeria B) and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool. I love the atmosphere of the patio also, lit with those great off-white lights, and fire pits. We shared the burrata which was gynormus, easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us. The wine was tasty and reasonable. I was drinking a pinot grigio, and my guy had the house chianti which I never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine - until I tried Cibo's house version. It was very good, definitely not from grandmas! Now for the pizza - it is just perfection. It has that amazing combination of char on the crust, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings. It almost melts in your mouth, it's not heavy at all. It's nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint! So we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella, ricotta, AND a scoop of ice cream on top. I don't typically die over dessert, it's my boyfriends thing. I'm an app girl - but this, it wasn't too sweet, it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness. I would never eat here without dessert again! I have been for lunch and they can get you in and out in a little less than an hour, but they don't fire up the pizza oven till supper which is why I prefer that here. You will feel at home at this spot in a group or on a date - hell, maybe even a mystery one :)"
0,"ok so here's what they teach: if you are a good person it is right and good for you to take from others and give it to yourself, because you deserve it and everyone else is a bad person. Stealing is okay, lying is okay, as long as it is done by you, but for the others, they have no place in society, so pillage and destroy them, it is your right and you will be rewarded for that. Wow."
0,"Worst, slow service ever....especially with almost no one in the place. Food was average at best and thats being kind. Skip it if you are looking to eat or get a drink. Just an update: I (as well as a friend who wrote a review of the day) were contacted (I didn't see my message until today oops) and offered refunds and gift certificates. Now this seems all well and fine-I do appreciate them trying to make the most of the situation-but my friend is still waiting for a refund and/or certificate. So we shall see. If I could take away my star for more non-service then I would."
1,This place is great. All the food is fresh and always good. They have a great happy hour daily with a very knowledgeable staff. I highly recommend this place.
1,"I eat here often because it is close to where I live. Good clean Chines food but it is all starting to taste the same like they use the same sauce on many of their dishes. It didn't used to be like that. I will keep going because it is still good and the best in the area IMHO, but it is time for a menu change to get some new flavors for those who eat there often."
1,"Cheap and good, family type feel..."
